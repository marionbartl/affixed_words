Thousands of Web users were left agog last month by what appeared to be a print advertisement depicting a young girl , seemingly nude and posing provocatively .
A photo of a seductive youth normally does n't turn too many heads nowadays , especially on the Web , but the text on the image — the BMW used car logo , the Greek BMW Hellas Web address and a sexually connotative tag line that reads , " You know you 're not the first " — raised a few eyebrows .
Among the hundreds of comments on the numerous websites that posted the image , you could practically cut the sexual uneasiness with a knife .
" Who else feels dirty right now ? " asked Digg user meretricis .
Users wondered aloud why BMW would associate its brand with , as a few commenters called it , " jail bait . "
Yes , the ad is coming from a division in the more sexually lenient Europe , they speculated , but surely this is too risqué for a car promotion .
As it turns out , it was .
BMW Hellas did indeed create the image .
But the company said it never intended the ad to be seen by the masses .
It " was only a creative idea of our advertising agency participating in a local contest among Greek advertising agencies , " said Vivi Dalakou , a spokesperson for BMW Greece , in an e-mail .
" This visual was never supposed to be used as a BMW campaign and never will be . "
( BMW would n't give us permission to use the image in this post . )
For companies that spend countless hours and billions of dollars every year carefully crafting their public image , rogue ads can be a nuisance .
You might recall the Speed Dressing video ad that began flying around the Web this summer .
The clip , shot in the style of JCPenney " Every Day Matters " TV campaign , showed a pair of adolescents timing themselves dressing , which some say endorses teen sex .
Like the BMW ad , this video was another competition entry , but JCPenney knew nothing about it .
A former employee of JCPenney 's ad agency , Saatchi & Saatchi , created the video and entered it into the Cannes International Advertising Festival in June , the retailer said in a statement .
" JCPenney does not approve or condone its content , and Saatchi & Saatchi was asked to apologize to our customers and our Associates for misrepresenting our company in this manner , " a JCPenney spokesperson said in an e-mail .
Rogue viral ads are n't always troublesome for the company whose brand is exploited .
Danish beer distributor Carlsberg Breweries did n't seem to have a problem with Romain Pergeaux 's Carlsberg and Mentos video ( seen below ) .
The video , which culminates in an unexpected twist , was shot for Pergeaux 's portfolio six months after he lost his job at an ad agency , which would n't use the script , he said .
" I do n't really want to talk about all of this .
Carlsberg has been fair and kind to not attack us , " Pergeaux said in an e-mail , " and trust me , this would have been a bad thing for us if they had . "
Some companies have taken the opportunity to simply buy an ad they like that happened to be created by someone else , as in the case of Apple with English student Nick Haley 's iPod Touch video , as reported by the New York Times .
But Carlsberg says it has no plans to buy the rights to use the year - old video .
" I do n't think it is capable to sell Carlsberg , " company spokesperson Jens Peter Skaarup said in an e-mail .
Professionals looking to build their portfolios are n't the only ones releasing unofficial ads .
Many times it's an eager consumer with a copy of Photoshop or video editing software .
There was the Wii Fit girl in May , a T - shirt and pantie - clad , virtual hula - hooping young woman , who unknowingly became a sort of cover girl for Nintendo's new exercise game after her boyfriend posted a video of her on YouTube .
Then there was the mysterious poster for " Batman : The Dark Knight Returns , " an amateur yet convincing image that tricked a horde of Web users last month .
D.C. Comics says it was ultimately a fake .
With fan - made videos and company - sanctioned viral ads becoming almost indistinguishable , it 's becoming more and more difficult for companies to maintain full control over how the public sees its brand .
But then again , maybe that 's not a bad thing .
After all , the phenomenon has given us Spongebob dancing to Soulja Boy .
Can you think of any better brand association ?

( CNN ) -- Sen. Barack Obama on Thursday slammed Sen. John McCain 's new mortgage plan as " the latest in a series of shifting positions " and evidence of " erratic and uncertain leadership . "
" He 's ended up with a plan that punishes taxpayers , rewards banks , and wo n't solve our housing crisis , " Obama said at an event in Dayton , Ohio .
At the second presidential debate Tuesday , McCain suggested that the government buy up bad home loan mortgages and renegotiate at the new diminished value of those homes .
Under McCain 's proposed $ 300 billion mortgage rescue plan , much of the burden of paying to keep troubled borrowers in their homes would shift to taxpayers .
McCain 's original plan called for lenders to write down the value of these mortgages and take those losses .
Doug Holtz - Eakin , McCain 's economic adviser , said Wednesday that the McCain plan could be put into place quickly because the groundwork and the authority for it already have been provided by last week 's $ 700 billion bailout bill ; the Hope for Homeowners program authorized by the housing rescue bill passed in July ; and the government takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Read the details of McCain 's proposal
In an e-mail to supporters , McCain said his plan would address " the very root of the failing housing market . "
Obama charged that McCain 's latest plan is " risky . "
" I do n't think we can afford that kind of erratic and uncertain leadership in these uncertain times .
We need steady leadership in the White House .
We need a president we can trust in times of crisis , " Obama said .
In response to Obama 's remarks in Dayton , the McCain campaign said Obama was " putting politics above the national interest . "
" John McCain 's home ownership resurgence plan represents absolutely no new expense to the taxpayer , but simply refocuses priorities to more directly assist the homeowners who are hurting instead of greed on Wall Street , " spokesman Tucker Bounds said in a statement .
Earlier Wednesday , Obama 's campaign launched a television ad that takes aim at McCain 's proposal , saying " the same lenders that caused the crisis in the first place " would benefit from the plan .
As the candidates enter the final weeks of campaigning , they have been attacking each other more aggressively .
McCain 's campaign has launched a string of new ads that question Obama 's judgment and character .
The McCain campaign calls Obama " too risky for America " in a new Web ad that focuses on his political relationship with Bill Ayers , a founding member of the radical Weather Underground .
" Barack Obama and domestic terrorist Bill Ayers .
Friends .
They 've worked together for years .
But Obama tries to hide it , " the announcer says in the 90 - second ad .
" But Obama 's friendship with terrorist Ayers is n't the issue .
The issue is Barack Obama 's judgment and candor , " the announcer says .
Watch analysts weigh in on the McCain attacks »
At a town hall meeting in Waukesha , Wisconsin , angry voters pleaded with McCain to get tougher on Obama .
One voter suggested that McCain bring up the Rev. Jeremiah Wright controversy .
" I am begging you , sir , take it to him , " the voter said .
McCain did not specifically address the comment about Wright , Obama 's former pastor who came under scrutiny during the primaries after clips of his sermons circulated on the Internet .
On Ayers , the Arizona senator said he does n't care about a " washed - up former terrorist , " but vowed to press Obama on his candor and judgment .
" We need to know the full extent of the relationship because of whether Sen. Obama is telling the truth to the American people or not .
That 's the question , " McCain said .
Weather Underground was involved in bombings in the early 1970s , including attacks on the Pentagon and the Capitol .
Obama was a young child at the time of the bombings .
Obama and Ayers , now a university professor , met in 1995 , when both worked with a nonprofit group trying to raise funds for a school improvement project and a charitable foundation .
CNN 's review of project records found nothing to suggest anything inappropriate in the volunteer projects in which the two men were involved .
Fact check :
How close are Obama and Ayers ?
Quoted in The New York Times , Obama called Ayers " somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago , when I was 8 . "
Michelle Obama brushed off the latest round of attacks in an interview with CNN's Larry King on Wednesday .
" I do n't know anyone in Chicago who 's heavily involved in education policy who does n't know Bill Ayers .
But , again , I go back to the point that the American people are n't asking these questions , " she said .
Watch Michelle Obama 's interview »
Obama said her husband has been " thoroughly vetted " and said the Ayers allegations are a " part of politics . "
The McCain campaign started pushing hard on the Ayers connection this past weekend when Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin accused Obama of " palling around with terrorists who would target their own country . "
The Obama campaign retaliated Monday with a 13 - minute documentary Web video detailing the Arizona senator 's involvement in the Keating Five scandal in the 1980s .
Cindy McCain , McCain 's wife , lashed out at Obama earlier this week , telling a Tennessee newspaper that the Illinois senator has waged the " dirtiest campaign in American history . "
Obama 's running mate , Sen .
Joe Biden put the blame on the McCain campaign Wednesday , saying the attacks on Obama are " beyond disappointing . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Scientists have created two new types of materials that can bend light the wrong way , creating the first step toward an invisibility cloaking device .
One approach uses a type of fishnet of metal layers to reverse the direction of light , while another uses tiny silver wires , both at the nanoscale level .
Both are so - called metamaterials -- artificially engineered structures that have properties not seen in nature , such as negative refractive index .
The two teams were working separately under the direction of Xiang Zhang of the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center at the University of California , Berkeley with U.S. government funding .
One team reported its findings in the journal Science and the other in the journal Nature .
Each new material works to reverse light in limited wavelengths , so no one will be using them to hide buildings from satellites , said Jason Valentine , who worked on one of the projects .
“ We are not actually cloaking anything , ” Valentine said in a telephone interview .
“ I do n’t think we have to worry about invisible people walking around any time soon .
To be honest , we are just at the beginning of doing anything like that . ”
Valentine ’s team made a material that affects light near the visible spectrum , in a region used in fiber optics .
“ In naturally occurring material , the index of refraction , a measure of how light bends in a medium , is positive , ” he said .
“ When you see a fish in the water , the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is .
Or if you put a stick in the water , the stick seems to bend away from you . ”
These are illusions caused by the light bending when it moves between water and air .
NEGATIVE REFRACTION
The negative refraction achieved by the teams at Berkeley would be different .
“ Instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water , it would actually appear to be above the water ’s surface , ” Valentine said .
“ It ’s kind of weird . ”
For a metamaterial to produce negative refraction , it must have a structural array smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation being used .
This was done using microwaves in 2006 by David Smith of Duke University in North Carolina and John Pendry of Imperial College London .
Visible light is harder .
Some groups managed it with very thin layers , virtually only one atom thick , but these materials were not practical to work with and absorbed a great deal of the light directed at it .
“ What we have done is taken that material and made it much thicker , ” Valentine said .
His team , whose work is reported in Nature , used stacked silver and metal dielectric layers stacked on top of each other and then punched through with holes .
“ We call it a fishnet , ” Valentine said .
The other team , reporting in Science , used an oxide template and grew silver nanowires inside porous aluminum oxide at tiny distances apart , smaller than the wavelength of visible light .
This material refracts visible light .
Immediate applications might be superior optical devices , Valentine said -- perhaps a microscope that could see a living virus .
“ However , cloaking may be something that this material could be used for in the future , ” he said .
“ You ’d have to wrap whatever you wanted to cloak in the material .
It would just send light around .
By sending light around the object that is to be cloaked , you do n’t see it . ”
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has portrayed herself as a foe of pork - barrel spending , pointing in particular to her role in killing the $ 398 million " Bridge to Nowhere ” between Ketchikan ( pop. 7,400 ) and its airport on Gravina Island ( pop. 50 ) .
I " told the Congress , ' Thanks , but no thanks , ' " she said in her speech accepting the Republican vice presidential nomination .
" If our state wanted to build a bridge , we were going to build it ourselves . "
But Gov. Palin ’s administration acknowledges that it is still pursuing a project that would link Ketchikan to its airport -- with the help of as much as $ 73 million in federal funds earmarked by Congress for the original project .
" What the media is n't reporting is that the project is n't dead , " Roger Wetherell , spokesman for Alaska ’s Department of Transportation , said .
In a process begun this past winter , the state ’s DOT is currently considering ( PDF ) a number of alternative solutions ( five other possible bridges or three different ferry routes ) to link Ketchikan and Gravina Island .
The DOT has not yet developed cost estimates for those proposals , Wetherell said , but $ 73 million of the approximately $ 223 million Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) and Rep. Don Young ( R - AK ) earmarked for the bridge in 2005 has been set aside for the Gravina Access Project .
In an interview that aired Friday night , ABC ’s Charles Gibson challenged Palin about the fact that she ’d initially supported the “ Bridge to Nowhere ” during her 2006 run for governor .
“ I was for infrastructure being built in the state , ” she said , but repeated her line that Alaska would “ find a way to build [ the bridge ] ourselves . ”
She added : “ What I supported was the link between a community and its airport .
And we have found that link now . ”
Peter Feldman , a spokesman for the McCain campaign , did not respond directly to questions about whether Palin was aware that the project had begun anew or that $ 73 million in federal funds had been set aside for it .
" The fact is that once Governor Palin was elected and had an opportunity to look closely at the project , she killed it , " he said in an e-mailed statement .
" She fought for Congress to kill the provision , but they sent the funds anyway .
Palin fired the kill shot by not using a dime of that money on the bridge . "
Gov. Palin ’s state office referred questions about the project to Alaska 's DOT .
The state has made no secret of its plans to go forward with the Gravina Access Project .
A DOT website for the project contains a timeline that shows Alaska 's study of the environmental impact of the bridge and ferry proposals is scheduled to conclude by the spring of 2010 .
One possible alternative , the DOT website notes , is to take " no action . "
The website , however , makes no mention of the ultimate source of the funding for the project .
The massive $ 398 million " Bridge to Nowhere " was to replace ferry service from the airport to Ketchikan ( departing every half - hour ) , a 15 - minute ride -- meaning that air travelers are assured of reaching Ketchikan in no more than 45 minutes .
It would have done so in grand style : the planned structure would have been nearly as long as the Golden Gate and higher than the Brooklyn Bridge .
But government watchdogs and Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) made the project the poster child for wasteful earmarks .
The money , they argued , should be rerouted to repair a major bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans .
Coburn 's campaign against the " Bridge to Nowhere " did n't succeed in redirecting the money , but did succeed in stripping the stipulation that Alaska be forced to spend the funds on the $ 398 million bridge design .
By the time Gov. Palin entered office at the end of 2006 , it was clearly unlikely that Congress would ever approve the funds necessary to complete the project .
So in September 2007 , Gov. Palin announced ( PDF ) that the state would no longer proceed with the $ 398 million bridge design , but she did not end the project , instead directing the DOT to look for the " most fiscally responsible alternative . "
Sen . Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) -- who led the fight in Congress to redirect the $ 223 million to New Orleans -- said he did n’t have any objection to Palin using the $ 73 million for the project .
" If I could have taken all the money away , I would have , " he said , " but Alaska gets to do whatever they want to do with that money .
" The problem is in Washington , not on the local level , " he said .
" If you 're a governor , and you 're sitting in your state and your politicians are telling you , there 's a lot of money we can get out of the budget , do you say , ‘ No , we want nothing , ' or ' Here 's a list of projects ? ' "
Gov. Frank Murkowski ( R ) , Palin ’s predecessor , was the first to confront what to do with the federal money .
He redirected $ 48 million of the sum to be spent on various state transportation projects .
He also , three days before he left office in December 2006 , used about $ 26 million on a contract to build an access road from the airport to the bridge .
The road currently leads to a dead end on the shore and is expected to be completed by next week , Wetherell said .
But since it follows the prior plan for the bridge , it might prove to be an access road to nowhere .
Most of the bridge and ferry proposals being considered by the DOT are located at different places along the coast .
Palin supported the $ 398 million bridge project during her campaign for governor in 2006 , but concluded in her first year in office that Alaska would never be able to win the funds needed to complete it .
“ Congress has little interest in spending any more money on a bridge between Ketchikan and Gravina Island , ” she said in an announcement .
She directed that $ 36 million of the federal funds be used for other state DOT projects while the DOT “ also looks for a more affordable answer for Gravina Island access . ”
A breakdown ( PDF ) provided by the Alaska DOT of the approximately $ 80 million in federal funds used on other projects shows that about half the money has so far been spent on 18 smaller projects ranging in cost from $ 140,000 spent on highway " scenic enhancements " to an $ 8.4 million highway project .
About half of the funds remain to be used on other projects .
Back in October 2007 , one of the hottest e-mail forwards was a picture capturing Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama standing in front of a U.S. flag ( at an Iowa political event ) with his hands clasped in front of him during the playing of the U.S. national anthem ( while other persons on the platform with him stood with their hands placed over their hearts ) .
This photographic brouhaha soon mutated into a ( false ) claim that Barack Obama “ refused to put his hand over his heart during the Pledge of Allegiance ” and then into the ( even more false ) claim that “ he refused to recite the Pledge of Allegiance ” at all ( rumors which the Obama campaign soon provided evidence to negate ) .
While this controversy was all the rage on the Internet , political columnist John Semmens included a bit at the end of one of his satirical “ Semi - News ” columns ( found on the web site of The Arizona Conservative ) offering a mock explanation from Senator Obama about his non -hand - over - heart stance , poking fun at the candidate by having him voice the opinion that “ the American flag is a symbol of oppression ” and that the U.S. national anthem is too “ bellicose ” and should be replaced by something gentler like “ I ’d Like to Teach the World to Sing ” :
Hot on the heels of his explanation for why he no longer wears a flag pin , presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama was forced to explain why he does n’t follow protocol when the National Anthem is played .
According to the United States Code , Title 36 , Chapter 10 , Sec. 171 , During rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed , all present except those in uniform are expected to stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart .
“ As I ’ve said about the flag pin , I do n’t want to be perceived as taking sides , ” Obama said .
“ There are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression .
And the anthem itself conveys a war - like message .
You know , the bombs bursting in air and all .
It should be swapped for something less parochial and less bellicose .
I like the song ‘ I ’d Like to Teach the World to Sing . ’
If that were our anthem , then I might salute it . ”
This bit of satire evidently came off as too believable to some readers , as it was excerpted from Semmens ’ column and forwarded via e-mail ( without attribution ) as a genuine statement from Senator Obama .
However topical it might have been , it was just a bit of political commentary - cum - humor , not Barack Obama ’s own words .
In September 2008 , this same piece began arriving in our inbox with extra text supposedly quoting Barack Obama on his plans to “ disarm America ” and “ end hostilities ” with Islamic nations , headed by the claim that it was derived from the 7 September 2008 airing of Meet the Press and naming the interviewer as “ General Bill Ginn , USAF ( ret . ) ” :
Yes , he told us in advance what he planned to do .
Few were listening .
The following is a narrative taken from a 2008 Sunday morning televised “ Meet The Press ’ .
From Sunday ’s 07 Sept. 2008 11:48:04 EST , Televised “ Meet the Press ” the THEN Senator Obama was asked about his stance on the American Flag. General Bill Gann ’ USAF ( ret. ) asked Obama to explain WHY he does n’t follow protocol when the National Anthem is played .
The General stated to Obama that according to the United States Code , Title 36 , Chapter 10 , Sec. 171 …
During rendition of the national anthem , when the flag is displayed , all present ( except those in uniform ) are expected to stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart .
Or , at the very least , “ Stand and Face It ” .
‘ Senator Obama replied : “ As I ’ve said about the flag pin , I do n’t want to be perceived as taking sides ” .
“ There are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression . ”
“ The anthem itself conveys a war - like message .
You know , the bombs bursting in air and all that sort of thing . ”
Obama continued : “ The National Anthem should be ‘ swapped ’ for something less parochial and less bellicose .
I like the song ‘ I ’d Like To Teach the World To Sing ’ .
If that were our anthem , then , I might salute it .
In my opinion , we should consider reinventing our National Anthem as well as ‘ redesign ’ our Flag to better offer our enemies hope and love .
It ’s my intention , if elected , to disarm America to the level of acceptance to our Middle East Brethren .
If we , as a Nation of warring people , conduct ourselves like the nations of Islam , where peace prevails — perhaps a state or period of mutual accord could exist between our governments … ”
When I become President , I will seek a pact of agreement to end hostilities between those who have been at war or in a state of enmity , and a freedom from disquieting oppressive thoughts .
We as a Nation , have placed upon the nations of Islam , an unfair injustice which is WHY my wife disrespects the Flag and she and I have attended several flag burning ceremonies in the past ” .
“ Of course now , I have found myself about to become the President of the United States and I have put my hatred aside .
I will use my power to bring CHANGE to this Nation , and offer the people a new path .
My wife and I look forward to becoming our Country ’s First black Family .
Indeed , CHANGE is about to overwhelm the United States of America ”
It goes without saying that Senator Obama was n’t among the guests on that day ’s Meet the Press program ( which featured Senator Joe Biden and author Tom Friedman ) , nor did he make the comments attributed to him on that show or in any other forum .
( Later versions of the message also falsely attributed its authorship to Dale Lindsborg of the Washington Post . )
The following ( also fabricated ) statement about flag burning purportedly made by Barack Obama was appended to later versions of the e-mail :
CARSON CITY - Assembly Bill 301 , which would simplify Nevada ’s complex web of current laws on voter disfranchisement , will be considered by members of the Assembly Committee on Legislative Operations and Elections on Tuesday March 22 .
Nevada has one of the most severe and complex voter disfranchisement policies in the nation , barring individuals convicted of felonies from voting until they complete their sentences and have their rights restored , a process that varies greatly based on the individual ’s type , date and place of convictions .
Of the 43,500 Nevadans disfranchised under this policy , almost half have completed their sentences but remain unable to vote .
Countless others are kept from voting because current law is unclear and current policies require documentation that is difficult to obtain .
A study conducted by the ACLU of Nevada in 2010 found that the state ’s voter registration agencies and websites give conflicting and sometimes incorrect information about registering to vote with a criminal conviction .
Alarmingly , voter disfranchisement in Nevada disproportionately affects people and communities of color .
African Americans account for 29 % of all disfranchised voters , and 12.4 % of all African Americans in Nevada are barred from voting due to felony convictions .
Criminal justice professionals recognize the importance of voting among people with past convictions , and research has shown that those who vote are half as likely to be re-arrested .
If AB301 is passed , it could not only save taxpayer money that is currently spent on cumbersome voter restoration procedures , but also potentially reduce recidivism .
AB301 would automatically restore voting rights to all Nevadans who have completed a felony prison sentence , probation or parole and eliminate the requirement to show documentation to register .
It would also inform and educate elections employees and past offenders about their restored rights in clear and reader - friendly terms .
“ Voting is a fundamental right , protected by more constitutional amendments than any other right we enjoy as Americans , ” says Rebecca Gasca , Legislative and Policy Director at the ALCU of Nevada .
“ Nothing is more fundamental to our democracy than the right to vote , and a healthy community needs to hear the voices of all its citizens . ”
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) of Nevada works to protect the rights and liberties of all Nevadans , including the right to vote .

One rainstorm , two campaigns and two responses
Wearing jeans , white sneakers and an insulated windbreaker , Barack Obama delivered his stump speech this morning in a chilly , steady rain in Chester , Pa .
" A little bit of rain never hurt anybody , " Obama said , surveying the soaking , umbrella - covered crowd at Widener University , occasionally rubbing his hands together for warmth and squinting through the raindrops .
Obama took the stage less than an hour after the McCain campaign announced it was postponing a rally at 1:15 p.m. in Quakertown , Pa. , about one hour north of Chester , " due to weather . "
The Obama campaign considered moving its event inside , but could n't find an appropriate venue , an aide said .
An estimated 9,000 people turned out .
Notorious crooks John McCain and Charles Keating partying at Keating 's Bahamas estate
McCain has worked very hard for many years to whitewash his involvement in the Keating Five Scandal .
I heard some Republican talking heads on Fox the other day screaming hysterically when someone brought it up : " he was cleared , he was cleared , he was cleared . "
Yet the people involved with the real investigation -- not the Senate Ethics Committee whitewash ( which did n't " clear " McCain either but rebuked him for the same kind of bad judgment that is the absolute hallmark of his entire career , both military and political ) have all claimed that not only was McCain guilty but that he was theguilty and theone who committed a crime -- accepting bribes -- that should have ended his career and sent him to prison .
McCain and the lipsticked pitbull want to talk about some idiotic terrorist who Obama barely knew and who committed a crime when Obama was 8 years old ?
Why does n't the media , who have been very much part of the Keating Five whitewash for McCain , take a closer look at that and see what it was really all about instead of parroting Palin 's baseless smear of Obama ?
And the Obama campaign has made it easier for them today -- launching a new McCain - Keating website , along with all the relevant -- and still shocking -- research , and an easy to digest 13 minute film ( below ) .
This all happen almost two decades ago and I wonder how manyreaders recall when McCain was caught red - handed taking bribes from the worst bankrobber and swindler in American history , a close family friend , introduced to McCain by his jailbird , Mafiosa father - in - law .
It is difficult to understand McCain 's ( and the GOP's ) role in the current Wall Street meltdown without understanding McCain 's role in the S&L and the Keating Five scandals .

I know that you do n't think I could ever be as good of a ' psycho ex ' as she was .
But , I assure you .
I can .
I 'll be such a raving lunatic nutcase - you wo n't even remember her when I 'm through with you .
Try me .
For starters - I am great in bed .
Is n't that how all the ' crazy ' ones start out ?
You 'll meet me at some party through some friend of a friend of a friend who knows I have ' whacko ' potential but will fail to mention this to the chain of people through whom we are introduced because ... quite frankly , our friends do n't really care enough about either of us to keep our best interests in mind .
Alternatively , they * do * have our best interests in mind but know that our dramatic personalities and overwhelming egos are forces too powerful for even the most friendly , logical advice .
Thus , they abort all attempts to keep us apart and allow us to get drunk and grope each other publicly , shaking their heads all the while because .. this shit is gonna ' blow up big time .
Meantime , we 'll already be upstairs , half undressed where you 'll be too drunk to censor yourself so you 'll make overly generous blubbering commentary about how ' sexy ' I am ( as I knock into a table lamp with swanlike grace ) .
You 'll also rave on and on about how I have the greatest tits you 've ever seen and am ' fucking amazing ' on all other fronts ( as if I did n't know ) .
Compared to the four other chicks you 've banged , this will be the best sex of your life .
And as soon as we 're done , you 'll start forming a mental list of which buddies you are going to text message first about this while at the same time wondering if you could possibly spend the rest of your life with me .
In the sobering light of morning , you 'll forget that you wanted to spend the rest of your life with me and instead opt for a " two - night stand " but you 'll quickly realize that I am having none of that and somehow weasle my way into staying over , cooking breakfast and reading your newspaper .
I will also have conveniently brought my toothbrush and some sanitary products which I quickly store in your bathroom cabinets since ' I 'm going to be spending a lot of time at your place . '
Your Maxim magazines will go from the top of the toilet to the bottom of the wastebasket because I find them ' offensive ' and ' immature .
'
Later that day , you 'll log onto Facebook and find out that I 'm ' in a relationship ' ... with you .
Yay !
At first , you 'll think it 's creepy but then ( due to your inferiority complex ) you 'll take it as a compliment and change your relationship status too .
Within an hour , you 'll receive 57 new notifications which indicate that I 've commented on every photo in your album in which you appear with an unidentified female .
Your relationships with these family members , college friends and co-workers will quickly disintegrate as you mistake my obsession for passion and declare your undying commitment to me and stop returning other people 's calls .
Friends will caution you but you 'll be too blinded by my mind - blowing felatio technique to notice anything .
Besides , I 've explained that they 're just jealous of our love .
Together , our poor self images will have us each convinced that the other is cheating .
We 'll fight about it all the time .
Non-stop .
On our ' good days ' we 'll shower each other with undeserved gifts and sexual favors and the accusatory banter will be minimal - though still prevalent .
Things will be going ' pretty well ' for a while until one night your phone battery dies and you fall asleep early - forcing me into an incoherent panic .
Six unreturned voicemails and text messages will lead me to believe only the worst - you ARE cheating on me !
To confirm my suspicions , I will immediately log into all your personal accounts - since you are so technologically oblivious you left your passwords saved on my computer - and find a message to be mad about .
It will likely be a harmless flirtation from a platonic friend who lives six states away that pushes me over the edge .
Unable to reach her or you - I will scramble into my car and drive barefoot to your apartment where I will ride up on the curb knocking over an unsuspecting potted plant .
The commotion outside will rouse you from your slumber and you 'll stumble bleary - eyed to the window just in time to see me throw the car in reverse and plow into your beloved Huyndai Elantra .
In short order , the police will come , I will cry , you will shout , your landlord will evict you and your insurance company will drop you .
On the bright side , our names will be forever emblazoned together onto a county police report .
Despite all this , it will take another several months for you to come to your senses and break - up with me .
Knowing that I am a ticking bomb , you will execute this in the kindest , most reasonable way possible .
You will make every effort to lift my spirits by explaning that " It 's not you , it 's me . " and that " I deserve someone better .
" All this , to no avail .
The only way you can truly be rid of me is to change your phone number and move across the country where you 'll make new friends and find a new insecure girlfriend to emotionally abuse for months until she finally reaches her psychological breaking point and throws a wine glass at you and storms out of a restaurant .
Everyone will be looking at you , dripping in Pinot Noir with an astonished look on your face .
In your head you 'll be thinking , " Ha . That was nothing .
You should see my Huyndai Elantra .
" And , that , is why I 'll be the best psycho ex-girlfriend you 've ever had .
At least 26 people have died after a huge explosion at an illegal fireworks factory in the western Indian state of Rajasthan , police say .
The dead include eight children .
The blast in Deeg town near Jaipur early on Thursday left some 20 others injured .
The blast was so powerful that it destroyed the factory in a slum and brought down two neighbouring homes .
Fireworks factories in India are most at risk of accidental explosions around this time of the year .
Indians are celebrating Diwali , the festival of lights , next week and fireworks manufacturers step up production to meet growing demand .
Correspondents say many illegal facilities making and storing fireworks come into operation during this time .
Senior police official Rohit Mahajan said rescue work was going on to determine whether there were more casualties .
In 2005 , at least 35 people died in a huge explosion at a fireworks store in northern Bihar state .
In the same year , at least seven people from the same family were killed in a firecracker blast in the western state of Gujarat .
And in 2002 , at least 23 people were killed in separate incidents in southern India caused by fireworks explosions .
Jon Kelly
ST LOUIS , MO :
So there I was in a downtown bar , discussing indie bands over my pint with a crowd of studenty - looking twentysomethings .
The talk turned to the election .
Religion and party politics should n't mix , someone said .
Church leaders who urged their congregations to back conservative candidates were abusing their position , another drinker agreed .
And then I remembered .
These people were Southern Baptist evangelicals - supposedly the most partisan and right - wing of all American religious groups .
What was going on ?
The Journey is n't your typical church , to be fair .
Its website proclaims a mission to reach out to " punk rockers , grandmothers , [ and ] construction workers " alike .
And as part of its strategy to persuade young people that a love of alt - rock and alcohol is compatible with Christianity , it holds regular informal meetings in this ale house I visited .
Well , any trip to the pub is a religious experience for me .
And at a time when most Americans are demanding that politicians listen to them , I was keen to meet one group who were anxious to step back from the megaphone .
With his scruffy - smart demeanour and fashionable horn - rimmed glasses , Darrin Patrick looked more like a Hoxton web designer than a Southern Baptist pastor .
He told me how much he loved Radiohead and Arcade Fire .
Earlier in the week , he said , he 'd been to an " awesome " Foo Fighters gig .
In Britain , we tend to be cynical about anyone who tries to marry popular culture with faith .
I come from a country where " trendy vicar " is a term of derision ( and one which was regularly lobbed at guitar - strumming Roman Catholic convert Tony Blair ) .
But Darrin genuinely seemed equally at ease in both worlds .
And in a county where religious belief is so widespread , it 's hardly surprising that young Americans might look for a connection between the secular and the sacred .
He told me how he had found his faith as a teenager when , during one week , he was suspended from high school for fighting , kicked off his football team for drinking , and led to believe that he might have got his girlfriend pregnant .
He 'd set up the Journey appeal to people like his younger self .
Six years on , over 2,000 people were now attending regularly .
An equal proportion of them were Republicans and Democrats , Darrin said .
Some were motivated by concern for the poor , others by individual responsibility .
It was n't his job to tell them how to vote , he said ; in fact , to do would be a breach of responsibility .
Instead , he told me that his priorities were social justice and community action .
Journey members worked in St Louis 's inner-city schools as well as with immigrants , people with HIV and single mothers .
Putting Christian principles into practice was what evangelicals should be doing , he insisted , not getting mixed up in party politics .
" If you sell out to the right or the left , you sell out Jesus , " he said .
" Go to certain evangelical churches and they 're all conservatives .
But I think the church needs to follow Jesus and stay right in the centre . "
Richie Cook , a 22 - year - old Bright Eyes fan , agreed wholeheartedly .
He had felt alienated from conventional churches when he studied for a theology degree at university .
" I met people living Christian lives who were secretive and hypocritical and ... " he searched for the right word .
" Mean , to be blunt .
" I did n't want anything to do with Christianity .
But I could n't get away from the fact that I believed in God . "
After discovering the Journey , he said he 'd finally found a home in the church .
" I do care more about social justice and issues that deal with how it affects people , " he said .
" That 's what motivates me . "
He was n't the only one .
Kristin Guilliams , 28 , a paediatric neurologist was still making up her mind about how to vote .
But she said that issues like the economy were more important to her than the kind of topics that were meant to excite evangelicals .
" I think that morality is something that should n't be legislated for , " she told me .
" Abortion and marriage are things that are better left to individuals ' conscience . "
Religion and politics might seem inextricably linked in the US for now .
But if Darrin gets his way , one of the great certainties of American elections could be undermined .

John McCain 's path to the presidency narrowed further yesterday with reports that he was giving up on Colorado , a day after a campaign blitz in the battleground state by his running mate , Sarah Palin .
The signs of retrenchment for McCain came on a day when Barack Obama was consumed by family concerns .
The Democrat is to take a 36 - hour break from the campaign tomorrow to visit his seriously ill grandmother in Hawaii .
The first reports that McCain had given up on Colorado were carried by CNN on Monday .
" Gone , " one adviser said .
Other campaign officials , while denying they had given up on the state , told CNN they were lessening their reliance on a win in Colorado to take the White House .
The campaign was also downgrading its chances in Iowa and New Mexico .
The Republicans were hoping to hang on to all three states , which George Bush narrowly won in 2004 .
But with McCain 's limited resources against the fundraising juggernaut of the Obama campaign , the Republican has had to make tough decisions on which battlefields to defend .
Obama 's lead in Colorado is a more modest 5 points , according to the RealClearPolitics poll average .
But he has a huge advantage over the Republican in organisation , with 51 field offices in Colorado , compared with a dozen for McCain .
" The McCain campaign , having taken public financing , just can't play everywhere now .
They do n't have the resources to do that , " said Bule Sewell , a former chair of the Colorado Democratic party .
Obama is also outspending McCain by $ 300,000 ( £ 177,000 ) a week on advertising .
McCain 's hopes of victory rest on holding on to Florida , Virginia , North Carolina , Ohio , Missouri and Nevada - as well as taking Pennsylvania .
But Obama is even or ahead of McCain in the first seven states and has a 12 - point lead in the last .
Campaign officials yesterday tried to douse speculation McCain was pulling the plug on Colorado , where Democrats believe that the Republican could be swamped at the polls by the enthusiasm among younger voters and Latinos .
However , such decisions are usually kept secret .
Last month , McCain faced severe criticism for announcing he was pulling out of Michigan , another battleground .
Palin made three campaign stops on Monday in Colorado and McCain is due there on Friday .
But the campaign has barely had any advertising presence on radio or television in the state .
" We see the race tightening both internally and in public polling , " said Jill Hazelbaker , his national communications director .
" We are within striking distance in the key battleground states we need to win . "
Michelle Obama will take a turn as the Democratic headliner on Friday , while her husband is in Hawaii .
She is to make campaign stops in Akron and Columbus , Ohio .
Her husband is cancelling a rally in Iowa and Wisconsin to visit his grandmother .
Obama 's absence is unlikely to hurt his campaign .
In a campaign of this magnitude and duration , it is not clear how much personal appearances boost a candidate so close to polling day .
Obama could also get a sympathy boost for taking time out to visit his white grandmother , Madleyn Dunham , 85 .
It allows him to demonstrate a commitment to family .
He was largely brought up by her .
His campaign released photographs of a young Obama with Dunham on his graduation from high school .
MALCOLM TURNBULL last night became the first Liberal leader to admit he had smoked marijuana .
On ABC1's Q&A program the host , Tony Jones , began asking : " Have you ever … " when Mr Turnbull headed off the question by saying : " smoked dope ?
Well , yes I have . "
He said he had smoked marijuana in his much younger days and now thought it was a very bad idea because the drug could be damaging .
" Many people have [ smoked it ] , " he said , before adding it was a mistake to do so .

Former White House press secretary voting for Obama
( AFP ) - Former Bush White House spokesman Scott McClellan is backing Democrat Barack Obama for president , CNN reported Thursday .
McClellan , who was the face of the Republican administration of President George W. Bush for three years , told CNN in an interview that Obama has the best chance of getting things done in Washington , compared to his rival , Republican Senator John McCain .
" From the very beginning I 've said I 'm going to support the candidate who has the best chance of changing the way Washington works and getting things done , " McClellan said , according to a transcript of the interview to be broadcast on Friday .
" I will be voting for Barack Obama , " he said .
McClellan , 40 , served as White House spokesman from 2003 to 2006 , during which time he steadfastly defended the US war in Iraq against harsh attacks from Democrats and the media .
Earlier this year he published a book covering his time in the job , " What Happened : Inside the Bush White House and Washington 's Culture of Deception , " that deeply criticized his former employer but also hit out at the US media for too easily accepting the early justifications for the war .
With wire reports .
As a postgrad in the late 80s I made some extra book money acting as a helper in the computing lab .
A few of us would be posted there , for undergrads to come to for help .
This tended to be focussed at the start of the year , when there were groups discovering Unix and programming for the first time .
One time an Irish girl called me over , saying that she could n’t understand what was going on : she thought her program looked right , but for some reason each time she ran it she got partial output , and varying amounts of output each time .
I do n’t remember the specifics , but their assignment involved writing a program that was generating various values and writing the results in ascii tabular form to a file .
I had a look at her source code .
Everything looked fine .
She showed me the file generated by her last run , and indeed it looked truncated .
Hmmm .
“ Ok , can you run your program for me , so I can see what happens ? ” .
She typed ./ a.out and hit return .
Her left hand darted to the keyboard and she hit Control - C. I was still mentally processing this when she cat‘d the output , and turned to me : “ See ! ” .
It did indeed contain partial output .
Again .
“ Um , can you just run it again please ? ” .
I figured I must have not seen right .
But once again she typed ./ a.out , hit return , then whap !
she hit Control - C. I asked her why she hit Control - C every time she ran her program : “ I discovered that Control - C makes the % prompt come up quicker ” .
In her mental model , the % sign appearing meant “ the previous command has finished ” .
The undergrads were all working on a VAX - 11/780 , which at times was grindingly slow .
She ’d stumbled across a useful technique for making the prompt pop up more quickly .
It had n’t occurred to her that hitting Control - C was the cause of her problem , she just thought it was making the faulty program run faster .
This has stayed with me ever since , partly because it ’s a funny story , but more as a reminder that when you do n’t fully explain a system to people , they build up their own mental model about what ’s going on , and as long as it fits their observations and experiences , it must be right !
Last week , after the Wall Street crisis took center stage in the presidential campaign , John McCain began assailing the greed of corporate fat cats , blasting CEOs who " seem to escape the consequences . "
Reminded today by Meredith Viera that Carly Fiorina , as CEO of HP , walked away with over $ 40 million even after her tenure at the company was marked by tens of thousands of job losses and a 40 % decline of shareholders stock value , John McCain insists that Fiorina did a heckuva job and played dumb on the details of her huge payout .

Viera :
You have said , bottom line , it 's those fat cats .
It 's the greed of Wall Street .
You promised to crack down on CEOs who walked away with huge severance packages .
And yet the person who up until recently was your public face on your economic policy was Carly Fiorina .
She 's the former CEO of Hewlett Packard , she was fired in 2005 , but she left with a $ 45 million dollar golden parachute while 20,000 of her employees were laid off .
She is an example of exactly the kind of person you say is at the root of the problem .
How can you say that ?
McCain : I do n’t think so .
…
Because I think she did a good job as CEO in many respects .
I do n’t know the details of her compensation package .
But she ’s one of many advisers that I have .
Viera :
But she did get a $ 45 million dollar golden parachute after being fired while 20,000 of her employees were laid off .
McCain : I have many of the people , but I do not know the details of what happened .
Are we really supposed to believe that McCain had no idea Fiorina was an epic failure at HP and still took home a huge $ 40 million dollar payout ?
Of course not .
He just knows he can't say with a straight face that he chose her , knowing she symbolizes the very corporate greed and corruption he now rails against .
A truly apocalyptic game should not be confused with a game that merely contains apocalyptic elements .
The industry is overflowing with games about " saving the world " which means a great many game stories feature some sort of apocalyptic threat .
Most of these games do not qualify as genuinely apocalyptic since the threat never actually materializes .
There are , however , games where the end of the world cannot be avoided , where watching civilization go up in flames is core to the experience .
Games of this sort are often unforgettable , and if you have n't experienced them you are really missing something .
Here are a few of the best ones ...
Fallout ( PC , 1997 )
The apocalyptic nature of Fallout is right there in the title .
In this game you are a survivor of the nuclear holocaust , part of a small community of people who escaped into Vault 13 , a government - funded nuclear shelter miles underground .
There your people have lived for nearly a century , functioning on the knowledge that human civilization has been utterly destroyed .
Something goes wrong with Vault 13's automated water system , and you are the lone volunteer whose job it is to brave the surface in search of replacement parts .
Thus begins your encounter with the horrors of nuclear devastation .
Fallout 's sense of apocalyptic finality is established in the opening credits .
They are haunting , featuring a scary Ron Perlman narrating how the world ends against real - life images of nuclear death .
Its documentary vibe leaves you with the feeling that everything really is over .
Everything you knew about this planet is gone , reduced to ash .
And you were on the last lifeboat , with no home to come back to .
By the time you reach the character creation screen , the mood is palpable .
You feel the death , the hopelessness , the finality of it all .
And then you 're told to get out of your cave and explore , else the last handful of humans will be snuffed out forever , and Earth with be nothing but a rock , floating silently in space , waiting for the Sun to swallow it .
Of course you eventually discover you are not the last person left in the world , that there were other survivors of the holocaust , and that human civilization is , slowly , hobbling back into existence .
But this is up to the player to discover on their own .
Much of Fallout is about finding these people , about the player pulling back the veil of hopelessness themselves , piece by piece .
Fallout goes to great lengths to ensure that you begin with this sense of hopelessness , that it is a very terrifying part of your journey .
I do n't think I 've ever felt so alone as I have in a videogame as when I stepped out of Vault 13 for the first time , the voice of Ron Perlman still echoing in my head , wondering what out there could possibly be alive .
Odin Sphere ( PS2 , 2007 )
Odin Sphere is one of the most apocalyptic games ever , featuring mass death and destruction on such a fabulous scale that by the time you even reach the last boss the entire world is already destroyed .
When you , as the Valkyrie Gwendolyn , fight Levanthan , a dragon so gigantic to twists back and forth across the visible sky , the known world has already been swallowed up completely by the sea .
This gives the last boss fight an eeire feeling , since what you are trying to accomplish is not entirely clear .
It 's certainly not saving the world .
You and Levanthan feel like the last two creatures on Earth , and your only choice is to destroy each other .
What 's left afterwards , assumedly , will be nothing .
Odin Sphere is based very loosely on Norse mythology , with the concept of Ragnarok being central to the game .
There are five playable characters in Odin Sphere : a Valkyrie , an knight , a fairy , and a witch .
Each of them plays a part in the apocalypse , and for most of the game the player assumes they are destined to avert this apocalypse .
But no .
What happens is they all play a part in ensuring that the apocalypse happen correctly .
Over the course of the game you collect books which cryptically describe the end of the world .
If you interpret them correctly , and make the right choices in the final hours , the world ends with a chance of beginning again in the future .
If you make the wrong choices , the world ends permanently .
But either way , the world ends .
The oceans boil .
The skies fall .
Cities are swallowed .
People die by the millions .
When they say Ragnarok in this game , they mean fucking Ragnarok .
The desperation of Odin Sphere is summed up by a brief cut - scene * at the end .
Gwendolyn's lady in waiting , Myris , whom you 've been friends with the whole game , stands atop the last mountain on Earth as it sinks into the boiling sea .
She pleads , assumedly to God , that just two people survive so that her death and the deaths of untold millions wo n't be in vain .
Then she sobs as the mountain crumbles into nothing .
You only see this cinematic if you make a mistake near the end and get one of the " bad " endings .
However , it is clear that this scene does take place , off screen , even in the good ending .
As Gwendolyn is flying up to fight Levanthan , she looks down and sees the mountain crumble , apologizing to Myris that she could n't save her .
So there you have it .
Even though in the best ending Gwendolyn and her lover alone survive to repopulate the world , civilization still gets wiped out in a wave of unimaginable horror .
That 's about as happy as Odin Sphere gets , making it one of the most melancholy games you will ever play .
Final Fantasy VI ( SNES , 1994 )
Every Japanese RPG is about saving the world .
Final Fantasy VI is the only one where you do n't .
Midway through FFVI , when the typical genre elements are coming together , when the ancient power that will ravage the world is about to be unleashed , and you , the lone heroes , stand together to stop it ... the unthinkable happens .
You fuck up , and the world is ripped to pieces .
Cut to one year later .
The land is a waste .
The sea is an endless brown sludge .
The sky is red .
All your party members are gone -- dead , for all you know -- and you are alone on a small island in the middle of a dead world , waiting to die .
Final Fantasy VI has balls , to say the least .
I remember opening the package for the first time and looking at the game map .
It had two sides .
On one was the World of Balance , which looked all nice and green , and on the other was the World of Ruin , which looked like Earth after God used it for toilet paper .
I had assumed the World of Ruin was some kind of netherworld , some magical dark reflection of the World of Balance , which you would go to periodically though out the game .
It never even occurred to me that it represented a permanent change to the game , that after a certain point in Final Fantasy VI that brown turd of a world would be the only one you had .
This reality came as big of a shock to me as it did to the characters in the story .
I remember sitting there slack - jawed in disbelief as the continents ripped themselves apart before my eyes , followed by the ominous on - screen text : " On that day , the world was changed forever ... "
The rest of the game is about surviving in this horrible world , about pulling yourself up , out of the misery , and finding something to live for .
It 's not easy .
You have to travel around this wasteland , gathering up all your old friends one by one , having to convince each one not to give in to despair .
You start with nothing but a wooden raft .
The beautiful overworld music has been replaced by the sound of desolate , ceaseless wind .
And there is n't a pixel of green color to be seen as you trudge across the desert landscape .
None of this ever goes away , making the final hours of the game a painful adjustment process .
There is hope to be found , you eventually discover , as well as beauty , in this dead world .
But , by God , you have to work to find it .
The sense of loss Final Fantasy VI is unlike any other game .
No other game so decisively takes everything away from you and simply tells you to deal with it .
The Legend of Zelda : Majora 's Mask ( N64 , 2000 )
How can one of the most apocalyptic games be one in which you avert the apocalypse ?
Is n't that breaking the rule ?
Majora 's
Mask certainly is a game where , at the end , you successfully save the world and avert the impending apocalypse .
However , by that time you 've experienced Armageddon more times than you can count .
Majora 's
Mask is a game about time travel .
In this game the only way to save the world is to witness its end over , and over , and over .
Each time the world ends you just rewind time with your magical Ocarina and let it happen again .
You have to study it .
You have to find the key that will help you , one day , successfully prevent it .
But that day is long in coming , and you will fail countless times before you succeed , making this the most brutal , relentless , and numbing apocalyptic experience in videogames .
In Majora 's Mask the world is ending in three days , and that is not enough time to save it , even though you are Link , the hero of all the Zelda games , whose saved the world countless times before .
This time , however , things are n't so easy .
The moon is crashing into the earth in 72 hours , and you 've got exactly that long to stop it .
Majora 's
Mask takes place in real time , meaning the clock is ticking .
Look up at any moment and you will see the moon inching closer .
Your magical Ocarina can slow down time , but not stop it .
Either way that moon in crashing , so you 'd better hurry up and do your hero thing .
Oh , wait .
You got stuck in a dungeon and it took you 2 days to get through it ?
Tough shit , Link .
Get ready for the end of the world .
The most harrowing thing about Majora 's Mask is the people you meet .
They are all in various stages of denial about the end of the world , and as you get increasingly familiar with them , with their daily lives , you become a witness to how they all deal with death .
I doubt anyone who played Majora 's Mask can forget the story of Anju and Kafei , two lovers kept apart by a curse .
Over the course of the 72 hours you see Anju's misery at being away from her lover , how it makes the looming apocalypse all the more horrible for her .
You know at 2:00 on the Second Day she will go for a walk and cry by herself in the park , and that she will run for the hills , without Kafei , at 6:00 on the Third Day .
If you try really hard you can unite them , although you cannot ever lift the curse that has transformed Kafei .
The best you are able to do is lead Kafei , in his cursed form , to Anju in the final hours , so they can share a final moment together before the end .
As the moon is tearing the town apart around them they thank you and prepare for death .
Such bitter moments are typical of Majora 's Mask , and they will haunt you even after you finally solve the time puzzle and save the world .
Conclusion
It occurs to me that all of these games except one are Japanese .
The scholar in me thinks this probably has something to do with the stronger apocalyptic tradition in Japanese pop-art .
Japan has a strong apocalyptic sensibility , which some say is connected with their shared cultural experience of the atomic bomb .
Interestingly , the only game on this list which features actual nuclear devastation is the non-Japanese one .
Perhaps for the Japanese nuclear war hits too close to home ?
On the other hand , you see them dealing with apocalyptic anxiety pretty openly through fantasy .
It 's hard to find a Western game that forces players to deal with the finality of apocalyptic change , realistic or imagined , whereas in Japan it is a little easier .
That 's how it appears to me at least , based on these examples , which , I admit , are pretty narrow .
* Unfortunately , the only clip I could find of this cut - scene was in English .
The English voice - acting is somewhat hammy , so I apologize .
One of the great things about Odin Sphere is that it has a Japanese language option , making it a lot easier to take seriously all its melodrama .
Watch this clip with the sound off if you want .
It 's subtitled .
I wish I ’d known :
A 28 - year - old delivery man from the UK who bought a Nikon Coolpix camera for about $ 31 on eBay got more than he bargained for when the camera arrived with top secret information from the UK ’s MI6 organization .
Allegedly sold by one of the clandestine organization ’s agents , the camera contained named al - Qaeda cells , names , images of suspected terrorists and weapons , fingerprint information , and log - in details for the Secret Service ’s computer network , containing a “ Top Secret ” marking .

 One of the reasons I m strongly for Palin is because the Democrats in Alaska are assholes ,  says Sarah Palin ’s gay friend .
 And half of the stuff that the media has reported about Palin that s negative was perpetrated by that small group of assholes . 
Sarah Palin ’s gay friend spoke to me on the condition that I not reveal his name .
While he ’s out to everyone he knows , including Palin , and while he says he ’s not embarrassed to be identified publicly as Palin ’s gay friend , he does n’t want to come forward at this time .
So we ’ll call him SPGF , for “ Sarah Palin ’s Gay Friend . ”
SPGF provided me with a photo of him with Palin , a link to a personal ad on a gay dating website created before Palin ran for governor , and a news story written about him in an Alaskan newspaper .
 I met Sarah met during her campaign early in 2006 , ” says SPGF .
“ That picture I sent you was taken at our first meeting .
She was dancing and there was this chronically inebriated guy in the room who made her way up to her , and I was the only one who would cut in and rescue her , and she was very grateful . 
SPGF is 36 , originally from California , and moved to Alaska 11 years ago .
Earlier this summer he had the honorlong before Cindy McCain of holding Trig Palin , Sarah Palin ’s infant son with down syndrome .
How does an openly gay man like SPGF support an anti-gay candidate like Palin ?
“ Palin keeps her politics separate from her beliefs her personal values , her religion , all of that , ” explains SPGF .
“ I have never never seen her bad mouth anybody gay , black , anybody . ”
And since being elected , says SPGF , Palin “ has never once initiated a policy proceeding that was homophobic or anti-choice . ”
But Palin endorsed an amendment to Alaska ’s constitution banning same - sex marriage while she was mayor of Wasilla , Alaska .
“ I blame that on the Mormons , ” says SPGF .
“ They drove that campaign up here .
That was one of the most divisise battles Ive ever seen .
But the amendment was very popular , you know , with voters up here .
I have friends and people I associate with across the board who were for that amendment , who voted for it .
What can you do ?
I dont expect Sarah Palin to be the vanguard of the liberal elite on that issue .
Shes practical .
Shes not going to take on battles that she cant win . ”
What about Palin ’s membership in a church that hosts ex-gay conferences , and encourages people to believe that we can “ pray - away - the - gay ” ?
“ A lot of people believe that crap , ” says SPGF .
“ But there is no religious test to run for office .
Those are her religious beliefs .
I saw the video where she stood up there and had the guy put his hands on her , the witchcraft guy .
But Im not going to hold that against her , just like shes not going to hold being gay against me . ”
From there our conversation jumped the rest of the way through the looking glass .
SPGF is confident that John McCain is pro-gayor tolerant of gay people because he saw him on Ellen and he was polite to Ellen Degeneres , wishing her “ every happiness . ”
Never mind McCain ’s insanely anti-gay voting record , or his opposition to same - sex marriages like the one Ellen just entered into .
And SPGF is confidant that McCainor Palin , if McCain drops dead wo n’t pack the Supreme Court with extremist , right - wing justices because , he says , the Senate is going to be dominated by Democrats .
And besides , McCain or Palin could accidentally wind up nominating liberal justices like Kennedy and Souter , right ?
So I finally asked SPGF the obvious question : Is he crazy ?
“ No , ” he said .
“ This is the first time I will ever have voted for the GOP candidate .
My eyes have been opened .
it s not us vs. them .
We have to make friends with as many of these people as we can .
It ’s the only way we ’ll ever make any true progress … .
If we ’re there and we ’re at their tables so that when the gay issue comes up , or when someone says something anti-gay , I can be there to say ,  Dude that s me . 
We need a place at the table . ”
But what earthly good is a place at Palin ’s table if knowing you and being “ best friends ” with a lesbian does n’t moderate her views on gay issues at all ?
“ We need to be there present and fighting , ” says SPGF , “ but fighting in a way that s effective .
We cant just have Barney Frank .
Hes a terrible spokesperson for being gay .
I dont mean from a policy perspective , I mean from a snapshot perspective . ”
Lander ’s White People are n’t always white , and the vast majority of whites are n’t White People ( he does n’t even capitalize the term ) .
But although Lander ’s designation is peculiar , he ’s hardly the first to dissect this elite and its immediate predecessors ( see for instance Mark E. Kann ’s Middle Class Radicalism in Santa Monica , Christopher Lasch ’s The Culture of Narcissism , Richard Florida ’s The Rise of the Creative Class , and David Brooks ’s Bobos in Paradise — Brooks calls these people variously “ bourgeois bohemians , ” the “ educated elite , ” and the “ cosmopolitan class ” ) .
Lander , like many of these writers , traces this group ’s values to the 1960s , and there ’s clearly a connection between a politics based on “ self - cultivation ” ( to quote the Students for a Democratic Society ’s gaseous manifesto , the Port Huron Statement ) and what Lander defines as White People ’s ethos : “ their number - one concern is about the best way to make themselves happy . ”
That concern progresses naturally into consumer narcissism and a fixation on health and “ well - being ” : Lander ’s most entertaining and spot - on entries dissect White People ’s elaborate sumptuary codes , their dogged pursuit of their own care and feeding , and their efforts to define themselves and their values through their all - but - uniform taste and accessories ( Sedaris / Eggers / The Daily Show / the right indie music / Obama bumper stickers / uh , The New Yorker ) .
So why call this group “ White People ” ?
Lander is almost certainly being mischievous .
After all , dismissing something or someone as “ so white ” has long been a favorite put - down among those who like to view themselves as right - thinking , hierarchy - defying nonconformists — that is , White People .
Recall those ads extolling “ the new face of wealth , ” which contrast male , stone - faced WASP bankers with attractive , far less formally — though far more expensively — clad women , quasi- hipsters , and assorted exotic ethnics .
The women and hipsters may be white , but they ’re not white — they ’re members of the cool - looking pan-ethnic tribe , a tribe defined by economic and social status and by cultural and aesthetic preferences rather than by ethnicity .
When I interviewed Lander on the telephone in July , he acknowledged that White People are in fact “ desperate to define themselves as other than white . ”
Indeed , he rightly places “ diversity ” and “ tolerance ” highest on the list of virtues prized by White People ( as did Brooks for Bobos ) .
Of course , this group shuns the suburbs ( sterile , bland … white — a view that has n’t advanced much since Malvina Reynolds ’s contemptuous “ Little Boxes ” of 1962 ) while it embraces certain neighborhoods as “ authentic ” ( Williamsburg , Echo Park , the Mission ) and spurns other enclaves and cities ( say , Astoria , Reseda , Concord ) .
Lander ’s
White People approve of the kind of diversity that affords them the aesthetic and consumer benefits of what they like to think of as urban life — that is , the kind that allows them to
get sushi and tacos on the same street .
But they will also send their kids to private school with other rich white kids so that they can avoid the “ low test scores ” that come with educational diversity .
Here and elsewhere , accompanying the book ’s mockery of the essentially innocuous solipsism of White People is what Lander , a man of the left , described to me as his exasperation with progressives ’ “ cultural righteousness ” and “ intolerance and groupthink ” — a set of attitudes that enhances and is enhanced by a profoundly smug and incurious outlook .
To be sure , these faults are n’t peculiar to the progressive and the hip , but Lander repeatedly and cleverly shows how some of White People ’s favorite activities ( watching political documentaries , “ raising awareness , ” foreign travel ) , which they complacently embrace as broadening , are in fact lazy and tend to be intellectually and politically stultifying :
White People “ like feeling smart without doing work — two hours in a theater is easier than ten hours with a book . ”

Should the Feds be handed all of your credit card transactions ?
Senator Dodd is trying to pull a fast one in HR 3221 by slipping in a provision , totally unrelated to preventing foreclosures , that would require that personal credit card purchases must be reported to the Federal Government .
" T he bill specifically targets payment systems like eBay 's PayPal , Amazon , and Google Checkout that are used by many small online businesses .
The privacy implications for America 's small businesses are breathtaking . "
Could this information be used in criminal IRS investigations even though the data was collected without the issuance of a search warrant , despite a person 's right to be free from self incrimination ?
Would people have to agree to waive their 5th amendment rights against self incrimination in order to obtain credit from a private bank ?
Will this even be pointed out as a condition on a credit card application ?
This has nothing to do with terror .
It is about looking for more money the government can grab .
Senator Dodd seems to thing that the money collected is what your right to privacy is worth .
This would let the feds know who you contribute to , what causes you support , what you subscribe to ... all unless you pay cash !
Do you believe the Federal Government should have a right to DEMAND that credit card companies and banks send them a list of all of your transactions ?
No , what I buy is my business .
Yes ... let them build a dossier on my spending habits .

Poll : Nearly 1/4 of Texans think Obama is Muslim Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday October 30 , 2008
Print This Email This Nearly one in four Texas voters erroneously believes Barack Obama is Muslim , according to a new poll .
The poll conducted this month by the University of Texas found that less than half the state 's voters , a majority of whom support John McCain 's candidacy , could correctly identify the religion of the Democratic presidential candidate .
Obama has been a member of the same Christian church in Chicago for more than 20 years , and he faced controversy earlier this year when controversial statements from the church 's former pastor appeared online .
When asked Obama 's religion , 22.7 percent of the respondents said Muslim , while 45 percent correctly said Protestant .
The poll showed that Texans were far more willing to believe untruths about Obama than about Sarah Palin , the GOP 's vice presidential nominee .
Just under 3 percent said they believed the untrue rumor that Palin 's youngest son , Trig , is actually her grandson .
Both rumors have circulated primarily online , although those focused on Obama have been around longer because he has been running for president longer .
The number of Texans who persist in their belief that Obama is a Muslim is nearly twice as high as the national average .
The finding worries the Dallas Morning News 's Tod Robberson .
This is worrisome because it underscores how uninformed or misinformed people are about some of the easiest and most accessible facts about the presidential campaign .
I mean , if voters can't even get his religion right , how in the world are they going to understand his position on more complex issues like health care , taxes , Iraq or urban policy ?
They wo n't .
They wo n't even attempt to understand it or read more so they 'll be better informed .
This is an indication of how lazy people are .
Or , more accurately , how lazy nearly one - quarter of Texans are .
The poll shows McCain leading Obama in the state with a 51 - to - 40 percent margin among registered voters .
Full results of the poll are available here . ( .pdf )

Vanessa Hudgens Calls Tom Cruise ' An Amazing Guy ' ( Photos )
High School Musical starhad an opportunity to meetearlier this year and found the experience to be very rewarding .
In fact , she calls him " an amazing guy " .
The scenario that led up to their meeting started when Victoria Beckham invited the teen actress to attend a Spice Girls concert .
When she arrived Katie Holmes , Tom and Suri were also in the same VIP box .
According to Vanessa : " Victoria was like , ' you know Tom and Katie do n't you ? '
I 'm like No !
And I got to talk to them , they are really great people . "
Vanessa went on to say that he gave her some advice about dealing with her life in the limelight .
" He was so sweet and such a nice guy ... just telling me there is n't much that you can do , it 's just part of your life and you have to accept it .
He is an amazing guy and I look up to him . "
The next thing we 'll be hearing is that she 's embracing Scientology .
She seems ripe for the plucking Tom .
Check out the $ 250 million lawsuit that has been leveled against the church and Cruise .
On another subject , there are reportedly make - out photos of Vanessa Hudgens and radio personality Bobby Bones floating around the Internet .
The well known host is on KHFI - FM in Austin , Texas .
The Bobby Bones Show is broadcast every morning with co-hosts Lunchbox and Amy .
The make - out pics were reportedly taken during the filming of Bandslam .
We 'll dig around and see what we can find .
Check out Vanessa 's photo gallery below - including one pic of Vanessa and Bobby Bones .
" The issue we 're raising now is are they being sensitive to the issues and the possibilities of intimidation and disenfranchisement , which could very well come out of them being too heavy handed .
( Sometimes ) the wrong strategy by law enforcement can actually create a problem rather than prevent one and it is our hope that we do n't see those kinds of problems on election day and people are able to enjoy the security of our democracy . "
Time magazine has a big interview with MPAA CEO Dan Glickman and Ratings Administration chairman Joan Graves to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the American movie rating system .
( Its birthday is tomorrow , and it would prefer it if you did n't mention its age . )
We suggest celebrating by viewing This Film is Not Yet Rated or controversial titles like the timely American Psycho , South Park : Bigger , Longer and Uncut , or the Kevin Smith Appeals Trio : Clerks , the highly - underrated Jersey Girl or Zack & Miri Make A Porno ( in a theater near you ) .
Then discuss whether the system works or is , as some might say , completely and totally unfair and arbitrary .
Anyways , in the Q&A , which we were alerted to by Variety 's Hollywood 's Aggregated Links ( HAL ) Web site , Kevin Smith pal Joan Graves says she 'd love it if Steven Spielberg made an NC - 17 film , because apparently it 's ok for Spielberg to make a dirty movie .
Here 's the full exchange between author , and former Entertainment Weekly writer , Gilbert Cruz and Graves :
I do n't really see Steven Spielberg going out and making an ' NC - 17 ' epic anytime soon .
Graves :
No , but would n't it be great if someone like him did ?
It would really help the rating .
" Help the rating ! " How ?
There 's no way Universal or Paramount would let Spielberg release an NC - 17 , we think .
They certainly would n't be happy about the rating , which would mean the respective movie would generate a heap of controversy probably ultimately resulting in an appeal in which Spielberg would kind of have to win .
Because if he did n't , Spielberg fans would lash out at the MPAA , which probably would n't help the rating or the agency 's reputation .
Inquiring minds have been wondering about food prices .
Let 's see if we can get a clue from raw commodity prices .
Wheat
Corn
Soybeans
Live Cattle
Lean Hogs
Coffee
Sugar

Judging from a broad basket of commodity prices , we are likely to see declining prices at the grocery stores in the weeks or months ahead .
Lower commodity prices will eventually pass through to prices in the grocery stores and thus be reflected in the CPI .
Some very favorable year over year comparisons are coming up , especially if prices continue to decline .

Blinking alone cannot indicate lying .
Blinking and pupil dilation can occur when someone is stressed but also when they are aroused or highly interested in something .
If it is caused by stress it could be possible that the person is lying , especially if they are not usually stressed when talking to others .
If blinking and pupil dilation occurs with a cluster of other indicators then they might be lying .
It is easier to know if someone is lying if you know them well because you will know their common and natural body language .

Nothing of substance that we know of was accomplished at the recent G - 8 meetings and the oil producers meeting in Saudi in lowering oil prices .
In fact , their failure has pushed oil prices higher .
We believe they recognize that what Lieberman , Israeli agent and poodle for the neocons , is proposing is tantamount to exchange controls totally unbeknownst to Americans who are deep in slumber , mesmerized by the puppets reining for their presidency .
The proposal is that the US would control all commodity markets and foreign exchanges that deal in commodities .
It would be Neocons über alles .
Herr Lieberman wants a prohibition on all private and public pension funds with assets in excess of $ 500 million from investing in agriculture and energy commodities traded anywhere .
How is that for imperial overreach ?
Another issue would be that the CFTC would be able , arbitrarily , to stop any financial institution from purchasing said commodities .
There would be the ability to impose speculative position limits , which we are sure wo n’t fly because it would limit swaps written by banks and investment banks .
These proposals would control capital flows that in time would grow .
It is what we experienced in airports .
First it was an ID , a driver ’s license was needed to get on a plane .
That was followed by taking your shoes off ; then the inspection of baggage and then being mauled by meatheads and thugs and now a machine that can see everything you own .
They call that creeping fascism .
That is what you will get if this legislation is passed , creeping fascism jjjjjj err Lieberman wants a proerr ieberman wants a prohibition on all private and p;ublic p
and the seeds of exchange controls .
We lived under exchange controls when we lived in South Africa and Rhodesia 33 years ago .
It is like living in a financial jail .
Domestically you had no control or freedom over your assets .
This is what the neocon Senator and Israeli representative want for you .
We can guarantee that total controls will follow .
It ’s a way of controlling your lives , especially your financial lives , by the most corrupt American in our history .
This will sneak up on you , a step at a time , just like your experience at airports .
By the time you wake up you will be in financial bondage .
What do you think the entire data gathering is all about ?
It is to financially profile all of you .
Why do you think they now record the contents of your laptop , digital camera and cell phones at airports ?
They want to file all this data in your personal dossier .
This is a long - term plan to control your lives .
What you are seeing in this legislation is far more sinister then you can imagine .
Everyone ’s positions will be constantly monitored and as you know in our Illuminist society today some are more equal than others , seeing as the illuminists control the regulators and they will profit as usual and you will not .
This is not a free market .
It ’s a government - controlled market directed by elitists from behind the scenes .
They own the CFTC and the SEC .
Do n’t you get it ?
This is what fascism is all about – vertical and horizontal control .
The first reaction of professional and institutional investors will be to move their funds as fast as possible out of the country and they have the ability to do that .
That will give the Illuminists the excuse to extend their controls into foreign markets .
A second step in the control process .
Eventually US corporations and other entities will be ordered to return their funds to the US so they can be totally controlled .
The only way to avoid that is by moving your entity out of the US the minute such legislation is passed .
What can you do to protect yourselves as Americans ?
In the final analysis your only refuge is in gold and silver assets .
If legislation is passed in near to its present form , base metals and precious metals are excluded .
Those who do not move their assets offshore to speculate in energy and agricultural markets will move to precious metals and other commodities .
We also expect such legislation could lead to new rules regarding foreign currency markets and could well end foreign currency trading or limit it to corporations that have a legitimate reason to use such markets .
The bulk of your assets should be gold and silver related .
The proposed legislation if passed will endow an additional impetus for those assets to appreciate .
As we mentioned in the last issue , in entering or leaving the US people are being selected for additional screening by customs , which includes digital media cards or drives in your pockets , inspecting the digital memory card from your camera and your cell phone .
They are also arbitrarily impounding such items and returning them two weeks later , and sometimes months later .
There obviously is a program to confiscate electronics at custom points .
Journalists are being selected for special treatment .
Alex Jones , the famous talk show host , recently endured this in Canada , when they were looking for anything they could find to bring charges against him .
The D.H.S. refuses to answer questions about the program , such as the criteria for inspection .
Lawsuits have been filed challenging the program .
D.H.S. refuses to say exactly how common the practice is , how many computers , portable storage drives , and BlackBerries have been inspected and confiscated , or what happens to the devices once they are seized .
Those suing already know digital copies – mirror images of drives have been made .
Can you imagine what could happen to companies that have trade secrets in their computers and most of them do .
The D.H.S. is loaded with criminals as is our government .
The Court of Appeals has already said D.H.S. has the authority to search electronic devices .
Except for journalists the D.H.S has been preying on Muslims , Asians and Middle Easterners .
The D.H.S. could care less about the nightmare they create .
They destroy the reason for the business trip .
It is totally wasted .
Often these criminals hold the electronics and laptops for months just to harass people .
As far as we know today they have never found anything incriminating .
It is no wonder foreigners hate America .
The D.H.S. says they want to catch terrorists , child pornographers and those stealing intellectual property .
This is not the America we once knew .
Two years ago Zbigniew Brzezinski was telling us that George and the neocons had set world government back 50 years and the Black Nobility of Europe wanted Bush out of Iraq .
Now Zbig tells us of the coming war with Iran .
He is looking for an event or some kind of terrorist attack that can be blamed on Iran to justify a pre-emptive attack .
They expect this to happen prior to the election .
Zbig said two years ago that the US should leave Iraq .
The Iran attack will be to derail Obama whose mentor is Zbig .
Yes , Zbig is selling Barak out .
The result of an Israeli attack would be that the entire Middle East would be in conflict and oil suppliers from Iraq , Iran and Venezuela would probably be shut off to Europe and the US .
Russia and China could get involved and we easily have nuclear war .
Even if Russia and China do not get involved they will be monitoring everything that goes on .
The anti-US propaganda will be massive .
The US and Israel will again embellish their reputations for being aggressive imperial fascist powers .
American sailors and Marines stationed in Iraq are more than twice as likely to use tobacco products as the average American , according to a study presented today at the annual meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians .
In a survey of 408 Marines and sailors , Dr. Michael A. Wilson found 64 % used some form of tobacco : 52 % smoked cigarettes , 36 % used smokeless tobacco and 24 % used both .
In contrast , the national average for tobacco use is 29.6 % .
Wilson found the rate of tobacco use is higher now among U.S. troops in Iraq than was found in a 2004 survey of troops returning from the war .
Tobacco use was clearly linked to military service .
About half of those surveyed said they had never used tobacco products before joining the military .
Eighty percent of the smokers said that being in the military had increased their use while 72 % stated that being deployed to Iraq had increased their smoking .
Smokeless - tobacco users also said being in the military and being in Iraq increased their usage .
Overall , 74 % of the troops who use tobacco said they wanted to quit .
Some controversy has surrounded the military 's efforts to discourage tobacco use .
Smoking among the troops has always been linked with deployment to foreign lands , but much more is known today about the health hazards of smoking , said Wilson , who is stationed with the U.S. Navy , 3rd Battalion , 23rd Marine Regiment , 4th Marine Division , New Orleans .
" There is a culture of acceptance about tobacco in the military .
It 's embraced by the leadership .
A lot of the leadership use tobacco .
They learned it from the people they trained with , and it gets passed on . "
Wilson conducted the survey while stationed in Iraq and said that troops told him they used tobacco for a variety of reasons : peer pressure , to emulate leaders they admire , boredom , stress relief and to help them stay awake .
But , he said , tobacco use is likely to have a greater negative impact to the long - term health of Iraq War veterans than combat - related injuries .
The cost of care for troops with tobacco - related health problems will also soar for both the VA and U.S. healthcare systems .
The Defense Department recently launched a virtual anti-smoking campaign targeting enlisted personnel between ages 18 and 25 called " Quit Tobacco , Make Everyone Proud . "
The Department of Veterans Affairs also has a website on smoking cessation .
But more effort should be spent to discourage tobacco use among newly enlisted troops and to discourage smoking in the war zone , Wilson said in an interview with The Times .
" My point is that we have to get them ready to survive Iraq and survive beyond Iraq .
Everyone realizes this is a problem .
But you need the leadership on a macro level , from the general on down , to the micro level , to get on board because that is who the kids really look up to . "
* In a follow - up interview and e-mail , Dr. Wilson said he wanted to make clear that he conducted this study on his own and that the views expressed regarding this study are his own opinions .
He is not a spokesman for the U.S. Navy , the U.S. Marine Corps , nor the Department of Defense and his views and opinions do not represent theirs .
He is speaking only for himself and his study as a pulmonary and critical care physician and fellow in the American College of Chest Physicians and not as a Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Troubled insurer American International Group - recipient of a more than $ 100 billion U.S. government bailout - agreed Wednesday to freeze $ 19 million in payments to former chief executive Martin Sullivan .
Under the agreement with New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , AIG also said it would block distributions from a $ 600 million deferred compensation and bonus pool intended for the company 's financial products subsidiary .
Joseph Cassano , the division 's former head , has an approximately $ 69 million stake in the pool .
The London - based division sold complex instruments that plummeted in value , leading to the insurer 's downfall .
The losses prompted the federal government to give the mammoth global company a $ 85 billion loan last month to prevent its immediate collapse .
The New York Federal Reserve then extended an additional $ 37.8 billion in financing in early October to provide it cash for daily operations .
" It is my position that until the taxpayers are repaid , with interest , the more than $ 120 billion that has been used in the rescue financing of AIG , no funds should be paid out of these pools to any executives , " Cuomo wrote in a letter to Edward Liddy , AIG 's current chief executive .
Robert Willumstad , who took over AIG from Sullivan after he was ousted in June , voluntarily gave up $ 22 million in severance .
Liddy replaced Willumstad when the government stepped in last month .
The state attorney general took issue with executive incentive payments , which he said gave management the incentive to maximize short - term gains at the expense of long - term growth .
" I find it hard to conceive of a situation where you could justify a performance bonus for management that virtually bankrupted the company , " Cuomo said in a conference call with reporters .
The agreement comes a week after AIG promised to withhold a $ 10 million severance payment to its former chief financial officer .
Cuomo , who is reviewing the company 's executive compensation agreements , is demanding the company halt all " unreasonable expenditures . "
Also , as part of last week 's agreement with Cuomo 's office , AIG promised to halt more than 160 conferences and sales junkets , worth a total of $ 8 million .
Executive compensation has returned to the spotlight as the government becomes increasingly involved in the private sector .
Under the terms of the $ 700 billion bailout of the financial system signed into law this month , banks cannot compensate executives for taking excessive risk or give generous " golden parachute " packages to departing executives .
They must also have a clawback provision that allows them to recoup money paid to chief executives who commit fraud .
Cuomo's actions with AIG go one step further , but he stressed that the government will have to decide the terms of executive compensation packages as it starts taking stakes in banks nationwide .
" Hundreds of companies will be entering into these types of situations where they will be receiving taxpayer funds pursuant to the bailout , " Cuomo said .
" It 's an important dialogue to have now . "

( Fortune Magazine ) -- Matt Simmons is as perplexed as anyone that it has fallen to him to take on OPEC , Exxon , the Saudis , and all the other misguided defenders of conventional wisdom in the oil patch .
Why should one investment banker with a penchant for research be required to point out what he regards as the obvious - that from here on out , oil supplies can't meet demand , and if we do n't act soon to solve this crisis , World War III could be looming ?
Why should a man who scorns most environmentalists have to argue that locally grown produce and wind power are the way of the future ?
Why should a lifelong Republican need to be the one to point out that his party 's new mantra - " Drill , baby , drill ! " - wo n't really fix anything and that his party 's presidential candidate is clueless about energy ?
That the spike in oil prices earlier this year was n't a temporary market anomaly and the recent retreat in prices is just a misleading calm before a calamitous storm ?
That we 're headed toward $ 500 - a - barrel oil ?
" I find it ironic that here we have the biggest industry on earth , and I 'm one of the few people to figure out that we have a major problem , " he says , in his confident if not quite brash way .
" And I did it all in my spare time .
How stupid and tragic is that ?
I should n't be one of the only folks that actually has a handful of ideas of how we can keep from blowing each other up and get through this . "
Indeed , Simmons is n't the obvious candidate to be the bearer of bad news about oil .
He 's spent his career working in the business , has lived in Houston for decades , and is such an industry insider that he helped edit the Bush campaign 's comprehensive energy plan in the 2000 election - the document that was ultimately more or less rubber - stamped by Vice President Dick Cheney 's infamous secret Energy Task Force .
Over the past 35 years , his boutique investment bank , Simmons & Co. , has helped finance and shape much of the country 's existing oil - services business .
With profits gushing , you might expect him to be celebrating .
Not to mention that the 65 - year - old banker does n't have the personality of a prophet of doom .
He has a puckish wit , a relentlessly cheerful and enthusiastic demeanor , and the appearance of a rosy - cheeked cherub in a navy blazer .
He routinely refers - in earnest - to his daily experiences as " tremendous fun . "
His closest business associates have a hard time recalling him ever showing anger .
But when it comes to oil and gas , his message is downright scary .
An unlikely maverick
Simmons was transformed overnight from an influential industry expert to an A - list pundit by the publication in 2005 of his book " Twilight in the Desert : The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy , " a fairly technical read which argues that Saudi Arabia 's oil supplies are much more limited than everyone thinks .
Since then he has moved to the forefront of the peak - oil movement - a once fringe but now growing contingent of oil industry veterans , independent consultants , investors , and academics who believe that world oil production is at or near an inflection point , after which it will fall inexorably and fail to meet projected future demands .
According to Simmons , we have already passed that peak .
And while we 're not going to run out of it anytime soon , the era of easy oil is over , and the world is about to enter a period of convulsive change .
( Hint : Learn to garden , and buy some comfortable walking shoes . )
The soaring price of crude - it has risen from below $ 20 a barrel in 2002 to as high as $ 147 earlier this year - has helped thrust Simmons further into the spotlight .
He was one of the main voices , for instance , in the recent oil - shock documentary " Crude Awakening , " and his book has now sold more than 100,000 copies .
His willingness to make bold predictions about how high crude may go has made him an A - list guest for cable TV news programs and a go - to source for newspaper reporters covering oil and gas .
In 2005 , when oil was $ 58 a barrel , he predicted it would be at or above $ 100 within a few years .
Now he sees it climbing to $ 200 , $ 300 , or higher .
" There really is no roof on oil prices at this point , " he says .
Being so outspoken , of course , invites criticism , and Simmons has endured plenty .
But he has also won a lot of high - profile admirers .
" Like most people who ignore conventional wisdom , he was scoffed at , ridiculed , and denied , " says commodities guru Jim Rogers .
" And now , of course , people are starting to say , ' Oh , well , I thought of that . ' "
Billionaire oil and gas investors Richard Rainwater and Boone Pickens both heap praise on Simmons 's analytical abilities .
Maine 's Senator Susan Collins , a Republican who recently began consulting with Simmons on energy issues , says , " I think he 's issuing a clarion call that policymakers need to listen to . "
In his own upbeat way , he despairs about what is to come .
As the price of oil has fallen this summer ( to $ 101 at press time ) , Simmons has watched in dismay as complacency has returned and the champions of do - nothingism have popped out of the woodwork to say I told you so .
Not that it 's lessened his conviction about the road ahead .
" I do think there are a growing number of people who are getting it , " he says .
" But I guess it just reminds me that as a society , we do n't have the ability to actually come to grips with a crisis until it's hit us in the face .
I am discouraged enough now to think that we 're going to have to have a really nasty shock before we wake people up . "
Has peak oil peaked ?
On a Thursday morning at the end of July , Simmons is sitting in a wicker chair on the back porch of his six - bedroom summer home on the coast of Maine , waiting to do a live television spot on CNBC .
Sun glints off Penobscot Bay below him .
In the distance , sailboats glide in and out of Camden Harbor .
It 's the kind of scene that has captivated him since his Harvard days in the 1960s , when he started coming up here on weekends .
Wearing a blue - and - white - checked shirt , cream - colored pants , and tasseled loafers , Simmons chats with Ellen , his wife , and Emma , one of their five daughters .
His earpiece is chattering as CNBC anchor Melissa Francis teases his upcoming segment .
At the moment , the price of oil is hovering around $ 124 a barrel , and CNBC wants him to interpret why crude is suddenly tumbling .
" Has peak oil peaked ?
I guess that 's our topic , " he reports to everyone within earshot , before the shot goes live .
It was on this same porch five years ago that Simmons had the insight that convinced him that the oil age had passed its zenith .
During a trip to Saudi Arabia in February 2003 with his friend Herbert Hunt ( yes , the son of H.L .
Hunt who , with his brother Bunker , almost cornered the silver market in 1980 ) , Simmons had become suspicious of the Saudis ' claims about the vastness of their oil supply .
In his four decades of working in the oil and gas industry , everyone he had ever talked to had taken it as gospel that the Saudis had enough oil to bail the world out when other supplies ran short .
If that was n't true , Simmons believed , the era of cheap oil was over .
Demand for crude was on the rise worldwide , and supplies were getting tighter all the time .
If the Saudis were pushing up against the limits of their oil production , the world needed to know .
In his typically analytical fashion , Simmons went hunting for data .
He found it in the form of hundreds of technical papers submitted by Saudi oil geologists to the Society of Petroleum Engineers over the past 50 years .
Simmons spent the month of August 2003 sitting on his porch in Maine and grinding his way through the minutiae of technical accounts of , for instance , reservoir pressure and water - cut percentages , trying to piece together the challenges that the Saudi geologists had encountered in managing their precious oilfields .
In the end , his conclusion was clear .
" I finished reading the last paper on a Sunday afternoon , " says Simmons , " and I sat back and I thought , Holy crap , this is unbelievable .
I 've just discovered the biggest energy illusion ever in the world .
We 're in big trouble .
I 'm going to write a book . "
And so he did .
But writing the book did n't exhaust his passion .
Today he is more convinced than ever that we 've reached peak oil .
If he 's right , current world oil production - 86 million barrels a day - is about as high as we 're going to go .
Of course , if demand goes up but supply does n't , prices are apt to go through the roof .
And unlike global oil production , global oil demand does n't appear to be anywhere near a peak .
Both the U.S. government 's Energy Information Association and the independent International Energy Agency , based in Paris , estimate that worldwide demand will be more than 115 million barrels a day by 2030 .
More tellingly , Jeffrey Frankel , one of the seven members of America 's National Institute for Economic Research – the body that officially decides whether the US is in recession – told The Daily Telegraph : " I think the chances are very high that we are currently in recession . "
A Good Story
When it comes to marketing and selling products , the food companies have never let the facts get in the way of a good story .
A lot of the information we find on the front of food packaging is not so much information , as it is a somewhat misleading and deceptive sales pitch .
For example , the reduced - fat peanut butter we find on our supermarket shelves has less fat when we compare it to the regular product , but it is by no means a low - fat product .
It ’s still a high - fat , high - salt , high - calorie product that should be avoided .
It ’s still complete crap .
Complete crap with slightly less fat than it ’s full - fat brother .
So instead of having 52 grams of fat per 100 grams , the new reduced - fat option has about 43 grams of fat per 100 grams ( and a little extra sugar ) .
Amazingly , some people will actually eat twice as much of the reduced - fat version because it ’s healthier .
Not .
Oh well .
Too Much of a Good Thing
Even foods which are genuinely healthy can lead to an unhealthy you and me if we consume too much of them .
If we eat only healthy fresh , whole foods but consistently consume twice what our body needs ( in terms of our energy requirements ) , we ’ll get fat .
If we ’re fat , we ’re at greater health risk .
Simple .
Obviously , what types of food we eat is an issue , but for many of us , how much we eat is the biggest issue .
Not only are we the sit - down generation but we are also the over - eating generation .
We have an incredible ‘ skill ’ for putting food in our mouth that our body does n’t need .
Our want over - rides our need and the net result is … obesity .
Here ’s a few common food options that trip plenty of people up :
Advertising
1. Seeds and Nuts .
Yep , healthy .
Except of course when you ’re eating a bucket of cashews before lunch .
Nuts are a quality natural food , but they are also very high in fat ( good fat ) and calories .
When it comes to eating nuts , weigh or count what you ’re putting in your mouth .
Freestyle ( unconscious ) eating of nuts ai n’t a great strategy when it comes to creating and maintaining your best body .
Unless of course , you wanna weigh four hundred pounds soon .
Most nuts are more than fifty percent fat .
2. Fruit Juice .
Not all juice is juice .
Some fruit juices are in fact fruit ‘ drinks ’ with as little as five percent fruit juice in them .
Read those labels carefully .
When you do find the real deal , consume it in moderation .
Lots of calories and lots of sugar mean that we do n’t want to be using fruit juice as our sole means of hydration .
They have this thing now called water .
Apparently it ’s great .
Interestingly , a glass of fruit juice has about the same amount of sugar and calories as a glass of soft drink ( soda ) .
A healthier type of sugar ( fructose ) of course , but sugar nonetheless .
3. Fruit Smoothies .
The term ‘ healthy smoothie ’ can be an oxymoron with some smoothies ( from well - known outlets here in Oz ) having as many as 600 calories and 70 grams ( 14 teaspoons ) of sugar .
Wanna get fat ?
Throw down a couple of those bad boys each day .
4. Dried fruit .
We take out the water , we leave the sugar and the calories and we ’re left with dried fruit .
A very energy - dense food .
Fresh fruit is a much ( much , much ) better option .
Compare 100 grams of fresh apricot ( 40 calories ) with 100 grams of dried apricot ( over 250 calories ) .
Same weight , very different calories .
If you ’re going to eat dried fruit , do it sparingly .
5. Muffins .
Somehow ( not sure why ) , some people consider a muffin to be a healthy snack .
Let ’s be clear … it ’s not healthy ; it ’s cake .
It ’s ( typically ) white flour , sugar , egg and some form of fat .
Parents who ( constantly ) feed their kids muffins are irresponsible and pushing their offspring towards obesity .
Advertising
6. Salads .
Just the word ‘ salad ’ wreaks of health , vitality and goodness , does n’t it ?
If only it were true .
As a rule , the only salad you wanna eat is the one you make yourself with fresh ingredients and little or no dressing .
Not all , but many salads that you buy when eating out are laced with high - fat dressings and high - sugar sauces .
A Caesar salad can easily contain 50 - 60 grams of fat ( the same as two Big Macs ) .
7. Muesli bars .
The majority are high fat , high - sugar , high - calorie crap .
Avoid them .
8. Toasted muesli .
Like raw muesli but more calories , more fat and not as good for you .
Go the raw option .
9. Sports drinks .
A.K.A coloured water with sugar .
Unless you ’re an athlete who needs to replenish your depleted glycogen stores because you ’ve just completed a massive training session , drink some water instead .
10 . Protein bars .
Some are okay but not many .
Most are high in preservatives , interesting chemicals , calories and fat .
Some are laced with artificial sweeteners and who knows what the long - term consequences of those will be .
Many protein bars have a similar calorie and fat content to a Mars bar ( of comparative weight ) .
Read the labels and choose wisely if you must have one , but keep in mind that you can find protein in better places .
Apparently there ’s a new high - protein product on the market ; they call it the ‘ egg ’ .
If you get a chance , check one out .
Advertising
11 . Cereal .
In Australia , the vast majority of supermarket cereals are high - sugar , processed crap .
Most of the popular cereals ( in terms of sales ) live somewhere in the twenty to thirty five percent sugar range .
Great for the dentists , not so good for our kids .
Or you .
Look on the back of the pack and as a rule , the less ingredients , the better .
My preferred cereals ?
Oats , raw muesli , Oat Brits , Vita Brits ( or similar ) , unprocessed bran .
The more natural and unprocessed , the better .
My daily breakfast ?
Three Oat Brits ( no I ’m not sponsored ) , fifty grams of raw Muesli , thirty grams of unprocessed bran , skim milk .
Or porridge ( oats ) and fresh fruit .
12 . Flavoured rice cakes .
Some people live on these things .
I have to admit that I am partial to the odd flavoured rice cake .
Unfortunately they have about as much nutritional value as eating your toenails .
There ’s a thought .
Very processed and very high in sodium ( salt ) .
13 . Low - fat ice - cream .
As with many other low - fat products , the lack of fat is usually compensated for with additional sugar .
Wo n’t kill you but keep it to a minimum .
14 . Low - fat frozen dinners .
Apart from the fact that they ’re tiny , expensive and taste like cardboard ( in my opinion ) , they ’re also jammed with preservatives and sodium .
Apart from that , they ’re fantastic .
15 . Vegetarian meals .
Some people assume that if a meal is vegetarian , it ’s automatically healthy .
Erroneous assumption .
Some vegetarian meals are fantastic .
Some are high in fat .
Some are healthy .
Some are not .
Some vegetarian meals contain plenty of oil and other high fat ingredients like coconut milk .
By the way , one cup of coconut milk contains fifty seven grams ( !!! ) of fat – more than most of us should consume in an entire day .
Do n’t avoid vegetarian food but know what you ’re putting in your mouth .

The Last Bit
So grasshoppers , as is often the way with the human experience , things are not always as they seem .
All I wanted to do today was to open the door on this subject and to stimulate and provoke you to be more aware and more considered when it comes to the choices you make regarding your ( and possibly your family ’s ) nutrition .
I have just scraped the surface but I would encourage you to investigate and read further .
If you do nothing else , begin to read the nutritional information labels on the products you intend to buy .
Keep in mind that with many healthy products , we ’re buying a concept more than we are a reality .

' Joe the Plumber ' for Congress ?
RAW STORY
Published : Sunday October 26 , 2008
Print This Email This Samuel " Joe the Plumber " Wurzelbacher has expressed interest in channeling his newfound fame into a congressional run against Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur in 2010 , he told Fox News on Saturday .
" Politics is a big part of my life , Wurzelbacher told the network 's Neil Cavuto .
" I love how American government works . "
Wurzelbacher 's celebrity began in front of his house in Holland , Ohio on October 12 as Senator Obama toured the neighborhood .
" Your new tax plan is gonna tax me more , is n't it ? "
Wurzelbacher asked .
" It 's not that I want to punish your success , " Obama responded , " I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you -- that they 've got a chance at success too ... I think that when you spread the wealth around , it 's good for everybody . "
" Joe the Plumber " was concerned that were he to go through with the purchase of a plumbing business and make $ 250,000 a year , he would be taxed more heavily under Obama 's proposed plan than that of his opponent Senator McCain .
McCain invoked Obama 's " spread the wealth around " comment , and " Joe , " repeatedly at the third presidential debate and in subsequent campaign speeches .
According to the Obama campaign , no family making under $ 250,000 a year would see an increase in taxes under his plan .
No family , it says , will pay higher taxes than it did in the 1990s .
" What worries me , " " Joe " said in a live online chat with the Washington Times on Saturday , " is that he is deciding that $ 250 k is rich right now , but what 's to stop him from changing his mind ? "
" What I essentially said to him , " Obama said at the October 15 debate , " was , five years ago , when you were in the position to buy your business , you needed a tax cut then ...
And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber , the nurse , the firefighter , the teacher , the young entrepreneur who does n't yet have money , I want to give them a tax break now . "
In what could be a first in the world , a fish species in the cichlid family has been observed by scientists in the act of splitting into two distinct species in Lake Victoria , Africa ’s largest lake and one of the world ’s biggest fresh water bodies .
This may be remarkable because what is causing them to diverge are adaptations to their vision as animals and plants try to cope with increased pollution and the effects of climate change .
The change is also happening without geographical isolation , which was thought to be a precursor for evolution .
The Pundamilia nyererei is a haplochromine type cichlid native to areas in the Mwanza Gulf region of Lake Victoria .
This region consists of many islands where each island region has its own color variant of the fish .
In a report published in the journal Nature , researchers from Tokyo ’s Institute of Technology and the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology have observed the cichlid evolve into a new species better adapted in sighting its prey and predator .
But the scientists have also tabled evidence indicating that it is not pollution and over - fishing alone that are responsible for the disappearance of some fish species in Lake Victoria and the evolving of others like the cichlid into new species .
The report summarizes that new species may be born because of vision differences and what fish see at least in one African lake could be the driving force that causes them to evolve into new species .
This may explain the very rapid loss of pundamilia in Lake Victoria over the past 30 years .
The study says the eye adaptations have also affected mating patterns .
Researchers looked at two species , conspicuous by their red or blue colours .
They determined through lab experiments that certain genetic mutations helped some fish adapt their vision at deeper levels to see the colour red and others in shallower water to recognise shades of blue .
The researchers showed that the eyes have adapted to this difference so that fish that live in deeper water have a pigment in their eyes that is more sensitive to red light , while shallow - water fish were sensitive to blue .
Generally , the evolutionary process of speciation ( the formation of new species ) occurs when one species is split by a physical distance or barrier , allowing each group to develop different traits .
The observations of Lake Victoria ’s cichlids provide evidence of an unusual form of evolution known as sympatric speciation , which occurs without the physical separation of a population group .

You should never hire anyone for something you have n’t first struggled to do on your own .
It ’ll teach you most of what you need to know to actually interview candidates , it ’ll allow you to understand the nature of the work better ( do I even need to hire or can we outsource ? ) , and you ’ll know exactly what a job well done will look like .
It ’ll also give you a sense of whether the job is big enough for a full - time hire yet or if you can skimp by on your own ( the latter is preferable if possible ) .
Jason did n’t hire me to help him program Singlefile ( now defunct ) before he had a sorta - just - barely - working prototype running off his own PHP skills .
I did n’t hire Mark to do system administration before I had spent a whole Summer setting up a cluster .
Jason did n’t get Sarah on board to do support before he had first done it for years on his own .
The benefits of having done the work yourself before seeking help does n’t stop at hiring either .
You ’ll be a much better manager of roles that you ’ve already held than when you ’re completely in the dark about what it takes to perform .
You ’ll have empathy available when the going gets tough and it ’s not their fault — and a stern voice when it is .
Do n’t let big titles scare you off either .

Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama has opened up a commanding lead in Minnesota over Republican John McCain , according to a new Star Tribune Minnesota Poll .
The poll , conducted last week among 1,084 likely voters , found that 55 percent support Obama , while 37 percent back McCain .
That 's a huge difference from the last Minnesota Poll , conducted in September , which showed the race dead even , with each candidate backed by 45 percent of likely voters .
The new poll shows that Obama 's surge in the state can be attributed to voters ' belief in his ability to deal with the nation 's worsening economy , his performance in the first presidential debate and an increase in the number of Minnesotans who call themselves Democrats .
Obama appears comfortably ahead among men , women , and voters of all ages and educational attainment .
The poll 's findings come at a time when polls in several other battleground states and nationally are showing a sudden and significant shift to Obama .
Gallup 's daily national tracking poll released Friday showed Obama leading McCain by 7 percentage points .
Statewide polls conducted last week show Obama overtaking McCain in such key battleground states as Ohio , Virginia and Florida .
In Florida , for example , the last four polls have shown Obama with leads of between three and eight percentage points ; in the weeks prior , Obama trailed by as many as 10 points .
In Minnesota , for decades the most reliably Democratic state in presidential elections , a CNN / Time poll conducted last weekend showed Obama ahead , 54 percent to 43 percent .
However , a Survey USA poll conducted last week showed McCain ahead among the state 's likely voters , 47 percent to 46 percent .
Ben Golnik , Upper Midwest coordinator the McCain campaign , said of the Star Tribune poll : " Clearly this poll is out of whack from every other recent public poll , including the Survey USA poll from two days ago .
...
The explanation is simple :
When a poll only includes one - quarter Republicans and a higher number of both independents and Democrats , these results are to be expected . "
Jeff Blodgett , who heads the Obama campaign in Minnesota , said , " I do n't know what to make of all these polls that have us up and down and at the same time .
I do n't spend much time thinking about them .
We do feel the voters are coming our way because of the economy . ''
Economy central
Two keys to understanding Obama 's apparent strength in Minnesota can be found in an abrupt change in likely voters ' party affiliations and their near - universal revulsion with the way things currently are going in the United States .
Forty - two percent of respondents identified themselves as Democrats in the latest poll , up from 34 percent a month ago .
In the same period , the percentage of Minnesotans calling themselves Republicans has dropped from 31 percent to 26 percent .
Larry Hugick , chairman of Princeton Survey Research Associates International , the Star Tribune 's polling firm , has studied party identification shifts in presidential years and found that it moves in concert with the results of the candidate horse race .
In a study that he and an associate conducted during the 2004 presidential race , they found that 18 percent of registered voters changed their self - described party affiliation between September and October 2004 .
At the same time , in the latest poll , 80 percent of Minnesotans believe the nation has " gotten seriously off on the wrong track , " the harshest assessment they have had of the general state of the nation during the Bush administration .

Clandillon and Steve Milbourne , who work at a digital design boutique division of Sony / BMG in London , have put together what they call " the world 's first music video in Excel format , " for AC / DC .
They decided on this unusual format because they wanted the video to penetrate even the most Draconian corporate firewalls .
After all , who can't receive an Excel spreadsheet ?
" Basically , it 's come about because we recognized that a lot of people have fairly restrictive internet and security policies at work , " Clandillon told Wired.com .
" What we really liked was that we could actually subvert the corporate firewalls by including AC / DC 's music in an Excel spreadsheet , because that 's allowed through every corporate firewall there is . "
You can view the video version to the right .
You can also download the real McCoy in the Excel format .
Caveats : the Excel version wo n't run on Macs , and you 'll need to enable macros after opening the file .

With oil prices in free - fall and the world 's economies in the toilet , short - sighted governments and C02 - denying GM execs will undoubtedly defer priority given to clean energies in the next round of fiscal budgets .
Too bad , because Korea 's S&P Energy Research Institute has just issued a press release about a new discovery it claims puts the era of clean energy within reach .
Dr. Sen Kim claims to have achieved the separation of Hydrogen using just 0.1 kwh of energy compared to the traditional 4 - 4.5 kwh required using the ol ' electrolytic method .
Dr. Kim postulates that " manufacturing the H2 by our method will lower the cost of H2 as much as 20 - 30 times " compared to electrolytic H2 .
That makes SPERI 's method suitable for H2 fuel production from say , an in - home hydrogen fueling station .
So is this the solution to all of our clean energy concerns ?
Perhaps , but we 've heard these economical hydrogen - generation claims before .
Let 's wait for the claim to be more thoroughly vetted by bigger brains than our own before getting too hopeful .
In matters of personal hygiene , it is men who are viewed as the grimy sex while women strive to keep them scrubbed .
But a survey has revealed that female cleanliness is a myth .
Women were up to three times more likely to have dirty hands than men .
The difference between the sexes was starkest in London , where 21 per cent of women were carrying faecal bacteria on their hands , compared with 6 per cent of men .
Women in Birmingham and Cardiff also outranked men for bacterial contamination , but in the north – Newcastle and Liverpool – stereotypes reasserted themselves and men had the filthiest hands .
The Dirty Hands study was conducted to highlight poor hygiene habits as part of the first Global Handwashing Day today .
Commuters ' at five train stations were swab - tested for bacteria .
The results , analysed by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine , also revealed a north - south divide .
Commuters in Newcastle were up to three times more likely than those in London to have the bacteria on their hands – 44 per cent versus 13 per cent .
More than a third in Liverpool were contaminated , compared to less than a quarter in Birmingham and Cardiff .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The bacteria were all from the gut and do not necessarily cause disease , although they indicate that hands have not been washed properly .
Val Curtis , director of the Hygiene Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said : " We were flabbergasted so many people had faecal bugs on their hands .
If these people had been suffering from a diarrhoeal disease , the potential for it to be passed round would be greatly increased by their failure to wash their hands after going to the toilet . "
Although they do n't directly concern the typical gadget fan , corporate I.T. purchases actually count for a lot in the books of many hardware makers .
When it comes to phones , smart devices like the BlackBerry range have ruled the roost for several years now – that 's something Apple wants to change by getting the iPhone in the pockets of business suits worldwide .
Handy package
One of the first such deals sees Softbank Mobile , the iPhone carrier in Japan , supplying 1,000 Apple handsets to consulting firm Bearing Point .
The firm says it chose the iPhone for its analysts and other staff to consolidate the unwieldy separate PC , modem and mobile arrangement they currently have to carry around when offsite .
Point to be made
If the move is a sign of things to come , Japan could become an important proving ground for the iPhone as a business tool .
To date , other smartphones have been thin on the ground there , with sightings of BlackBerry and Windows Mobile devices about as common as snow in July .
For local people
That has partly been because phones that are most useful when synced with a PC are n't appealing in a country where most people do n't own a computer , but also because Japanese networks stuck with tried - and - trusted local manufacturers for years .
Now that the market is saturated , it appears the time to look overseas for new phone technology is finally upon the Japanese .
For baseball fans , October is a melancholy time of year even if your team is in the playoffs .
In short order the season will be over and despite the entertainment of hot stove chatter and free agent signings , it ’ll be a long winter .
That said , after watching the Red Sox and Angels play two white - knuckle games on Sunday and Monday nights , I ’m glad the ALCS does n’t start until Friday .
As a Sox booster , I need a breather .
Hell , I ’ll be able to watch tonight ’s presidential “ debate ” without flipping back and forth between channels .
It was a minor miracle that Monday ’s 3 - 2 clincher for the Sox , which threatened to go into extra innings for the second straight night until rookie Jed Lowrie drove in Jason Bay in the bottom of the ninth , finished before midnight .
Before retiring , I laid out a Coco Crisp t- shirt in my younger son ’s room — the season - long signal that our team won when he ca n’t stay up for the entire game — and did n’t even worry for the moment about the challenge ahead for Boston in playing the Rays for the American League pennant .
Very early this morning , I took a cursory glance at The Boston Globe ’s coverage of the game and then moved on to reading about the far more vital , and disturbing , news of the global credit crunch .
It was n’t until about 11 a.m. , checking out Craig Calcaterra ’s blog that I found out what a complete jerk Angels ’ star pitcher John Lackey is .
( Calcaterra made no judgments , just alluded to Lackey ’s bitterness . )
Mind you , I like the Angels a lot : Mike Scioscia ’s a gutsy manager , Chone Figgins and Vlad Guerrero are two of MLB ’s most exciting players and their stadium in Anaheim is a terrific place to watch a ballgame .
But Lackey really cheesed me off , as he spoke to anyone and everyone at The Los Angeles Times who ’d listen , sort of like a bad drunk at a party who ’s the last to leave .
He told Times beat writer Mike DiGiovanna : “ We lost to a team that ’s not better than us …
Sunday night they scored three runs on a pop fly that was called a hit , which was a joke . ”
Hey , it was n’t Jacoby Ellsbury ’s fault that Torii Hunter or Howie Kendrick did n’t catch his ducksnort .
Did Lackey expect Sox manager Terry Francona to tell the umps , “ Hey , guys , let ’s call a mulligan on that play , the Angels were n’t in position . ”
More Lackey , a guy Leo Durocher or Ty Cobb would ’ve loved : “ Monday night they scored on a broken - bat ground ball and a fly ball that anywhere else in America is an out , and [ Dustin Pedroia is ] fist - pumping on second base like he did something great . ”
In fact , for the Sox it was great : Pedroia , who may win the AL ’s MVP award , hit a double and a run scored .
Is that so hard for Lackey to understand ?
In addition , the pitcher who won the seventh game of the ’02 Series ( Lackey ’s a cretin , but any team would like him in their rotation ) , visibly growled at a couple of plays when his infielders could n’t come up with run-saving plays .
Way to hang together as a team , John ; as if Hunter , still one of the best outfielders in the Majors has n’t saved your butt at times this season with his spectacular catches in center field .
Finally , let ’s remember that the Angels racked up their 100 wins playing in the four - team A.L.
West , where they had the pleasure of matching up with three sub -.500 teams , including the woeful Seattle Mariners .
The Rays ( 97 wins ) and Sox ( 95 wins ) play in baseball ’s toughest division , the A.L. East , where only the Orioles — and even that team was pretty good for half a year — were crummy in ’08 .
I ’ll admit that the Angels ’ dominance over the Sox during the regular season , plus their injury - ridden roster ( which mirrored the Angels last year in the playoffs ) , gave me little hope that they ’d prevail against Lackey and his squad , but thanks to Jon Lester , Jason Bay , Ellsbury and Kevin Youkilis , plus great defense , they did .
So , Lackey : hard cheese , tough guy .
Mid-season pick - up Mark Teixeira , gold - glove first baseman , slugger and current free agent , was better in minding his manners , saying “ There were two really good teams in this series , and we did n’t catch many breaks .
But we did n’t hit well with runners in scoring position , and that ’s what it came down to . ”
Since

Oct. 29 , 2008  -- Sen. Barack Obama intends to overwhelm Sen. John McCain in an air war today that will feature a new television ad , a 30 - minute prime - time infomercial on most TV networks , an interview with ABC News anchor Charles Gibson and a late - night appearance on the " The Daily Show . "
McCain 's response is a 30 - second ad and a CNN interview on " Larry King Live . "
Watch Obama 's Interview With Charles Gibson on " World News " at 6:30 p.m. ET
With six days to go in the presidential race , the candidates are shadowing each other through states that are vital to both strategies for victory .
They went toe - to - toe in Ohio on Monday and held competing rallies in Pennsylvania on Tuesday .
Their slugfest heads to Florida today , where both will woo voters in a state that is seen as essential to McCain and could be decisive for Obama on Election Day .
Yet polls released today brought bad news for McCain .
The latest Quinnipiac University survey showed Obama with a nine - point point lead , 51 - 42 , over his Republican rival nationally .
Even bleaker for McCain is a Pew Research Center poll that showed Obama with a 16 - point lead among the country 's registered voters .
Those are tough numbers for McCain to overcome as voting has already begun in much of the country .
Everyday Families
The centerpiece of today 's furious round of campaigning is Obama 's multi-network , multi-million dollar TV extravaganza that begins at 8 p.m. ET and ends just moments before the World Series resumes .
Obama will be sitting at a table with average Americans he met on the stump as they tell their stories , each illustrating an economic challenge facing voters .
Several prominent American supporters are expected to make cameo appearances to vouch for Obama .
The candidate will talk about his mother 's struggle with her insurance company while dying of cancer , and the spot will climax with Obama speaking live from a campaign stop in Florida .
It will be the first time a candidate has spent so lavishly for a solid block of prime - time television since 1992 , when billionaire Ross Perot bought several half - hour segments as part of his unsuccessful independent bid for the White House .
Obama and Bill Clinton 's Joint Appearance in Florida
Adlai Stevenson also bought several 30 - minute spots on television during his run against Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 , but he also lost .
If you miss Obama 's special , you may stumble across him at 6:30 p.m. ET during his sitdown with ABC News ' Gibson during " World News , " or again on " The Daily Show " at 11 p.m. ET .
Veteran Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf warns that there is a danger that Obama could overdo it , that some voters who are n't emotionally committed to Obama could object to having him hijack their television sets .
More serious , however , " There could be a danger if this is seen as a victory lap , " Sheinkopf said .
" That kind of arrogance people wo n't tolerate . "
Jefrey Pollock , head of Global Strategy Group , believes " there 's no such thing as overdoing it . "
Polls indicate that voters believe Obama is running a positive campaign " and you ca n't overdo positive . "
Pollock also noted that Obama is hitting very different audiences with his televised blitz .
" The audience for Charlie Gibson and the audience for ' The Daily Show ' are vastly different , " he said .
" It could be a danger if voter interest was n't so intense , " said Tad Devine , who also advised Democratic candidates .
" But it 's enormous .
It 's the highest level of interest we 've seen in a generation . "
Dan Schnur , a GOP strategist , doubts that many people will watch the Obamathon .
" Most people will find out about it through news coverage " on Thursday , Schnur said .
" The real benefit for the Obama campaign is that this unusual approach helps them dominate the news cycle for a day when there are n't many days left . "
For voters in the battleground states , it will also be hard to miss Obama 's new ad that uses McCain 's own words to skewer him on the issue of the economy .
The Democrat 's newest commercial quotes McCain saying on Dec. 18 , 2007 , " The issue of the economy is not something I 've understood as well as I should . "
It also includes a McCain quote from last Nov. 28 , saying , " I might have to rely on a vice president that I select " for expertise on economic issues .
It then cuts to a picture of his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , without any commentary -- apparently questioning whether her selection did indeed boost the GOP ticket 's economic credentials .
One moment that wo n't be televised will be Obama 's first joint campaign appearance with former President Bill Clinton in Orlando .
McCain tries to deflate Obama 's 30 - minute appearance with a new 30 - second ad that says , " Behind the fancy speeches , grand promises and TV special , lies the truth : With crises at home and abroad , Barack Obama lacks the experience America needs . "
McCain's Newest Attack on Obama
McCain will press the experience issue today at a rally in Florida , where he will be backed by four former secretaries of state who have endorsed him along with a platoon of retired army generals .
In some of his harshest criticism of Obama yet , McCain said he doubted Obama 's ability to protect America from terror attacks .
" The question is whether this is a man who has what it takes to protect America from Osama bin Laden , al Qaeda , and other grave threats in the world , " McCain said .
" And he has given you no reason to answer in the affirmative . "
He also renewed his attack on Obama 's friends .
After criticizing Obama for weeks over his acquaintance with former Weather Underground radical Bill Ayers , McCain lashed out at Obama today for his friendship with Columbia University professor Rashid Khalidi .
Khalidi advised former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat during the 1990s , but has decried suicide bombers and more radical groups like Hamas .
He is a currently a professor of Arab studies at Columbia .
A tie to a pro-Arab person like Khalidi could hurt Obama with Jewish voters in Florida , now considered a toss - up between the candidates .
When asked about Khalidi in May , Obama acknowledged that he knew Khalidi when both taught in Chicago and their children went to the same schools , but said , " He is not one of my advisers , he 's not one of my foreign policy people . "
The McCain camp continues to press its argument that Obama 's tax policies will further damage the reeling economy .
Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty told " Good Morning America " this morning that Obama would tax capital gains , dividends , payroll taxes and would " suffocate job growth . "
Pawlenty was countered on " GMA " by Sen.
Claire McCaskill , D - Mo. , who argued an Obama presidency would produce a new stimulus check for Americans and would create jobs by boosting spending on state infrastructure projects .
ABC News ' Bret Hovell contributed to this report
As hard as Republican candidate John McCain has tried to distinguish himself from US President George W Bush , Americans are indicating they do n't want another four years of a Republican in the White House .
With Barack Obama also making inroads in many Republican states , the party is bracing for big losses in the US Congress .
And while Senator McCain is n't throwing in the towel , some Republicans are already looking beyond him .
His running mate , Sarah Palin , has been described as a diva and a whack job by some Republicans who blame her for dragging down the ticket .
There are others who suspect she 's already positioning herself for her own White House run in 2012 .
So if the Republicans do n't win next week 's Presidential election , will Ms Palin consider it ?
" I 'm just thinking that it 's gonna go our way on Tuesday November 4 , " she said .
" I truly believe that the wisdom of the people will be revealed on that day as they enter that voting booth they will understand the stark contrast between the two tickets . "
But she 's also making it clear she has n't been put off by the some of the criticism that has come her way , from both the media and the Republican Party .
" If I were to give up and wave a white flag of surrender against some of the political shots that we 've taken , that would bring this whole ...
I 'm not doing this for nought , " she said .
" No , we 're gonna progress , we 're gonna keep going forward .
So it is all worth it and I 'm not complaining about any of it . "
' Bloodletting ' begins
Michael Gerson , a former speechwriter for George W Bush , says he is not looking forward to the Republican post-election conversation .
" Usually a loss results in a circular firing squad of recrimination and anger , not a healthy discussion of the directions of the future , " he said .
" And the reality is we 're already beginning to see that right now . "
Norm Ornstein , a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington , says the Republican criticisms have been harmful to Senator McCain .
" Normally the bloodletting waits until after you 've lost , " he said .
" It 's pretty unusual to have it occur in such an open way , really two weeks before the election and it's been pretty damaging to McCain .
" Part of it because some of this has happened between the people around McCain and the people around his running mate Sarah Palin .
" And it 's also clear of course that she has anticipated what might happen and is already planning what future she 's going to have in the party as we head towards 2012 . "
Party crisis
Mr Ornstein says there 's a broader factor at play than whether people are jumping ship from Senator McCain to Ms Palin .
" You have a crisis right now within the Republican party 's ranks .
What does the party stand for ?
You know to use the old cliché ; there is a struggle for the soul of the party , " he said .
" A part of it is that we 've had some real questions about what the core economic policy is .
" Remember the old Republican party , which was a business dominated party , was , at its core , fiscally conservative ; it was for balanced budgets .
" And now we 've gone through the biggest deficits in history , you have a Republican party that 's stood for limited government .
" We 've had this dramatic expansion of government even before this financial meltdown and now we 've got almost $ 1 trillion of government involvement in the financial sector , including government owning a piece of the major banks in the society .
He says as well as business issues , there are also social issues .
" Now throw into that the tension between the neoconservatives and the realists in foreign policy and you 've got quite a witch 's brew here , " he said .
He says it is never too late to be grooming Ms Palin as the next Republican flag bearer .
" But there 's no clear sense of who 's going to be the flag bearer , " he said .
" What we do know about Sarah Palin is she emerged from nowhere , she had this initial burst of enormous enthusiasm that cut across a lot of boundaries , but within a few weeks she had become a drag on the ticket generally with a core of enthusiastic support from among many in the party 's base , but almost nobody else .
" But that core support in the party 's base and her undeniable skills as a campaigner leave her in a position where she is going to be a serious figure under a couple of conditions .
Give Sarah Palin three years to bone up on the issues . "
Senior Republicans are already planning a rural retreat in Virginia days after the presidential election to discuss how to rebuild their party .

In the UK blood cannot be stored beyond 35 days Storing donated blood too long increases the chance of an infection , US researchers claim .
The risk of blood poisoning or pneumonia doubled once the 29 - day mark passed , Cooper University Hospital in New Jersey found .
The study , presented at a US conference , calls for increased care over the way blood is used and stored .
UK authorities said blood took 10 days on average to reach hospitals and daily deliveries meant it was not stockpiled .
The shelf life of blood in the UK is shorter than in the US
Spokesman
UK National Blood Service
The US does not allow the use of blood stored for longer than 42 days - in the UK this is lower , at 35 days .
After two weeks in storage , red blood cells start to undergo changes which lead to the release of chemicals called " cytokines " .
These are known to hinder immune function , and in high levels could possibly make patients more susceptible to infection .
Researchers looked at the rate of hospital infections in 422 patients against the age of the blood transfusion they received .
They found that the average age of the blood was 26 days , and 70 percent of patients had received blood older than 21 days .
Blood shortage fears
In total , 57 patients developed an infection - and these patients had received older blood than the others - on average it had been stored for three and a half days longer .
Patients who had received blood older than 28 days were twice as likely to develop an infection , and the more units of blood given , the higher was the chance of infection .
Dr David Gerber , who led the research , and presented the results at the American College of Chest Physicians conference in Philadelphia , said that any change to the time limit could lead to a blood shortage .
" More cautious utilisation of blood might help to alleviate , at in least part , a diminished blood supply that might result from such a change in policy . " about A spokesman for the National Blood Service said that UK hospitals were not as reliant on using older blood stocks .
" The shelf life of blood in the UK is shorter than in the US . "
She said that the average age of blood arriving at hospitals was just over 10 days , and daily deliveries meant that hospitals were less inclined to stockpile blood .
She said : " We continue to work hard with hospitals to improve blood stocks management and ensure a safe , sufficient supply of blood to meet patients ' needs . "

BUCHAREST ( Reuters ) - U.S. President George W. Bush sought to salvage his legacy on the world stage on Wednesday by defending the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and appealing to Russia to drop opposition to a missile defense shield .
Laying out his agenda for his farewell NATO summit , Bush also pressed the defense alliance to put Ukraine and Georgia on the path to membership despite French and German qualms that it could further strain Moscow ’s relations with the West .
Bush ’s keynote speech at a pre-summit conference in Bucharest read like a laundry list of his foreign policy woes as he struggles to stay relevant abroad in the twilight of his second and final term .
But with Bush even more unpopular overseas than at home , he could have a hard time swaying world leaders as they look to whomever will succeed him as president in January 2009 .
Bush is aware that NATO allies have grown weary of the war in Afghanistan against a resurgent Taliban and its al Qaeda allies but called on partners to send more troops there , saying they could not afford to lose the battle .
“ Our alliance must maintain its resolve and finish the fight , ” Bush said .
The issue of troop levels in Afghanistan , where some NATO allies have shied away from areas of heavy combat , has brought trans -Atlantic finger - pointing and was expected to remain a source of tension at the NATO summit starting on Wednesday .
European critics accuse Bush of being distracted by the Iraq war , which cemented his go - it - alone image .
With Iraq expected to define Bush ’s presidential legacy , he kept up his defense of the five - year - old war , which has damaged credibility with friends and foes alike .
Bush said a U.S. troop buildup in Iraq had yielded significant security progress .
“ There ’s tough fighting ahead , but the gains from the ‘ surge ’ we have seen are real , ” he said .
But the latest increase in fighting has increased doubts of further drawdowns of U.S. forces before Bush leaves office .
APPEAL TO PUTIN
With U.S. - Russia relations deemed to have sunk to a post - Cold War low , Bush also appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to embrace the U.S. plan for a missile defense system partly based in Poland and the Czech Republic .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
Putin , who will be a guest at the Bucharest summit , has fiercely criticized Washington ’s plan , seeing it as an encroachment on the former Soviet sphere of influence .
Bush again said the missile shield was not aimed at Moscow but was meant to deter missile threats from countries such as Iran that Washington considers dangerous .
“ The Cold War is over .
Russia is not our enemy , ” he said .

After the summit , Bush goes to Russia for final talks with Putin in the Black Sea resort of Sochi .
Putin steps down in May .
Bush , roundly mocked by critics as naive for saying he had peered into Putin ’s soul and liked what he saw when they first met in 2001 , said the meeting would be the leaders ’ last chance for a “ heart - to - heart . ”
They will try to repair relations strained over missile defense , Kosovo ’s independence and NATO expansion .
Diplomats have sketched a possible trade - off , in which Moscow would accept U.S. plans to deploy its missile shield and Washington would accept a delay in NATO bids for Georgia and Ukraine , both former Soviet republics .
But Bush has denied any such deal is on the table .
U.S. officials have said the Sochi talks could yield a “ strategic framework ” of U.S. - Russia relations .
But the meeting could also help Bush gauge how much power Putin will wield behind the scenes after Dmitry Medvedev , his protege , takes over as president .
Putin is expected to become prime minister .
Aides say he Bush is now more realistic about Putin , who has become more assertive of Russia ’s place in world affairs and more strident in his criticism of U.S. policies .
Bush will also have talks in Sochi with Medvedev , who won a presidential election last month after being backed by Putin .
“ The president looks forward to meeting with President - elect Medvedev in Sochi , ” White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .

Wonkette just put up this amazing picture :
Apparently , some Christians are on Wall Street , putting their hands on and praying over a large brass bull in the hopes that God will save the world ’s economy and transform the United States from a bull and bear economy to a lion ( of God ) economy .
Do these people actually read the book they ’re supposed to be following ?

The latest CBS News and CNN post debate polls revealed that voters feel Barack Obama won the town hall debate with John McCain .
In the CBS poll , 39 % thought that Obama won the debate , and 35 % thought that the debate was a draw .
Only 27 % thought that McCain won .
The CNN poll gave Obama an even bigger victory by a margin of 54%- 30 % .
Obama gained with voters on the question of which candidate would make the right decisions on the economy .
Before the debate 54 % thought Obama would make the decisions , and that number increased to 68 % after the debate .
On the other side of the coin , John McCain lost ground on this question .
Before the debate , 49 % thought that McCain would make the right decisions on the economy , but after the debate , his numbers dropped to 41 % .
The CNN post debate poll gave Obama the win on the economy by a margin of 59 % - 37 % .
The CNN Poll also found that respondents said that Obama was the stronger leader by a margin of 54 % - 43 % .
Obama was also found to be better able to handle the financial crisis , 57 % - 36 % .
The CBS poll found that uncommitted voters thought that Obama better understood their concerns .
Before the debate Obama led McCain on this question , 60 % - 35 % .
After the debate Obama ’s margin increased to 80 % - 46 % .
The good news for McCain is that he still dominates Obama , 84% - 57 % .

I think that these numbers are partially a reflection of the pre-debate trend towards Obama .
In the CNN poll Obama was found to be more likable than McCain by a margin of 65 % - 28 % .
This number is representative of another of McCain ’s problems , he is n’t very likable .
If this election was being contested in the immediate post - 9/11 political environment , McCain would probably be winning .
However , America is looking for a leader to deal with the problems at home , and this is where Obama shines .
John McCain is in really big trouble .
According to these poll numbers , he did not do anything to stop the slide of his presidential campaign .
If anything , he reaffirmed many of the questions and criticisms that have been growing for a few weeks now .
The polls indicate that that Obama is getting stronger as a candidate , and people are moving towards his message .
McCain now has one presidential debate , and a few weeks of campaigning to turn it around .
If the trend stays at it currently is , McCain might not only lose , but Obama might blow him out .

The next time you are taking money out at the ATM , be wary of anyone lurking nearby with an antenna sticking out of their pants .
They might be stealing your PIN wirelessly .
A pair of Ph.D. students at the Security and Cryptography Laboratory ( LASEC ) of Switzerland 's Ecole publique Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ( EPFL ) , recently demonstrated a number of techniques for listening in on the electromagnetic emanations coming from wired keyboards and interpreting that information into the actual keystrokes pressed .
The two researchers , Martin Vuagnoux and Sylvain Pasini , tested four different versions of this technique on 11 different wired keyboards with PS / 2 and USB connections , as well as with keyboards integrated into laptops .
Using a combination of the four techniques , they were able to successfully " recover keystrokes from compromising electromagnetic emanation [ from ] up to 2 meters [ away ] , " at least in part , if not fully .
With a stronger antenna , they were even able to listen in to keystrokes through a wall from a computer in the next room .
All electronic devices give off electromagnetic radiation .
Those FCC Class A and Class B labels you see on devices in the U.S. tell you that devices have passed certain tests to indicate the electromagnetic radiation they give off do not interfere with certain types of other devices .
For instance , FCC Class B is a rating for residential and small office use that indicates that the rated device will not interfere with the over - the - air broadcast transmissions for radios and TVs .
This is not to say , however , that these devices are perfectly shielded .
Unless a manufacturer designs a device specifically to be used in a high - security area , such as in a military installation , chances are some " unintentional radiation " ( in the form of radio waves ) are bound to leak out of a device .
This means that not just the wired keyboards are leaking radio waves -- so are all the various components and peripherals that make up a computer system .
This can make for a very " noisy " environment .
The researchers set up an antenna that captured a wide range of the relevant electromagnetic spectrum .
The antenna then sent these signals to a combination of hardware and software that analyzed the spectrum and was able to sniff out and detect the keystrokes from the cacophony of radio noise .
The researchers stated : " We conclude that wired computer keyboards sold in the stores generate compromising emanations ( mainly because of the cost pressures in the design ) .
Hence they are not safe to transmit sensitive information .
No doubt that our attacks can be significantly improved , since we used relatively inexpensive equipments .
" Which means that not only is this relatively easy and inexpensive to do ( as long as you know what you are doing ) , but who 's to say that there are n't people or organizations out there now who are n't already doing this ?
Who needs a keylogger when you can steal passwords from the next room ?
A U.S. study says women who have more than five alcoholic drinks at one sitting are at increased risk of having unsafe sex and contracting sexually transmitted diseases .
Researchers at John Hopkins University medical school in Baltimore looked at the correlation between binge drinking and risky sexual behaviours in women .
They interviewed patients at an urban clinic for sexually transmitted infections to explore the link .
In their study , which will be published in the November issue of the journal Alcoholism : Clinical and Experimental Research , the researchers found that women who binge drink are at increased risk of practising unsafe sex , including having multiple partners and engaging in anal sex , leading to high rates of gonorrhea .
" The link between binge drinking and risky sexual behaviour is complex , " said Heidi Hutton , assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the medical school and an author of the study .
" We wanted to examine one component of that relationship , whether binge drinking increased the risk of engaging in sexual behaviours and having STDs .
We found ... that binge drinking increased STD risk for women . "
Binge drinking was defined as having more than five drinks at one time .
Not surprising
Geetanjali Chander , assistant professor of medicine in the general internal medicine division at the school , said the results are not entirely surprising .
" Binge drinking results in a decreased ability to make clear decisions and can enable individuals to engage in behaviours that they would not if sober , " she said .
" Initially , some individuals may drink with the expectation of decreasing inhibitions , or some may drink because they are anxious or depressed , and they expect alcohol to alleviate their symptoms .
Regardless of why they choose to drink , many people do not perceive the potential risk or harm that may result from binge drinking . "
The researchers asked 795 patients who were being evaluated or treated at the urban clinic for sexually transmitted infections whether they would be interested in being interviewed .
Of that number , 671 agreed to answer questions about their recent alcohol and drug use and risky sexual behaviours .
The respondents included 322 men and 349 women , though the research focused on the women .
Ninety - five per cent of the respondents were African - American .
Their answers were analyzed to examine the link between binge drinking , sexual behaviours and sexually transmitted infections .
The researchers also took into consideration the age , employment and drug use of the respondents .
Hutton said the results are worthy of further study and she recommends that staff at STD clinics routinely screen for binge drinking .
" While it is standard practice in most STD clinics to discuss behavioural factors for STD risk , binge drinkers may be harder to identify than alcohol - dependent individuals because the latter have more obvious impairment of function . "
Peter Schiff argues it 's Not Your Father 's Deflation .
Among those rational enough to perceive the looming economic downturn , a heated debate has arisen that centers on whether the slowdown will be accompanied by inflation or deflation .
Those in the deflation camp believe that money supply will collapse as a natural consequence of the implosion of the biggest credit bubble in U.S. history .
As loans go bad , assets , which collateralize these loans , will be sold at fire sale prices to satisfy creditors .
It is also argued that a recession will reduce consumer discretionary spending , causing retailers to slash prices to move their bloated inventories .
This is the way the situation played out in the 1930's and this is how many expect it to happen today .
There are several key differences between then and now , which argue against the classic deflationary scenario .
In particular , the Fed 's ability to pump liquidity into the market in the 1930's was limited by the gold backing requirements on U.S. currency .
No such limitations exist today .
This distinction is critical .
When credit was destroyed after the Crash of 1929 , the Fed was not able to simply replace it out of thin air .
Today however , the Fed will likely print as much money as necessary to prevent nominal prices from collapsing .
In fact , in the infamous speech that spawned his " helicopter " sobriquet , Ben Bernanke explained how the printing press can be used to stop deflation dead in its tracks .
To fully understand the way inflation and deflation affect prices , we need to differentiate between assets , such as stocks and real estate , and consumer goods , such as shoes and potato chips .
If we measure prices in gold , as we did during the 1930's , both asset and consumer goods prices will fall , with the former falling faster than the latter .
So in that sense the deflationist are correct .
However , in terms of today 's paper dollars , this outcome is completely impossible .
During deflation , money gains value , so prices naturally fall as fewer monetary units are required to buy a given quantity of goods .
In the coming deflation , real money ( gold ) will gain considerable value , so prices will therefore fall sharply in gold terms .
Paper dollars however , which have no intrinsic value at all , will lose value , not only as the Fed increases their supply , but as global demand for the currency implodes .
The way I see it there are only two possible scenarios .
The more benign outcome would we be one where asset prices fall , even in terms of paper dollars , but consumer goods prices continue to rise .
This would be the stagflation scenario .
The more catastrophic scenario is one where asset prices hold steady or even resume their ascent , while consumer goods prices rise even faster .
This of course is the hyper- inflation scenario , and is the worst possible outcome .
I see no possible scenario where consumer goods prices fall in term of paper dollars .
Banks are unwilling to lend
Consumers and businesses are unwilling to borrow
Consumers stop buying goods they cannot afford
The Fed attempts to print but rising interest rates put an end to it
Global wage arbitrage
Jobs
Many mistakenly believe that when the U.S. economy falls into recession , reduced domestic demand will lead to falling consumer prices .
However , what is often overlooked is the fact that as the dollar loses value , the rising relative values of foreign currencies will increase consumer demand abroad .
As fewer foreign - made products are imported and more domestic - made products are exported , the result will be far fewer products available for Americans to consume .
So even if the domestic money supply were to contract , the supply of goods for sale would contract even faster .
Shrinking supply will be a major factor in pushing consumer prices higher in America .
In addition , since trillions of dollars now reside with our foreign creditors , even if many of these dollars are lost due to defaulted loans , those that are not will be used to buy up American consumer goods and assets .
As a result of this huge influx of foreign - held dollars , the domestic dollar supply will likely rise even if the Fed were to allow the global supply of dollars to contract , forcing consumer prices even higher .
In fact , a contraction in the domestic supply of consumer goods will likely coincide with an expansion of the domestic supply of money .
The result will be much higher consumer prices despite the recession .
So even though Americans will consume much less , they will pay much more for the privilege .
The real risk of course is that the Fed gets more aggressive as it realizes that the additional credit it is supplying is not flowing where it wants .
If the Fed drops enough money from helicopters it will eventually reverse the nominal declines in asset prices .
Unfortunately , that road leads to hyper- inflation and disaster .
No matter what , even if the Fed succeeds in propping up nominal asset prices , they can do nothing to sustain their real values .
Consumer goods prices will always rise faster , leaving the owners of those assets poorer no matter how high their nominal values climb .
Things ignored by Schiff
The Fed is a private business unable to give away money
The Fed would not give away money even if it could .
Ultimately it would destroy their own wealth and power .
The Fed can provide liquidity ( loans ) but not capital ( money ) .
However , liquidity is a coward in the face of rising defaults .
The Fed can encourage but not force banks to lend or consumers of businesses to borrow .
The Fed can at most control either interest rates or monetary printing .
A massive printing campaign that actually found its way into the market would cause interest rates to rise , further putting deflationary pressures on both residential and commercial real estate .
There is rampant overcapacity in housing , commercial real estate , and autos , so there is no reason for businesses to expand .
Global wage arbitrage is an enormously deflationary force .
The Fed can not create jobs or force wages higher .
Even if the Fed found some back ended way to give money to banks , and they actually carried that plan out ( both are doubtful ) it would not help cash strapped consumers pay back loans .
Is the Fed a Private Institution ?
The Federal Reserve System is not " owned " by anyone and is not a private , profit - making institution .
Instead , it is an independent entity within the government , having both public purposes and private aspects .

Whenever I hear the government throw around dollar amounts like they are playing a game of Monopoly , I can't help but think of the movie ' Austin Powers . '
The scene where he threatens to blow up the world unless he is paid $ 1 million and his assistant Number 2 leans over and tells him that a million dollars is not a lot of money anymore .
He then changes his demand to $ 100 billion .
Of course , what makes this scene is the camera coming in for the close - up and his finger at the corner of his mouth illustrating just how much money this really is .
I can't help but laugh when I see the government using the same reckless method to ' save ' the financial markets .
Every time there is a crisis , Bush or one of his cronies can be counted on to come up with some exorbitant amount of money to ' fix ' the problem .
I keep waiting to see one of them raise a finger towards their mouth as the camera pans in for a close - up .
The only problem is unlike Austin Powers , this is not a movie and it's not funny .
With a price tag that would make even Dr. Evil envious , the Bush administration announced its plan to bail out the financial firms .
The plan is to buy the bad debt that these firms are holding .
What 's the price ?
Over $ 500 billion ( finger to mouth as camera zooms in ) .
Of course , this money does n't really exist , but then again neither does any of the money they so frivolously throw around .
This is also on top of the billions and billions ( finger to mouth camera zooms in ) of fake Federal Reserve Notes they have already put into the markets lately to falsely prop them up .
I keep wondering when the rest of the world is going to wise up to the Ponzi scheme the United States is operating .
Maybe it 's because these other countries are too busy trying to keep their own Ponzi scheme into play that they are missing the shell game being played by our own shysters .
Oh yes , this house of cards will finally come crashing down and very soon .
I do n't think there will be any amount of fake currency that will save us , either . . . no matter how many fingers they raise to their lying lips .
My question is , if it 's so easy to just create this kind of ' money ' out of thin air , why only half a trillion ?
Hell , let 's fire up those printing presses !
I say we should make it $ 100 trillion dollars ( my finger raised to the corner of my mouth ) and let 's not stop there .
Let 's give every person in this country let 's say . . . oh , I do n't know . . . $ 1 million ( once again finger to mouth ) ; that should really fix things !
The problem with this kind of thinking is it wo n't work .
All that will happen is the problem will get much worse , inflating our already devalued dollar .
The government knows this yet still has no problem creating more ' wealth ' out of nothing .
You can not make something out of nothing ; it does n't work that way .
This is nothing more than a scheme , one that would land the average broker on Wall Street in prison , but the government gets away with it every day !
The United States government is the number one counterfeiter in the world , the number one Ponzi scheme operator and the number one enemy of the free market system .
Do n't expect to see any of these criminals on the evening news ; it is n't going to happen .
The only thing you can expect to see on the news is the next crony announcing the next answer to a problem created by the very system that is going to ' fix ' it .
How will they ' fix ' it ?
Well of course they will offer $ _____________________
( fill in the blank and be sure to place your small finger at the corner of your mouth ) .
Well all is not lost ; I played the lottery Saturday night . . . maybe I will get lucky and win $ 43 million dollars ( my finger raised to the corner of my mouth ) .

While working on a web application , one of my team presented some weird behaviour on ASP.
NET
FIrst observation : Session times out randomly while working on the application .
So we started observing the application closely to see what might be causing this .
We came out with some more observations :
Detailed observation : Session times out when any of the user participates in certain scenario .
Also , not only the specific session expires , but all the use sessions are expired .
Further study shown that actually the app domain itself recycles .
We studied the activities in these specific scenario .
We found that a certain implementation use to create folder , put some temporrary files inside it and once done , the folder and the files were deleted .
The application recycles whenever the folder is deleted .
The technical reason : ASP.NET runs a File Monitor ( FCN ) that observes any change to the structure of the Virtual Directory .
In case of any change the application is recycled .
Some forums said that tghe app_data folder within the application folder is immune to the condition .
But upon testing , we found it otherwise .
Analysis : Lots of analysis :
Also we were observing session expiration initially .
All session expires on application recycle unless the state is not in - process .
So moving state in - proc to out - proc is a solution .
We found some other approaches as well .
Resolution :
There are multiple solutions that can be taken up for this :
Compiled Solutions / workarounds so for
Sol 1 : Use out of process session state .
Sol 2 : Use Directory Junction between seperate Web folder and content folders .
A directory Junction is a pointer to an external folder ( outside the application folder / sub folder .
See http://blogs.msdn.com/toddca/archive/2005/12/01/499144.aspx for more details
Sol 3 : Disable FCNotifications in ASP .
NET2.0 by adding DWORD FCNMode =1 under HKLM \Software \Microsoft\ASP.NET
key
Registry information
loadTOCNode ( 3 , ' resolution ' ) ;
To enable this hotfix , you must add the following DWORD value at the following registry key :
HKLM \Software \Microsoft\ASP.NET\FCNMode
The following table lists possible values for the FCNMode DWORD value and the behavior that is associated with each value .
Value Behavior
Does not exist
This is the default behavior .
For each subdirectory , the application will create an object that will monitor the subdirectory .
0 or greater than 2
This is the default behavior .
For each subdirectory , the application will create an object that will monitor the subdirectory .
1 The application will disable File Change Notifications ( FCNs ) .
Smile
2 The application will create one object to monitor the main directory .
The application will use this object to monitor each subdirectory .
More info at : http://support.microsoft.com/kb/911272/en-us
Sol 4 : Do not delete any folder .
Most of the time solution 4 seems to be easy way out till MS releases fix for this problem .
So we are following solution no 4 for the time being .

[ The following is an exact transcript of this podcast . ]
In 1953 a student named Stanley Miller did an experiment showing that the simple chemicals present on the early Earth could give rise to the basic building blocks of life .
Miller filled a flask with water , methane , hydrogen and ammonia — the main ingredients in the primordial soup .
Then he zapped the brew with electricity to simulate lightning , and , voila , he created amino acids , crucial for life .
Now , scientists have reanalyzed this classic experiment , and found that the results were even more remarkable than Miller had realized .
Jeffrey Bada , a former student of Miller ’s , preserved the chemicals that were produced by those original sparks .
And he analyzed the samples using equipment that was n’t available in the ‘ 50s .
He discovered an even greater variety of organic materials than Miller originally reported .
For example , Bada ’s team identified 22 amino acids where Miller only saw 11 , results that appear in the October 17th issue of Science .
They also found that Miller did n’t even report his best results , which came from a flask that was bathed in some steamy volcanolike vapors .
That setup produced an even richer mix of amino acids .
I guess Miller felt that he ’d proved his point without needing any data that were primordially souped up .

Who here in my generation does n't remember the Super Mario brothers ?
Ah yes , the square controllers , the thumb blisters , that annoying music that played endlessly in your head every night when you were trying to sleep ... Well , two people with those fond memories grew up , found each other , and decided to get married .
Then they commissioned this wedding cake : Gorgeous , no ?
But the real beauty is in the details ; check this out :
That - colored ring is the Rainbow Road ( I believe from Mario Kart ) , and it 's made of hard sugar candy , like a lollipop .
Look how adorable :
And just crazy detailing : the tiny bananas in the road !!
I love them !
This masterpiece was created by Beth over at Let Them Eat Cake , and the photos were originally uploaded here Interestingly enough , the other Mario - themed wedding cake I was going to feature anyway is the one this couple reference as their own inspiration cake - small world !
Here it is :
Too cute , and also with beautifully done details .
It was created by Robin at Gateaux Inc , and the photo was originally uploaded here
The current crisis demonstrates more than almost anything in recent memory what I call " Horwitz 's First Law of Political Economy " : namely that " no one hates capitalism more than capitalists . "
Aside from the fact , much discussed here , that the crisis itself was largely brought on by easy money policies and government interventions supported by and benefiting capitalists even as they were undermining capitalism as a system and the well - being of the citizenry , the debate over the bailouts also illustrates the principle quite well .
" The Market " ( which , as Heyne , Boettke , and Prychitko note , is a particularly bad metaphor for millions of individual decisions ) rallied late last week as the bailout plan was conceived and publicized .
Today , as the plan has got some pushback ( though not always for the right reasons ) , " The Market " has taken another dive .
The explanation , I think , is that capitalists prefer the stability and predictability of the known over anything unknown , especially when it promises to socialize their losses on the rest of us .
Capitalists have long despised the uncertainty and unpredictability of a truly free market and have frequently succeeded at using the state to reduce that uncertainty ( see also Gabriel Kolko and other historians of the Progressive Era ) .
Of course this has benefited them , but it has harmed the economy and the citizenry in the process .
One of the things market capitalism does best is enable us to peer through the fog of uncertainty that surrounds human action .
Prices provide signals for capitalists to interpret to try to provide the goods and services people will want in the future .
Profits tell them they 've done well at it , losses tell them they have n't .
The competitive process is how we learn what it is people want and how best to produce it - and who is best at doing so .
Competition is , in Hayek 's words , a " discovery procedure . "
Competition sucks if you 're one of the competitors .
It makes you have to constantly be on your toes , watching for new entrants , new innovations , and changes in the relevant variables .
How much easier life would be in a more stable and predictable world where capitalists did n't have to serve the fickle consumer !
If we cut short this discovery process , and especially the mechanism of profit and loss , the benefits to the capitalists will not come from behaving in ways that benefit the rest of us .
This is precisely why those of us concerned with preserving whatever bits of capitalism we have left should be largely ignoring " The Market 's " response to the various bailout plans .
What 's good for GM or the financial sector is not necessarily what 's good for America .
In fact what 's good for America , might be very , very bad for the financial sector .
The desire for stability and predictability has been the calling card of dirigisme regimes since the dawn of capitalism , whether they called themselves " socialist " , " fascist " , or just plain " interventionist . "
It is but a thinly disguised power grab by those who own the means of production , and who will profit at our expense , rather than profiting by serving us better .
" Stability " is a siren song that we must do our best to ignore , lest we enable them to make an even bigger mess than they already have .

“ The Burmese people are used to getting nothing , ” said Shari Villarosa , the highest - ranking United States diplomat in Myanmar , formerly Burma .
“ I ’m not getting the sense that there have been a lot of deaths as a result of the delay . ”
The United States has accused the military government of “ criminal neglect ” in its handling of the disaster caused by the cyclone .
Privately , many aid workers have , too .
The junta , widely disliked among Myanmar ’s citizens , did not have the means to lead a sustained relief campaign , they say .
But relief workers say the debate over access for foreigners and the refusal of the government to allow in military helicopters and ships from the United States , France and Britain overshadowed a substantial relief operation carried out mainly by Burmese citizens and monks .
They organized convoys of trucks filled with drinking water , clothing , food and construction materials that poured into the delta .
“ It ’s been overwhelmingly impressive what local organizations , medical groups and some businessmen have done , ” said Ruth Bradley Jones , second secretary in the British Embassy in Yangon , Myanmar ’s largest city .
“ They are the true heroes of the relief effort . ”
Aid workers emphasize that of the estimated 2.4 million Burmese strongly affected by the storm , thousands remain vulnerable to sickness and many are still without adequate food , shelter and supplies .
But their ailments are  for now  minor .
Medical logs from Doctors Without Borders show that of the 30,000 people the group ’s workers treated in the six weeks after the cyclone , most had flesh wounds , diarrhea or respiratory infections .
The latter two afflictions are common in rural Southeast Asia even in normal times .
Diarrhea can be especially dangerous for infants and young children , but doctors say that , while they have treated thousands of cases , the illness has not reached critical levels .
For reasons unknown to anyone alive , The Hills star Heidi Montag has been selected to perform during the 2009 Miss Universe Pageant telecast next month .
Talk about hitting a low note in the history of pageants and music .
The god -awful " singer " will belt out " Turn Ya Head " off her upcoming debut record , Unleashed , during the August 23 broadcast .
Across America and the world , remote control MUTE buttons will be punished with unprecedented force .
Access Hollywood reports that Celebrity Apprentice star Claudia Jordan , Flo Rida , Kelly Rowland and DJ David Guetta also will take the stage that night .
But the true star of the evening will be horsey - face herself ...
Despite the new Miss Universe gig , it would be the understatement of the year to say that Mrs. Spencer Pratt 's singing has n't been embraced by the public .
Shortly after debuting her first single and video , " Higher , " in 2008 , online critics slammed her on the web .
At least the ones that were n't doubled over laughing .
" Excuse me while I go vomit , " " WTF is she serious , " " LOL WUTTTT " and " give me a f**king break " were among the responses by The Hollywood Gossip readers .
Montag said , " I cried myself to sleep that first night after my video came out .
I am just a 21 - year - old from a small town in Colorado trying to follow her dreams . "
With the fake boobs , nose and lips to prove it , too .
She has n't been deterred by fan reaction , or by having no talent whatsoever , as she 's subsequently dropped the singles " No More , " " Overdosin ' " and " Black Out . "
They all sound similar and are equally terrible .

The car had been left by Avon and Somerset Police officers with a covert camera concealed inside , which took pictures of Evans .
Evans , an illiterate man of no fixed address , was sentenced to seven months .
Supt Ian Wylie said : " Criminals wo n't be tolerated in Bristol and we will keep catching them and bringing them before the courts .
" We get such excellent images from these cameras that there is often , and never more so than in this case , no doubt who the criminal is . "

One day this past summer , I logged on to Facebook and realized that I was very close to having 700 online “ friends . ”
Not bad , I thought to myself , absurdly proud of how many cyberpals , connections , acquaintances and even strangers I ’d managed to sign up .
But the number made me uneasy as well .
I had just fallen out with a friend I ’d spent a lot of time with .
I ’d disconnected with a few other ones for the usual reasons  jobs in other cities , family life limiting social time .
I was as much to blame as they were .
I had a 2 - year - old kid of my own at home .
Add to that my workaholic irritability , my love of being left alone and my lack of an office environment or mysterious association with the Masons from which to derive an instant network of cronies .
I had fewer friends to hang out with than I ’d ever had before .
So I decided to have a Facebook party .
I used Facebook to create an “ event ” and invite my digital chums .
Some of them , of course , did n’t live in Toronto , but I figured , it ’s summer and people travel .
You never know who might be in town .
If they lived in Buffalo or Vancouver , they could just click “ not attending , ” and that would be that .
Facebook gives people the option of R.S.V.P. ’ing in three categories  “ attending , ” “ maybe attending ” and “ not attending . ”
After a week the responses stopped coming in and were ready to be tabulated .
Fifteen people said they were attending , and 60 said maybe .
A few hundred said not , and the rest just ignored the invitation altogether .
I figured that about 20 people would show up .
That sounded pretty good to me .
Twenty potential new friends .
acts_as_audited gains parent record tracking 24 September 2008
As part of our current line of improvements on PowerDNS on Rails , we needed to start auditing changes made through the interface to the DNS data .
This is a logical step to opening the system up for more API based interaction , and implementing neat features like macros and temporary authentication tokens .
Auditing in Rails is not for the faint hearted .
The Rails Recipes book has an example on how to do this with sweepers , and using the new ActiveRecord dirty object tracking can help ease the problem too .
So after some investigation I found the brilliant acts_as_audited plugin by Brendon Keepers .
After playing with it , I realised one short coming .
This is very much a problem specifically for PowerDNS on Rails , but after some thought I realized it could be applied to other auditing challenges as well .
Enter parent record tracking
I forked the original project on github , and started hacking .
Not too long after I came up with this :
class Author < ActiveRecord ::
Base has_many : books end class Book < ActiveRecord :: Base belongs_to :author acts_as_audited : parent => : author end
Using the sweepers is also possible , like this :
class Application < ApplicationController :: Base audit Author , Book , : parents => { Book => : author } end
As contrived as it can be , it allows us to track all the changes to books by a specific author .
In the DNS world this allows us to easily access all changes made to the records of a particular domain , and it becomes very valuable .
It becomes even more valuable when you need to start tracking deleted records .
Pull requests were sent to the network , hopefully they get accepted and I can remove my repo again .
Looking forward ?
This was a relatively small step forward for the plugin , but opens a lot of possiblities for the host applications , like PowerDNS on Rails .
In any ISP environment audits are extremely important , especially when clients start gaining limited access to the backend systems …

With the new season of The Office kicking off tomorrow night on NBC , we thought we ’d put together our own “ Sports Office ” , using the original characters as inspiration .
Jim — Chris Cooley
The coolest guy in the office meets perhaps the coolest guy in sports .
Both are pranksters and love having fun at work .
Pam — Mrs. Chris Cooley
Of course Jim has to get the hottest girl , in this case a former cheerleader , unlike Pam .
Michael — Al Davis
Has kind of lost it , but still thinks that he knows what he is doing .
Has a semi-irrational hatred of Lane Kiffin .
Toby — Lane Kiffin
Has a tough job in a tough company , and has to deal with a crazy boss who hates his guts .
Both are leaving their present jobs , although I ’m not sure if Kiffin has plans to go to Costa Rica .
Dwight — Shaquille O’Neal
They both think that they are cops , as well as talking way too much .
Both get the job done pretty well though , Shaq on the court , Dwight in sales .
Creed — Julio Franco
Dude is like 56 years old or something .
Angela — Ashley Harkleroad
Seems like a prude , but if you wait a while , you see things like appearances in Playboy or making out with an ex-boyfriend after you just got engaged .
Meredith — Adam Jones
He likes to drink , she likes to drink .
He likes drive recklessly , she likes to get by cars .
He likes strippers , she likes to strip .
Close enough for us .
Ryan — Martina Hingis
Prodigy at a young age .
Went further than anyone thought .
Struggled after some time at the top .
Coke problem .
Well , we got you started , finish out the list and come up with your best sports figures for Darryl , Phyllis , Jan , Kelly , Oscar , and anyone else we missed .

Forty years ago , Richard Nixon made a remarkable marketing discovery .
By exploiting America ’s divisions  divisions over Vietnam , divisions over cultural change and , above all , racial divisions  he was able to reinvent the Republican brand .
The party of plutocrats was repackaged as the party of the “ silent majority , ” the regular guys  white guys , it went without saying  who did n’t like the social changes taking place .
It was a winning formula .
And the great thing was that the new packaging did n’t require any change in the product ’s actual contents  in fact , the G.O.P. was able to keep winning elections even as its actual policies became more pro-plutocrat , and less favorable to working Americans , than ever .
John McCain ’s strategy , in this final stretch , is based on the belief that the old formula still has life in it .
Thus we have Sarah Palin expressing her joy at visiting the “ pro-America ” parts of the country  yep , we ’re all traitors here in central New Jersey .
Meanwhile we ’ve got Mr. McCain making Samuel J. Wurzelbacher , a k a Joe the Plumber  who had confronted Barack Obama on the campaign trail , alleging that the Democratic candidate would raise his taxes  the centerpiece of his attack on Mr. Obama ’s economic proposals .
This is the fourth of a series of articles about my experience learning Pinax .
In the previous articles I created a new option in the menu for a paste bin application and linked it to a very basic view .
My next step is to create a form for pasting text .
I plan to do that using a form based on a model object .
So the first thing I did was to write that model .
$ gedit apps / oxybeles/models.py
from django.contrib.auth.models import User from django.db import models from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ from uuid import uuid4 class PastedItem ( models .
Model ) : " " " An item that was pasted . " " " uuid = models .
CharField ( _( ' identifier ' ) , max_length=36 , unique= True ) text = models .
Text Field ( _( ' text ' ) ) in_response_to = models .ForeignKey ( 'self ' , related_name= 'responses ' , blank =True , null = True , verbose_name=_ ( ' in response to ' ) ) user = models .
ForeignKey ( User , related_name= " pasted_items " , verbose_name=_ ( 'user ' ) ) pasted_at = models .
DateTimeField ( _( ' pasted at ' ) , auto_now_add=True ) def __unicode__( self ) : return self. uuid def save ( self ) : if not self.uuid : self.uuid = str( uuid4 ( ) ) # random so it can't be easily guessed super ( PastedItem , self ) .
save ( )
The uuid will be used later to refer to an object in a URL .
It will be a random unique identifier .
The text field is what the user pasted , and is the main content of this object .
I plan to allow responses to pasted items , so that two users can share different versions of the same text .
The in_response_to field will be used for that .
Since now the application has a model object , I must tell Django about it :
$ gedit settings.py
Insert the application name inside the INSTALLED_APPS list :
INSTALLED_APPS = ( ... ' oxybeles ' , ... )
Then I was ready to review if the table would be created correctly :
$ python manage .py sqlall oxybeles
BEGIN ; CREATE TABLE " oxybeles_pasteditem " ( " id " integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY , " uuid " varchar ( 36 ) NOT NULL UNIQUE , " text " text NOT NULL , " in_response_to_id " integer NULL , " user_id " integer NOT NULL REFERENCES " auth_user " ( " id " ) , " pasted_at " datetime NOT NULL ) ; CREATE INDEX " oxybeles_pasteditem_in_response_to_id " ON " oxybeles_pasteditem " ( " in_response_to_id " ) ; CREATE INDEX " oxybeles_pasteditem_user_id " ON " oxybeles_pasteditem " ( " user_id " ) ; COMMIT ;
Finally , I updated the database structure :
$ python manage .py syncdb
To test this model , I defined an administrative interface :
$ gedit apps / oxybeles / admin.py
from django.contrib import admin from oxybeles.models import PastedItem class PastedItemAdmin( admin.ModelAdmin ) : list_display = ( ' uuid ' , ' user ' , ' pasted_at ' , ) fields = ( ' text ' , ' in_response_to ' , ' user ' , ) admin.site.register( PastedItem , PastedItemAdmin )
Starting the server again and browsing to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/oxybeles/pasteditem/,
I was able to create a few pasted items to verify that all is working :
In the next step I will create the user interface to paste new items and to view stored items .
The source code is hosted on GitHub .

Ruby has blocks , which enable all sorts of interesting idioms .
I 'm going to show one that will be familiar to Rails enthusiasts , but was new to me .
I was reading some code in a book , and it had the following :
Here 's how you call it :
The code in the block will only execute if the obj was found .
If it was n't found , the response will already have been taken care of .
I 've been in the same situation in Python ( using Pylons ) , and I coded something like :
Here 's how you call it : Pylons likes to return responses , whereas render in Ruby works as a side effect whose return value is n't important .
However , that 's not my point .
My point is that the Python code uses " if response : " whereas the Ruby code uses " if_found ( obj ) do " .
Python uses an explicit if statement , whereas Ruby hides the actual if statement in a block .
Similarly , Rubyists tend to write " my_list.each do |i| ... " ( even though Ruby has a for statement ) , whereas Pythonistas use " for i in my_list " .
Ok , now that I 've totally made a mountain out of a molehill , please note that I 'm not saying either is better than the other .
I 'm just saying it 's interesting to note the difference .
Criticizing Sarah Palin is truly shooting fish in a barrel .
But given the huge attention she is getting , you ca n’t just ignore what she has to say .
And there was one thing she said in the debate with Joe Biden that really sticks in my craw .
It was when she turned to Biden and declared : “ You said recently that higher taxes or asking for higher taxes or paying higher taxes is patriotic .
In the middle class of America , which is where Todd and I have been all of our lives , that ’s not patriotic . ”
What an awful statement .
Palin defended the government ’s $ 700 billion rescue plan .
She defended the surge in Iraq , where her own son is now serving .
She defended sending more troops to Afghanistan .
And yet , at the same time , she declared that Americans who pay their fair share of taxes to support all those government - led endeavors should not be considered patriotic .
I only wish she had been asked : “ Governor Palin , if paying taxes is not considered patriotic in your neighborhood , who is going to pay for the body armor that will protect your son in Iraq ?
Who is going to pay for the bailout you endorsed ?
If it is n’t from tax revenues , there are only two ways to pay for those big projects  printing more money or borrowing more money .
Do you think borrowing money from China is more patriotic than raising it in taxes from Americans ? ”
That is not putting America first .
That is selling America first .
Sorry , I grew up in a very middle - class family in a very middle - class suburb of Minneapolis , and my parents taught me that paying taxes , while certainly no fun , was how we paid for the police and the Army , our public universities and local schools , scientific research and Medicare for the elderly .
No one said it better than Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes : “ I like paying taxes .
With them I buy civilization . ”

Planet Google ( Book )
A new book by Randall Stross is out ; it ’s called “ Planet Google ” and covers Google ’s beginnings but also their latest actions and troubles .
It ’s a very good , highly readable , well - researched and up - to - date introduction to the subject and will also offer bits and pieces of interest to those following Google more closely for longer .
Randall both talked to Google employees and was there at one of Google ’s Thank - God - It ’s - Friday meetings ( where employees can ask questions ) , but he also apparently had his ears close to the web to write the book .
For instance , you ’ll find blog sources and Friendfeed comments among the material .
This book broadly falls into the category of company biographies , like The Search by John Battelle or The Google Story by David Vise .
Because Planet Google is so new , even more recent topics like Knol or OpenSocial are covered .
( Google Chrome did n’t make it into the book , though . )
The book also does a good job at avoiding to oversimplify certain patterns we can see with Google ; for instance , the first chapter is called “ Open and Closed , ” describing both the ways Google opens up to the world – like via open source projects – but also the different ways in which they remain closed and non-transparent .
Here are some of the noteworthy bits from the book ( with my emphasis ) :
« Google has been determined to “ organize the world ’s information and make it universally accessible and useful ” since June 1999 ...
Until then , Google had used a modest statement of company mission that the founders had hastily put on Google ’s Web site at the time the site was launched : “ To make it easier to find high - quality information on the web . ” »
» « How Google should respond to the social networking phenomenon in general , and to Facebook in particular , was not clear to Google ’s executive troika , but they understood that the question was a pressing one .
...
Google appointed three executives in its applications group ... to organize an internal team ...
The first step was recruiting other members of the team .
This did not require hiring new employees – scattered across different groups within Google were plenty of individuals who were working in one way or another on projects that could conceivably contribute to Google ’s social networking initiative .
...
The initial response was , in many cases , a shrug .
Google may appear , on the outside , to be a monolithic organization that acts with terrifying efficiency ...
On the inside , however , it is a federation of autonomous teams , staffed by feisty individuals who have no compuction about slamming the door on fellow employees and the company ’s top priorities . »

« When Marissa Mayer , employee number 20 , arrived on June 24 , 1999 , for her second day of work at Google , the company had about three hundred computers to handle search requests ...
Google would receive search requests sent to it by its new affiliate , Netscape .
...
Google had wanted to start off with a limited volume of queries from this new source ...
But Netscape forgot or ignored Google ’s wishes and sent Google all of its requests that day .
It was too much : Google.com had to close .
...
That morning , Mayer stopped by the company kitchen and noticed that Larry Page was standing in a corner of the room for no clearly visible purpose .
She asked Page what he was doing .
“ I ’m hiding , ” he replied .
“ The site is down .
It ’s all gone horribly awry . ”
Mayer said that seeing the CEO of the company in such a state led to her estimate that Google had about a 2 percent chance of succeeding . »

« Google hired human evaluators to judge the relative quality of results produces by variations of algorithmic tweaks – in 2007 , Google used ten thousand contractors around the world as “ quality raters . ” »
» « Google reacted to the criticism with an announcement that created more unfavorable publicity for Google Print : in August 2005 , Google said it would suspend scanning of in - copyright books until November , by which time publishers were to have submitted a list of books still in copyright that they did not wish to have Google copy .
... Jack Romanos , who was then the CEO of Simon & Schuster , said , “ There ’s sort of this innocent arrogance about [ Google ] .
One minute they ’re pretending to be all idealistic , talking about how they ’re only in this to expand the world ’s knowledge , and the next they ’re telling you that you ’re going to do it their way or no way at all . ” »
One minute they ’re pretending to be all idealistic , talking about how they ’re only in this to expand the world ’s knowledge , and the next they ’re telling you that you ’re going to do it their way or no way at all . ” »
« Or at the very least , should Google share access to its digital books with other search engines ?
[ Brewster Kahle of the Internet Archive ] said he was told by librarians at several institutions that they would permit their books to be scanned only once and they could not participate in the OCA [ Open Content Alliance ] because they were already working with Google .
“ We want a public library system in the digital age , ” Kahle said , “ but what we are getting is a private library system controlled by a single corporation . ” »
Kahle said , » « [ In May 2005 , YouTube ’s ] Steve Chen said , he had become “ pretty depressed ” because “ Dude , we have like maybe forty , fifty , sixty videos on the site . ” ...
And the quality of what had been posted made him wince – there were few videos he ’d want to watch himself .
...
At this point , they decided to try a desperate measure : they would run an advertisement on Craigslist in the Los Angeles area , inviting “ attractive ” women to upload videos of themselves .
The enticement would be a payment of $ 100 upon submission of every ten videos .
This , too , ended in failure .
The advertisement drew not a single response . »

« Nonetheless , it was Google that was depicted as acting irresonsibly .
One cartoon showed a barber offering a customer not just a mirror but also a PDA to use to examine the just - completed haircut : “ Would you like to see the top on Google Earth ? ” »
» « In looking back , [ Google ’s Brian Rakowski ] marveled at the public ’s focus on the scanning for matching ads [ in Gmail ] , while ignoring much more serious privacy issues , such as the increased risk that e-mail on centralized servers could easily be subpoenaed or personal information in e-mail messages could be shared with advertisers .
“ Nobody was talking about those privacy issues and the few things we were doing to protect users ’ privacy , ” he said . »

Finally .
After a barrage of slanderous and fear - mongering commercials from the Yes on Prop 8 campaign , and somewhat tepid and underwhelming ads from the No on Prop 8 campaign , it is heartening to see positive and effective messaging put forth by these witty videos by Margaret Cho , Molly Ringwald , and friends , in the style of the Mac vs PC ads .
The first video is posted above , the rest , below .
The researchers looked at brain tissue
The brains of people who commit suicide are chemically different to those who die from other causes , a Canadian study has suggested .
Researchers analysed brain tissue from 20 dead people and , in those who killed themselves , they found a higher rate of a process that affects behaviour .
Writing in Biological Psychiatry , they said it appeared environmental factors played a part in the changes .
And they said the discovery opened up a new avenue of research .
This is exciting new evidence that genetic and environmental factors may interact to produce specific and long - lasting modifications in brain circuits
John Krystal , Biological Psychiatry editor
The researchers , from the University of Western Ontario , Carleton University and University of Ottawa , analysed tissue from 10 people who had a serious depressive disorder and had committed suicide and 10 who had died suddenly from other causes , such as a heart attack .
They found that the DNA in the suicide group was being chemically modified by a process normally involved in regulating cell development , called methylation .
It is methylation which shuts down the unwanted genes in a cell - so the necessary genes are expressed to make a cell a skin cell rather than , for example , a heart cell .
The rate of methylation in the suicide brains was almost 10 times that of the other group , and the gene that was being shut down was a chemical message receptor that plays a major role in regulating behaviour .
In the paper , the researchers suggest this reprogramming could contribute to the " protracted and recurrent nature of major depressive disorder " .
Previous research has suggested that changes to the methylation process can be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors called epigenetics .
Modifications ' shape life ' Dr Michael Poulter , who led the research , said : " The whole idea that the genome is so malleable in the brain is surprising , because brain cells do n't divide .
" You get dealt your neurons at the start of life , so the idea that there are still epigenetic mechanisms going on is pretty unusual . "
He said the findings of the study opened up a new avenue of research and potential therapies for depression and suicidal tendencies .
John Krystal , the editor of Biological Psychiatry , said : " This is exciting new evidence that genetic and environmental factors may interact to produce specific and long - lasting modifications in brain circuits .
" Further , these modifications may shape the course of one 's life in extremely important ways , including increasing the risk for major depressive disorder and perhaps suicide . "

Artist Michael Chesko has been lovingly carving a true - to - form model of Midtown Manhattan .
This scale miniature of Midtown took 2000 hours to complete .
As reference , he used blueprints , old photographs , digital reproductions and satellite images .
On a good day , he ’d work his way through four city blocks .
The entire model is 36 ″ x 30 ″ … a good deal smaller than most office desks .
At the 1:3200 scale , the Empire State Building Chesko’s favorite skyscraper ) roughly reaches the dizzying height of a Campbell ’s Soup can .

" It 's nothing .
It 's so marginal . "
Salman Ullah spits the words from his black Aeron in the corner office that serves as the headquarters of Merus Capital .
Sean Dempsey , who cofounded Merus last November with Ullah and another man , Peter Hsing , had just started telling Ullah about a pitch he 'd recently heard .
The pitch had come from a company that is developing a new Web browser , and Ullah made his pronouncement on the basis of that information alone .
It was almost a matter of principle :
On a whiteboard that hangs on a wall of the office , Ullah had a few days ago scrawled a list , with the heading " Avoiding the Graveyard , " of businesses he does not believe Merus should invest in .
Number two on the list was " Freeware , e.g. , browsers . "
" Tell them to go fuck themselves , " Ullah says .
" What value do I get as an end user ?
Why would I install a new browser ? "
" You get two pieces of value , " Dempsey says .
" One is . . . "
I can't write down exactly what Dempsey says now , because that would violate the terms of confidentiality I agreed to in order to attend this meeting .
I can say that as soon as Dempsey finishes describing the browser 's first supposedly distinctive feature , Ullah laughs and says , derisively , " Shades of 1998 . "
As Dempsey starts describing the new browser 's second feature , my eyes drift to the window behind him , with its view of city hall in downtown Palo Alto , California .
Hundreds of multicolored porous plastic panels obscure the building 's original facade , creating a slightly blurry effect , like a newspaper photograph viewed too close .
The new facade only makes sense if you look at it through one of the two telescopes installed at street level , which reveal that each of the hundreds of plastic panels contains almost a hundred small digital photos of houses located in Palo Alto .
All together , the panels contain photographs of every single house in the city .
Like the new browser Dempsey is describing , this art installation , which the city commissioned several years ago , would also have seemed a lot cooler in 1998 .
Today , a pedestrian with an iPhone can stand right where the telescopes are and call up a Google " street view " image of any house within miles of here and then , with a few more clicks , spin the view 360 degrees .
Score another point for Google : Without even knowing it was playing , the company bested a piece of municipal art at its own game .
That 's what Google does :
It makes what came before it look old .
Atlases , variety shows , newspapers , and diaries , to take just a few examples , wither under the diodic glow of Google Earth , Google News , Google 's Blogger , and Google 's YouTube .
Google likes to say that it launches new products " early and often . "
Most fail to hit , but the ones that do hit hard .
Merus Capital , as it happens , is itself a new Google product .
Or , to be more specific , Merus Capital is the product of a new Google phenomenon .
Call it the Google exodus , the Google diaspora , whatever -- in almost any given week , blogs and business sections perk up with news that key figures at Google are leaving .
It happened last October , the day word leaked about Salman Ullah : ANOTHER DAY , ANOTHER KEY GOOGLER DEPARTS , read the headline on VentureBeat .
Ullah and Dempsey , who resigned at the same time , ran Google 's corporate - development group .
This meant they were in charge of buying and assimilating new companies , spending billions on YouTube and DoubleClick , among others .
They also witnessed some of the initial stirrings of restlessness , the trickle of defections and departures that seemed to them a harbinger of the future .
Since the late nineties , when they worked together at the top of Microsoft 's corporate - development office , they 'd considered becoming venture capitalists .
But the timing had never seemed right .
By the middle of 2007 , about three years after having joined Google , the timing seemed urgent .
They became convinced that their departing Google colleagues were going to dream up some truly special projects , and they wanted in .
So , along with Peter Hsing , who had previously worked with them at Microsoft and was currently that company 's managing director of corporate strategy , they abandoned some of the best corporate jobs in the world in order to go into business for themselves .
Merus Capital , both a product of the Google diaspora and an exploiter of it , has become an important node in the increasingly complex web ex-Googlers are weaving around Silicon Valley .
The firm 's first entrepreneur in residence , and the first beneficiary of Merus funds , was Gokul Rajaram , perhaps the highest profile recent Google departure , a man whom Fortune magazine identified as " one of the godfathers of AdSense " for his role in creating the targeted advertising service that is one of Google 's prime revenue sources .
Rajaram 's start - up , Chai Labs , which is still in stealth mode , was incubated at Merus .
In just the past couple years , ex-Googlers like Rajaram and Ullah and Dempsey have started about two dozen new companies and invested tens of millions of dollars in other start - ups .
As you would expect , this new breed of Google graduates has already come up with a cute and clever name to describe themselves .
They , the ex-Googlers , are Xooglers .
It should be noted that the Xoogler network 's profile is out of proportion with its size .
Any large company , especially one that went public four years ago and is beginning to see its first generation of pre-IPO employees become fully vested , is going to experience some attrition .
It is a testament to Google that the departures so far constitute more of a trickle than a flood .
Still , the stature of some of the people leaving -- the creator of Gmail , the company 's head of information security , its head of wireless -- makes it a force worth paying attention to .
It seems quite possible , in fact , that the next big thing to come out of Google wo n't come out of Google at all .
And it might just touch down at Merus Capital .
One thing about the next big thing :
It 's not , apparently , going to be a new Web browser .
Ullah eventually cuts Dempsey off .
" Some clown could build this for a Mozilla plug - in ! "
He shakes his head .
" We 're not meeting with them . "
Whenever possible , all three of the Merus principals like to sit in on pitches , as they are doing today .
When confronted with new business ideas , they say , Hsing is the optimist , Dempsey the pragmatist , and Ullah the skeptic .
Hsing and Dempsey each followed fairly typical paths into the corporate world .
Ullah 's background is different : Born in Germany to Pakistani parents , raised in England , he studied physics at Oxford University , then received a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Stanford .
He entered the world of business late .
But this unusual medley of a background made him a prototypical leader at Google , which prides itself on hiring more Ph.D. 's than any other company .
" In terms of our growth map , " Gil is saying , " our first focus right now is on building an infrastructure and trying to . . . "
Ullah , who is sitting across the table from Gil , interrupts .
" I think you 'll have no trouble raising money , but if you want my help , learn how to do bullets . "
He waves dismissively at the screen .
" Because the spacing drives me insane . "
" You do n't like these bullets ? "
" You do n't have any fucking space between the bullet and the letter !
You need the ruler to do that .
I can help you with that . "
" Okay , " Gil continues , " so I think we actually have four phases to this .
Phase zero is changing our PowerPoint slides .
Phase one , we focus on seeding the data . . . and SEOing . . . . "
The grammar of a meeting between VCs and entrepreneurs -- the PowerPoint slides and geekspeak and acronyms -- ROI , LP , SEO ( search - engine optimization ) -- can easily tip over into self - parody , and every party at this table knows it .
But this is the music that goes with this particular dance , for better or for worse , and so far these dances have led Merus to shack up with six different start - ups .
The Peninsula Fountain & Grill in downtown Palo Alto , a few blocks from the Merus offices , is a place where VCs and entrepreneurs often meet .
It 's noisy -- hard to eavesdrop in -- maybe that 's why .
I 'm here meeting with Jason Shellen , an entrepreneur who 's not currently connected directly to Merus , at least no more than all ex-Google employees are connected to one another .
He went with a different venture firm , Polaris Venture Partners , for his funding , and Polaris just led a first round for his start - up , securing it $ 1.6 million .
That should last him a year or so .
Shellen 's experience at Google , and his reasons for leaving , are fairly typical .
He joined Google in 2003 , part of the team Google adopted when it purchased Pyra Labs , creators of Blogger , one of Google 's biggest early acquisitions .
" We were their first acquisition of live human beings , " he says .
Shellen 's first big project at Google was to create an entirely new product , Google Reader , a collaborative blog - reading site .
At the time , Google had about six hundred employees , making it less than one twentieth of its current size , but that was still a big leap from the handful of people Shellen had worked with at Blogger .
" Even at the size Google was then , there was already a little bit of process to keep Google Reader from being the product that I had hoped it would be .
. . .
The person who I reported to did n't like the idea , so I essentially went shopping for a new boss internally who would sponsor it , and she had certain caveats to what it would be .
. . .
It sort of ground me down to the point where I did n't feel like creating another product at Google .
I was having trouble feeling like I would be rewarded in the same way as at a start - up . "
So shortly after his stocks fully vested , he left .
He wanted to do something entirely new , entirely for himself .
He wo n't say much about his project , called Plinky , other than it 's a " content - encouragement system , " which he admits sounds " sort of buzzy and weird . "
But he will say he 's having a great time .
Start - ups of any size carry an excitement hard to duplicate when you 're just one employee out of thousands .
" No one joining Google today can ever go back to the garage with Sergey and Larry , " he says .
In that garage , Sergey Brin and Larry Page built their empire on the basis of a simple and powerful idea that now seems obvious :
Create a better search engine by taking into account not just a page 's content but also its connectedness .
The most popular pages would show up ahead of the lonelier pages in search results .
This idea was so central to the Google experiment that its demo - stage name was " BackRub , " as in , " You rub my site 's back , I 'll rub yours . "
It 's this same basic idea that drives interest in the Google diaspora .
Not only are Xooglers bright , entrepreneurial , and wealthy , but their links to one another and to Google endow them with a real - world ranking bonus -- VC doors open wider ; the press is more intrigued .
Of course , not all the people leaving Google are starting companies themselves .
Some assume new roles at other companies .
Google is still hot and young , but it is no longer the hottest , or the youngest , established company in Silicon Valley .
Nor is it the only company here built on the value of connectedness .
About twenty - five minutes into lunch with Shellen , he recognizes four former Google colleagues walking past the restaurant , and all are wearing Facebook employee badges .

The Merus founders can get pitch requests from a dozen entrepreneurs a week , and the few meetings they choose to set up usually take place in a glass - walled conference room , around a shellacked , Swedish - looking table made from blond - and burgundy - colored wood .
A little shelf at one end of the room contains bottles of water ; a few abstract , African - looking sculptures ; and a vase of fresh , exotic flowers .
The fancy conference room belongs not to Merus but to Regis , a wealth - management company .
The decisions of Ullah , Dempsey , and Hsing to leave their jobs -- decisions made with the knowledge that they were sacrificing combined stock options running well into the seven figures -- were spurred in part by Regis 's guarantee of a $ 5 million investment and a deal on office space .
Unlike some other Xooglers investing in ex-Google start - ups -- people like Aydin Senkut , Google 's former international sales manager , who organizes occasional Xoogler get - togethers and cashed out of Google with tens of millions -- the Merus guys are not stratospherically wealthy , at least not by Silicon Valley standards .
They 've got money -- the name Merus , which means " pure " in Latin , was inspired by a favorite cabernet from Hsing 's wine collection -- but they still need to work for a living .
( Senkut owns a Lamborghini ; Ullah drives a Volvo wagon . )
Rather , the value of their stints at Google is not how much money they left with but whom they worked alongside .
Their particular jobs required them to get to know people from every area of the company .
Those contacts , and the knowledge base that came with it , is what they hope they can now spin into gold .
In the borrowed conference room this afternoon , Elad Gil sits behind a black ThinkPad laptop , queuing up a PowerPoint slide that is being projected at the far end of the room .
Gil and Othman Laraki , who 's sitting next to him , are both newly minted Xooglers and have come to present details on a company they 've dreamed up .
When they were at Google , Gil played a prominent role in the development of the company 's mobile infrastructure and Laraki worked on collaborations with the Mozilla Firefox browser .
The slide onscreen charts the various stages they see their start - up growing through over the next year and a half , if they receive the low seven figures in funding they 're looking for .
Ullah and Dempsey used to work with a guy named David Friedberg in Google 's corporate - development office .
He left Google a year before they did , and his departure added fire to their plans for Merus .
" We had a hypothesis that these were the kinds of things that were going to happen , " Ullah says .
" You know : Very smart guy -- he likes Google , but he has this idea that does n't fit the franchise . "
Had Merus existed when Friedberg was looking for seed capital , the firm likely would have been happy to provide it to him .
As it was , Ullah invested $ 50,000 of his own money in Friedberg 's company , WeatherBill .
On a recent afternoon at his office , Friedberg , twenty - eight , wearing jeans , a black T - shirt , and a zip - up jacket that looks like a Members Only but is n't , explains how he got the idea for WeatherBill :
He used to live in San Francisco 's Embarcadero district , down by the water , near a bike - rental place called the Bike Hut .
He 'd drive by the Bike Hut all the time , and he started to notice that whenever it rained a lot , they 'd just pull in the bikes , lower the shutters , and close shop - - nobody wants to rent a bike on a rainy day .
" I thought , Well , that 's such a shitty business , " Friedberg recalls .
" Every week , the guy 's gonna make -- or lose -- money based on how much it rains . "
And then Friedberg started to notice all sorts of other businesses with similar problems :
Movie theaters full on rainy days , empty on sunny ones .
The bar down the street , with its big outdoor patio , just the opposite .
So he did some research .
The Department of Commerce estimates unpredictable weather has the potential to negatively affect up to $ 4 trillion worth of business in the U. S. every year , or about one third of the entire GDP .
Sixty percent of weather - related financial losses are due to relatively small weather events , and there 's often nothing businesses can do to protect themselves .
" It 's this huge problem that no one does anything about , " says Friedberg .
So he , together with fellow former Googler Siraj Khaliq , founded WeatherBill .
The company crunches large amounts of historical and forecasting data with proprietary algorithms in order to determine the best - guess probability that virtually any weather - related scenario will take place , and then sells risk - hedging contracts based on those probabilities .
For example , a ski resort in Vermont might be able to buy a contract from WeatherBill for , say , $ 80,000 that would pay out $ 1 million ( up to $ 10 million ) for every degree above freezing that the average temperature strays during the upcoming ski season .
WeatherBill sells its own risk to reinsurers , which theoretically means it could survive the sort of cataclysmic Katrina - level payouts that a bad string of weather events might bring .
In fact , Friedberg himself is bullish on global warming and its resulting tempests .
" Extreme weather is kind of ridiculously going off the charts right now .
Stuff that used to be 10 percent likely is now 30 percent likely .
The good thing for us is that it means people are more cognizant of [ these extremes ] , and we get more customers .
It 's the fact that citrus farmers got frozen out and wiped out [ last year ] that we got the calls [ this year ] . "
Near where I 'm meeting with Friedberg , an intern from Berkeley is working on a WeatherBill white paper that identifies the Third World countries whose economies are most dependent on weather .
Meanwhile , a WeatherBill sales manager is trying to get in touch with a minor league ball club , the Charleston RiverDogs , that stands to lose at least $ 50,000 if its big Fourth of July event is rained out .
Meanwhile , automatically , revenue pours in from Priceline , which is currently offering a Sunshine Guarantee that offers full reimbursements to any customers whose Priceline - booked vacations are affected by a prespecified amount of rain .
Priceline is covering all of its risks with WeatherBill , purchasing individually tailored contracts for every vacation package .
Friedberg shows me , on his laptop screen , the latest batch .
Since a high contract price indicates a high probability of rain , it 's a good bet there will soon be a lot of wet , happy vacationers in Vancouver .
The firm has invested almost $ 13 million so far : $ 5 million in Airline Intelligence Systems , which uses proprietary algorithms to improve airline flight scheduling and routing efficiency ; $ 1 million in DeviceVM , creator of Splashtop , a product that enables a PC to sprint from powered off to functional in seconds ; $ 550,000 in The StoreBook , which gives small , unwired businesses the means to advertise daily specials online ; $ 3.5 million in Debix , which helps protect its customers from identity theft ; $ 2 million in Adroll , which connects small networks of complementary Web sites and allows them to leverage their combined size to sell advertising space ; and $ 350,000 in Chai Labs , which they wo n't say much about at all .
Ex -Googlers directly founded Chai Labs and TheStoreBook , but every company in the Merus portfolio becomes a de facto part of the Xoogler phenomenon , since each benefits from Merus 's own network of advisors , not to mention the buzz and curiosity that surround a venture - capital firm that , its founders admit , is " mainly known for Google . "
This buzz leads a steady stream of entrepreneurs to Merus , and the firm anticipates investing in at least another eighteen start - ups over the next two years .
I promised not to publish many details about Gil and Laraki 's plan , but I can say that although they are no longer a part of Google , their emulation of their former employer starts at a basic level .
The company , though a single entity , will contain two different teams working semi-independently on two distinct products .
As Gil explains during the meeting , this structure was inspired by Google 's " 20 - percent time " policy , which encourages employees to spend a fifth of their working hours on projects outside their main purview .
" Twenty - percent time really helps drive innovation , " Gil says .
" Originally we were thinking , Well , should we just do a company of 20 - percent projects , in which we do five different things ?
But we decided to hone it down to the two big markets that we thought were the most intriguing . "
Their hiring strategy , also , is Google - esque .
" I think the way we phrased it at Google was , you know , we 're looking for athletes versus specialists .
So we 're looking for people who are very , very sharp and who can do a variety of things . "
Finally , they 've appropriated their former employer 's confident , playful nonchalance when it comes to the earnings side of their business .
" When do you think you 'll get your first dollar of revenue ? "
Ullah asks .
" In a few months , " Gil says .
" We 're estimating $ 1.2 million a year . "
He waits a beat , then adds , with exaggerated precision .
" One point two five . "
All four Xooglers laugh .
" It 's just like , you know how Google raised , what was it , pi ? "
Gil adds , referring to Google 's initial public offering , prior to which Brin and Page filed an SEC form declaring that they wanted to raise $ 2.718281828 billion .
" It was e , " Ullah corrects him , and it was .
" We assume that , either way , our revenue will be irrational ! "
Gil continues , to more laughter all around .
" I discriminate against white people , " Ullah tells me one afternoon .
" You should know that .
I do .
I also discriminate against brown people .
The discrimination is subtly different .
With the white guy , I know he 's stupid .
Whereas with the brown guy , he better be fucking brilliant .
So I 'll take the meeting with the brown guy , because I want to give him the benefit of the doubt .
I will never give the benefit of the doubt to the white guy .
But the bar is lower for the white guy , much higher for the brown guy .
It 's weird .
It 's this weird off - diagonal thing . "
" This is great PR for the firm , " Dempsey says softly from his desk .
The guys are working today on a one - page mission statement that they intend to send out to all their investors .
They show the draft to me , ask for my comments .
One of the key lines reads :
" Within the software / Internet sector , we are focused on early - stage investment opportunities supported by one or more of our three major investment themes : algorithm - intensive solutions , multisided aggregation platforms , and next - generation productivity solutions . "
I point out that the word solutions is used twice and offer that , in general , the term " next - generation " is used so often , it 's basically useless .
They change the line , replacing the first solutions with services , and writing " Web - centric " in place of " next - generation . "
Then I tell them that the sentence is still , from my nontechnical perspective , pretty opaque .
" It 's not self - explanatory , " Ullah admits .
" But that 's a good thing .
That 's why they need us .
We 're like those priests in the temple .
Can I talk to God ?
No .
You talk to me .
I will then talk to God . "
Anyway , the themes are just guidelines , and flexible ones at that .
" I mean the whole thing is a joke , " Ullah says .
" All of these [ other firms ] , their portfolios are all over the place . "
But the guys do genuinely believe that keeping these three investment themes in mind will help them sift through all of the pitches they hear each week and spot the nuggets amid all the worthless gravel .
More important , they believe they know how to identify the gravel .
Although Merus Capital is the beneficiary of a species of buzz - - of this idea that there is something special about Xooglers -- the Merus founders have learned to be skeptical of buzz in general .
For example , one of the buzziest little start - ups in the Valley these days is , they think , a lousy business .
It 's called Twitter .
It allows you to write 140 - word " tweets " all day long , from your cell phone or wherever , and post them to your Twitter page , a sort of short - attention - span blog .
Lots of people are using it .
And it does n't hurt that Evan Williams , Twitter 's cofounder , worked at Google until 2004 .
Twitter is just the sort of portfolio - jazzing start - up that some venture capitalists like to name - drop over cocktails , and it has raised $ 22 million so far .
" But it 's nothing we would invest in , " Dempsey says .
" Despite the excitement , we do n't see the economics behind it . "
After they finish editing the letter , they start brainstorming possible Merus slogans .
" Changing the Landscape , " Hsing offers .
" Everyone says that , " Ullah says .
" Not everyone says that . "
" Kleiner says that .
Sequoia says that . "
" First Round does n't say that . "
" I do n't know what the fuck First Round says . "
There 's a lull .
Then Dempsey makes a suggestion : " Want to know what Google 's doing ?
Come have a quiet conversation with us . "
So what is Google doing ?
During my lunch with Jason Shellen , he 'd mentioned a meeting he had a few years ago with Susan Wojcicki , Google 's vice - president of product management , about the problem of employee retention .
Wojcicki was Google 's fourteenth hire and the owner of the Menlo Park garage in which the company incubated .
They 'd discussed , among other things , whether it might be possible to create a " Google Ventures sort of thing " that would allow entrepreneurial employees with ideas to " spin projects out " while keeping them close by .
The idea , Shellen believed , had never gained traction .
Six weeks after my conversation with Shellen , and days before this story went to press , an article appeared in The Wall Street Journal : GOOGLE TO EXTEND REACH WITH VENTURE - CAPITAL ARM .
The details are still vague , and Google has n't confirmed anything , but here 's one safe bet : Even Google does n't want to miss out on the Xoogler action .

Coors faces a $ 12.5 million lawsuit for allegedly copying a $ 3 beer - drinking novelty application that allows users to virtually drink a pint by tilting their iPhone .
Hottrix , a small company that develops " tricks " for mobile devices , filed a lawsuit alleging that Coors commited copyright infringement by copying its iPhone application iBeer .
Both Hottrix 's application and Coors ' iPint display the image of a glass of beer on the iPhone 's screen , which is emptied when a user tilts the handset about 90 degrees .
Both apps launched in the App Store on July 11 – the major difference being that iBeer cost $ 3 and iPint was free .
An attorney for the law firm representing Hottrix , Buchalter Nemer , said the smaller company attempted to reach an amicable solution with Coors , without success .
Hottrix then complained to Apple , which eventually removed iPint from the App Store in the United States .
However , iPint still appears in the App Store in other countries .
" My client ... is really a mom-and - pop company who just wants to protect their intellectual property rights , " said Jason Fisher , the attorney representing Hottrix .
The removal of iPint exemplifies the limitations of Apple 's popular iPhone App Store as a closed , for - profit marketplace .
In August , Apple had to ban NetShare , because the app violated AT&T 's terms - of - service agreement by turning the iPhone into a wireless modem .
The removal of iPint in the United
States demonstrates
Apple attempting to mediate a legal battle between two companies .
When iPint appeared in the App Store , it quickly climbed into the top 10 most downloaded free applications – essentially hurting iBeer 's sales , Fisher said .
After Apple removed iPint , iBeer made it onto the App
Store 's top 25 most popular paid applications list .
It currently sits at No. 22 on that list .
Fisher said that a video demonstrating the accelerometer technique of iBeer appeared on YouTube in August 2007 – even before iPhone 's App Store launched – which may be how Coors latched onto the idea .
The 12 - page lawsuit ( .pdf ) stresses that the iBeer technique was " wholly original ... and is copyrightable subject matter . "
The lawsuit includes two other companies – Beattie McGuinness and DOES 1 to 10 – that handled the marketing for iPint outside of the United States .
" We are confident that we ’ve handled this matter appropriately , and will vigorously defend the action , " Coors said in a statement .

Editor 's Note : Each Wednesday LiveScience examines the viability of emerging energy technologies — the power of the future .
From Holland , the country famous for its windmills , comes a new design for home wind power .
Looking like an eggbeater , it spins quieter and at lower wind speeds than a lot of traditional propeller - type turbines .
It 's now standard for big wind turbines to have propeller blades .
Much of the turning force is generated at the tips , which slice perpendicularly through the air , causing a swooshing noise that some residents nearby have said they find unnerving .
By contrast , the so - called Energy Ball , sold by Dutch - based Home Energy International , has rotors bent around in a ball shape so that they primarily move parallel to the wind .
This generates less noise .
" A small wind turbine has to be silent , otherwise it will be annoying to the community , " said Erik Aurik , Home Energy 's marketing manager .
The noise from an Energy Ball is always less than the sound of the wind , Aurik told LiveScience .
And what 's more , the device continues to work even when the wind speed dips down to as slow as 4.5 mph ( 2 meters per second ) , whereas the average turbine needs roughly twice that wind speed to turn .
Venturi effect
This is not the first wind turbine to resemble an egg - beater .
The Darrieus wind turbine has a similar shape and has been around for almost 80 years .
What 's different with the Energy Ball is that it has a horizontal axis , not a vertical one .
And it uses a different kind of physics , called the Venturi effect .
The Venturi effect is characterized by a low pressure that occurs when a flow of air or liquid speeds up as it is constricted .
Some perfume bottles use the Venturi effect to suck up perfume into the spray nozzle .
The Energy Ball 's design constricts the wind , thereby causing the pressure to drop inside the ball .
This sucks in air flowing around the ball and helps turn the rotor blades .
Because of this sucking action , Venturi - based turbines use more of the wind — and can therefore be 40 percent more efficient — than a propeller - style turbine of the same diameter , according to research by Technical University of Delft in Holland .
Decorative windmills Energy Balls currently are sold in sizes of either 1 meter or 2 meters in diameter .
They can be installed on a pole or a flat roof in as few as four hours , Aurik said .
In places where the wind is relatively strong — blowing 15 mph , or 7 meters per second , on average — a 1 - meter ball can generate up to 500 kilowatt - hours per year , while the 2 - meter ball can supply 1,750 kilowatt - hours per year .
The typical U.S. household uses 11,000 kilowatt - hours per year , so additional electricity will have to come from somewhere .
However , these are optimum values that assume the small turbine is mounted at least 40 feet ( 12 meters ) above the ground and is free from surrounding trees and buildings that block the wind .
The cost of the Energy Ball is between $ 3,500 and $ 7,000 , not including installation .
" There is a lot of interest worldwide , " Aurik said .
" Everybody likes the design .
It looks like an art piece . "

Seeing the Palin family , in a very visible public forum , with an uncompromising and public pro life philosophy arouses deeply repressed feelings in post abortive parents , as well as media members , counselors , health care professionals , politicians and others who promote abortion rights , especially the abortion of children with challenges such as Down Syndrome .
These powerful repressed feelings of grief , guilt and shame can be deflected from the source of the wound ( i.e. , abortion ) and projected onto an often uncharitable focus upon the trigger of these painful emotions ... the Palin family .
Can I just say that I have always been extremely supportive of anyone who decides not to abort a child , especially those with special needs .
That 's been my position for my entire life .
The reason for opposition to Palin is that she is utterly unqualified , her record is flimsy at best and her incessant , bizarre lies suggest she is unable to deal with reality .
As for the rest of the Palin family , the tabloid stuff about her son and her marriage has been widely ignored .
The strange twists and turns of her last pregnancy - as explained in public - simply defy credulity .
It is n't an attack to ask her to account for such a bizarre story .
It 's called democracy and accountability .

In your computer science algorithms course , you learned about space - time tradeoffs .
An algorithm that requires lots of time can often be changed to take less time but more space .
A wide range of performance optimizations work this way , from caching to memoization to loop unrolling .
But the " tradeoff " is a lie .
Space is time .
Every use of space incurs a time cost .
In your theory class , the time cost of space is swept under the big - O rug .
On your big-iron machine running a single computational workload or CPU benchmark , the time cost of space is small compared to the other time costs involved .
But in the real world of consumer - grade devices , with limited memory and power , the time cost of space is tremendous .
A performance optimization that tries to trade less time for more space often ends up requiring more time and more space .
The gcc compiler uses a garbage collector to manage its memory .
To save time , gcc does not even start to collect any garbage until its memory size is quite large .
" That 's fine " , you might say , " my new machine has gigabytes of memory " .
But the kernel needs a big chunk of memory just to keep track of the rest of the memory .
And you 're running a web browser , and an email client , and an IDE , and music and chat and clock and search and sync and backup and everything else you did n't have a decade or two ago .
And your build system runs multiple gcc commands in parallel because your machine has multiple cores .
Now your memory capacity is n't so big after all , the system starts paging to disk , and your compiler performance falls off a cliff and the web browser is sluggish too .
In this memory - constrained environment , trying to use less time ( skipping GC ) and more space ( accumulating garbage ) has backfired badly .
Space is time .
An optimization that is faster on a well - endowed device may be much slower everywhere else .
Assume your customer 's machines have less memory than yours , and design and test accordingly .
At one modern extreme , the iPhone has only 128 MB of memory .
Ever seen iPhone Safari " forget " a web page and re-download it after you switched tabs or apps ?
The system ran out of memory and Safari had to throw the page away .
On the iPhone , your favorite space - time tradeoff in your own program may sacrifice the user 's web page , requiring a repeat download across a slow network .
Good for your program , perhaps , but bad for the user .
Space is time .
An optimization that makes your program faster may make the user 's system slower overall .
Play well with others .
Most of Mac OS
X is compiled with - Os instead of - O3 , to reduce code size .
Mac OS
X's memory allocator is slower than other allocators under some workloads , because it tries to avoid hoarding unused memory where other processes can't use it .
Mac OS
X uses dynamic shared libraries exclusively , then combines multiple shared libraries into a single shared cache , then carefully re-processes that shared cache , all to save space across multiple processes .
Many ideas for faster cross-library calls or accelerated Objective - C method dispatch or JIT - based optimization have been abandoned because they need too much space and do not save enough time .
CPU - focused optimization can be just as evil as the infamous premature optimization .
Space is time .

How double agents duped the Nazis
Insights into the exploits of one of Britain 's most useful wartime double agents have been revealed in previously secret MI5 files .
Before the Second World War Eddie Chapman was a burglar , safe breaker and extortionist who blackmailed former lovers with compromising photographs .
He has no scruples and will stop at nothing
British camp commandant about agent Zigzag
But these sleazy credentials helped make Chapman , codenamed Zigzag , an ideal wartime double agent , according to the Public Record Office files .
He was originally recruited by the German secret service after the Nazis occupied Jersey , where he was a prisoner .
He was parachuted into the UK by the Germans in 1942 with the task of blowing up a factory making Mosquito bombers .
But after landing in Cambridgeshire , he immediately offered his services to MI5 .
He was interrogated at Latchmere House in west London , known as Camp 020 .
Underworld prince
The camp commandant described him as vain and said he thought of himself as " something of a prince of the underworld " .
He said : " He has no scruples and will stop at nothing .
He plays for high stakes and would have the world know it .
" Of fear he knows nothing , and while patriotism is not a positive virtue he certainly has a deep rooted hatred of the Hun .
" In a word , adventure to Chapman is the breath of life .
" Given adventure he has the courage to achieve the unbelievable . "
Chapman was further angered when he realised the Nazis had put his life in jeopardy when they gave him British banknotes which had a German bank wrapper around them .
Chapman went on to dupe the Germans into believing - with the help of faked photographs - he had carried out a successful sabotage attack on the Mosquito factory , in Hatfield , Hertfordshire .
Rubble was strewn around the site and MI5 planted a story in the Daily Express about the " raid . "
In 1943 Chapman was ordered by the German secret service , the Abwehr , to return to Paris .
The Germans rewarded him with the Iron Cross , a 110,000 Reichmarks and his own yacht and gave him a job training agents in occupied Norway .
In June 1944 Chapman was again parachuted into England where he transmitted false wireless messages to the Germans .
But an MI5 agent said Zigzag was becoming discontented .
He warned that if this continued : " He will turn his tortuous mind to working out schemes for making more money which will almost certainly bring him to the notice of the police . "
The MI5 eventually gave Chapman a £ 6,000 pay - off , allowing him to keep £ 1,000 of the German reward and quashed his outstanding criminal convictions .
His story is just one of many to emerge from the latest release of a batch of secret files opened to the public on Thursday .
Misleading information A Welshman , codenamed Snow , is described in the government papers as the first double agent .
Recruited by the British before the war , he passed information to the German secret service .
Snow , who had been given a transmitter by the Germans , was arrested at the outbreak of war .
Under MI5 control at Wandsworth Prison , he continued his double agent work , feeding through harmless and often misleading information to the Nazis .
One of the tasks set by his German masters was to find out how easy it would be to put bacteria in the British water system .
' Wretched woman ' A French woman , codenamed Agent Treasure , threatened to scupper a covert operation after she blamed the British secret service for the death of her pet dog Frisson .
The pet was accidentally left behind in Gibraltar during an operation to get the spy back to London .
She is described in the papers as " exceptionally temperamental and troublesome " and a " wretched woman . "
In May 1944 , a month before D - Day , Agent Treasure threatened to end her bogus reports to the Germans .
MI5 officer Mary Sherer said she blamed them for the death of her dog .
After D - Day she was sacked and returned to France .
But by then she had already achieved her mission - successfully encouraging the Germans to believe the D - Day landings would be at Calais .
There are skilled locksmiths out there that can reproduce a key from high - resolution images , but new software developed by computer scientists at UC San Diego has simplified the process to a frightening degree .
In fact , their " Sneakey " system can reproduce a key with only a grainy cellphone image or , in one case , a picture taken from 200 feet away with a five - inch telephoto lens .
" The program is simple .
You have to click on the photo to tell it where the top of the key is , and a few other control points .
From here , it normalizes the key 's size and position .
Since each pixel then corresponds to a set distance , it can accurately guess the height of each of the key cuts , " explained Benjamin Laxton , the first author on the paper who recently earned his Master 's degree in computer science from UC San Diego .

The researchers have not released their code to the public , but they claim that anyone with a decent working knowledge of MatLab and computer vision techniques could create a similar system without much difficulty .
Their suggestion : treat your keys like you would a credit card .
Thanks for giving us all one more thing to worry about guys .

US Sends $ 800 Billion In New Amero Currency To China
By : Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers ( Traducción al Español abajo )
A chilling report circulating in the Kremlin today states that the US Secretary of the Treasury has informed the China Development Bank that the US has shipped $ 800 Billion of a new currency called the Amero , which is to be based upon the merging of the economies of The United States , Mexico and Canada into what is termed as The North American Union .
The current American debt obligation to China , currently based on the US Dollar , is now estimated to be the staggering sum of $ 2.5 Trillion , and which this new Amero will be exchanged for $ 400 Billion of this debt as the current American currency is set to be devalued by 50 percent before the end of the year .
Virtually unknown to the American people is that their current leader of the US Department of Treasury , Henry M. Paulson , Jr. , has been tasked by President Bush to lead the efforts to join the economies of the US , Canada and Mexico and is also the head of the North American Development Bank , the bi-national financial institution established by the United States and Mexico to further the merging of their economies , and the leader of the Border Environment Cooperation Commission ( BECC ) , the organization created by the governments of the United States and Mexico to further the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) .
This is important to note as the final provisions of the NAFTA Agreement were implemented on January 1 , 2008 , leaving only the final merging of the economies of the US , Mexico and Canada into a North American Union to be accomplished , of which we can read :
“ President Bush is pursuing a globalist agenda to create a North American Union , effectively erasing our borders with both Mexico and Canada .
This was the hidden agenda behind the Bush administration 's true open borders policy .
Secretly , the Bush administration is pursuing a policy to expand NAFTA politically , setting the stage for a North American Union designed to encompass the U.S. , Canada , and Mexico .
What the Bush administration truly wants is the free , unimpeded movement of people across open borders with Mexico and Canada .
President Bush intends to abrogate U.S. sovereignty to the North American Union , a new economic and political entity which the President is quietly forming , much as the European Union has formed . ”
It is also interesting to note that American economists have been warning about the replacing of the US Dollar with the Amero , due to pressure from China , for nearly two years , and as we can read in this December , 2006 report titled Analysts : Dollar collapse would result in ' amero ' , and which says :
“ As WND reported earlier this week , in an unusual move , the Bush administration is sending virtually the entire economic " A - team " to visit China for a " strategic economic dialogue " in Beijing Thursday and Friday .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke are leading the delegation , along with five other cabinet - level officials , including Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez .
Also in the delegation will be Labor Secretary Elaine Chao , Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt , Energy Secretary Sam Bodman , and U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab .
But Chapman doubts the trip will help the Fed to engineer a slow dollar slide .
“ The Chinese are going to do what the Chinese want to do , not what we want them to do , " he said .
" I believe the Chinese are going to send Treasury Secretary Paulson and Fed Chairman Bernanke home packing , with little or nothing to show for the trip . "
How severe will the coming dollar collapse be ?
" People in the U.S. are going to be hit hard , " Chapman warned .
" In the severe recession we are entering now , Bush will argue that we have to form a North American Union to compete with the Euro . "
" Creating the amero , " Chapman explained , " will be presented to the American public as the administration 's solution for dollar recovery .
In the process of creating the amero , the Bush administration just abandons the dollar . ”
The prophetic warnings of these American economists are , indeed , coming to pass as during the month of September alone , 10 years worth of gains on US stock markets have been wiped out in their entirety and bank runs are now occurring in the United States for the first time since the days of the Great Depression leading to the failure of 13 banks , some of their largest , and the imminent failure of 117 more forecasted by the US government .
US Treasury Secretary Paulson , however , continues leading the charge attempting to force upon the American people the ‘ final peg ’ to their own demise by completely bankrupting the United States leaving no other choice but to completely discard the almost totally worthless US Dollar and its replacement with the Amero .
It goes without saying that the American people will greatly resist the replacement of their Dollar , but this cannot be said when tens of millions of them are without jobs and their life savings have become worthless leaving them with no other choice but accept what their own leaders have planned for them all along .
To this growing crisis currently battering the US , and its destruction of the entire Western Economy , Russian Military Analysts state in their reports that the establishment of a North American Union is by no means a foregone conclusion as aligned against it are the combined , and powerful , forces of the United States Military establishment and the State of Israel , both of whom see their demise should this planned merger occur .
This is important to note because both the US Military and Israel are proponents of what is termed as ‘ Disaster Capitalism ’ which advocates the seemingly contradictory view that ‘ shocks ’ and ‘ crashes ’ to populations and economies are quickly followed by long periods of sustained growth and stability .
The phenomena of Disaster Capitalism was first observed during the 2007 World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , where this ‘ puzzling trend ’ was discussed and debated at great length , but which none of the participates could dispute after the full reports of the effects of September 11 , 2001 , in the United States , and other such catastrophic disasters , were fully analyzed .
To the growing Western adherence to the new ideology of Disaster Capitalism , and its dangers , we are further warned by the eminent writer Naomi Klein in her seminal work “ The Shock Doctrine : The Rise Of Disaster Capitalism ” , and where she states :
“ The creeping expansion of the disaster capitalism complex into media may prove to be a new kind of corporate synergy , one building on the vertical integration so popular in the nineties .
It certainly makes sound business sense .
The more panicked our societies become , convinced that there are terrorists lurking in every mosque , the higher the news ratings soar , the more biometric IDs and liquid - explosives - detection devices the complex sells , and the more high - tech fences it builds .
If the dream of the open , borderless “ small planet ” was the ticket to profits in the nineties , the nightmare of the menacing , fortressed Western continents , under siege from jihadists and illegal immigrants , palys the same role in the new millennium .
The only prospect that threatens the booming disaster economy on which so much wealth depends - from weapons to oil to engineering to surveillance to patented drugs - is the possibility of achieving some measure of climatic stability and geopolitical peace . ”
To which of these powerful forces , North American Union or Disaster Capitalism , the American people will ultimately be forced into choosing it is not in our knowing .
But , what is in our knowing is that these Americans are woefully ill equipped , on every level imaginable , to either fully understand , or know how to survive , the horrific future being planned for them .

Report Copyright Violation Re : be ready for a one - week universal shut - down of the banking system Bush Wants To Bankrupt America :
There is Method To His Madness
By Sam Hamod
07/01/03 : " ICH " -- -
Some have wondered if GW Bush knows what he 's doing with his tax cut that benefits the corporations and the very rich , and cuts away the remaining money of the poor and the middle class .
I say yes , he does know what he'd up to , as do his corporate advisors and his neo -con economist friends and theorists , chief among them Grover Norquist .
Norquist has been the chief architect behind the dismantling of the American federal financial structure in terms of benefits for the common citizen , but has helped to create the superstructure of tax breaks for the very rich and the corporatocracy that now has a choke - hold on America .
The plan is very simple , but not obvious on first blush .
Make sure that all the money is gone from the U.S. treasury , make sure the deficits are so great that all social and educational programs are cut , increase the military and security budgets to " protect our nation " with all these monies going to corporations and security firms who are extra-national ( not tied to any country , but actually more than multi-national in that they are outside the purview of any nation at any single moment ) and stave in the social security fund by allowing it to go to private corporations for " investment " - and you have the perfect scenario for saying , " only the private sector can save us - we 're broke and they have the money to run every program , fund every program , but of course , at huge costs and profits for the private corporations . "
Our only resource will be the corporate lenders , especially the large extra-national corporations who will have loyalty to no one except their corporate coffers and large share owners throughout the world .
This plan is so obvious at this point that it is hard to believe because it is happening so fast and the Democrats and even conservative non- neo-con Republicans do n't realize what Bush and his neo -con buddies are up to .

This rumor would have legs if the credit market does n't unfreeze ( barring any bailout or what the market is doing ) .
The way I understand it , we are weeks away from Main Street being shut down if the credit markets do n't work again , and from what I see they are frozen solid .
Even with a bailout it may not unfreeze .
I would n't be surprised if this is just a back up plan by the FED .
I can only hope if the banks are closed , that I do n't have to go to work either .

Federal Certification Test for Vote - Counting Accuracy Cannot Determine the Error Rate of the Equipment
by Ellen Theisen .
March 21 , 2009 permalink
We live in a world of complex computerized systems -- medical equipment such as MRIs and CAT scans ; flight control software ; an automotive fuel injection system ; the databases that store , retrieve , and collate data .
All these systems undergo stringent testing .
The primary purpose of any testing of computerized systems is to show either that the system works as designed or that it doesnt .
If the system does not work as designed , then the test results are expected to provide information on the nature , and perhaps the cause , of the defective behavior .
Using these criteria , this report evaluates one specific test -- a test designed to confirm or refute that a specific computerized vote - counting system meets the accuracy level required by federal law .
The details that follow contain many numbers and many technical details , but the discussion centers on a single , simple question : did the test , which was approved by the federal agency tasked with certifying voting equipment , provide evidence that the accuracy requirement was met , or did the test provide evidence that the accuracy requirement was not met ?
As the author demonstrates in this specific instance , the answer is : the test provided neither .
The test , which was designed by a federally - accredited test lab for the sole purpose of testing the accuracy of the vote - counting equipment , cannot prove whether or not the system accurately counts votes , nor can the test yield any measure of the accuracy rate .
The author wants the reader to understand that such testing provides false assurance that a federally - certified vote - counting machine meets the accuracy requirements of federal law .

The EAC Need Not Continue Violating Federal Law
by John Gideon and Ellen Theisen .
January 5 , 2008
There can be little doubt that , of the issues springing from elections held since President Bush signed the Help America Vote Act of 2002 ( HAVA ) , two are among the most significant .
Those issues are failures of voting systems to meet the HAVA mandates for accuracy and accessibility and the confusion over the proper use of provisional ballots .
The states should have been able to look to the federal Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) for guidance on both issues , but the EAC has failed to give the necessary Assistance , thus failing to fulfill duties assigned to the agency by federal law .
Now the EAC is proposing to extend its dereliction of duty for another two years .
The result will be the publication of these important guidelines a full eight years after HAVA was enacted .
The delay is inexcusable and intolerable , and the cost to American elections , on many fronts , is nearly incalculable .

Watch the 10 - minute video , compliments of NH Protect the Count .
Federal Vote - Counting Accuracy Mandate Is Ignored
Violations abound , but no federal action is taken
The Help America Vote Act of 2002 ( HAVA ) , Section 301 ( a ) ( 5 ) , requires that the vote - counting error rate of each voting system used in federal elections must comply with the 2002 Voluntary Voting Systems Standards .
UPDATE , May 5 , 2008 .
It has come to our attention that the 1/500,000 error rate previously quoted here applies to the testing process .
For operation in an election , the allowable error rate is 1 error in 10,000,000 ballot lines ( 0.00001 % ) .
Here are some examples of voting system error rates logged in elections since HAVA was enacted , yet no federal agency has taken action to stop the use of these systems .
In fact , all these systems are still in use in the United States .
Many other news stories tell of equally shocking error rates .
Though we have not calculated the error rate per ballot line ( choice on the ballot ) , it 's clear that these miscounts are far beyond the legal limit of one error in 10,000,000 ballot choices .
For example :
Phillips Co , AR. 2006 .
432 of 2,011 ballots had " mistakenly been counted as Republican ballots , effectively nullifying them . "
( Thanks to ES&S programming of the iVotronic touch screens . )
Pottawattamie Co , IA .
2006 .
A machine count of the absentee ballots showed Sciortino 79 , Duran 99 ; but a subsequent hand count gave the correct count : Sciortino 153 , Duran 25 .
( Thanks again , ES&S . ) Johnson Co , KS. 2002 .
Results were misreported in six races .
" The system miscounted hundreds of votes , and a re-count was ordered . "
( Diebold admitted it was a software error . )
Sarasota Co , FL . 2006 .
ES&S touch screen voting machines reported 18,000 fewer votes than voters in a US Congressional contest won by less than 400 votes .
Wait !
My mistake .
It 's impossible to tell whether this was a miscount or not since the electronic evidence has long since vanished into thin air and cannot be recovered .
The list goes on and on and on ...
Every election , federal law is being violated in hundreds , maybe thousands , of polling places , and no federal agency takes action .
Worse yet , democracy is being violated .
Furthermore , HAVA Section 301( a ) ( 3 ) , which requires that each poll site provide a means by which voters with disabilities can vote privately and independently , has been the driving force behind the widespread purchase of equipment that DOES NOT COMPLY with the very law it purports to satisfy .
The official report from the California " Top to Bottom Review " of voting systems shows that much of the " accessible " equipment does n't even meet common - sense standards , and stories from poll sites are heart - wrenching .
Yet , the fact that " accessible " equipment is inaccessible is being ignored by virtually all officials .
Certainly no action has been taken .
Voting system vendors are taking billions of tax - payer dollars and , in return , giving us inaccurate , inaccessible , unauditable , unreliable voting equipment that counts our votes in secret .
You Can Take Action .
It 's time to call for accountability in the machinery of our electoral system .
Please sign the petition in support of VoterAction 's call for Congressional investigations into blatant and destructive commercial fraud in the electronic voting machine industry .
The 2006 mid-term election revealed that the promise of easier voting , more accurate tallies , and faster results with electronic systems has not been fulfilled .

Romney goes out there and loses one for the Gipper
September 5 , 2008 by lestro
by lestro
The Democrats had Dennis Kucinich , The Republicans had Mitt Romney .
During Romney ’s speech this past week at the convention , the vanquished former governor of Massachusetts and passed - over veep short - lister who ran mainly on the strength of his hair made his pitch to give the Reagan - esque , convention - stealing , oh - shit - we - got - the - wrong - guy speech that Reagan gave in 1976 , setting himself up as the 1980 standard - bearer .
But where Reagan inspired , Romney , crazy eyes blazing and Presidential Coif shaking the whole time , leaned waaaay right , threw everything he had against the wall and instead of coming off looking like the missed opportunity I am sure he hoped it would , he just sounded like a lunatic .
Every line of this thing is pure , crazy gold .
Here ’s the opener :
For decades , the Washington sun has been rising in the east – Washington has been looking to the eastern elites , to the editorial pages of the Times and the Post , and to the broadcasters from the coast .
If America really wants change , it ’s time to look for the sun in the west , cause it ’s about to rise and shine from Arizona and Alaska !
huh ?
Then he just starts swinging at liberals , making no sense but obviously just trying to fire up the crowd and leave an impression .
Last week , the Democrats talked about change .
But let me ask you – what do you think Washington is right now , liberal or conservative ?
Is a Supreme Court liberal or conservative that awards Guantanamo terrorists with constitution rights ?
It ’s liberal !
Actually , protecting the rights laid out in the constitution is a conservative idea .
So is the Court , by the way .
He goes on :
Is government spending – excluding inflation – liberal or conservative if it doubles since 1980 ?
It ’s liberal !
Of course , 20 of those 28 years – including the largest government increases and expansion as well as the largest explosion of debt as well as slower economic growth – were with Republicans in the White House .
We need change all right – change from a liberal Washington to a conservative Washington !
We have a prescription for every American who wants change in Washington – throw out the big government liberals and elect John McCain !
McCain ’s been there the entire time .
Opportunity expands when there is excellence and choice in education , when taxes are lowered , when every citizen has affordable , portable health insurance , and when constitutional freedoms are preserved .
Even though I was opposed to the Supreme Court preserving freedoms just seven paragraphs ago !
Blah Blah Blah and then this :
It ’s time for the party of big ideas , not the party of Big Brother !
Agreed .
We should throw out the floundering , wiretapping , war - is - peace torturers while we still have the chance .
I love this part :
Our economy is under attack .
China is acting like Adam Smith on steroids , buying oil from the world ’s worst , and selling nuclear technology .
Russia and the oil states are siphoning more than 500 billion dollars a year from us in what could become the greatest transfer of economic wealth in history .
This is no time for timid , liberal empty gestures .
Did he just come out against the free market ?
Our economy has slowed down this year and a lot of people are hurting .
What happened ?
Mortgage money was handed out like candy , speculators bought homes for free – when this mortgage mania finally broke , it slammed the economy .
And stratospheric gas prices made things even worse .
Thanks to Republican policies of deregulation and letting them police themselves .
Democrats want to use the slowdown as an excuse to do what their special interests are always begging for : higher taxes , bigger government and less trade with other nations .
It ’s the same path Europe took a few decades ago .
It leads to moribund growth and double - digit unemployment .
Correct me if I am wrong , but is n’t the Euro now worth about two bucks ?
The right course is the one championed by Ronald Reagan 30 years ago , and by John McCain today .
It is to rein in government spending and to lower taxes , for taking a weed whacker to excessive regulation and mandates , for putting a stop to tort windfalls , and to stand up to the tyrannosaurus appetite of government unions !
Um , that has failed every time we ’ve tried it .
No matter , he got to say “ Ronald Reagan . ”
HEY !
FEAR !
Did you hear any Democrats talk last week about the threat from radical , violent Jihad ?
Republicans believe that there is good and evil in the world .
Ronald Reagan called - out the Evil Empire .
George Bush labeled the terror - sponsor states the Axis of Evil .
Of course , North Korea got the bomb and Iran got even closer .
Never mind that , CHRISTIAN FEAR !
And at Saddleback , after Barack Obama dodged and ducked every direct question , John McCain hit the nail on the head : radical violent Islam is evil , and he will defeat it !
He flamed on for a few more minutes before finally petering out with this :
To this we are all dedicated and I firmly believe , by the providence of the Almighty ,
… and the angel Moroni and Joseph Smith and his magic gold plates …
that we will succeed .
Crazy .
I love it .
He knew he was n’t in primetime , plus he knew that once people heard the stack of doublespeak and bullshit the candidates were going to lay out nobody would remember his pack of crap so he just went for it .
You gotta admire that .
And that hair .
Great hair .

The UK 's top share index chalked up its biggest ever one - day points fall as Chancellor Alistair Darling attempted to reassure financial markets .
Mr Darling said the government would do whatever necessary to ensure the stability of the financial system but offered few specific measures .
The FTSE 100 , which was launched in 1984 , fell 391.1 points , or 7.85 % , to close at 4,589.2 .
This means that £ 93.4bn has been wiped off the value of the index 's shares .
In terms of points , Monday 's fall was bigger than the slides seen in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the US and the 1987 stock market crash .
' Support ' Mr Darling told MPs that the government would act to support the banking system as a whole as well as supporting individual banks
The chancellor said that European countries needed to work together to respond to the global financial crisis .
But despite pledges being given by some European Union countries , Mr Darling stopped short of guaranteeing all bank savings and called on EU members to co-ordinate action .
" When member states take unilateral action , it does have a knock - on effect , " he said .
He also said that the Bank of England would inject a further £ 40bn into the financial system to help ease the credit crunch .
Stocks slide Stock markets around the world also fell sharply during trading on Monday .
There can be no sustained recovery until the markets are in the clutches of utter despair
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert 's blog In New York , the Dow fell 369.88 points , or 3.58 % , to end at 9,955.50 - falling below the 10,000 point barrier for the first time since 2004 .
The falls follow a series of events including :
The German government was forced to salvage a 50bn euro ( $ 69bn ; £ 39 bn ) rescue package for mortgage provider Hypo Real Estate Denmark , Sweden , Iceland and Spain increased the amount of protection depositors in their banks receive .
EU leaders issued a joint statement saying they would take the necessary measures to protect both the system and individual depositors .
Iceland announced emergency legislation to salvage its battered banking sector .
Central banks across Europe - including the European Central Bank and Bank of England - offered more than $ 74bn to banks in short - term loans in separate efforts aimed at trying to make cash available for the banking sector Shares in Fortis were suspended , a day after France 's BNP Paribas said it would take a 75 % stake in the Benelux bank .
Emergency meeting Mr Darling told the Commons that an emergency meeting would be held in Luxembourg on Tuesday , where he hoped that all EU member states would agree to act together to avoid confusion .
The chancellor said that 98 % of UK bank accounts will be covered by deposit protection once the increase in the amount of bank deposits guaranteed by the government takes effect on Tuesday .
The threshold has increased from £ 35,000 to £ 50,000 and Mr Darling said that the Financial Services Authority was looking at whether to increase this further .
Co-operation
The Shadow Chancellor George Osborne reaffirmed the Conservative Party 's commitment to work with the Government to help ease the crisis .
" If the banking system fails it 's not just the banks that go bust : businesses fail , families can't get mortgages , people lose their jobs , not just in the banks but across the wider economy , " Mr Osborne said .
Vince Cable , Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman , asked the Chancellor to consider overriding the Bank of England 's right to change interest rates .
He said the central bank 's mandate must include responsibility for averting a meltdown in the financial and economic system .
" Of course the issue is about the availability of credit , but it's also about official interest rates and the implications for mortgage borrowers and small businesses , " he said .
The Bank of England meets this week to decide on interest rate policy .
Many economists expect a cut from the current rate of 5 % .

Hardly a day goes by at the n-Category Cafe without operads being mentioned .
So it 's time to write some code illustrating them .
Let 's define a simple tree type : Sometimes we want to apply a function to every element of the tree .
That 's provided by themember of thetype class .
But just as we can't use map to apply monadic functions to a list ( we 'd write ) , we can't use fmap to apply them to our tree .
What we need is a monadic version of .
Here 's a suitable type class : ( I could have used Data .
Traversable but that entails Data .
Foldable and that 's too much work . )
And now we can implement a monadic version of 'sinstance :
We can useto extract the list of elements of a container type :
Not only doessuck out the elements of a container , it also spits out an empty husk in which all of the elements have been replaced by .
We can think of the latter as the ' shape ' of the original structure with the original elements removed .
We can formalise this asSo we have : Keeping the shape around allows is to invertto give : ( That 's a bit like using the supply monad .
This function also returns the leftovers . )
We can also write ( apologies for the slightly cryptic use of the writer monad ) : Let 's try an example .
Here 's an empty tree :
We can pack a bunch of integers into it :
And get them back out again : separates the shape from the data , something you can read lots more about at Barry Jay 's web site .
Remember that trees are also monads Theoperation for a tree grafts the elements of a tree of trees back into the tree .
Right , that 's enough about trees and shapes for now .
Operads are a bit like the plumbing involved in installing a sprinkler system .
Suppose you have a piece , A that splits a single pipe into two :
And you have two more pipes B and C that look like this : then you can ' compose ' them to make a larger system like this : ( Vim rectangular mode FTW ! )
The important thing to note here is that as A had two outputs ( or inputs , depending on your point of view ) you can attach two more pieces , like B and C , directly to it .
Call the number of outlets the ' degree ' of the system .
If A has degree n then we can attach n more systems , A...Ato it and the resulting system will have degree degree ( A ) +...+ degree( A ) .
We can write the result as A ( A , ... , A ) .
We also have the ' identity ' pipe that looks like this : Formally , an operad is a collection of objects , each of which has a ' degree ' that 's an integer n , n≥0 , depending on your application ) , an identity element of degree 1 , and a composition law : is the composition operation .
If f has degree n then we can apply it to a list of n more objects .
So we only expect to evaluatesuccessfully if There are many identities we 'd expect to hold .
For example , because adding plain sections of pipe has no effect .
We also expect some associativity conditions coming from the fact that it does n't matter what order we build a pipe assembly in , it 'll still function the same way .
We can follow this pipe metaphor quite closely to define what I think of as the prototype Operad .
Ais a function that takes n inputs of type a and returns one of type a .
As we can't easily introspect and find out how many arguments such a function expects , we also store the degree of the function with the function : is a kind of inverse to .
You give a list of integers and it chops up a list into pieces with lengths corresponding to your integers .
We use this to unpack the arguments tointo pieces suitable for the elements ofto consume .
Now compute an example , f( f , f , f ) applied to [ 1,2,3 ] .
It should give 1+1+2*3=8 .
( That 's a lot like lambda calculus without names .
Operads are a bit like n-ary combinators . )
Now I 'm going to introduce a different looking operad .
Think ofas representing schemes for dicing the real line .
Here are some examples :
If A divides up the real line into n pieces then you could divide up each of the n pieces using their own schemes .
This means that dicing schemes compose .
So if we define A , B and C as : Then A ( B , C ) is :
We could implementas a list of real numbers , but it 's more fun to generalise to any monoid and not worry about divisions summing to 1 : This becomes an operad by allowing the monoid value in a ' parent ' scheme multiply the values in a ' child ' .
For example , if dcuts the real line in half , and dcuts it into thirds , then d(d , d ) will cut it into five pieces of lengths
1/4,1/4,1/6,1/6,1/6:
If the elements in aare non-negative and sum to 1 we can think of them as probability distributions .
The composition A ( A , ... ,A ) is the distribution of all possible outcomes you can get by selecting a value i in the range { 1..n} using distribution A and then selecting a secondvalue conditionally from distribution A . We connect with the recent n- category post on entropy .
In fact we can compute the entropy of a distrbution as follows :
We can now look at the ' aside ' in that post .
From an element ofwe can produce a function that computes a corresponding linear combination ( at least fortypes ) :
We can now compute the entropy of a distribution in two different ways :
Now according to this paper on operads we can build a monad from an operad .
Here 's the construction :
( The field names are n't from the paper but they do give away what 's actually going on ... )
The idea is that an element of this construction consists of an element of the operad of degree n , and an n element list .
It 's a functor in an obvious way :
It 's also aWe can make the construction a monad as follows :
Now for something to be a monad there are various laws that needs to be satisfied .
These follow from the rules ( which I have n't explicitly stated ) for an operad .
When I first looked at that paper I was confused - it seemed that the operad part and the list part did n't interact with each other .
And then I suddenly realised what was happening .
But hang on for a moment ... Tree shapes make nice operads .
The composition rule just grafts child trees into the leaves of the parent :
We can write that more generically so it works with more than trees : > data OperadWrapper m = O { unO :: Shape m
}So let 's use the construction above to make a monad .
But what actually is this monad ?
Each element is a pair with ( 1 ) a tree shape of degree n and ( 2 ) an n-element list .
In other words , it 's just a serialised tree .
We can define these isomorphisms to make that clearer : So , for example : That construction wo n't work for all monads , just those monads that come from operads .
I 'll leave you to characterise those .
And now we have it : a way to think about operads from a computational perspective .
They 're the shapes of certain monadic serialisable containers .
Operadic composition is the just the same grafting operation used in theoperation , using valuesas the graft points .
I have a few moments spare so let 's actually do something with an operad .
First we need the notion of a free operad .
This is basically just a set of ' pipe ' parts that we can stick together with no equations holding apart from those inherent in the definition of an operad .
This is different from theoperad where many different ways of apply theoperator can result in the same result .
We can use any set of parts , as long as we can associate an integer with each part :
The free operad structure is just a tree : will be the identity , but it will also serve as a ' terminator ' like the way there 's always aat the end of a list .
An easy way to make a single part an element of an operad :
Here 's the instance : Now I 'm going to use this to make an operad and then a monad :
What we get is a lot like the probability monad except it does n't give the final probabilities .
Instead , it gives the actual tree of possibilities .
( I must also point out this hpaste by wli . )
Now we can ' flattten ' this tree so that the leaves have the final probabilities :
This is a morphism of operads .
( You can probably guess the definition of such a thing . )
It induces a morphism of monads : will give you the final probabilities .
There may just be a possible application of this stuff .
The point of separating shape from data is performance .
You can store all of your data in flat arrays and do most of your work there .
It means you can write fast tight loops and only rebuild the original datatype if needed at the end .
If you 're lucky you can precompute the shape of the result , allowing you to preallocate a suitable chunk of memory for your final answer to go into .
What the operad does is allow you to extend this idea to monadic computations , for suitable monads .
If the ' shape ' of the computation is independent of the details of the computation , you can use an operad to compute that shape , and then compute the contents of the corresponding array separately .
If you look at the instance foryou 'll see that the part of the computation that deals with the data is simply aBTW
In some papers the definition restricts the degree to ≥ 1 .
But that 's less convenient for computer science applications .
If it really bothers you then you can limit yourself to thinking about containers that contain at least one element .

We are hearing reports that Mike Mulvaney , running for SC state senate , is making gay baiting robo calls .
( oh by the way , robo calls in SC are illegal ) .
That is , someone associated with him is making calls purporting to come from a gay rights organization in SC endorsing his opponent .
Only this org does n't exist .
Something like this occurred last Fall in Kentucky with the Governor 's race .
A robo call went out purporting to be from a gay rights organization supporting a specific candidate .
Only the gay rights organization had nothing to do with it .
This was the content of that call last Fall :
For the first time in 20 years , the homosexual lobby proudly endorses a Kentucky candidate for governor : Steve Beshear .
Beshear is receiving major support from out - of - state gay activists and has publicly committed to same - gender relationships , employment of more homosexuals in state government including teachers , and support for homosexual adoption of children .
If you believe these rights are fair please vote for Steve Beshear for governor .
Visit Fairness.org .
Now comes a report of the following gay baiting robo call in South Carolina ( where robo calls are illegal ) .
Here is the transcript :
Hi , this is Allison calling from the Alliance for the Advancement of Gays and Lesbians .
We are a pro-gay rights , pro-choice grassroots organization .
I am calling to let you know that we are supporting Mandy Powers Norrell in the state Senate
A proven Democrat , Mandy Powers Norrell supports homosexual unions and abortion rights .
We can count on Mandy Powers Norrell to promote a progressive agenda in the state Senate and to fight the right wing fringe at every turn .
Again , this is Allison with the Alliance for the Advancement of Gays and Lesbians asking you to vote for Democrat Mandy Powers Norrell on Tuesday , November 4 .
Thank you .

Luckily the Obama - Biden team has learned from the mistakes of 2004 and the Swiftboat ploy .
The gloves are off .
The veil of decency has been pierced ( as if it had n't been already ) .
And Obama - Biden is fighting back - hard .
If guilt by association is a tactic that McCain - Palin want to play , then turnabout is fair play .
Too bad McCain - Palin did n't think about the potential responses .
Very bad Game Theory !
And apparently , they forgot about John McCain 's pal , Charles H. Keating , Jr. Not wasting any time , today the Obama - Biden team unveiled their new Keating Economics web site .
But you already knew that .
Now , some of you may be disappointed with the negative attack from Obama - Biden regarding the Keating scandal - it 's old news , it 's not a current issue , McCain was never charged with a crime .
But Obama too was never charged with any crime .
And there is a modern moral to the Keating story - we are repeating the same mistakes of the 1980s S&L crisis and then some .
And who forgot his own mistakes and helped make them again ?
John McCain of course .
And at $ 700 Billion ( or more ) , today 's banking crisis is even bigger than the formerly gargantuan S&L scandal .
McCain and his Republican friends in the Senate may have forgotten about the dangers of irresponsible deregulation in banking , but we should n't .
And the Obama - Biden team has n't either .
And that 's why it 's important to remember Charles Keating 's Lincoln Savings and Loan failure .
We 're repeating that history right now .
Let 's not let this happen a third time .
Help fight the McCain - Palin smears .
Today , is the final day to register new voters in many key states like Ohio , Virginia , and Florida .
And let 's not forget some Senate battlegrounds like Kentucky , Colorado , Mississippi , and Georgia .
If you 're pounding the pavement to get Blue Voters registered , you may only have a few hours left to get registrations postmarked .
And help give the boot to McCain 's Republican allies in the Senate .
There are several key races where Democrats are close to victory but need help on the ground , and financially .
And do n't forget to hit the recommend button !
America Pays the Piper , Big Time After a 28 - year binge of drunken optimism and blind nationalism – often punctuated by chants of “ USA , USA ! ” and “ We ’re No. 1 ! ” – Americans are waking up with a painful hangover , facing a grim “ morning in America , ” not the happy vision that Ronald Reagan famously sold them on .

As the United States begins to assess how the nation got into its trillion - dollar bailout mess , a true understanding must go back three decades or so when Reagan deployed his well - honed communications skills and the Republican Right mastered the dark arts of propaganda to get the American people to shed the annoying strictures of rationality .
In the 1970s , there had been stumbling efforts by three presidents – Richard Nixon , Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter – to begin confronting stubborn structural problems , such as a growing dependence on foreign oil , environmental damage , and excessive military spending which had sapped resources away from a productive economy .
Nixon helped create the Environmental Protection Agency ; he imposed energy - conservation measures ; he opened the diplomatic door to communist China ; and he initiated “ détente ” with the Soviet Union .
But his presidency foundered on the rocks of his political paranoia that led to the Watergate scandal .
President Ford tried to continue many of Nixon ’s policies , particularly winding down the Cold War with Moscow and slimming down the bloated Pentagon budget , which had fed what President Dwight Eisenhower dubbed the “ military - industrial complex . ”
However , confronting a rebellion from Reagan ’s Republican Right in 1976 , Ford abandoned “ détente ” ; he let hard - line Cold Warriors ( and a first wave of young intellectuals called neoconservatives ) pressure the CIA ’s analytical division ; and he brought in a new generation of tough - minded operatives , such as Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld .
After winning in 1976 , President Carter injected more respect for human rights into U.S. foreign policy , a move some scholars believe put an important nail in the coffin of the Soviet Union , leaving it hard - pressed to justify its repressive internal practices .
At home , Carter proposed a comprehensive energy policy and warned Americans that their growing dependence on foreign oil represented a national security threat of the first order , what he called “ the moral equivalent of war . ”
However , powerful vested interests managed to exploit the shortcomings of all three of these presidents to sabotage any sustained progress .
For instance , Carter ’s prescient energy address was widely mocked as the “ MEOW speech . ”
Soon , the American people were persuaded to turn away from their real - world challenges and enter a land of make - believe .
Do n’t worry , they were told .
Be happy .
Reagan as Piper
The lead piper in this parade away from America ’s tough choices was Ronald Reagan who insisted in his First Inaugural Address in 1981 that “ government is not the solution to our problem ; government is the problem . ”
As President , Reagan attacked the federal regulatory system and cut taxes so recklessly that his budget director , David Stockman , foresaw red ink “ as far as the eye can see . ”
Reagan also justified fattening the Pentagon ’s budget by citing dire warnings that the Soviet Union was on the rise ( despite CIA analysis at the time that it was in sharp decline ) .
To marginalize dissent , Reagan and his subordinates stoked anger toward anyone who challenged the era ’s feel - good optimism .
Skeptics were not just honorable critics , they were un-American defeatists or – in Jeane Kirkpatrick ’s memorable attack line – they would “ blame America first . ”
Under Reagan , a right - wing infrastructure also took shape , linking new media outlets ( magazines , newspapers , books , etc. ) with well - financed think tanks that churned out endless op - eds .
Plus , there were attack groups that went after mainstream journalists who dared disclose information that poked holes in Reagan ’s propaganda themes .
Significantly , too , Reagan credentialed a new generation of neocon intellectuals , who pioneered a concept called “ perception management , ” the shaping of how Americans saw , understood – and were frightened by – threats from abroad .
Many honest reporters saw their careers damaged when they resisted the lies and distortions of the Reagan administration .
Likewise , U.S. intelligence analysts were purged when they refused to bend to the propaganda demands from above .
[ See Robert Parry ’s Lost History . ]
In effect , Reagan ’s team created a faux reality for the American public .
Civil wars in Central America between impoverished peasants and wealthy oligarchs became an East - West showdown .
U.S. - backed insurgents in Nicaragua , Angola and Afghanistan were transformed from corrupt , brutal ( often drug - tainted ) thugs into noble “ freedom - fighters . ”
While Reagan played the role of the nation ’s kindly grandfather , his operatives refined their skills at dividing the American people , using “ wedge issues ” to deepen grievances especially among white men who were encouraged to see themselves as victims of “ reverse discrimination ” and “ political correctness . ”
Yet even as working - class white men were rallying to the Republican banner ( as so - called “ Reagan Democrats ” ) , their economic interests were being savaged .
Unions were broken and marginalized ; “ free trade ” policies shipped manufacturing jobs abroad ; old neighborhoods were decaying ; drug use among the young was soaring .
Wall Street Greed Meanwhile , unprecedented greed was unleashed on Wall Street , fraying old - fashioned bonds between company owners and employees .
Before Reagan , corporate CEOs earned less than 50 times the salary of an average worker .
By the end of the Reagan - Bush - I administrations in 1993 , the average CEO salary was more than 100 times that of a typical worker .
( That CEO - salary figure is now more than 250 times that of an average worker . )
The era ’s financial imbalances had other effects .
Bloated with hundreds of billions of new dollars , the military - industrial complex recycled some of that money back into right - wing and neocon think tanks , which then justified more spending on “ defense . ”
The super - wealthy finance industry kicked back money to both Republicans and Democrats – as well as to friendly think tanks – to ensure that “ free - market ” ideology flourished and regulatory “ barriers ” were removed in the name of progress .
Much of this momentum continued through Bill Clinton ’s presidency .
Indeed , some of Clinton 's biggest achievements involved collaborating with congressional Republicans on deregulation and trade agreements initiated during the Reagan - Bush - I era .
In the 1990s , the Republican Right also continued building its media infrastructure , expanding into talk radio , TV and the Internet .
By contrast , the American Left mostly ignored building media , making the Right ’s investment even more striking since defense of liberal positions nearly disappeared from large swaths of the nation .
[ See Parry ’s Secrecy & Privilege . ]
The consequences of this imbalance became more obvious when the right - wing media and the Republican congressional majority harassed Clinton through the final years of his presidency .
Increasingly , the mainstream press joined in , bending to the dominance of the conservative message .
Although Clinton still managed to turn the gigantic federal deficit into a surplus , his presidency was rated as a disappointment , if not an embarrassment .
In Campaign 2000 , the media ’s hostility was transferred to Democrat Al Gore , with distortions about Gore appearing in the New York Times and the Washington Post as well as the New York Post and the Washington Times .
[ See Neck Deep . ]
Meanwhile , Republican George W. Bush – though a plutocrat born to privilege – was pitched to the voters as some sort of everyman .
He was praised , too , for surrounding himself with “ adults , ” such as Cheney and Rumsfeld .
When Gore still managed to beat Bush in the national popular vote and stood a good chance of overcoming Bush ’s narrow lead in the swing state of Florida , much of the U.S. press corps acted as if Bush deserved the White House and that Gore should concede .
An unprecedented intervention by five conservative Republicans on the U.S. Supreme Court stopping a court - ordered recount in Florida was welcomed by much of the American news media , which saw its principal role as protecting Bush ’s fragile “ legitimacy ” and uniting the country behind his presidency .
That attitude grew stronger after the 9/11 attacks when the major news organizations wanted to demonstrate their “ patriotism ” in line with rank - and - file Americans .
The Bush - Cheney power grabs after 9/11 received scant media criticism as did the run-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Like in the Reagan era , the neocons played a key role with their “ perception management , ” painting the “ war on terror ” as a frightening conflict between good and evil , in which Islamic militants “ hate our freedoms ” and seek to hem in the United States with a “ caliphate ” stretching from Spain to Indonesia .
The hyping of this Islamic threat fit with the neocon exaggerated depiction of the Soviet menace in the 1980s – and again the propaganda strategy worked .
Many Americans let their emotions run wild , from the hunger for revenge after 9/11 to the war fever over Iraq .
When old allies like France urged caution , angry Americans poured French wine into gutters and renamed “ French fries ” as “ Freedom fries . ”
When the rare expert dared question Bush ’s case for war – as former weapons inspector Scott Ritter did – the major media joined in attacking the skeptic ’s patriotism .
Arguably , the descent into this dark fantasyland – that Ronald Reagan began in the early 1980s – reached its nadir in the flag - waving early days of the Iraq War , but the journey continued .
It carried the country through Campaign 2004 when John Kerry ’s Vietnam War heroism was mocked and he was dismissed as “ looking French . ”
Reality began to reassert itself with the bloody insurgency that resulted from Bush ’s conquest of Iraq and with his administration ’s inept response when Hurricane Katrina flooded New Orleans .
Gradually , Americans were waking up from a long sleepwalk , but the nation still stumbled from disaster to disaster , from an exploding federal debt to the bursting of the real - estate bubble to the fact that the anti-regulatory fervor has left the country on the brink of a new Great Depression .
Ironically , many of the same Wall Street hotshots who had so disdained government – whose high - flying lifestyle was built on Reagan ’s ideology that “ government is the problem ” – now found themselves turning to Washington for a $ 700 billion bailout .
But the future remains unclear .
One might think that the American people would now be wide awake , having learned their lessons and eager to throw out both the neocons , who engineered the foreign policy debacles abroad , and the anti-regulators , who precipitated the economic catastrophe at home .
Yet the perception managers appear to have at least one more trick up their sleeves .
They are turning John McCain , the self - proclaimed foot soldier of the Reagan revolution who championed the neocon cause overseas and the deregulators ’ schemes in the domestic economy , into a reformer who can change the system .
If recent opinion polls are to be believed , tens of millions of Americans still want to believe .

WASILLA , Alaska --
With all the controversies swirling around the meteoric rise of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , there has been one constant by her side : her unassuming husband .
As Gov. Palin told the world when Arizona Sen .
John McCain introduced her as his running mate Friday , she and her husband were celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary that day .
" I had promised Todd a little surprise for the anniversary present , and hopefully he knows that I did deliver , " the beaming governor said as her husband stood by smiling .

Après la tempête de la crise , Sarko ne revient pas à la case de l’effort national et reste pompier occupé par l’incendie de la maison capitaliste ...
La France découvrira aujourd ’hui , 20 octobre , une compilation de propositions que comporte le plan « France numérique 2012 » .
Dans le contexte de crise , ce programme n’a pas été révélé il y a une semaine ...
Considéré comme l’un des axes de relance économique des pays développés , car l’industrie traditionnelle est désormais entre les mains des pays émergeants , les technologies de pointe ouvrent de nouvelles et réelles perspectives ...
Mais aussi culturelles .
Avec 6 % de son PIB , alors qu’à titre d’exemple 13 % aux USA et bien plus de 17 % en Corée pour ne citer que deux cas de nations de son rang , la France est à la traîne en matière d’économie numérique .
Pourtant du fait de la teneur culturelle de la technologie partout envahissante , la francophonie entre autres segments qui permet au pays de rayonner universellement , ce retard est désormais une urgence pour répondre aux nouvelles batailles économiques que se livrent les puissances dans le monde .
Aux pays dits développés , il ne reste que de se consacrer pleinement aux innovations .
Du fait que les activités traditionnelles d’industrie sont transférées aux pays émergeants .
Là où savoir électronique et applications techniques s’associent , les pays comme la France ont de nouveaux champs encore inabordables par d’autres .
La France découvrira aujourd ’hui un ensemble de propositions à travers le plan « France numérique 2012 » .
Par lequel s’affichera une ambition égale aux objectifs atteints ailleurs avec ces outils ultramodernes .
Et , par bien des bouchées doubles , il sera mis sur rails des chantiers générateurs de revenus ainsi que d’entreprenables labeurs ayant des objectifs concrets d’emplois et de croissance .
Considéré jusqu’à là , en ces jours de phobie plutôt et strictement occidentale devant la récession imparable , secondaire par rapport à la crise financière .
Cette dernière est finalement identifiée sous sa vérité évidente d’un effondrement du capitalisme mercantile .
Le projet " France numérique 2012 " est présenté finalement en fin de matinée de ce 20 octobre .
Après que l’intervention du président Sarkozy , initialement prévue le lundi 13 octobre a été reportée sans aucune précision .
Puis la conférence de presse d’Eric Besson , le secrétaire d’Etat au développement de l’économie numérique , prévue en après - midi du même jour fut , elle aussi dans un premier temps , à cause de la réunion extraordinaire du gouvernement à la même plage horaire , différée au lendemain mardi .
Ni l’une ni l’autre , zappées par la houle de la panique face à ne ruine économique .
Et rendez - vous a été donné au 20 du même mois si aucun aléa ne vienne …
L’exposé , du chef de l’Etat , rendra public les 151 mesures élaborées et déjà formulées par le ministre concerné , nous y voilà .
Propager l’usage à 99 % le haut débit pour Internet à échéance du projet , qui est le but phare , soulève le lourd dossier de l’accessibilité de l’outil Web à toute la population afin de réparer la fracture numérique entre catégorie nantie et celle au pouvoir d’achat méritant d’être renfloué .
Plus attendu par les citoyens et les observateurs préoccupés de ce volet de la communication sociétale , le pays tourne actuellement à 64 % des foyers équipés d’ordinateurs .
Très dépendant de la fibre optique où la France est un leader très en vue en ce qui concerne la maîtrise de cette technologie , mais souffrant d’un déficit d’installation assez marquant , a seulement 54,2 des usagers qui disposent du haut débit .
Ils étaient 44 % en 2007 , ce qui est déjà un bon considérable qui ne peut aller bien plus loin sans une action d’envergure .
Sur ce dernier point , la Corée en fin d’année 2009 sera couverte à 99 % .
Notons que le haut débit multiplie par 5 , soit le flux de 100 gigas bits .
Les estimations avancent 10 milliards d’euros d’investissements source d’emplois et d’une activité économique pour sa réalisation .
Ce coût incombe aux collectivités locales et à la caisse des dépôts et des consignations .
Et dont les réseaux seront par la suite , loués à des opérateurs privés , de quoi voir de nouveaux revenus publics .
L’autre volet de ce plan est la révélation des soutiens , aux plus démunis , concernant la généralisation de la TNT .
Elle bute inéluctablement sur l’extinction de la radio et de télévision analogique en 2011 .
Et pour laquelle se posent aussi les conditions de ce redéploiement , particulièrement de la TV , sachant que nombreux foyers ne peuvent pas s’équiper des récepteurs .
L’essentiel de « France numérique 2012 » comporte :
1- Pour la téléphonie mobile , une 4ème licence sera proposée l’année prochaine .
Elle créera un nouvel opérateur , histoire d’élargir la concurrence .
2- La vente liée en matière de télévision sera réduite .
Un abonné d’un autre fournisseur peut accéder à certains programmes sous monopole de leur acquéreur principal .
Comme le cas du championnat de ligue 1 de football , entre les mains du fournisseur " Orange " et qui n’est visible que pour sa clientèle .
3- L’acquisition d’ordinateur et d’une connexion Internet , accompagnée d’une formation , devrait coûter 1 € par jour aux plus démunis .
4- Les travailleurs payés par chèque emploi service , peuvent régler par ce type de compensations salariales .
5- L’administration pourra laisser à ses employés le matériel renouvelé .
6- Le recyclage des équipements est encouragé .
7- Une structure dite « Ordi. 2.0 » sera créée pour commercialiser des ordinateurs remis à neuf .
Enfin de nouvelles fréquences seront proposées aux opérateurs ( télé , radio et Internet mobile ) .
Elles sont estimées entre 1,5 et 2 milliards .
La télé mobile par satellite sera lancée en 2009 .

The bigger issue is that the bill effectively creates protections not just for the Treasury , but for the executives on Wall Street who created this near Armageddon .
Mr. Rosner says that the draft bill “ prevents judicial review that could allow the protection of decisions that create false marks , hide prior marks , or could be used to prevent civil or criminal prosecution in situations where a management knowingly provided false marks that aided the growth of this crisis of confidence . ”
False marks  using mark - to - market accounting to hide the true value of security , rather than disclose it honestly  has a lot to do with why Jeffrey Skilling , the former Enron chief executive , is in jail .

It is absolutely true , of course , that Mr. Paulson needed to do something .
By Thursday afternoon , less than 48 hours after the bailout of the American International Group , the financial system was near meltdown .
The mere rumor that Mr. Paulson and the Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke were devising a big bailout fund cause the stock market to soar .
In truth , I ’m not sure I agree with Mr. Rosner ’s assessment of Mr. Paulson ’s job performance .
I think he is one of the most competent Treasury secretaries we ’ve ever had , and it is hard to imagine anyone else handling this crisis any better .
His predecessors , who lacked his grounding in the world of high finance , would most likely have been like deer in headlights .
And when Mr. Paulson says , as he did on all the talk shows on Sunday , “ I hate the fact that we have to do it , but it ’s better than the alternative , ” I believe him .
( It would have looked better , of course , if he had come up with this plan before it looked as if his former firm , Goldman Sachs , was in jeopardy . )
But the question on the table now is whether the government ’s latest response to this crisis  the way it has been constructed , and frankly , the way it is being crammed down everyone ’s throat at the eleventh hour  is the right approach .
Already the market has its doubts ; just look at its performance on Monday .
With colleges back in session and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin on board as the Republican vice presidential nominee , social conservatives are intensifying efforts to woo young voters , a demographic they once all but conceded to the Democrats .
Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama has long enjoyed a huge edge among college students and voters in their 20s .
Republicans now are seeing their first real chance to make inroads with that group .
The key : Young voters may see the 44 - year - old Gov. Palin as in tune with their concerns ...
Spotting a flash of colour in the water , the whitetailed sea eagle swoops .
Eyes fixed on her prey , her powerful curved beak breaks through the surface and lifts the prize .
A yellow tennis ball .
For a bird of prey whose every instinct is honed to seek out a more appetising catch , a soggy ball might seem a poor reward .
But four - year - old Evie loves nothing more than a game of fetch .
And there is a reward – every time the magnificent bird with an 8ft wingspan retrieves the ball , falconer George Hedges gives her a piece of fish , or a tempting morsel of rabbit or day - old chick .
On the ball : Evie the Eagle gets stuck into her game of fetch
White - tailed eagles became extinct in Britain in the early 1900s , although after a re-introduction scheme there are now a few in Scotland .
Evie , however , was bred in captivity in Belgium and moved to Mr Hedges ' Dartmoor - based falconry , Devon 's Eagles , when she was two years old .
All the birds there – including owls , hawks and falcons – are exercised constantly .
But Mr Hedges makes sure they also get some ' playtime ' .
It was one day last month that Evie suddenly took flight , dropped over a mystery object and then returned with a tennis ball gripped in her beak .
She 's off !
Evie spreads her wings as falconer Mr Hedges follows
Seeing her prey , she drops down to the surface of the water
Gotcha !
She grasps the ball with her huge curved beak
Flapping her wings , which span eight feet , she regains the air
Keeping a firm grip on the prized ball , she takes off
Mission accomplished , now where 's my reward ?
Best of friends : George and Evie
' I could n't believe it , ' said Mr Hedges .
' I gave her some food and threw the ball and she chased it again .
' Then I wondered if I threw it in the pond whether she would fetch it and she did .
' Ever since it 's been her ball .
This is very , very unusual . '
Evie is now happy to fetch her ball – even catching it in midair – as long as Mr Hedges is happy to keep throwing it .
As the name suggests , white - tailed sea eagles have a distinctive white tail .
Young birds , however , have much darker plumage .
Eventually , Evie 's tail will become completely white and the rest of her feathers will become a paler brown .
She weighs about 12lb and eats 8 - 10 oz a day on a diet designed to maintain her weight .
In the wild the birds may weigh as much as 20lb .

We remind you that the Facebook Messenger is a separate application from the Facebook App .
The developers have decided to separate Facebook with a new application that is handling the private conversations , voice / video calls etc .
We remind you that the old Facebook application was allowing you to send private messages to your Facebook friends , but it was quite limited .
However , the new Facebook Messenger allows you to send emoji , make free voice / video calls , send text messages , files and many other useful things .
We have to mention that the Facebook Messenger app is FREE , but you will need an account on the Facebook platform in order to use it .
The developers are also continuously working on the application and they will bring some new features and options in the near future .
Facebook Messenger 115.0.0.22.69 For Android : Features
Ability to share videos and photos ;
Ability to create and join group chats ;
Free Voice and Video Calls ;
Ability to use emoji , stickers and GIFs ;
Ability to preview your videos / photos gallery ( without leaving the conversation ) and send the ones that you want to the private / group conversation ;
Ability to record voice messages .
Facebook Messenger 115.0.0.22.69 : How To Install On Your Android Device
The Facebook Messenger 115.0.0.22.69 can be downloaded and installed directly from the Google Play Store .
All you will need to do is to open the official Android store , search for Facebook 115.0.0.22.69 and tap on the “ INSTALL ” or “ UPDATE ” button .
Around eight per cent of 10 to 12 - year - olds in cities are now thought to be obese and another 15 per cent are overweight .

Short after posting how to get django - rcsfield running , Marty Alchin posted to mention AuditTrail , and ask if I could see any compelling reasons to use something like django - rcsfield instead of AuditTrail .
If you look at the two , they perform very similar services :
django - rcsfield uses a variety of version control systems ( Git , Bazaar , Subversion ) to maintain a complete version history of a textfield .
AuditTrail uses the database to maintain a complete version history of a model ( although it does n't necessarily play well with relations ) .
Last night I set up an app I am working on to use django - rcsfield , and it took a bit of sleuthing to understand .
On the other hand , just now I was able to replace django - rcsfield with AuditTrail in about five minutes .
Where rcsfield was opening up weird cross-platform issues related to Git , AuditTrail just worked .
Where rcsfield was causing my small vps to lag horribly - - again -- AuditTrail just worked .
I can imagine some specific situations where having the full power of merging , cloning , branching , etc , would be a real asset , but I suspect such apps are a small minority of all the applications that benefit from some degree of versioning .
For those not in that small bucket , AuditTrail seems like the best existing solution .
Setting AuditTrail up was a few short steps :
Paste the code at the bottom of the AuditTrail wiki entry into a file named audit.py , somewhere in your Python path .
Import audit.py in your models .
py file .
from django.db import models import audit Add an AuditTrail field to your model definition .
class MyModel ( models .
Model ) : title = models .
CharField ( max_length = 200 ) text = models .
Text Field ( ) history = audit .
AuditTrail () Sync your database .
python manage .py syncdb Profit . >>> from models import MyModel >>>
MyModel .
create ( title = " hi " , text = " some value " ) >>> a = MyModel . objects . all ( ) [ 0 ] >>> a . text = " some other value " >>> a . save ( ) >>> a . history .
count () 2 >>> a . history . all ( ) [ 0 ] . text " some other value " >>> a . history . all ( ) [ 1 ] . text " some value "
Although I really appreciate the hard work that has gone into django - rcsfield , I think that AuditTrail is simply an easier approach to versioning data at this point in time .
I do think there is room in the world for both of these approaches , and that some apps will benefit more from using django - rcsfield than AuditTrail , but I 'd recommend starting with AuditTrail and only transitioning over if and when circumstances demand it .
Hopefully both of these projects will continue to improve , but for the time being AuditTrail is the way to go unless you need more advanced VCS functionality like merging , pushing , pulling or cloning .
The economy shrank for the first time in 16 years between July and September , confirming that the UK is on the brink of recession .
Output fell by 0.5 % , according to the Office for National Statistics , a bigger - than - expected drop , knocking UK shares and weakening the pound .
The UK will be classed as being in recession if the economy slows in the fourth quarter as well .
The Prime Minister said other countries must play a part fighting the slowdown .
' Once - in - a - lifetime crisis '
" This is a global financial recession and we 're fighting it every way we know how , " Gordon Brown said .
" But we need other countries to work with us and that 's what I 'm also spending my time making sure other countries take the action that we 're taking to stop this becoming worse . "

He said the government was putting more money into people 's pockets - including an increase of the winter allowance for pensioners and a £ 120 tax cut for basic taxpayers .
The fall in UK output has been blamed on the credit crunch , falling house prices and rising energy prices , which have forced consumers to tighten their belts .
Charlie Bean , deputy governor of the Bank of England 's rate - setting committee , the MPC , described it as a " once in a lifetime crisis and possibly the largest financial crisis of its kind in human history " .
UK shares tumbled further on the news , closing down 5 % .
The pound was also affected , falling to $ 1.52 before recovering to $ 1.5889 - the first time it has fallen below $ 1.60 in the past five years .
Shock fall
The 0.5 % fall in economic output is far greater than predicted and increases expectations of further interest rate cuts from the current level of 4.5 % to ignite growth .
What 's the real impact of the economic slowdown ?
BBC
News is taking the temperature across the UK in a special day of coverage
Special report :
The downturn
It is the biggest drop in UK gross domestic product ( GDP ) since the first quarter of 1990 .
The services sector - which represents three quarters of the UK economy - fell 0.4 % , the biggest drop in 18 years .
Within the services sector , hotels and restaurants saw the biggest fall , down 1.7 % , compared with an increase of 0.2 % in the previous quarter .
Manufacturing output fell 1 % while construction tumbled 0.8 % compared to the previous quarter .
Market fear
This is the day that the recession became real
David Cameron MP , Conservative leader
More downturn reaction Analysts expressed their shock at the news and their desire for aggressive rate cuts .
Business group CBI said the figures were worse than expected and called for rates to be cut by half a percentage point at the next meeting of the MPC .
" My comment to traders is dive , dive , dive , " said Societe Generale 's Brian Hilliard .
" It is a very emphatic entry into recession which underlines the need for dramatic rate cuts , which we think the Bank of England will deliver . "
He anticipated rates dropping to 2.5 % by the middle of next year .
Rates could go as low as 3 % by the middle of next year and possibly even lower , said UBS analyst Amit Kara .
" The risks are that this is going to be a pretty severe recession . "
Return to 1990s ?
BBC economics editor Hugh Pym said the figures raised fears we could be in for a recession very like the one in the early 1990s when unemployment hit three million .
He said it was unlikely to be just a technical recession ( two consecutive quarters of negative growth ) , but could be a year or so of negative growth .
But the difference now is that interest rates are much lower , he added .
Deputy bank governor Charlie Bean told the Scarborough Evening News that the bank 's independence - and ability to set monetary policy - meant that the UK was in a better position than in the early 1990s .
Hard rain DEFINING A RECESSION
A recession is widely accepted as a decline in a country 's domestic economic output or GDP for at least two consecutive quarters
The layman 's finance crisis glossary Q&A : What is a recession ?
Opposition politicians criticised the government for its handling of the financial crisis .
" Well , this is the day that the recession became real .
We 've had 10 years of being told no more boom and bust , 10 years of a government not putting aside money for a rainy day .
Well that rainy day has now come , " he said , calling for more support for businesses , " David Cameron , the leader of the Conservatives , said .
The Liberal Democrats called for tax cuts for the poor and more interest rate cuts .
" These growth figures show that the credit crunch is hitting the real economy and harder and faster than was first feared , " said Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg .

Scientists at the University of Leicester , where genetic ' fingerprinting ' was invented by Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys , say they are developing techniques which may one day allow police to work out someone ’s surname from DNA alone .
Research by Turi King has shown that , unsurprisingly , men with the same British surname are highly likely to be genetically linked even in today 's multicultural world .
The results of her research have implications in the fields of forensics , genealogy , epidemiology and the history of surnames .
On Wednesday 8th October Dr King will present the key findings of her Ph.D. research in which she recruited over two and a half thousand men bearing over 500 different surnames to take part in the study .
Carried out in Professor Mark Jobling ’s lab , Dr Turi King ’s research involved exploring this potential link between surname and Y chromosome type .
Dr King said : “ In Britain , surnames are passed down from father to son .
A piece of our DNA , the Y chromosome , is the one part of our genetic material that confers maleness and is passed , like surnames , from father to son .
Therefore , a link could exist between a man ’s surname and the type of Y chromosome he carries .
A simple link between name and Y chromosome could in principle connect all men sharing a surname into one large family tree .
“ However , in reality the link may not be so clear cut .
Hereditary surnames in Britain are many hundreds of years old and each name may have had several founders .
Events such as adoptions , name - changes and non-paternities would confuse any simple genetic link .
“ These days , using genetic techniques , it is possible to tell Y chromosomes apart from one another so we wondered if you might find that a particular surname was associated with a particular Y chromosome type . ”
Dr King said there were a number of factors which could break the link between surnames and Y chromosome type : for example , there could have been more than one person , known as a surname founder , who took on a surname at the time of surname formation around 700 years ago .
She said : “ The surname Smith is a good example of this as it derives from the occupation of blacksmith so many men could have taken on the surname Smith .
This means that instead of just one type of Y chromosome being associated with a surname , many different types of Y chromosomes would be associated with this single surname .
On the other hand , for rarer names , there may have been just one founder for the name and potentially all men who bear that surname today would be descended from him and could be connected into one large family tree . ”
“ The link between surname and Y chromosome type could also be broken through events such as adoption or illegitimacy : in this instance , a male child would have one man ’s surname but another man ’s Y chromosome type .
Given all this , we really did n’t know if a link would exist . ”
Dr King ’s research showed that between two men who share the same surname there is a 24 % chance of sharing a common ancestor through that name but that this increases to nearly 50 % if the surname they have is rare .
She said :
The fact that such a strong link exists between surname and Y chromosome type has a potential use in forensic science , since it suggests that , given large databases of names and Y chromosome profiles , surname prediction from DNA alone may be feasible .
Dr King then went on to look at 40 surnames in depth by recruiting many different men all bearing the same surname , making sure that she excluded known relatives .
Surnames such as Attenborough and Swindlehurst showed that over 70 % of the men shared the same or near identical Y chromosome types whereas surnames such as Revis , Wadsworth and Jefferson show more than one group of men sharing common ancestry but unrelated to other groups .
These results have a potential use in forensic science , since it suggests that , given large databases of names and Y chromosome profiles , surname prediction from DNA alone may be feasible .
Dr King ’s research was presented at the Doctoral Inaugural Lectures held in the Frank and Katherine May Lecture Theatre , Henry Wellcome Building , University of Leicester on Wednesday October 8 .

Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s appearance at the New York City based Council of Foreign Relations ( CFR ) on 25 September 2007 , was an official endorsement and expression of solidarity on the North American Union agenda .
Harvard University educated CNN Veteran anchor Lou Dobbs , has further confirmed the official endorsement of the Stephen Harper Minority Conservative government on North American Union , or “ New America ” .
Mr. Harper has been apparently directed by the principal funders of the Conservative Party of Canada , which are ideologically linked to the CFR , to assimilate Canada into a new “ Fortress North America ” which is controlled by the U.S. political - military - industrial complex by no later than 2010 .
Building a ‘ North American Community ’
Indeed , the Stephen Harper government has been reported to be in the process of getting various Canadian government departments and agencies to “ harmonize ” , with U.S. governmental agencies , to expedite the assimilation of Canada into the neo-conservative vision of a “ Fortress North America ” .
The Council of Foreign Relations has indeed published a book on its North American Union manifesto entitled “ Building a North American Community ” .
John Manley , former Deputy Prime Minister in the Paul Martin Liberal Government is a co-author of this book .
Yes , my fellow Canadians , that is why Stephen Harper with ONLY a minority government , has been able to easily pursue North American Union , with what Mr. Lou Dobbs has referred to as a cabal at the CFR .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
( Article continues below )
Political party elites including those among the Liberals and Bloc Québécois , have apparently been all co-opted by the very wealthy Council of Foreign Relations .
North American Union architects have used the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) to legitimate the take over of Canada by U.S. interests as a “ logical outcome ” of the terms of NAFTA .
“ When the leaders of Canada , Mexico , and the United States met in Texas recently they underscored the deep ties and shared principles of the three countries .
‘ Security & Prosperity ’
The Council - sponsored Task Force applauds the announced “ Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America , ” but proposes a more ambitious vision of a new community by 2010 and specific recommendations on how to achieve it , ” states the Official Press Release for the book Building a North American Community , which is published by the CFR .
Mr. Harper ’s speech at the CFR on 25 September 2007 affirms Mr. Harper ’s Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPPNA ) commitment to hand over Canada to full control by no later than 2010 , to a political fraternity which is associated with the current U.S. Bush administration .
Mr. Harper ’s government apparently reports to the CFR .
In effect , the Government of Canada appears to be governed not from a sovereign Parliament in Ottawa , but run through a New York City - based political fraternity , which seeks to replace a democratic form of government , with the rule of society by a “ Council of Wise Men ” .
The architects of such a fascistic government look upon their vision of society , to be much more “ efficient ” in dealing with the need to vanquish enemies , i.e. “ terrorists ” .
‘ New World Order ’
A terrorist is broadly defined by the architects of the North American Union , as any individual or group which opposes the New World Order agenda .
The CFR website also openly endorses the Conservative Party of Canada under Stephen Harper , alluding to his government having an alleged mandate to transform Canada substantively into a U.S. colony by implementing the recommendations of the CFR , book “ Building a North American Community ” .
There is therefore clearly a working association between the Harper government and the CFR to implement and execute the NAU agenda of the book entitled “ Building a North American Community ” , whether Canadians like it or not .
John Manley , former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister of Canada , who is part of an apparent Liberal - Conservative - Bloc parliamentary alliance on the SPPNA , also endorses the replacement of the Canada - U.S. border , with a new international border around Canada , the U.S. , and also Mexico .
“ To make North America more competitive and secure , the three leaders should announce a plan to establish a North American security and economic community by 2010 .
The aim of this community would be to guarantee a free , safe , just and prosperous North America .
The boundaries of the community would be defined by a common external tariff and an outer security perimeter , within which the movement of people and products would be legal , orderly and secure . ”
John Manley stipulated on 23 March 2005 , in the Wall Street Journal , in the aftermath of his Liberal government ’s support of SPPNA .
Canadians who seek to save their country , must therefore seek to cancel NAFTA , as the legal basis for the greed - driven and fear associated pursuit of the destruction of Canada , under the pretext of the “ War on Terrorism ” .

Instead , Mr Zhou said the government was determined to reform itself , but that there had been some infighting between different departments .
He called for the number of ministries in Beijing to be halved to between 19 and 21 in order to form a " modern government structure " .
If your iPhone crashes more often than you would like , conventional wisdom typically attributes this to the proliferation of third - party apps on your phone , the ones you added via the App Store .
However , this is likely a misconception , or at least an exaggeration .
Recently , I launched Console on my Mac and navigated to MobileDevice ->
Ted ’s iPhone 3G ( the name here will obviously be different for your iPhone ) .
This is where you ’ll find a list of every recent iPhone crash , sorted by the name of each process that crashed ( the list is updated each time your sync your iPhone ) .
Somewhat to my surprise , the vast majority of these crashes were due to Apple processes ( despite the fact that I have more than 40 third - party apps on my iPhone ) .
The primary culprits were the App Store application itself , Mobile Safari , and Apple ’s Texas Hold ’em game .
Of course , a few third - party apps also showed up , including one pernicious app that turned out to be the overall “ winner ” with more crashes than any other : the NYTimes app .
It has crashed my iPhone more than 50 times since July .
To be fair , I launch this app more often than most others , so it has more chances to crash .
But that ’s not a sufficient excuse to let this app off the hook .
It crashes a lot by any standard .
I did n’t really need to check Console to know this .
NYTimes crashes almost every time I use it .
Threads in numerous forums , including Apple ’s and Macworld ’s , confirm that I am not alone here .
What is missing from all of these threads , unfortunately , is any suggested work - around or solution .
Apparently , the only hope is for the New York Times to release an update that fixes their buggy app .
The only mystery is why it has n’t already done this .
I assume the app ’s makers just do n’t care enough to make it a sufficiently high priority .
There ’s an old saying : “ If you ca n’t do it right , do n’t do it at all . ”
The Times should have considered this advice before unleashing their unworthy app on iPhone users .
Hope you enjoyed that ride .
The markets just smashed them some previous one - day records .
All three indexes closed up around 11 % , coming off a week of stomach churning declines .
The 940 + gain on the Dow was easily the largest point gain of all time .
Second biggest was just 499 + in March , 2000 , right near the top of the bubble .
On a percentage basis , the Dow gain was in the top 5 -- largest ever was March 15 , 1933 , when the Dow gained 15 % .
Will it carry through when the credit markets open up tomorrow and weigh in on their view of the economy ?
No clue , but we appreciate one day of not worrying whether America is finished .
Ok , now someone needs to do a counterpoint to the " Sad Traders " blog .
This week many sites offering homemade Greek subtitles received legal threats from an organization representing the TV and movie industries .
Very quickly , fansub sites closed down or removed access to subtitles , leaving thousands of Greek file - sharers quite literally in a position of not understanding what is going on .
EPOE , Company for the Protection of Audio - Visual Works ( known as Eteria Prostasias Optikoakoustikon Ergon ) , is a non-profit organization working to protect the copyrights of its for - profit members .
Operating at the behest of its members , EPOE is given authority by Greek law enforcement and works under license of the Greek Copyright Organization , which itself is linked to the Ministry of Culture .
Its members include many Greek companies but its international members are most easily recognized as they include MPA , Columbia , Fox , Universal , Buena Vista , MGM , Warner and Paramount .
On Tuesday , virtually every site offering user - generated Greek subtitles ( fansubs ) for English language movies and TV shows received legal threats from EPOE .
Within a very short time , all sites including greektvsubs.gr , subtitles.gr , greeksubs , subs4u.gr and apsubs.com had either closed down or removed all subtitles .
A sample of the translated complaint issued to greektvsubs is shown below :
According to our information and evidence , in your capacity as owner and manager of the website under the name www.greektvsubs.gr, without right and in violation of the provisions of Law 2121 / 93 , without the required prior written permission of the legitimate beneficiaries of copyright and related rights of our member - companies , are engaged in a totally illegal activity , which consists of right without translation in the English language texts / dialogues and subtitles creation of films or television series , the royalties of which belong to our member companies , which you have then illegally and without right , distributed via the Internet .
So why are the Greeks file - sharers so upset ?
Yiannis , a user close to the subtitling sites explained to TorrentFreak : “ Greek TV networks are most of the times very slow in airing the popular shows ( one or two years is common ) , not showing them at all or the worst , or show a season or two and then forget about them , leaving the fans looking desperately for solutions .
DVD distribution companies are no better .
Some popular shows do not even exist in a translated form . ”
“ A couple of years ago dedicated fans started working to translate and create subtitles of their favorite shows and they teamed up to create a few web sites to share them with the rest of the fans , ” Yiannis said “ One of the biggest was greektvsubs.gr .
These people managed to do with hard work , love and dedication what the TV industry failed : translate TV show episodes hours after they were aired and offer the subtitles for Greek speaking people to be able to watch their favorite show . ”
There is currently a fierce debate surrounding the legality of such fan - subtitling sites .
The Greek subtitles ( in common with user - generated subtitles in other locales ) are the result of hours of really hard work , listening to the TV show or movie in its native English and then translating by hand into Greek .
The ‘ subbers ’ do n’t have access to the original scripts , everything is created from scratch since the movie or TV show is n’t even available in Greek , so on this basis some believe the sites operate legally .
However , some are suggesting that under Greek copyright law , a translation could be considered as a ‘ derivative work ’ and as such requires permission from the original copyright holder .
Whatever the truth – and this is echoed in the emails we ’ve received here at TorrentFreak from the fans – there is obviously a really healthy demand for these products in Greek language ( not to mention from deaf people who absolutely rely on subtitles ) , yet the media companies spend their money on litigation , instead of addressing the core issue of giving the fans what they want .
In the meantime , while EPOE throws its considerable weight around , the show goes on for Greek subtitling fans as they head to their new home at gr.tvsubtitles .

We have n’t touched it .
But you probably know there have been internet - based rumors claiming that Sarah Palin ’s newborn son Trig is actually the son of her 17 year old daughter , Bristol .
In an effort to knock down these rumors , Palin and the McCain camp have now put out a statement claiming that Bristol Palin is currently five months pregnant with child , which she plans to keep and that she will soon marry the father .
I really do not know what to make of this story .
But we wanted to keep you up on the latest and particularly the McCain / Palin statement .
Late Update : I ’ll note also that the McCain campaign is lashing out at ‘ liberal bloggers ’ for this story coming to light and even perhaps the Obama campaign .
I think we can chalk that down as another intemperate falsehood emanating from their campaign .
I will note this .
Vetting works in a fairly established way with most campaigns .
The standard procedure in a case like this would have been for the campaign to have gone to a trusted reporter — and by that I do n’t mean a hack but someone the campaign knew would deal with the story in an appropriate way — and given them the story about the family drama the Palins are going through , how the daughter is planning to have the baby , how it confirms the family ’s values , etc .
In an ideal world , the daughter ’s life would be her own business .
But in the world we live in the best for all concerned would be to give it a respectful airing on day one or two and take it off the table rather than have it come out in some more jagged and painful way .
We do n’t care about Palin ’s daughter .
Her life is her own .
She ’s not running for anything .
What this does show is much more confirmation of what Republican operatives and pols are saying loquaciously off - the - record : that they do n’t think there was any real vetting of Palin .
Acting out from the McCain camp will not change that .
( ed.note :
In the original version of this post , I wrote that “ Bristol Palin is currently five months pregnant with another child , which she plans to keep … ”
The meaning of another was to distinguish this pregnancy from the rumor that she carried Palin ’s son Trig .
Several readers read this as an insinuation that this was Bristol ’s second pregnancy .
That was n’t the intention and that does n’t strike me as a logical reading .
But to avoid any misunderstanding , I revised . )

In my talks this year , I have been outlining some of the world ’s great problems , highlighting some of the things that are being done by technology innovators to solve them , and urging my listeners to “ work on stuff that matters . ”
We are in unprecedented times .
And folks , I ’m sorry to say that the current financial meltdown is not the worst of it .
Political instability around the world , wars over access to resources , and yes , terrorists , are all in our future .
Scientists who ’ve studied global warming agree that we ’re heading towards decades of extreme environmental stress , leading to even more severe economic disruptions than we have seen to date .
Meanwhile , we have an aging population with ballooning healthcare costs , an unfair economy in which some people receive outsized gains while others fall behind , an educational system that is not preparing children for the future , and deficits that require an increasing percentage of our tax dollars to service debt to other countries .
Even if there is a short term recovery , huge problems loom in the years ahead , problems we can no longer pass off to our children and grandchildren .
Faced with these problems , we need a president who can harness the best and brightest our country has to offer , a president who is conversant with , and comfortable with , the power of technology to assist in solving these problems , a president who is good at listening , studying , and devising solutions based on the best insight available , rather than on narrow ideology .
We need a president who can forge consensus , not just among the partisans in our own fractured democracy but around the world .
We need a president who can inspire our citizens and our global partners to forgo narrow self interest and embrace the possibilities that we can achieve if we work together to build a better future .
I believe Barack Obama is that president .
He is a man of intelligence , but also a man whose character and temperament seem suited to the problems of our age : unflappable , optimistic even in the face of adversity , willing to speak the truth about subjects that have long been taboo ( I ’m thinking of his speech on race , and his speech on fatherhood ) and with unscripted reactions that show his fundamental decency ( I ’m thinking of his reaction to those who wanted to make a campaign issue of Sarah Palin ’s daughter ’s unplanned pregnancy . )
Because this is a tech blog , not a political blog , though , I primarily want to address the subject of why members of the technical community should join me in supporting Barack Obama .
( The New York Times has made a compelling case based on the broader issues , as has Colin Powell . )
I outline four principal reasons :
1. Connected , Transparent Government
2. The Financial Crisis
3. Climate Change
4. Net Neutrality
I will also discuss some important additional considerations , personal and political , that I hope Radar readers who do n’t want to see politics in these pages , will forgive .
I want to be clear that this is my personal endorsement , and not an endorsement by O’Reilly Media .
I ’d like O’Reilly to be a company where people of all political persuasions are welcomed and supported , and feel free to express their personal opinions , as I have here .
1. Connected , Transparent Government
Web 2.0 has shown the power of what I ’ve elsewhere called harnessing collective intelligence .
Despite the claims of critics like Nick Carr and Andrew Keen , Google does make us smarter .
So does Wikipedia , and Amazon , YouTube , Facebook , the blogosphere , and Twitter .
Our access to information today is unprecedented ; the ability of individual citizens to discover and share important new ideas is greater than it has ever been in our history ; important ideas are able to bubble up and become visible to those who need to know them .
Barack Obama understands this .
His campaign has demonstrated his ability to harness the internet not only for fundraising , but also his comfort with its decentralized nature .
my.barackobama.com is not a one - way fundraising machine , but a platform that has enabled his supporters to act independently , while coordinating their decentralized , bottom - up activities in a way that adds to their effectiveness .
What ’s more , it is a platform that has allowed supporters to disagree with him , and so to shape his policies – a far cry from the current administration ’s belief that disagreement is equivalent to disloyalty .
Further , I believe that Obama ’s prowess in fundraising from small donors has the potential to change the culture in which Washington is for sale to lobbyists .
I ’m not naive : I know that bundlers and big donors will continue to have privileged access under any administration .
But I also know that the internet enables the long tail , and what we see here is the long tail of influence , a long tail in which self - organizing groups of people who care about important issues will have far more impact than they do today .
I also believe that in an Obama administration , there will be significant investment in applying the lessons learned from internet campaigning into the tools of internet governance .
There are efforts already underway to build better tools for two - way communication , for government transparency , and for harnessing innovations from outside the public sector to improve the work of the public sector .
Those of you who follow my blog and my speeches know that I am a big believer that “ alpha geeks ” show us the shape of the future .
I ’ve been watching the work of folks like Ellen Miller , Greg Elin and Micah Sifry at the Sunlight Foundation , Adrian Holovaty at Everyblock , Carl Malamud at public .
resource.org , and Tom Steinberg of mysociety.org in the UK , and I believe that in an Obama administration , we ’ll have an unprecedented opportunity to put their pioneering applications and approaches to work to build a more responsive , more transparent , and more effective government .
I should add , for those of you who are concerned about the financial downturn , that reinventing government will be a huge business opportunity .
Yes , much of that business may well go to existing government contractors – navigating the maze of Washington procurement is not for the faint - hearted – but there will be tremendous demand for expertise that today can only be found in the cutting edge technical community .
2. The Financial Crisis
The financial crisis we face today is a damning indictment of a philosophy that insists that the market is always right , that government only gets in the way , and that unfettered capitalism is the best system .
Left to themselves over the past eight years , Wall Street bankers have feathered their own pockets at the expense of customers , shareholders , and the public .
Meanwhile , investments in the real economy have faltered , been diverted to artificial wealth creation using obscure financial instruments that , in retrospect , turned our banks into willing participants in a giant Ponzi scheme .
It ’s clear that the era of hands - off government is over .
Ironically ( or perhaps inevitably ) , it is the failure of deregulation , not the expansionist ideas of an activist government , that is driving us towards ever greater government involvement in our daily lives .
Meanwhile , John McCain repeats the old mantras of deregulation , of letting the market work its magic .
I ’m a big believer in the market , but I also know that markets , like games , depend on clear rules of fair play .
It ’s not going to be easy for anyone to unwind the enormous mess that has been created as a result of the mismanagement of the economy under the current administration .
It will take great insight , intelligence , and an about - face in our attitudes towards regulation .
More than that , though , making the right decisions , coming up with the right regulations , will take insight into the nature of networks , the nature of markets , that can be profoundly informed by what we ’ve learned from the internet over the past decade .
I realized last year that there was a productive – nay an essential – dialogue to be held between the world of financial markets and the world of Web 2.0 .
( See Web 2.0 Meets Wall Street ( pdf ) . )
It ’s why I launched the Money : Tech conference , and why I ’ve been spending so much time thinking about what we can learn from the development of markets that are , effectively , run by computer programs , or as Richard Bookstaber put it so eloquently , A Demon of Our Own Design .
It will take a president and presidential advisors with enormous technological sophistication to understand , let alone design and manage the kinds of regulatory regimes we will need for increasingly automated markets .
We are far more likely to find that sophistication in the administration of Barack Obama than in the administration of John McCain .
It will also likely take significant government spending to boost the real economy as part of the recovery from the collapse of the shadow financial economy .
Given the inevitability of increased government spending , the question becomes one of priorities .
Obama understands how important it is to invest in infrastructure , in education , in health care , in energy independence and green technology , and in making our society fairer to all its citizens .
At the same time , he is a believer in markets .
He has been described as a ‘ University of Chicago ’ Democrat , in reference to the way he has tried to synthesize the market - oriented economics of the University of Chicago , where he was a lecturer for twelve years , with the traditional Democratic ideas that government can play a large role in creating markets , in leveling the playing field , and in creating a fairer society .
As University of Chicago professor Cass Sunstein notes , in the article linked - to at the start of this paragraph , “ His policies often involve setting up a government program to address a market failure but then trying to harness the power of the market within that program . ”
We need a new approach that synthesizes the best of what the right and the left have had to teach us , and Barack Obama has demonstrated , long before the current crisis was upon us , serious thinking about what such a synthesis might entail .
We need fresh thinking , not a pendulum - swing from one ideology to another .
And despite claims to the contrary by his opponents , I believe that Barack Obama is n’t afraid to take the best economic ideas from any part of the political spectrum .
3. Climate Change
I have come to believe that climate change provides one of the most severe long term threats to our society – greater even than the current financial turmoil .
While no one knows for sure just how bad the effects of climate change might be , the worst case scenarios are bad indeed – so bad that they might entail the end of civilization as we know it .
However unlikely you may consider these worst case scenarios , or however distant , it ’s worth remembering that in our everyday lives , we insure against outcomes that are far less likely .
And however much you discount that worst - case scenario , it ’s clear that investment in green technology will provide an enormous boon for our economy and a long term strategic benefit for our country .
If global warming does n’t get us , oil depletion will .
It ’s easy to forget that the US was once the world ’s biggest oil producer .
Our oil fields are now mostly gone , providing only 3 % of the world ’s supply and 10 % of our own needs .
It takes someone very short - sighted not to realize that the same fundamentals that marginalized our domestic oil industry will one day do the same to other nations whose oil supplies we depend on today .
I highly recommend the video documentary A Crude Awakening , which makes a compelling case for the end of cheap oil .
As demand rises around the world , so will the price of oil , and competition for this precious resource .
The current pullback in oil prices is temporary , driven by a recession - fueled decline in demand .
And as oil becomes scarce , we face the dangerous prospect of increasing our reliance on coal .
I ’ve been in Beijing on days when you ca n’t see buildings a quarter mile away , and I assure you , it is n’t pretty .
And the consequences for warming the planet are dire .
Meanwhile , the need to secure oil supplies around the world will hold our economy hostage to the whims of countries who have no love for us .
Given how long it takes for new forms of energy production to come onstream , we need to make major investments today if we are to have any hope of replacing fossil fuels with green alternatives .
But once again , this crisis provides huge opportunity .
Reinventing the energy economy will require enormous technological innovation as well as huge capital investments in generating capacity , upgrading the grid , and instrumenting the world to measure and manage our carbon output .
If we do not invest in these technologies , we face the real danger of becoming a second class nation , as those nations that do make the investments reap the rewards .
Progress from the climate crisis towards the green economy will require strong government policies .
If we ’d stuck the course that President Jimmy Carter outlined in 1977 , we ’d be in a very different position today .
This is not something we can leave to the unfettered market .
We need government leadership .
Given a free rein by the hands - off attitude at the highest levels of government , oil companies have reaped record profits while making only token investments in alternative energy , independence from foreign oil , and the strategic interests of our country .
Given choices among alternative energy sources , existing energy companies , agricultural lobbyists , and unscrupulous promoters took us down a disastrous path towards corn - based ethanol , a proposed solution that raised food prices and did little to address the real problem , but much to line the pockets of entrenched multi-national companies .
Now , I ’m not saying that any multi-national company is likely to put national interests ahead of self - interest , but it ’s clear that it is a foolish ideology that opens the sheepfold to management by wolves .
I will say that I ’m not satisfied with Obama ’s energy policies .
We need to move more urgently and more broadly than even he envisions , but at least he has resisted the political posturing that characterized John McCain ’s embrace of offshore oil drilling as a solution to the spring runup in energy prices , which was , after all , only a rehearsal for the much larger problems we will face down the line .
But for those concerned about climate change , the most urgent case for the election of Barack Obama was made by John McCain .
Despite being an early and thoughtful advocate on the threat of global warming , he lost all credibility with his selection of Governor Palin as his running mate .
We can not afford to take the risk of a Vice - President ( especially for a candidate as old as McCain ) who is scornful of science , denies human involvement in creating climate change , and is completely unprepared to tackle this most urgent of problems .
If scientists are right , we have to act now .
Every year counts .
There is no “ do over ” on this issue .
Climate change and energy policy can no longer be dictated by “ politically possible ” but must be dictated by “ technically necessary . ”
NASA ’s James Hansen has recently argued that an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 350 ppm looks to be the safe bet climate wise for humanity .
We are already at more than 380 ppm !
( Here ’s Hansen ’s full paper ( pdf ) . )
As my son - in - law Saul Griffith argued at our Emerging Technology Conference earlier this year , we need to pick a target CO2 concentration and work backwards to get to an energy policy , rather than guessing at an energy policy with fingers crossed , hoping for a climate outcome that is tolerable .
4. Net Neutrality
I love the internet .
It ’s been one of the most fertile grounds for technological innovation , wealth creation , and social change that our country has seen in my lifetime .
I believe passionately in the “ small pieces loosely joined ” model that allows anyone to invent a compelling new service , find other people to use it , and grow a business without having to ask anyone ’s permission .
It ’s essential that we preserve the architecture of the internet .
Under the guise of free market experimentation , big companies with monopoly positions in local markets are asking us to change the fundamental rules that have served the internet so well .
They want to be able to charge differential fees for different types of data traffic .
This will , quite simply , be the end of the internet as we know it , turning it into a network that works much more like the cellphone network , slow to innovate , hostile to its users , extracting profits through artificial barriers rather than true value creation .
Barack Obama supports net neutrality ; John McCain , as in other areas , once again claims that government should get out of the way .
Other Key Issues
I would be disingenuous to suggest that my endorsement of Barack Obama is driven purely by technical issues .
Here are some of the other issues that are on my mind :
9/11 , The War in Iraq , and the Growth of Authoritarian Government
Perhaps the most frightening thing about 9/11 is how easily we , as a nation , forgot who we are and what we stand for .
We threw away the sympathy of the world by acting as though the threat of terrorism justifies the abandonment of human rights .
The false intelligence and the lies that linked Iraq with the terrorists of 9/11 , the abuses in Guantanamo , the drumbeat of fear that was used for political gain , all lost us the respect and moral leadership we once enjoyed .
Meanwhile , Americans gave up freely the liberties that were the very foundation of our nation and made us a model for the rest of the world .
We need a clear break with that sordid epoch .
John McCain is as outraged by Guantanamo as Barack Obama , but he continues the misplaced focus of American foreign policy on Iraq .
And he seems to share the Bush administration ’s idea that terrorism is the greatest threat facing this country .
Barack Obama has outlined a commitment to extricate ourselves from a colossal foreign policy mistake .
This plan , derided as naive by the Republicans , is in line with the wishes of the Iraqis , and will allow us to realign our foreign policy priorities to deal with far more substantial threats to our national interest .
But more importantly , it is itself a strategic move in “ the war on terror . ” By invading Iraq , we created a haven for terrorism that did n’t previously exist .
Even worse , we gave them exactly what they wanted , an enemy that could serve as a recruiting tool .
And we played completely into their hands here in America as well !
What , after all , is the goal of terrorism ?
To disrupt the society of an enemy by creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty .
Al Quaeda no longer needs to do anything to create that atmosphere of fear .
Our government does that for them !
From the horrific — abuses of civil rights that undermine fundamental constitutional freedoms — to the ridiculous — what Bruce Schneier has so ably criticized as security theater that has increased the costs and inconvenience of travel while providing no added security , the Bush administration has acted the puppet to Osama bin Laden ’s game plan .
On the internet , we know how to deal with people who try to disrupt our activities .
While griefers are not the same as terrorists , the same principle applies .
We say , “ Do n’t feed the trolls ! ”
Even without any overt action , an Obama presidency will undermine the aims of terror by providing a clear break with the past , a break with the policies that have made America more of a target for terrorism than we were before 9/11 .
My hope — and I ’ll admit that it ’s only a hope — is that Obama is smart enough to know , like Roosevelt , that “ the only thing we have to fear is fear itself , ” and will use the power of the presidency to reverse the fear - driven policies of the past seven years .
Perhaps the most alarming aspect of what has happened in those years is the way that fear has been used to claim extraordinary power for the Presidency .
Those of you who know my background know that my degree is in Greek and Latin Classics .
So it ’s perhaps forgivable that historical parallels with ancient Rome are quick to come to my mind .
The claims of the Bush administration to be above the law , its claims that the threat of terrorism demand the suspension of civil liberties , are eerily reminiscent of the events that led to the end of the Roman Republic .
Faced with an invasion by pirates ( the terrorists of 68 BC ) , Pompey the Great was given extraordinary powers .
Within a decade , Rome was a dictatorship , led by the one Senator who had supported Pompey ’s exaggerated claims , Julius Caesar .
Of course , we are a long way from that point , but the drift of our country towards authoritarianism is alarming .
John McCain has been trying to paint Obama as the candidate of big government .
Yet it is the Right , not the Left , that is bringing us the biggest , most powerful , most centralized , and most intrusive government that America has ever seen .
Many members of the technical community have libertarian leanings ; you should vote for Obama for this reason alone !
I do n’t see evidence in Obama ’s platform that he has come to explicit grips with this issue .
But it is seems far more likely to me that any Supreme Court justices he appoints will be more inclined to stop this mad slide towards an authoritarian society than the candidates who might be proposed by John McCain .
I do know that the technological sophistication and political predilections of Obama ’s advisors will be to warn of the slippery slope that awaits us if we continue down the path of fear , with the tools of technology applied to end freedom rather than to increase it .
Abortion
I come from a conservative Catholic family .
I am no longer a practicing Catholic , but conversations with my brothers and sisters who are have made clear to me just how fundamental the issue of abortion is to their support of John McCain .
If you believe that abortion is murder , as they do , that literally millions of lives are lost each year in government - sanctioned killing , then virtually all other issues pale by comparison .
The chance that a John McCain will appoint one or more Supreme Court justices who will make it possible for the court to overturn Roe v.
Wade is hard to pass by .
Meanwhile , Obama ’s voting record on the other side of this issue speaks volumes to them about what they consider a fundamental failure of morality on his part .
I understand their concerns .
I hate to see a candidate with a perfect voting record on one side of an issue that so clearly divides the country , with passionate and compelling arguments on both sides .
But I remind them that Obama said , in his speech accepting the Democratic nomination , “ We may not agree on abortion , but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country . ”
He expanded on these views in an interview with Relevant Magazine in July .
It seems to me that the debate about abortion has been polarized far too long , with each side unwilling to give an inch , for fear that the other will take a mile .
While Obama will surely not give my family and those who agree with them a Supreme Court justice who will overturn Roe v.
Wade , I would hope that , with his gift for finding a middle ground , he will be willing to engage , and perhaps break the deadlock in our culture around this most divisive of issues .
It is almost certainly true that , by contrast , John McCain and Sarah Palin would continue the “ culture wars ” strategy that has made it impossible to make any progress on this issue .
Character
Senator McCain has made much of character in his career and in his campaign , yet he has run a race that gives the lie to those claims .
He hired the very people who used lies to undermine his campaign for the presidency in 2000 ; he has adopted the sleazy tactics that he once abhorred .
McCain ’s tilt to the right , pandering to the base of the Republican party while abandoning many of the positions he fought for in his maverick years , culminating in his cynical selection of Sarah Palin , shows a man who has been driven by the pressure of the race to sacrifice principle to expediency .
Contrast this with Barack Obama , a man who , faced with these attacks , has largely maintained the high road .
I ’m not saying that the Obama team has n’t played politics , using trivialities to paint McCain in the worst possible light .
But McCain has demonstrated a far greater willingness to stretch the truth , to stoop to tactics that have dismayed even his supporters .
At the start of this election , I was prepared to give McCain serious consideration .
But his behavior during the campaign forfeited my good opinion .
The ancient philosopher Heraclitus once said that “ Character is destiny . ”
John McCain used that quote as the title of his book , but it is Barack Obama who has demonstrated the sure character of a man who will not change how he acts for the sake of political gain .
Barack Obama shows us that character is also the deepest foundation of strategy .
When strategy comes from a fundamental sense of both who you are and what you want to accomplish , it has secure roots .
His campaign has been disciplined without being authoritarian , focused without being myopic , responsive while maintaining consistency .
These are all signs of a man whose strategy is deep rooted and a reflection of who he is .
Competence in Leadership
The final argument for the presidency of Barack Obama is the enormous competence he has shown in running his campaign .
He has demonstrated unprecedented ability to motivate people , to gather support for his vision and his programs , and to surround himself with people who can execute on that vision .
For the past two years , he ’s managed what you could easily think of as the fastest growing and best - funded startup in America , and as CEO of that startup , he ’s come through with flying colors .
If Barack Obama were a company , I ’d say he was ready for the IPO .
And I for one intend to buy shares on November 4 .
I hope you will too .

Wisconsin attorney : GOP 's mass voter fraud theory as likely as alien abduction David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday October 27 , 2008
Print This Email This Republicans across the country have been claiming that massive voter fraud is about to tip the 2008 elections , with Senator John McCain even warning of it " destroying the fabric of democracy . "
Although critics have found these claims to be " wildly overblown , " Republicans continue to press them , in what some regard as a deliberate attempt to disenfranchise potential Democratic voters .
Last month , Wisconsin's Republican Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen brought a lawsuit against that state 's Government Accountability Board , which oversees elections , to compel them to cross-check more than 240,000 voter registrations going back as far as January 2006 against driver 's license records .
The case could have forced many voters to use provisional ballots , calling their votes into question and tying up the polls on Election Day .
A judge ruled against Van Hollen 's lawsuit last week , but he and the Wisconsin Republican Party intend to appeal .
Van Hollen told CNN he is convinced that voter fraud is taking place because " some people are registered who are fictitious . "
However , the attorney for Wisconsin 's Election Board , Lester Pines , counters , " I compare the possibility of massive vote fraud in Wisconsin to the same likelihood as alien abduction . "
Pines himself is a prominent Democrat and Obama supporter , who held a political event at his home just days after being hired to defend the Board against Van Hollen 's suit
A Wisconsin country clerk interviewed by CNN stated without hesitation that she has not seen any evidence of massive voter fraud , although " sometimes a voter will fill in the registration form and they 've misspelled the name of their street . "
Milwaukee reporter Bruce Murphy checked with a voting registration expert , who told him that minor discrepancies between voter registrations and other state records disproportionately affect two groups that vote heavily Democratic -- Hispanics with hyphenated last names and African - Americans with unique first names .
Van Hollen has been accused of " playing party politics " because he is also the honorary state co-chairman of McCain 's presidential campaign .
One local blog even called him " Wisconsin 's Katherine Harris , " with reference to the disputed election in Florida in 2000 in which the Republican Secretary of State played a significant role .
CNN 's Susan Roesgen noted these concerns and asked Van Hollen , " Is n't it true that there was a discussion in your office with lawyers for the GOP a week before you filed this lawsuit ? "
Van Hollen denied that the Republican lawyers had asked him to sue the Election Board , although he admitted , " They may have asked lawyers in my office to file the lawsuit . "
Van Hollen himself acknowledges , " I have no doubt in my mind that there are going to be people out there who are going to say , ' Boy , that looks a little bit fishy . ' "

Congressman warns middle class in danger of being wiped out , says Congress is oblivious and Fed has no clue
Steve Watson
Infowars.net
September 18 , 2008
Congressman Ron Paul has issued a stinging address concerning the financial crisis in which he outlines how the current economic problems , created via malinvestment and shift to a debt based economy , are now being mismanaged by private interests in secret .
What ’s more he says he is not sure the Federal Reserve has any idea what to do next and that the Congress is totally oblivious to the whole sorry state of affairs – a cocktail of elements he warns puts the middle class of America in serious jeopardy .
“ Today we had a lot of financial fireworks in the markets , a lot of things are going on , and I think we are in the middle of something very big . ” the Congressman stated .
Speaking on the recent collapse and government bailout of several big financial institutions he warned :
“ We ’re talking about big bucks , we ’re not talking about hundreds of millions or even hundreds of billions , we ’re talking about trillions of dollars , the obligation is immeasurable . ”
“ The interesting thing is that they ( the financial institutions ) do n’t come to the Congress , I mean the Federal Reserve buys them out , they own it .
We as tax payers now own Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and know one knows how much that will cost .
They do n’t come to the Congress , we do n’t have appropriations , it ’s done by secret government , private individuals behind the scenes maneuvering and manipulating and trying to patch things up .
While in the meantime , I ’m sure there ’s a few people making a couple of bucks out of this whole thing . ”
The Congressman highlighted how an economy structured on debt and credit and a financial system based on interventionism and self serving moral hazard has led to gross devaluation of the dollar and ultimately lies at the root of the current financial meltdown .
“ Our problems come first of all from the Federal Reserve .
It is a monopoly and it controls interest rates artificially low , causes people to make mistakes , that ’s the basic source .
But then on top of that in the Housing market we had the community reinvestment act which told investors that they had to loan to risky borrowers , and that was a risky complication .
HUD contributes to this , FDIC contributes , it ’s called moral hazard , everything that we have done over here creates moral hazard , that is we assure people or assume that we will take care of everybody , just go out and create the risk , it is the opposite of the market place . ”
Paul stated .
“ You ca n’t create money like we ’re doing in order to support the dollar , because ultimately it hurts the dollar and everything we do in Washington today whether its on the appropriations side , whether it ’s what the Fed is doing , buying up America , it ’s all putting pressure on the dollar .
One of these days we ’re just going to have to wake up and say that we need to liquidate debt .
This is malinvestment . ” he urged .
The Congressman then slammed those who have blamed the crisis on failures of the free market :
“ And then they have people come along and say ‘ see , this is the failure of capitalism ’ , this has nothing to do with capitalism , this is something that started off as interventionism and us being too involved in the economy for the benefit of special interests .
But now it is being socialized out in the open . ”
“ The end of this comes when people reject the dollar and I think we ’re getting awfully close to this . ”
Paul stated echoing comments from leading investors such as Jim Rogers , who predicted Monday that the dollar would soon lose its world reserve status .
“ When you see the movement in the markets that we have today , you know that there are serious problems out there and Congress basically are oblivious , they have no idea what ’s going on . ”
Paul continued .
“ As a matter of fact I ’m not even sure the Federal Reserve has any idea what to do about this .
They ’ve been manipulating and maneuvering for their own benefit over the years but eventually the market wins out . ”
The Congressman ’s comments were echoed today by reports indicating that the Congress cannot agree on any form of action and is likely to simply adjourn and “ get out of the way ” .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters that “ no one knows what to do ” .
In a stark warning , Ron Paul stressed that the longer the value of the dollar is allowed to depreciate , the greater the risk becomes for the majority of Americans :
“ The reason this is so important is that if you care about people in a humanitarian sense , what you want to do is protect the value of the money .
Just think of the third world nations when they have total run away inflation , the middle class gets wiped out .
And what we are seeing today is the middle class being jeopardized by this type of system that we have , unlimited spending , unlimited debt , unlimited creation of new credit . ”
“ So it ’s time that we wake up …
The answers are in the free market , sound money and our Constitution . ”
Paul concluded .

Of course , I 've tried to tell them that by Election Day , the deal is done .
You may have overestimated my " access to DNC ' leaders ' " .

They do n't seem particularly interested .

It seems to me that the job devolves on the individual voter .
Check to see if you are still registered ; if not , demand to know why , and if not immediately restored , threaten suit ; if still not restored , BRING SUIT !
I 'll bet there are a lot of lawyers who'll do it pro bono , and then there 's always the ACLU .
ALSO , the NEWSPAPERS - holler to the Editor of your local fishwrapper ; Public " Servants " HATE exposure when they are doing something illegal or discriminatory .

Since it appears that at least eight of the nineteen states are traditionally Democratic in the above list , it occurs to me that the Democrats may be purging voter lists themselves in response to the GOP game plan .
If so , the elections taking place from now on will go to the party which is most effective in facilitating voter suppression and election fraud .
Wonderful " democracy " we now have , is n't it ?

A little o.t. ( well , not if you put it all under " Things that make you want to vomit " ) I read somewhere that Treasury Secretary Paulson makes about 735 million a year .
That was definitely the most obscene thing I heard THAT day .
Then on Letterman last night his guest was a woman from the World Food Network I think it was , talking about how their goal is knowing that every child on earth has at least a cup of gruel a day .
Those two things together make me want to vomit .
Hey , here 's a thought .. that 's HIS fucking cup of gruel .

Maybe this time , when exit polls show Obama winning handily and Obama loses ( in the above scenario ) , the pollsters , all of them , will not say they made a mistake .
Maybe this time , the real winner will not let this crime stand .
When the Dems took over Congress , one of their first acts should have been to insist on a paper trail for voting machines .

Not just 19 states ... 20 states , if you count Florida .
Certain counties in FL are purging any voter registrations where the name and address are not an exact match to the information listed on the person 's state - issued identification or driver 's license .
This means if your driver 's license says John M. Smith and your voter registration says John Smith or John Michael Smith or anything that varies at all from your driver 's license , your voter registration will be purged from the system .
If the address on your voter registration is not an exact match to the address on your license , your registration will be purged .
Or , just as bad , you 'll arrive at your voting precinct and will be handed a provisional ballot which probably wo n't be counted anyway .
What is wrong with our country ?
Why are so many people allowing this to happen right under their noses ?

LOL .
If you are suggesting that Walk on Water Obama will be the " real winner , " I suspect when the corporate media announce that the " election " ( if there is one ) is 51 % for McCain to 49 % for Obama that Obama will rush to the microphone in John Kerry style to give his concession speech and say something to the effect of : I congratulate my distinguished colleague on this outstanding victory , the great senator and now president [ sic ] - elect John McCain and vice president [ sic ] - elect Sarah Palin .
We must unite as a nation and stand behind our new president [ sic ] and vice president [ sic ] .
I will return to the senate and continue reaching across the aisle ( to help McCain and Palin accomplish most of their goals just as I have done for the Bush regime ) and I call on this nation to now have a healing .
( There always has to be a " healing . " )
I call on all of my supporters to now warmly welcome and rally and stand behind John McCain and Sarah Palin .
This is a great time in our nation .
A great time for hope and change and I 'm sure that McCain and Palin will do an outstanding job in their new positions .
And I will be at the ready should they need any assistance from me .
I have spoken with Joe Biden and he feels just as I do .
Let us now rally behind this nation 's new ' leaders . '
God bless America .
Good night . "
Nauseating is n't it ?
Yes , that 's very close to what we will likely hear .
More bull shit and no one called on anything .
Pretend it 's all legitimate , fair and honest .
End of story .
" When the Dems took over Congress , one of their first acts should have been to insist on a paper trail for voting machines . "
Yeah right .
I 'm convinced that the Dems ( most of them ) do n't give a fuk about any of this stuff .
They do n't care whether they win anything or not otherwise they would behave very differently than they do .
Most of them act as if they have had a lobotomy .
They are quite comfortable simply serving as enablers ( the salary is the same with full health coverage ) whether it be Bush enablers or McCain enablers ( if that man is allowed to reside in the White Houe ) .
There are reams and reams of stuff that the Dems " could have done " and should have done ( and their delusional wishful - thinking kool - aid drinking supporters were expecting them to do following 2006 ) .
I was n't .
I was n't expecting a damn thing to change with them in the majority and nothing has changed for the positive .
In hindsight , I 'm rather convinced the Dems were allowed to become the majority because the Bush regime knew that the Dems posed absolutely no threat to them and their agenda .
The Bush regime knew and / or were assured that the Dems would continue enabling the Bush regime , as they have done .
And will continue to do .
Look at what they have done with their majority status .
No positive " leadership " on their part whatsoever .
The real ' leaders ' have been the Repugs , as usual , and the " majority Dems " follow along because the Dem$ ' agenda is the same as the Repug$ ' agenda .
One - party system charading as two .

But the Dems were not about to do that , because they have encouraged them ( except for Debra Bowen here in CA ) .

is the scope of this beyond their limited ability to process information ?
are they resigned to elections being won or lost on these terms because of the liklihood that whites will be a statiscal plurality in a few decades and fair elections will just be completely off the table then anyway ?

I take it you did not read my original thought comment about Obama ’s concession speech in my comment ( # 12 ) .
Yes , that was my original .
That was my own .
So once again , you are wrong .
I still do n’t understand why you are even on this blog .
You cannot seem to comprehend anything anybody writes .
All you are good at is complaining about other people ’s comments .
Why do n’t you just worry about yourself and your own comments .
Let me tell you , I could pick the hell out of most of yours but I feel that we are all sort of " on the same page " here so why bother ?!
Try worrying about yourself and not me .
And pay more attention to my message and not the mesenger .
What you are accusing me of doing is exactly what Brad did in his comment # 14 to RonnyG ?
What I do in some of my comments is no different whatsoever than what Brad did in that comment ( he corrected someone just as I correct others on occasion )
And Brad has done the same thing in his other comments over time .
I know because I 've read them .
So it seems that it 's perfectly fine for Brad to do that because it's his blog ?... but it 's not acceptable for me to do that because it 's termed a " personal attack " when Erma does it ?
Hmmmmm ?
That ’s a double standard , and that ’s being polite .
As for correcting others , other people correct me on occasion .
That ’s the way a good message board works .
If you want to improve Bradblog.com , REMOVE yourself from this blog and it will improve .
That 's a guarantee .
What " many people find shaming ? "
You can only speak for yourself and for Brad , and not " many people . "
And to begin with , there are not " many people " on here .
It 's a very .
very small group .

The basic problem in many states undergoing voter purges just before an election is that the local ( city or county ) registrars of voters are free to act upon their own volition and the state boards of elections ( or secretaries of state ) are either ( 1 ) unaware of the purges , ( 2 ) encourage the purges ( or ) do n't care .

The comment you cite is a perfect example of what I mean .
You just read through the comments and pick out somebody to quote and laugh or sigh at and proceed to tell them all about how deluded they are .
You could make your points about all of us deluded people without singling people out for your ire ... picking fights .

" Capital must protect itself in every possible manner by combination and legislation .
Debts must be collected , bonds and mortgages must be foreclosed as rapidly as possible .
When , through a process of law , the common people lose their homes they will become more docile and more easily governed through the influence of the strong arm of government , applied by a central power of wealth under control of leading financiers .
This truth is well known among our principal men now engaged in forming an imperialism of Capital to govern the world .
By dividing the voters through the political party system , we can get them to expend their energies in fighting over questions of no importance .
Thus by discreet action we can secure for ourselves what has been so well planned and so successfully accomplished . "

The Democrats do n't want this examined too closely because it will bring more attention to the exploding scandal of ACORN and its subsidiaries using federal funds to run an enormous nationwide electoral fraud campaign which is designed to register voters illegally and register nonexistent voters with the objective of disrupting the voter registration system to the point where it becomes impossible for registrars to actually police the voter rolls in any meaningful way .
The use of caging lists is legal in most states and is far less destructive of the electoral process than the activities of ACORN .

My advice to voters who feel they have been purged wrongly from voting and they wo n't let you vote : raise hell .
Yell , cause a scene , get the cops called .
Do n't hurt anyone , but seriously , make a scene and get the media to notice you .
The more people who make a scene , the less likely this is to be ignored .
In 2004 everyone slinked quietly away , do n't do that this year .
Yell your head off if they have taken you off the voter rolls .
Do n't leave until they let you vote .
GET MAD .
This BS has to stop or we will be a full - fledged dictatorship by 2009 .
Raise hell , and do n't be apologetic about it .

except the people most likely to be purged are the ones who are n't going to read about it on the computer or suspect they need to check before election day .
I bet that right wing churches are all advising their congregations to check their voting status - if not doing it for them and their extended like - minded family , friends and neighbors .
everyone seems to forget that conservatives have their own news distribution system - outside of mainstream ' filters ' .
do n't just check your own registration .
check everyone you know too .
chances are the ones who are dropped are your 80 and 90 yr old aunt and uncle that still believe the daily paper reports everything they need to know - or your hairstylist single mom that 's working 2 jobs and does n't have the time or funds to read this stuff on the internet .

So what is worse , purging voter registrations which may have been the handiwork of ACORN and their affiliated groups , or allowing illegals , the dead , felons that lost their right to vote , or blatantly fraudulent names to skew the election ?
Think I am a bit off base ?
I was in one of the states that had a caucus and participated in the caucus process .
Check out http://www.wewillnotbesilenced2008.com/ for a documentary on the fraud that the Democrats permitted to happen during the primaries .
Then you might understand why I would prefer each state 's election officials to stringently apply their election law to all registered voters .
The actions of the Democratic leadership made me sick .
Each fraud is wrong and should be prevented , whether it is the ballot stuffing of the Democrats or the registration purging of the Republicans .
Follow the rules and laws people - NO EXCUSES !

We are what we repeatedly do .
- Aristotle
I used to just think about this quote in the positive way , such as “ if I continue to write , then I am a writer . ”
It ’s helped me get through many self - defeating ideas about what I can and ca n’t do , especially in regards to what I ’ve been taught how to do and what I ’ve learned on my own .
In that sense , it ’s very empowering .
But here recently I ’ve started thinking about the dark side of that principle as it pertains to the activities that I say I do and the activities that I actually do .
Let ’s take email , for instance .
Given the requirements of my full - time job , I spent a large portion of my days doing email correspondence .
At the end of the day , I ’d recount what I did that day and it was “ push email . ”
Other days , I licked envelopes and hung posters .
You do these things to get a job done when you ’re short - staffed and handed a messy project , but at the same time , a lot of what I ’ve been doing does not match my job description .
( Sidebar : Part of the problem is that I ’m filling a new position that really has at least three distinct components .
My spidey - sense went off when I was interviewed and it became clear to me that they really did n’t know what all the job will entail . )
It ’s not at all unusual for our job descriptions to be a lot different than what we actually do .
That ’s not the real point here .
The real point is that when I talk with people about productivity , creativity , and goal actualization , there ’s a large chasm between what they say they ’re doing and what they ’re actually doing .
Our Technological Time - Fillers
Let ’s return to email .
Many creatives are swamped in their Inbox and spend hours of their days checking , shuffling , categorizing , and monkeying around with email .
When meetings are sandwiched between email and sandwiches , the net result is that , at the end of the day , the creative has n’t actually created anything except for email messages .
There ’s nothing wrong with email , and by now it ’s a critical part of the way we work .
But we have to realize at some point that if we ’re spending our days shuffling email , we ’re not writers , designers , artists , and such – we ’re customer service agents .
Twitter is much the same way .
I love Twitter , but at some point we all have to realize that if we ’re spending our day tweeting , we ’re not creatives – we ’re Tweeters .
I can hear the resounding disagreement .
Some of you are saying “ But Twitter and email is how I network , market , build clients , and connect with friends ! ” I understand – I do the same thing .
But we have to be honest with ourselves about this one .
Sometimes we ’re legitimately there marketing , networking , and connecting with people .
A lot of times , though , we ’re just there because we ’re avoiding doing something else .
( Or to show that we ’re part of that elite group who has the type of position that we can hang out all day , but that ’s a completely different post . )
The Relationship Between Time and Relationships
One of the things people are most often concerned about is their relationships with others .
We want to be good parents , friends , lovers , and spouses and a good portion of what makes us who we are is made up by these very powerful bonds .
Yet , when it comes to the time we actually invest in these relationships , it falls short of the other things we do ( like work and play ) .
The answer is simple in theory and hard in practice .
Meaningful relationships take time in one shape or the other , whether it ’s in weekly emails , phone calls , bar meets , or soccer games .
The hard part is making time for these things in our hectic , busy lives .
The main point here is that trying to hold your end of the relationship in thoughts and wishes is pointless – you must do things to uphold your end of relationships .
Doing takes time .
So rather than worrying and thinking about your relationship with someone , pick up the phone or shoot them an email .
Go from there and invest time in the relationship .
The Present of the Present
Our histories only take us so far .
Each day is a new day to reassert your being , not by intention and wishing , but by action .
We create or reinforce habits that lead either to our thriving or not actualizing our potential each day .
I say this because many of us forget that , while we can only really mark progress through weeks and months , the trenches of our development and identity is in the minutes that make up each day .
The hours that are lost on the activities that are n’t instrumental to becoming the person we want to be or gained by consciously redirecting those loose minutes into purposive motion make the difference between us treading water with our goals and us actually pushing the ball forward .
The historical fascination tends to point to men and women who , in a moment , defined themselves through virtue or folly .
The reality is much more powerful : the great people , known and unknown , familiar and foreign , became great through momentary choices throughout a lifetime .
But the reality is also much more frightening , for :
What lies in our power to do , lies in our power not to do .
- Aristotle
Through your actions , what are you becoming in this moment on this day ?
Two years after announcing that Jesus would return with a fleet of flying saucers ( in Portuguese here ) , and four years after fleeing a public commitment to present one single evidence to prove what they sell ( roll down ) , the Brazilian UFO magazine just managed to hit a new low .
In this month ’s issue , editor Ademar Gevaerd announces “ a new way of conducting ufology in Brazil , with the creation of the Carl Sagan Institute ” .
Yes , you read it right .
And it does n’t stop there .
Besides the paradoxical abuse of Sagan ’s name , the magazine claims that the astronomer and one of the most famous skeptical activists in history was :
“ a scientist … who suspected that some [ of the alien life forms in the Universe ] already visits us in vehicles that we call flying saucers .
Many think that Sagan passed away without knowing the result of his search ..
But that is far from the truth .
Sagan had a close relationship with north - american governmental agencies dedicated to the UFO phenomenon investigation , and even Joseph Allen Hynek , considered the father of Modern Ufology , guaranteed that Sagan had a profound knowledge about the alien presence on Earth . ”
The full press editorial , in Portuguese , can be read here .
Believe it … or not !
OR NOT
Obviously , Sagan never said anything regarding a “ profound knowledge about the alien presence on Earth ” , and he actually spoke quite clearly about the opposite .
In “ Demon Haunted World ” , the last book he published in life , chapter 5 , he states that :
“ There are no cases – despite well over a million UFO reports since 1947 – in which something so strange that it could only be an extraterrestrial spacecraft is reported so reliably that misapprehension , hoax or hallucination can be reliably excluded . ”
In “ The Varieties of Scientific Experience ” , from a series of lectures given in 1985 , he also noted how :
“ It is remarkable that in all these million cases there is not one example of physical evidence that sustains even the most casual scrutiny .
No pieces of spacecraft chipped off with a penknife and put into an envelope and carried back for laboratory examination of exotic alloys .
No photograph of the interior of the spacecraft or the extraterrestrials , or a page from the captain ’s logbook .
Somehow , in all of these cases , there is not a single example of concrete physical evidence .
And that again is suggestive , I maintain , that we are dealing with some combination of psychopathology and conscious fraud and the misapprehension of natural phenomena , but not what is alleged by those who see UFOs . ”
How could these ufologists claim otherwise ?
Well , it ’s simple .
According to them , Carl Edward Sagan lied in public !
As Ademar Gevaerd stated in reply to this criticism :
“ It ’s obvious that in his works he speaks the opposite , since in them he plays the game of skepticism , part of governmental functions .
I doubt that today he would express himself the same way , but we will never know , will we ? ”
Need I say more ?
Well , in fact I need .
In 2001 the same editor expressed his opinions in a public forum , which I reproduce verbatim .
From Gevaerd :
“ I REALLY believe and maintain that Project SETI is a shameful waste of money .
And for various reasons , the main one being the fact that the scientists involved in the structure and maintenance of the project ( now , as well as in its original phase , two decades ago [ sic ] ) know perfectly well that UFOs are a reality and that they come from other planets .
In other words : they know , as is expected from well informed scientists , that we are being visited by non-terrestrial beings .
Therefore , with more than 5 million UFO records in 180 countries , present in official files of armed forces of these nations , in the last 40 years , how can such a reality be denied ?
Many prominent scientists that claim that UFOs do n’t exist know that the reality is exactly the opposite , and make such claims for obscure reasons .
I give two examples , one from Brazil and another classical one from USA .
Here , Ronaldo Mourão , from the National Observatory , happily claims that UFOs doe n’t existe when it ’s known that he was a consultant of the Brazilian Air Force in its UFO research projects , which included analysis of concrete data .
And in USA , Carl Sagan , who lived and died claiming that UFOs did n’t exist , was a partner of J. Allen Hynek for a long time in Cornell University , NY , and both were USAF consultants .
But only Hynek admitted that later .
Any real scientist do n’t dismiss the reality of extraterrestrial visitation . ”
Except , it seems , Carl Sagan , who not only stated that there ’s not one single conclusive case for alien visitation , but who was also one of the , if not the biggest public supporters of SETI .
I guess that means Gevaerd , who now claims to “ honor ” Sagan , actually called him a fake scientist who defended a “ shameful waste of money ” and lied in public for “ obscure reasons ” ?
Ademar Gevaerd has just replied stating that “ I have n’t changed a single bit of my opinion from that year until today ” .
Why do they want to “ honor ” Sagan if they think of him this way ?
I can only think of “ obscure reasons ” for that .
They already admitted they will be asking for donations to support this institute .
Unauthorized use of image
ILLEGAL
The Twilight Zone aspect of this situation is obvious .
Beyond that we have the simple fact that this outrage is simply not legal .
“ We have legal standing regarding the use of Carl ’s name and likeness ” , wrote Ann Druyan , Sagan ’s partner in almost all of his works starting from the iconic Cosmos TV series .
Druyan is president of the Carl Sagan Foundation , appropriately registered in the USA , and which has among its projects The Carl Sagan Discovery Center at The Children ’s Hospital at Montefiore , Bronx , New York .
Carl Sagan also founded the Planetary Society , of which Druyan is also president , an institution dedicated to space exploration and which among many activities develops a new means of space propulsion , the solar sail , with prototypes called …
Cosmos 1 and 2 .
This is just part of the bright legacy a decade after this figure who so enlightened our age left us .
In contrast , the outrageous “ Carl Sagan Institute ” of ufology in Brazil , tellingly , already in its home page ( the only one that works for now ) uses a photo of the astronomer without proper consent .
“ Their use of that photograph of Carl could not have been authorized .
We own those rights ” , confirmed Druyan .
As for this unauthorized use of Sagan ’s photo , Gevaerd replied that the claim “ is ridiculous , because the photo is widely used in websites , publications , journals , etc. , and is properly credited in the Carl Sagan Institute website . ”
This editor does n’t seem to know much about copyright law .
He does say also that “ we asked Ann Druyan about this ” , but he does n’t say if he got an answer .
Well , her answer is above .
Not only is this institution illegal … it ’s actually non-existent !
Despite the public announcement stating that it was created in May 26 in Curitiba , a search of the local records offices revealed nothing , and Gevaerd has just confirmed that the institution is not in fact formally registered yet .
But unfortunately , this fake Carl Sagan Institute , that goes against everything that Sagan ever stood for , will probably be official soon .
And they will be asking for donations soon after that , counting with all the benefits of an NGO .
We will do whatever we can to stop this , and if you want to help , please contact us .
This is one Carl Sagan Institute that must not come to reality .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the United States would be prepared to reconcile with the Taliban if the Afghan government pursued talks to end the seven - year conflict in that country .
Gates made the comments to reporters Thursday while at a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Budapest , Hungary .
The United States and NATO are looking for ways to reduce the rising violence in Afghanistan .
The Taliban has been battling a U.S. - led coalition since it was toppled from power in 2001 for harboring Osama bin Laden 's al Qaeda terrorist network .
U.S. commanders in Afghanistan have asked for an additional 15,000 troops but the call has gone unanswered , with the United States short on troops and NATO countries not interested in contributing more personnel .
Alternatively , a plan is being developed under the direction of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm .
Mike Mullen , focused on the idea that Afghanistan and Pakistan are linked by a common insurgency that stretches along their border , according to a Pentagon official with knowledge of the issue .
The official would not go on the record because he did not want to speak about the plan before Mullen introduces it .
Mullen said empowering tribal militias that have influence in both Pakistan -- where U.S. forces have limited access -- and Afghanistan -- where the United States is training more Afghan security forces to bolster troop levels -- could reduce violence .
By giving legitimate power to some militias , the plan addresses U.S. commanders ' frustration with Afghan President Hamid Karzai 's government , which is viewed as not very effective outside the capital , Kabul .
The official said that no decisions have been made and no drafts have been shown to Mullen , but the plan is expected to be completed later this year .
There is no political timeline attached to the report , according to the official .
Gates , referring to talks with the Taliban , said a similar rapprochement strategy worked in Iraq .
" We promoted a reconciliation that involved people we were pretty confident had been shooting at us and killing our soldiers , " he said .
" At the end of the day , that 's how most wars end , " Gates said , referencing the Sunni Awakening Movement in Iraq .
" There has to be ultimately -- and I 'll underscore ultimately -- reconciliation as part of a political outcome to this , " he said
Those talks would not include al Qaeda , Gates said .
The reconciliation would have to be on the Afghan government 's terms , and the Taliban would have to subject itself to the sovereignty of the government , he added .
" That 's ultimately the exit strategy for all of us , " Gates said .

In the NFL there is revenue sharing and a salary cap .
What does this mean ?
Revenue sharing
About 2/3 of the NFL 's money comes from the TV deal .
The players get about 2/3 of team revenue .
So , more or less , the TV contract goes to pay the players .
These contracts are typically for about 5 years , and every time they are renegotiated the price goes up .
So do player 's salaries .
The money from the TV contract is share and share alike - the Redskins , Cowboys , Bills , and Packers get identical checks .
This money is key to the success of the smaller franchises .
Without the TV contract money , there is simply no way on earth that Green Bay could ever field a competitive team .
There are a lot of other sources for NFL money .
NFL licensed jerseys , for example that Randy Moss jersey you put on your kid last Halloween when you dressed him up as a demon , result in license fees going to the NFL .
This money is also equally shared .
When the teams play , there is a " gate , " the money people pay for seats .
This is in the neighborhood of about $ 2.5 M per game .
This money is split 60 - 40 , with the visiting team getting 40 % of the gate .
Because of this teams like Jacksonville and Arizona just love it when the Packers or Cowboys come to play .
These are the two or three games each year these teams can count on selling out , and the money they get is very welcome .
Sometimes you will find that to buy a ticket to see the Packers on the road you have to buy a package of two or three tickets .
This is nothing more or less than a device to get money from Packers fans into the pockets of the other teams owners .
Unshared money
The newer stadiums have large box seats which are leased to corporations .
This money is not currently shared , which gives individual teams a big incentive to get a new stadium with fewer normal seats and more corporate seats .
Some teams ( read : Cowboys ) are starting to make their own licensed products and refuse to share the money .
They theory is that Jerry Jones is a brilliant marketer ( who just happens to live next to half the country 's oil wells ) so why should he share his hard - earned money with a slacker like Art Rooney ( who just happens to live next to a bunch of shut - down steel mills in a solidly blue - collar town ) .
The box seat and license money is a subject of great debate at this instant , and is the big holdup in renewing the NFL labor contract : the owners cannot sign a labor contract until they know how much money they 're taking in , and until the new revenue agreement is signed they do n't know that .
Finally , a well designed stadium can bring in other money for events like concerts , weddings , a pro shop , and the sale of $ 12 hot dogs .
This money is not shared , again giving teams a huge incentive for a new stadium .
The Packer 's stadium is a model of efficiency , and does a league - leading job of extracting money from the local residents .
If Green Bay were in the Spy / Defense / Government business like Washington , or the oil business like Dallas , the Packers would almost certainly lead the league in revenue .
In fact Green Bay makes placemats , napkins and toilet paper , so the Packers are about # 12 in the league in revenue .
In 2005 teams will make about $ 110M - $ 140 M per year in gross revenue , and the players get about $ 85 M of that .
The $ 85 M number is the salary cap .
This is an agreed upon percentage of total league revenue divided by 32 .
Each team may spend $ 85 M on players , no more .
Each team must spend at least 80 % of the salary cap , it 's not allowed to be a complete cheapskate .
However , things are much more complicated than that simple statement .
First , the TV contract has escalator clauses .
This has nothing to do with shopping malls and elevators , it means the contract payments increase each year .
In '06 the salary cap is likely to be over $ 100 M , about a 20 % increase .
This means that the top contracts are continually going up in value , and a contract signed a couple years ago is suddenly looking pretty thin .
Although the US as a whole has almost no inflation , the NFL lives in an artificial world with about a 10 % inflation rate .
The idea of salary indexing has not really happened in the NFL , with the result that you see people sign very competitive contracts and two or three years later comparable players are making twice as much .
This promotes a lot of hard feelings and contract problems .
Appendix 1 shows the historic salary cap .
All 53 team players and the 8 players on the practice squad count towards the salary cap .
A team may not exceed the salary cap .
If a team does exceed the cap , the NFL can waive players from the team , starting with those earning the lowest salaries , until the team 's payroll has fallen under the cap .
In addition , the NFL may fine a team up to $ 1 million per day for exceeding the cap .
In practice this does n't come up because if a proposed contract would put the team over the salary cap , the NFL wo n't approve the contract .
Player benefits are currently capped at $ 12,156,000 per club above the salary cap .
The NFL Labor Contract
The NFL players have a union , the NFL Players Association , the NFLPA .
These guys negotiate a labor contract every five to seven years .
The contract specifies the percentage of total NFL revenue that goes to the players ( currently roughly 2/3 ) , and also specifies certain minimum salaries for players .
There is a minimum salary you can pay a guy who is in his first year , which is just over $ 200 k .
For each year the player has in the NFL , the minimum salary goes up , until a 10 year veteran has a minimum salary of just over $ 750 k .
These numbers change each year with the salary cap , so it 's a bit of work to keep up on the exact number each guy has for his minimum salary .
Minimum salaries shown in appendix 2 .
The NFLPA was worried about veterans being cut for cheaper young guys , so if a player is signed to a one year contract , paid the minimum salary and given a signing bonus no larger than $ 25,000 , then he only counts $ 450,000 against your cap .
Better yet , the money he is paid above the $ 450,000 amount comes out of a league - wide " player benefit pool " and not from your team 's checkbook .
Other player benefits include the league retirement plan .
Player benefits amount to another approximately $ 13 M over the $ 85.5 M cap in 2005 .
The labor contract also specifies what sorts of contracts you may sign with a player .
When you read that a player has signed his contract , it 's not actually a done deal .
The contract is then forwarded to the NFL and NFLPA legal offices , where it is reviewed and either accepted as legal or rejected .
Each year a few contracts are sent back for a re-work because the NFL or NFLPA lawyers say it 's not a legal contract under the labor agreement .
Some ( most ) teams perceive themselves to be very close to a superbowl , and therefore the idea of somehow stealing a bit of next year 's salary cap for use this year can be very compelling .
Especially because of the salary cap inflation , which means the money you steal from next year is a bigger fraction of this year 's cap than of next year 's , and in any case next year you can do it again .
How do you steal cap room from the future ?
Easy , it 's all laid out in the labor agreement .
MIT researchers have designed an underwater robotic craft dubbed Odyssey IV .
This new , small , and inexpensive vehicle is capable of hovering in place much like a helicopter .
In addition , it can move in a speed of up to two meters per second going straight ahead , giving it another advantage .
Odyssey IV can prove to be a valuable scientific instrument for deepwater oil explorers , marine archaeologists , and oceanographers .
Odyssey IV differs from previous artificially intelligent submarines developed by the MIT Sea Grant College program ’s Autonomous Underwater Vehicles Laboratory , in that it can hover in place and does n’t need to keep moving forward at all times .
When stopping , Odyssey keeps correcting itself for currents and obstacles , thus holding its position , enabling it to make detailed inspections or to photograph the flora and fauna around an undersea vent .
“ Our old subs needed to swim , to go forward , in order to maintain maneuvering capability , ” says Chryssostomos Chryssostomidis , director of the MIT Sea Grant Program .
“ People wanted to be able to work in the ocean and stop and hover to do a specific task .
In the past , you could only fly over a scene , take a picture , then fly over again and take another picture .
Now , I can stop over a scene that ’s of interest , and stay and make measurements .
We ’ll be able to observe underwater scenes in much more detail . ”
Odyssey IV is a two - meter - long craft resembling a fish , with fins and thrusters located on each side as well as on its bow and stern .
The combined action of those fins and thrusters enable the craft not only to move quickly , but also to stop in place .
The new underwater robotic vehicle , capable of moving through the ocean up to 6,000 meters down , has just completed sea trials off Woods Hole , Massachusetts and has recently embarked on its first scientific mission – a study of the George ’s Bank area of the Gulf of Maine .
The next step is adding a few improvements such as improved power - storage and communications capabilities .
In addition , the researchers wish to add a mechanical arm that will allow Odyssey to take samples and manipulate objects .
“ Once we prove the hovering capability foolproof , as we think it is now , the next challenge for me to worry about is the issue of recharging , so that I can be free of the surface vessel , ” explained Chryssostomidis .
TFOT recently covered Seagliders – autonomous underwater vehicles which are used to gather valuable information such as conductivity - temperature - depth ( CTD ) data at a considerably lower cost than any other vessel or instrument currently available , along with the Thermal Glider – an autonomous underwater vehicle powered by ” green ” energy .
This robotic glider propels itself using the temperature differences in the ocean ’s waters as an energy source .
More information on the Odyssey IV can be found at MIT ’s official website .
Internet advertising is a strange beast .
Some of the most popular ads play directly off our insecurities – that we ’re fat , that we ’re lonely , or that our penis is far too small .
The immediate emotional response to what basically amounts to a controlled insult online can gall you into the all important “ click ” of the ad .
While this emotional manipulation is effective , it does n’t give you the ability to completely half ass your campaign and still expect no one to call you on it .
I saw this ad online recently .
Please note if you have AdBlock or similar software installed , it may block the image as it has “ ad ” in the filename .
Check your settings .
Seems rather benign , not unlike thousands of other ads you see every day .
It ’s not particularly well done , but if it did n’t make money it would n’t be out there .
But there ’s something else – I saw it , did a bit of a double take , and then looked again .
The 35 pounds figure seems to be off , but more importantly , the body types of the two do n’t quite seem to match up .
Wait a second , what ’s that on the right side of the slimmer girl ?
There ’s a hint of yellow on the edge of the frame .
Let ’s cut out the pictures of the two girls , and then flip them around and put them beside each other .
Well damn .
Turns out that you just took a picture of two sisters , one slim , the other not so much , flipped it around , and then tried to pass it off as a weight loss ad .
Sorry about the grey line in the middle , it ’s because of the black borders around the ad cut out a little bit of the image .
Next time , perhaps a bit more Photoshop work ?

As gas hovers around $ 4 a gallon , your Prius - driving neighbors are cruising smugly all the way to Whole Foods .
Sure , you could join their self - satisfied ranks .
Or you could commute in style — on a horse ( if your city 's ordinances allow it ) .
The timing is good : Equestrian gear recently got some serious and long - needed upgrades .
High tech , Silver , away !
1 // Bitless Bridle
Robert Cook 's Bitless Bridle is an evolution of an ancient pony - friendly design .
It steers with straps that crisscross under the muzzle :
To turn left , draw the left rein away from your steed 's neck , applying pressure to the right cheek and turning its head in the direction you want to go .
2 // Ultralight Helmet
Old - school hats were just velveteen - sheathed plastic .
Today 's models , made of high - density polystyrene , are almost half the weight of the classic style yet can withstand several hundred Newtons of force .
3 // Carbon - Fiber Saddle
Leather seats have all the give of a two - by - four , and a bad fit can cause your horse 's vertebrae to dip .
The Swedish company Linear has designed a modular seat ( for a custom fit ) with a carbon - fiber core to spread your weight as evenly as possible .
4 // Polyurethane Wraps
To better protect tendons and joints from accidental hoof slaps , wool wraps are being replaced by boots padded with gel and carbon fiber .
An outfit called Veredus molds its shells from 54 - Shore TPU , a tough polyurethane mixture that stays flexible down to 5\0xB0 F .
5 // Springy Stirrups
Invented around the third century AD , the first stirrups were nearly perfect ; they lacked only suspension .
The company Horse - tec has added spring - loaded shocks to relieve strain on your legs and the horse 's back , which increases as you gallop faster .
6 // Flexible Shoes
Horse hooves change shape with every step , helping to pump blood through the legs .
Thus , steel kicks ai n't the best .
High - grade polymer compounds are the material du jour — elastic enough to absorb shock and reduce muscle stress .

Personalized genomics just got a lot more accessible .
Until tonight , the cheapest genome scan was available for just under a thousand dollars .
Thanks to improvements in microarray technology , 23andMe has been able to cut that cost by more than half – to $ 399 – well within the reach of cash - strapped grad students , frugal genealogy buffs and other not - so - early adopters .
“ By taking advantage of continuing innovation we are able to introduce a new chip that will give people more relevant data at a lower price , ” said Anne Wojcicki , co-founder of 23andMe .
” We are excited that we are opening doors for more people to learn about their health and ancestry and for more people to be able to participate in advancing research .
It is important to democratize personal genetics and make it more accessible . "
On The Spittoon blog , Wojcicki mentioned that her company has also implemented a major technology upgrade .
Among other things , their new chip can check people for a condition that makes taking some drugs extremely dangerous .
If you are G6PD deficient , and unwittingly take the malaria drug primaquine , you 'll have a horrible reaction that may include hemolytic anemia and death .
By checking your genetic makeup before taking a new medication , you might be able to avoid that sort of nasty situation .
In other words , the new test could give you a lifesaving warning .
Predicting how someone will respond to a drug before they ever take it , just by looking at their genes , is called pharmacogenetics .
It is a rather new field , and not ready for prime - time yet , but I have a feeling that services like the one offered by 23andMe will greatly accelerate its development .
At some point 23 andMe will start asking its clients how well they respond to particular drugs .
By relating that information to their customer 's genetic data , the small company 's researchers may be able to identify new pharmacogenetic markers – genes that indicate how someone will react to a medication .
In order to do those studies , the personalized genetics company requires a tremendously large population to study .
In other words , it needs tons of customers , and that could be the underlying reason for this incredible price cut .
But the other co-founder of 23andMe ,
Linda
Avey , offers a different explanation .
She says that the biotech industry has its own Moore 's Law , and it moves even more swiftly than the one that causes the cost of computer chips to drop as their capabilities swiftly increase .
From the outset , she has suggested that the cost of the whole genome scan would drop as microarrays become cheaper and more sophisticated .
Despite the massive amount of information gathered by those chips , some people are convinced that they do not paint a detailed enough picture of our genetic makeup .
" The term ' whole genome scan ' seems misleading to me , " said a bioinformatics student in our comments thread .
" It took C. Venter 's whole , single - purpose , dedicated company many months and many millions ( or even billions ? ) to sequence a single human genome .
And even that was subject to quite some criticism : Measured , short sequence fragments were " puzzled " together in computers by heuristic algorithms , resulting in a ' probably ' correct whole sequence . "
Genetics experts could argue that tests like the one offered by 23andMe are fully adequate .
They make over 650,000
measurements , and that should be enough to see the big picture – or even reconstruct the whole genome with some very educated guesses .
It 's a bit li k coml ting this sen ence .
Even though some of the information is missing , you can easily fill in the blanks .
In any case , it looks like bigger - better genetic tests are on the way .
Will the lower price drive you to try their service ?
What would you do with all of that information ?
Votes being stolen from Obama in Early Voting I have to point out the pattern of voting " glitches " that have been reported so far with early voting .
People in several states now have noted that when they cast a vote for Obama , it has switched to McCain .
Not once have the votes flipped in the opposite direction .
If there were simple error , we 'd expect to see mistakes in both directions .
But , just as with the errors in 2004 , the only votes that have been seen flipping have gone from the Democratic presidential candidate to the Republican one .
How many times do we have to see this before we recognize what is going on ?
Someone is trying to game the vote in our country .
And if we do n't all become a lot more vigilant , our vote will be reduced to a meaningless exercise .
Here are some sample incidents .
Austin , Texas
From a message on an Obama list :
A good , responsible , reliable friend of mine just called with a horror story about voting this morning here in Austin , TX .
He voted at Fiesta Mart on 38th and IH - 35 .
He voted a straight Democratic ticket .
When he was reading the ' voted for ' listing at the end of his ballot , all of those listed were Democratic candidates EXCEPT FOR PRESIDENT .
The list showed that he had voted for John McCain !!!
And he voted the straight Democratic ticket .
He reported it to the election official and that person was as shocked by it as my friend .
They corrected the vote BEFORE he hit the CAST BALLOT button .
My friend said the experience made him sick to his stomach .
He said he was the youngest person in the voting area a nd all he could think is that the older people around him may not proofread their ballot before pressing the CAST VOTE button .
They may believe that they voted for Obama but the voting machine may have registered a
vote for McCain .
He called the Travis County voting office and they said they would look into this .
When he called me I gave him the telephone number for the Democratic Party and he then called them to report what had happened and they said they would look into it , also .
I am shocked and disgusted by what he experienced this morning and I am telling you because of it .
Please PROOFREAD your ballot choices BEFORE hitting the CAST BALLOT button .
This is vitally important .
( For EVERYONE who votes , whichever way you vote . )
...
So I went down to the Democratic headquarters this afternoon and they confirmed what Veryan 's e-mail said , that even though a voter had chosen the Democratic ticket , the presidential candidate on his pre-casted ballot was listed as John McCain rather than Barack Obama .
The person I talked with concurred that it is more likely to happen where poor or elderly vote and that it has happened at more than one location .
Here 's a suggestion to all of you who are thinking of early voting : Consider voting in an area that has more elderly or a disproportionate number of poor people .
See if your ballot is in error before you cast it .
If it does , raise heck before you cast it -- get the number on the side of the machine -- and then make sure to let the Democratic headquarters know .

Three Putnam County voters say electronic voting machines changed their votes from Democrats to Republicans when they cast early ballots last week .
This is the second West Virginia county where voters have reported this problem .
Last week , three voters in Jackson County told The Charleston Gazette their electronic vote for " Barack Obama " kept flipping to " John McCain " .
In both counties , Republicans are responsible for overseeing elections .
Both county clerks said the problem is isolated .
Of course they would say that .
But the problem should never have happened , and again , if it were random , there would have been reports of votes switching in the othe direction .
The uniformity of the flip is the disturbing clue .
This woman 's experience is heartbreaking ( not to mention democracy - breaking ) :
“ I pushed buttons and they all came up Republican , ” she said .
“ I hit Obama and it switched to McCain .
I am really concerned about that .
If McCain wins , there was something wrong with the machines .
“ I asked them for a printout of my votes , ” Ketchum said .
“ But they said it was in the machine and I could not get it .
I did not feel right when I left the courthouse .
My son felt the same way .
“ I heard from some other people they also had trouble .
But no one in there knew how to fix it " ....
No one knew what to do .
How can you , when the system , by design , is inauditable ?
We should not be voting on DRE ( direct recording electronic ) voting machines ever .
Not ever .
Even if you see a paper record ,

David and Patricia Earnhardt , the makers of the documentary film "
My wife , Patricia Earnhardt , had an early voting experience here in Nashville , Tennessee , where she saw her vote momentarily flip from Barack Obama to Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney .
She voted on a touch - screen paperless machine .
Here is her story :
A poll worker directed me to a touch screen voting machine & instructed me how to use it .
I touched " Obama " for president & nothing lit up .
I touched 2 or 3 more times & still nothing lit up .
I called the poll worker back over to tell him I was having a problem .
He said I just needed to touch it more lightly .
I tried it 2 or 3 more times more lightly with the poll worker watching & still nothing lit up .
The poll worker then touched it for me twice --- nothing lit up .
The third time he touched the Obama button , the Cynthia McKinney space lit up !
The McKinney button was located five rows below the Obama button .
The poll worker just kind of laughed and cancelled the vote .
He hit the Obama button again & it finally lit up .
I continued on to cast the rest of my votes .
After completing the process & reviewing my votes , I went to the VOTE page , hit the VOTE button & nothing happened .
Again after several tries , I called the poll worker over & he finally got the machine to register my votes . "
Patricia Earnhardt - Friday , Oct. 17 - Howard School Building - Nashville , Tennessee I also had similar problems with the machine I was voting on that same day , although no vote flipping .
I would touch the screen numerous times before I could get my various candidate choices to light up .
It was strange and very frustrating .
When I finally got through my slate of candidate choices , I could not get the VOTE button to light up when I touched it .
I finally called over a poll worker and he told me that I needed to touch lightly .
I touched the VOTE button more lightly , but was only able to get it to work after several more failed attempts .
There are other problems that are less sinister , in that they are bipartisan in nature .
For example , in Flagler County , where George Bush and John Kerry got similar numbers of votes in 2004 , ballots were printed on paper that was 1/32 of an inch too short to be read by the new voting machines .
You 'd think , in a Democracy , that this in the one thing Republican , Democrats , and people of ALL political persuasions could absolutely agree on : we need an honest vote .
And so far , the dishonest machines have all favored the Republicans .
Any objective observer has genuine cause for concern .
I would n't want to win the race by stealing it .
Republicans should n't approve of that either , even if it appears to benefit them .
Putting thugs who are willing to steal their way into office at the helm helps NO party in this country .
Be prepared
It 's better to prevent an election issue than to have to report one !
Please review these 12 checklist items for securing your vote , from
1. Check your registration .

[ Lisa 's note : do NOT vote early if it means NOT voting on a paper ballot that you control . ]
3. Practice your vote .
Electronic voting machines can be difficult to use .
Verifiedvoting.org is preparing links to video demos of how to vote on the machine you will find at your polling station .
If you 'll be using a paper ballot , check out the sample included in your voter pamphlet .

I have to point out the pattern of voting " glitches " that have been reported so far with early voting .
People in several states now have noted that when they cast a vote for Obama , it has switched to McCain .
Not once have the votes flipped in the opposite direction .
If there were simple error , we 'd expect to see mistakes in both directions .
But , just as with the errors in 2004 , the only votes that have been seen flipping have gone from the Democratic presidential candidate to the Republican one .
How many times do we have to see this before we recognize what is going on ?
Someone is trying to game the vote in our country .
And if we do n't all become a lot more vigilant , our vote will be reduced to a meaningless exercise .
Here are some sample incidents .
From a message on an Obama list : From the Charleston Gazette Of course they would say that .
But the problem should never have happened , and again , if it were random , there would have been reports of votes switching in the othe direction .
The uniformity of the flip is the disturbing clue .

NBC projection gives Obama majority of electoral votes
David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Monday October 27 , 2008

Eight days before any election results come in , NBC News is essentially predicting Barack Obama will win the presidency .
The network 's electoral vote projections -- which are based on an analysis of state - by - state polling , campaign efforts , early turnout and other factors -- say a majority of electoral votes will go to the Democratic candidate .
Even without factoring in the " toss up " states where the outcome is too close to predict , Obama can get more than 270 electoral votes , enough to win the presidency , assuming he prevails in states that are solidly in his column or leaning toward voting for him .
NBC political director Chuck Todd said Colorado and Virgina -- two states that went for President Bush in 2000 and 2004 -- were now leaning toward Obama , putting him over the threshold .
If Obama also wins Nevada , where polls give him a narrow lead , the Democratic candidate can win the presidency without winning Pennsylvania , Ohio and Florida -- the three states that have proved most critical in the last two elections .
That scenario is exceptionally unlikely , however .
Obama holds a double - digit lead in Pennsylvania and is up by about 6 points in Ohio , while Florida remains essentially tied .
The fact of the matter is that Obama is solidly on offense during the last week of the campaign , with the toughest fights occuring in red states .
Things are so bad for McCain that voters in his home state of Arizona are trending toward Obama .
Even some Republicans are beginning to doubt John McCain 's chances .
 Any serious Republican has to ask ,  How did we get into this mess ?   Newt Gingrich , the former Republican house speaker , said in an interview .
 It s not where we should be , and its not where we had to be .
This was not bad luck .
As Mr. Obama uses his money and political organization to try to expand the political map , Mr. McCain is being forced to shore up support in states like Indiana and North Carolina that have not been contested for decades .
His decision to campaign on Sunday in Iowa , a day after Ms. Palin campaigned there , was questioned even by Republicans who noted polls that showed Mr. Obama pulling away there .
But it reflected how few options the campaign really has , as poll after poll suggests that Mr. Obama is solidifying his position .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Bank of America said Monday its third - quarter profit slid below analysts ' estimates , and announced a dividend cut and stock offering aimed at positioning it for an eventual recovery .
The company said it earned $ 1.18 billion , or 15 cents a share in the quarter , a 68 % fall from the $ 3.70 billion , or 82 cents a share , in the same period a year ago .
Analysts polled by FactSet Research had expected earnings of 61 cents a share .
Bank of America BAC , - 1.32 % Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lewis cited rising charges for soured credit market investments and higher credit card charge - offs .
He said in a prepared statement that , " These are the most difficult times for financial institutions that I have experienced in my 39 years in banking . "
During a conference call with analysts , Lewis said : " We 've seen , even in the last 45 days , things worsen . "
That prompted the company to take " a view that the recession is going to be a little deeper than we thought , " Lewis said .
Bank of America said it is cutting its dividend in half , to 32 cents a share , and will sell up to $ 10 billion in common stock to beef up its balance sheet .
It said the dividend cut should preserve about $ 1.4 billion a quarter in much - needed capital .
The dividend cut highlighted the seriousness of the capital situation in the banking sector , because Lewis had repeatedly stressed the firm would not cut the dividend and had enough capital to operate with the 64 cents - a- share payout in place .
However , the increased pressure on the credit markets since Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy last month -- along with the added capital requirement associated with its purchases of Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch -- appeared to have forced Lewis ' hand .
Shares of Bank of America fell nearly 10 % in late trading , to $ 29.10 .
Lewis said the company felt compelled to disclose its lower - than - expected quarterly numbers and capital - raising plans as quickly as possible .
He acknowledged the increasingly tight credit markets , and added that in order to maintain a targeted Tier 1 capital ratio of 8 % , the company needed to raise money now .
" We do n't look real smart today , given what happened , but all in all , we thought it was prudent to get out there sooner rather than later , " Lewis said .
" You can talk about a miss on estimates , but estimates do n't mean what they used to . "
The company said earlier that , " The recessionary conditions and outlook for still weaker economic performance ... [ will ] drive higher credit losses and depress earnings . "
Credit card unit takes a hit
Another warning sign also emerged in the company 's third - quarter earnings report in the form of credit card write - offs .
The bank said credit card net charge - offs rose to $ 1.24 billion , representing a net charge - off rate of 6.14 % , while credit card managed net credit losses rose to $ 3 billion , representing a loss rate of 6.4 % percent .
" The consumer credit card business experienced a decrease in purchase volumes , slowing repayments and increased delinquencies during the quarter , " the company said .
As housing prices fell dramatically , investors who could no longer access credit through home equity loans began increasing their drawdown of revolving credit - card debt .
Now , as unemployment rises and the economy worsens , defaults are rising in credit - card land .
In other segments , investment banking income rose 22 % from the previous year to $ 474 million .
Lewis said that the company 's capital raise announced Monday should cover its acquisition of Merrill Lynch , a deal announced last month and is expected to provide a boost to its investment banking operations .
Lewis said the acquisition could close by the end of the year , and noted that former Merrill CEO John
Thain will serve as head of global corporate and investment banking , " which will incorporate most of Merrill Lynch 's businesses . "
In addition , Bank of America said its capital markets and advisory services businesses took a $ 952 million loss in charges related to collateralized debt obligations .
Leveraged loan and commercial mortgage related write - downs took a $ 327 million bite out of results , and the firm lost an additional $ 190 million from its commitment to buy back auction - rate securities from clients .
Equity investment income results were negatively impacted by write - downs totaling $ 320 million on the preferred stock of Fannie Mae FNM , and Freddie Mac FRE , +0.07 % , the firm said .
Bank of America 's global wealth and investment management revenue was affected by $ 630 million in support for cash funds and $ 123 million in losses on a commitment to buy back auction - rate securities from clients , it said .
The company added almost $ 2 billion to its allowance for loan losses , which it said were mainly for consumer loans , including the unsecured consumer lending , credit - card and residential mortgage portfolios .
" Higher levels of bankruptcies are occurring and delinquencies and losses have increased in all consumer portfolios , " the firm said .
She just had to go there .
During an exchange on Late Edition Oct. 26 , 2008 , Heather Wilson could just not resist taking a cheap shot at Biden for his hair transplants and compares the money spent by the RNC on Palin 's clothing to what Obama spends on his ties as well .
Since the Republicans have tried to paint Palin as a Washington outsider , a maverick and reformer --- this clothing spree certainly shattered that image .
Let us remember how the Republicans went wild over John Edwards 400.00 hair cut .
Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee used it as laugh lines at one of the Republican Primary debates .
CNN :
BLITZER : Heather Wilson , are you embarrassed that the Republican National Committee spent $ 150,000 buying designer outfits for Sarah Palin at Saks and Neiman - Marcus , another $ 20,000 for make - up in the first two weeks of October alone , $ 10,000 for hair ?
Is this what a hockey mom should be getting ?
WILSON : Well , that sounds like there are some staffers at the RNC who need a little education on how to shop at Wal - Mart and Ross Direct .
But it does concern me in the last 10 days of an election campaign we 're talking about those things .
WILSON : And we could talk about Barack Obama 's ties or the vice president 's hair transplants or something like that .
WASSERMAN -SCHULTZ : Barack Obama does n't spend that kind of money on ties .
He buys them himself .
WILSON : But I would rather talk about things that matter like which direction we go to get our economy back on track .
And we have two very different candidates in very different directions here , and I think that Americans should be concerned about Pelosi , Reid and Obama because Katie bar the door on government spending if that 's the way Americans choose to go .
And we will go back to very big government and government in your lives in every aspect of your life .
WASSERMAN -SCHULTZ : Wolf , when it comes to spending , it 's the Republicans under the Bush administration that have gotten us into the biggest deficit in American history .
We had a --
WILSON : It is the Congress that appropriates , Debbie , and you of all people know that .
WASSERMAN -SCHULTZ : And the Congress was controlled by Republicans for eight out of the last 10 years , so let 's keep that in mind .
WILSON : And we balanced for the first time since 1969 .
WASSERMAN -SCHULTZ : No , no , no , my dear , you got us into a deficit situation within three years of the Bush administration .
So , we had a Clinton surplus and we have a Bush deficit and that 's what John McCain would continue more of the same
The PlayStation 2 just passed its 8th birthday here in North America , and the console is still going strong .
With 131.3 million units sold worldwide , Sony is looking to continue to tap into that market .
To that end , Sony Computer Entertainment Europe 's developer relations manager George Bain has revealed that the company will be removing the content approval process in an attempt to attract smaller developers .
" You no longer have to submit a game for content approval , " Bain explained at the Casual Connect conference in Kyiv .
Citing Russia and India as examples , Bain said that independent developers in all countries can now " create low - development cost titles and release them in their market . "
Since there are no licensing fees , the only cost to the developer would be the PS2 dev kit .
In order to help alleviate some of that financial burden , Bain said that in some cases Sony will lend out dev kits .
Another option for developers making small , casual titles is to purchase PS2 debug dev kits , which cost about 1/10 of a full version .
Bain went on to explain another possible option for smaller local developers : the PlayStation Network .
" One thing that a lot of developers seem to forget is that PlayStation Network is free , " he explained .
" Consumers do not have to pay a monthly fee ... game developers should create games for local markets . "
To make this an easier process , Sony is implementing several new policies .
One is the new global approval system .
Instead of sending a game to each Sony territory — Europe , Japan , and America — games now go through just one worldwide website .
Sony will also be eliminating the need for a third - party publisher for PSN games .
" This is something we 're actively promoting , " Bain said .
" Without the need of a licensed publisher , it 's a direct relationship between a developer and Sony . "
Given the recent boom in independent game development , this seems like a very smart move on Sony 's part .
Fostering the creativity of smaller developers can only lead to good things , and who knows , maybe we 'll see another Braid or Everyday Shooter , thanks to this initiative .
KABUL , Afghanistan — Taliban insurgents pulled some 50 passengers off a bus in southern Afghanistan and beheaded as many as 30 of them after accusing them of being soldiers traveling in civilian clothes , Afghan officials in the region announced on Sunday .
The police chief of Kandahar Province , where the attack occurred on Thursday , said that of six bodies retrieved so far , all had been beheaded , mutilated and dumped .
The police had received information that 24 other people had been killed but had yet to find their bodies , the police chief , Gen. Matiullah Qati , said .
The attack was on the main road running from the southern city of Kandahar to the western town of Herat , General Qati said .
It took place in Maiwand District , which is known as an area with a significant Taliban presence , where attacks on military convoys are frequent .
The road is also the main route for British and Afghan army troops traveling to Helmand Province , where the insurgency is strongest .
The attack follows a pattern of intimidation and brutality that Taliban insurgents have pursued , spreading terror in an effort to undermine support for the Afghan government .

WPXI is reporting that the story of a politically motivated attack against a McCain supporter in Pittsburgh is a hoax .
Ashley Todd made up the story of mugging that turned into a political attack after the mugger noticed a McCain bumper sticker on her car .
A police source told the television station that she had made the whole thing up .
It is likely that her injuries including a B carved into her cheek were self inflicted .
As a Western Pennsylvania , this story sounded dubious from the beginning .
It did n’t make sense why she was not on the ATM video .
In fact , if you know the area , the whole story did n’t make much sense .
Pittsburgh is n’t known for violence , much less politically motivated violence .
Either Ms. Todd is a Republican who was trying to help McCain / Palin in the state , or she is just a desperate attention seeker who was looking for a little fame .
What troubled me was the racial element and implications in her story .
A tall black man attacked her and told her that he was going to make her an Obama supporter .
The whole idea of trying to fuel a racial divide either to help a presidential campaign or as a stunt to get attention is sick and sad .

Maybe this stuff plays in Texas , but in Pennsylvania , this stuff is n’t going to fly .
I do n’t know maybe this was a designed appeal to the racist redneck vote .
Pittsburgh has its racial problems , but I do n’t believe that there are politically active muggers roaming the streets of Bloomfield .
Pittsburgh is a city that prides itself on friendliness and its small town feel .
If this was a political stunt , it sounds like it was thought up by a dumb college Republican .
Of course , the police would take such an allegation seriously , because if true , it would give the whole city a bad name .
Pittsburgers are very proud of their city , and I hope that Todd either gets the mental help she needs or gets sent to jail .

' Rednecks for Obama ' defy conventional wisdom Founders tell friends : ' He 's not going to try to take away your guns '
TO GO WITH AFP STORY by Michael Mathes , US - vote - Obama - conservativesTony Viessman ( L ) , founder of the grassroots campaign group Rednecks for Obama , and friend Les Spencer demonstrate on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis , Missouri on October 2 , 2008 , the day of the US vice presidential debate .
The group backing the first African - American nominee of a major party for the US presidency , Barack Obama , consists of two men on a grassroots mission to bridge a cultural gap in the United States and help usher their candidate into the White House .

Les Spencer is an atypical Barack Obama supporter .
He 's a redneck .
His buddy Tony Viessman calls himself one , too .
Without accessing their inner Jeff Foxworthy , they define redneck as hardworking guys who like to hunt , fish , and maybe pop a beer or two .
" I hunt squirrels , too , " Spencer said , in between drags of bummed Pall Malls on Viessman 's back porch .
" And I like eating turtles . "
Spencer and Viessman comprise the sum total of the Rolla , Mo. - born - and - bred " Rednecks for Obama . "
Unaffiliated with the Obama campaign , it 's a home - grown shtick the two retirees invented to address what may be Obama 's most serious challenge in becoming commander in chief : winning - or at least not totally losing - the " redneck " vote .
The two retirees have traveled on their own dime to all the debates and the Democratic National Convention to try to convince doubters that Obama is redneck - friendly .
" This election is too important , " Viessman said .
Obama 's ' small - town ' gaffe
Every voter worth his deer rifle remembers what Obama told attendees at a San Francisco fundraiser in April .
He said small - town voters in Pennsylvania and elsewhere had become " bitter " over losing their jobs .
That bitterness caused them to " cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people like them , " he said .
Obama told the New York Times recently the statement was " my biggest boneheaded move " of the campaign , saying that he was " clumsily " trying to say the opposite : that since Democrats had n't done a good job of reaching out to rural voters on cultural issues , they have n't been able to connect with them on economic ones .
Far more than his losing predecessors Al Gore and John Kerry , Obama has traveled to the reddest parts of states like Virginia , North Carolina and Missouri to try to connect .
In 2004 , George W. Bush won two - thirds of the vote in these rolling hills of Phelps County two hours southwest of St. Louis .
' Change is hard '
Viessman was so impressed that Obama was the first presidential candidate to visit Rolla since native Missourian Harry Truman that he made a 3 - by - 7 - foot sign ( " Cost me 25 bucks " he said ) to welcome him to town .
But visits are only the start of a courtship .
Viessman is more succinct in analyzing why fellow rednecks may not be flocking to Obama 's campaign .
" Guns , " he said .
" And that he 's black . "
" We are just trying to tell people that you do n't have to be afraid of Obama , " said Spencer , who has done everything from working as a laborer to selling real estate .
" He 's not going to try to take away your guns , no matter what the NRA says . "
" Sometimes change is hard for people , " said Viessman , a retired highway patrol officer .
" But I do n't care if you 're black or Oriental or green , if you can do the job .
And he can do the job .
He 's pretty near the smartest guy who 's ever run for president . "
Cultural wedge issues
In 2004 , author Thomas Frank wrote in his bestselling book " What 's the Matter with Kansas ? " that Republicans had convinced working - class whites to vote against their economic self - interest by appealing to them with cultural wedge issues like abortion , gay rights and gun laws .
Viessman 's neo -redneck take on that : " My dad used to say , ' A poor man who votes for a Republican is a fool . ' "
But McCain supporters say opposition to Obama goes deeper than race in rural Missouri .
" Race is absolutely an issue to some people , and that is unfortunate , " said Missouri state Rep. Jason Brown , a Republican legislator from suburban Kansas City and a McCain supporter who was wounded while serving a tour of duty in Iraq during his legislative term .
" But what people should be focusing on is that Barack is too liberal for many people in Missouri , particularly those outside the cities of St. Louis and Kansas City . "
K.C. Morrison , a professor of political science at the University of Missouri , said Obama has copied the political playbook of his top Missouri surrogate , Sen. Claire McCaskill , in directly appealing to rural voters with economic and health care issues .
Nearly 18 percent of the nation 's rural residents did n't have health insurance in 2007 , according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .
Economic focus
" While he can't take off the blackness when he goes into these areas , he has made an effort to moderate his views on issues like guns , " said Morrison , who concentrates on racial politics .
" He also makes a genuine effort to talk about economic issues .
The pocketbook issues may cause them to listen to another message in this moment in time . "
As for the impact of race in rural Missouri , " that is the great imponderable of this election , " Morrison said .
" It 's unclear . "
While " Rednecks for Obama " may have won the hearts - or at least piqued the interest - of the 1.2 million folks who have visited their Web site , rednecks4obama .com , in the six weeks since its launch , not all rednecks are fans .
" So what do ( Rednecks for Obama ) say a redneck is ? " asked Matt Hinds , 27 , who lives on the other side of Rolla .
When told , he turned to his buddy Jason Boswell and said , " If that 's what they say rednecks are , well , that sounds like you . "
" You , too , " Boswell , 28 , said .
But these rednecks are n't Obama fans .
" I think he 's a two - talker , " said Boswell , who works at a local Wal - Mart .
" He 'll say something to you that you want to hear , then he 'll turn around and say something different to somebody else . "
Hard times
The past few months have been tough on both men .
Hinds ' three kids , playing on a tire swing in the side yard , do n't have health care .
Boswell , a father of two , worries about how price of groceries has gone up $ 50 every two weeks and how it now costs $ 40 more a week to fill his truck up with gas than it did a year ago .
Missouri polls say the economic downturn caused many in the state to support Obama a month ago , pulling him into a virtual tie with McCain .

A mouse species , which was thought to have been extinct in New South Wales for 150 years , has been found living in a drought - ravaged national park in the state 's far west .
It is the first time anyone has seen the desert mouse in the Sturt National Park near Tibooburra since 1857 .
The manager of the area 's National Parks and Wildlife Service , Ingrid Witte , says a PhD student at the University of New South Wales , Ulrike Kloecker , made the important discovery .
" We certainly did n't expect any new finds , " she said .
" [ Ms Kloecker ] has been out their travelling and had to get the manual book out again to identify this species because she had never come across it and yep , there it was . "
Ms Witte says further investigations will now take place to try to find other desert mice .
She says it is exciting that the park can still yield mammals despite the prolonged drought .
" Although it is a rodent , it does n't look like a little house mouse that we know of .
This one is really a beautiful colour , " she said .
" It has a buff - orange ring around its eyes , it is quite an attractive little thing . "
Ms Ulrike , who works in Sturt National Park investigating the ecology of the small mammal and reptile communities , said in a statement that she was excited by the discovery .

Baghdad Is Now Safe !
( According To John McCain ) Posted by Pile ( 8149 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Liars ]
During an interview on " The Situation Room " this afternoon , John McCain told Wolf Blitzer that he needs to " get up to speed " and stop reporting three - month - old news from Iraq .
According to McCain , the surge is working and the streets of Baghdad are safe for Americans to go strolling down .
The only problem ?
Michael Ware , who is , ya know , in Baghdad , says McCain has n't a clue …
UPDATE : McCain goes to Baghdad .. kind of like Debbie Does Dallas except more people get screwed .
" Honestly , Wolf , you 'll barely last twenty minutes out there .
I dont know what part of Neverland Senator McCain is talking about when he says we can go strolling in Baghdad . "
Name : ( change name for anonymous posting ) Title : Comments : 1 Article displayed .
In most political speeches , the common refrain is “ my fellow citizens ” .
John McCain just referred to the country as “ my fellow prisoners . ”
“ Across this country , this is the agenda I have set before my fellow prisoners and the same standards of clarity and candor must now be applied to my opponent . ”
Late Update : For what it ’s worth , my own hunch is that McCain ’s just gotten so in the habit of peppering his speeches with gratuitous POW references that it ’s hard to keep the two things separate .
Latter Update : Longtime TPM
Reader GG says I ’m being too kind : “ If a Dem had made that statement ( my fellow prisoners ) and in that context , the repubs would loudly proclaim the man mad as a hatter and unfit for the presidency .
And judging from other recent actions , he may very well be unfit and it would not be a service to the country to gloss it over . ”

How DARE you stand on that stage , on the shoulders of generations of women who have struggled and sacrificed to allow a woman to achieve what you have , and spit in their faces the way you have done over the past few weeks ?
For a serious candidate for vice president to turn in such a poor performance in interview after interview that the fact that you managed not to pee on the stage meant that you exceeded many people ’s expectations is a crying shame .
In the month since you were named as candidate for VP , you have embodied every single negative stereotype ever put forward as a “ reason ” why women are not fit to lead a nation .
You have been shallow , superficial , disorganized , and clearly uninformed on a wide range of issues that the president MUST understand .
That is absolutely disgraceful .
You are no longer Miss Wasilla – this is not a beauty contest that you can win by chirping “ World peace ! ” into a microphone and waiting for someone to show up with your tiara and sash – it is deadly serious .
How do you propose to take over the presidency , should that be necessary , when it takes you weeks of preparation and drilling and rehearsal in seclusion to get through a 90 minute debate ?
You are so afraid of the press after your three disastrous interviews that you have decided to avoid them completely – do n’t think that we ca n’t see through your attempt to spin the situation to cast yourself as a victim of the evil , mean , press corps .
Do you seriously believe that that would be an option for you , should you ever become president ?
What will you do then ?
How DARE you stand up there and criticize other nations ’ lack of women ’s rights , when you have systematically worked to strip women of their rights since you have had power of any sort ?
Your city led the fight in Alaska to charge women for the rape kits used to gather forensic evidence after a woman has been sexually assaulted .
Your state leads the nation in number of forcible rapes per capita , but you ’ve done nothing to stem the tide .
You speak out against socialized health care – you do n’t want the government involved in what you believe are private decisions – but you ’re more than happy to take away a woman ’s right to choose whether to continue an unwanted pregnancy , even if that pregnancy is the result of rape or incest .
How DARE you stand in front of us as a nation and claim that you are prepared to lead us in finding a way to improve education , when you have demonstrated over and over again your own lack of understanding of basic principles of science , history , and civics ?
Any high school freshman should be able to name at least one or two other Supreme Court cases .
Finding ones you disagreed with might be a bit harder , although for me , Bush v. Gore , Plessy v. Ferguson , and District of Columbia v. Heller come to mind pretty quickly .
One would hope that you would also disagree with the verdict of at least the second case in that list .
How is it that you propose to lead our nation in its interactions with other countries , yet you ca n’t be bothered to do some studying to find out what the Bush Doctrine might be ?
You do n’t seem to grasp the concept that if you do not understand what is causing climate change , you will not be able to do anything to stop it .
Yes , the climate has warmed and cooled in the past without it being caused by human activity – but the difference is those climate changes happened over centuries and millennia — not decades .
They also tended to be accompanied by mass extinctions .
It seems to me that , even if you do n’t believe that humans are to blame , it ’s worth taking action to make absolutely sure that we ’re not part of the problem .
Your position in opposition to comprehensive sexual education is fatally flawed .
As the gap between puberty and marriage widens for more and more young people , abstinence becomes more and more unlikely .
Young people will have sex , and nothing that we say or do will ever stop that .
Sex is a basic drive for humans .
We can either accept this fact and make sure that these young people have comprehensive sex ed – including a thorough understanding of how to prevent pregnancy and disease – and access to condoms and other forms of birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancies and the spread of STIs , or we can continue to see young people ’s options in life severely limited by disease and unplanned pregnancies .
I have been unable to definitively substantiate reports that you are a young - earth creationist who believes that dinosaurs coexisted with humans , but if that is true , it is one more proof that you are unfit to lead this nation .
Science and technology are the US ’s only hope for maintaining its position in the global economy .
We cannot move forward as a nation and maintain our position in the vanguard of science and technology behind a leader who rejects even the most basic scientific understanding in favor of myths and legends .
How DARE you claim to be part of a middle - class family ?
The AP reports that your family income is approximately $ 230,000 per year , with assets in excess of $ 1 million .
That ’s almost 4 times the average income in Alaska , and over 5 times the average income in the entire US .
That ’s approximately 3 times the net worth of Joe Biden .
The folksy , aw - shucks routine is a calculated fake with which you hope to lie your way into national - level power – what other reason could there be for you refusing to release your financial information before the VP debate , other than your hope that no one would bother to fact - check your claim to be in the middle class ?
God help us if you actually succeed at this .
You are nothing more than a conniving , grasping politician who favors style over substance .
You talk of your status as an “ outsider ” , but your true colors showed tonight as you talked of your hopes of expanding the power you would wield as vice president , were the American people crazy enough to elect you .
Dick Cheney has already had his crack at running the country into the ground by wielding powers to which he had absolutely no right , from a Constitutional standpoint .
The LAST thing we want to do now is expand those powers further for the likes of you .
We ’ve been lied to for eight years already .
We ’ve dealt with cronyism and abuse of power .
We ’ve watched the government stonewall inquiries into even its most blatantly illegal and unethical actions .
( We ’ve already seen evidence of how you ’re more than happy to do these things as well , in your less than two years as Alaska governor .
Why is it that you are no longer asking us to “ hold you accountable ” in your ethics inquiry ?
Why are your people now refusing to answer subpoenas so that the inquiry can proceed ? )
We ’ve seen our homes and jobs and money stolen , and watched wealth concentrated in the hands of the rich while the poor and the middle class suffered .
We ’ve watched oil company profits shoot up , and no -bid contracts handed out unapologetically to companies with undeniable ties to the Bush / Cheney regime .
We ’ve watched scientists routinely manipulated or squelched if their findings were inconvenient to the administration ’s political objectives .
We ’ve seen ally after ally throughout the world alienated .
We ’ve watched thousands of young men and women die in a preemptive war which the government lied to us to start , yet we ’ve continued to fail to catch the people who were actually the ones that attacked us on 9/11 .
We ’ve watched the economy tank , and the deficit skyrocket .
You talk about “ change ” , but spout the same old policies we ’ve seen over and over and over and over .
You are nothing more than 4 more years of Bush .
And it ’s time we said “ Enough . ”
As for you , the best thing you could do for the nation is to take your family , and go back to Wasilla .
Spend time in that lovely house you own – the one by the lake .
Or maybe in one of your vacation cottages .
Relax .
Maybe read a book .
You can use your private plane to get there .
But leave the rest of us alone .
We ’ve had enough of your type .
Sincerely ,
Nan Rhyner

What motivates campaign donations ?
Discussions of campaign finance reform are dominated by a private interest theory , that donations are in trade for favors .
Here donations in support of interests besides yours are bad news ; they says the candidate has implicitly promised to help those interests at your expense .
The main alternative is a public interest theory , which says we donate to signal private info about candidate quality .
Under this theory people who get private info suggesting a candidate would be good at promoting the general public interest donate money to signal confidence .
Here campaign donations are good news .
Now consider that Big Donors Drive Obama ’s Money Edge :
The record - shattering $ 150 million in donations that Sen. Barack Obama raised in September represents only part of [ his ] financial advantage . …
[ It ] is compounded by Obama ’s ability to continue to raise money through the election because he decided not to participate in the federal financing program .
McCain opted in , meaning he received $ 84.1 million in federal funds to spend between the Republican National Convention and Nov. 4 , and he must rely solely on the Republican National Committee for additional financial support . …
The Democratic Party created a separate committee to capture millions of additional dollars from individuals who had already given Obama the most the law allows and who had also anted up $ 28,500 to the Democratic National Committee . …
The Committee … has become a vehicle for ultra-rich Democratic donors to distinguish themselves from the 3.1 million others who have put $ 600 million behind Obama ’s presidential candidacy . …
Only a quarter of [ this ] has come from donors who made contributions of $ 200 or less . …
That is actually slightly less , as a percentage , than President Bush raised in small donations during his 2004 race .
Obama supporters seem to have these alternatives :
Reject the private interest theory , and thus reject campaign finance reform , or Accept the private interest theory , and A . See Obama ’s donors as an unusual aberration , or
B. Agree this is bad news , but see enough other good news about Obama , or
C. See this as good news as they share private interests with Obama ’s rich donors .

India sets its sights on the Moon
By Sanjoy Majumder
BBC News , Sriharikota
Please turn on JavaScript .

On an island off the Bay of Bengal in southern India , the mood is upbeat but also slightly tense .
This is the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota - India 's launch pad for its satellite missions .
It 's been prepared for what is the country 's most ambitious space venture to date , an unmanned mission to the Moon .
Its indigenously built satellite , Chandrayaan - 1 - the name is Sanskrit for lunar craft - blasted off on an Indian - built rocket , the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle , early on Wednesday .
For the country 's space scientists , it marks a major milestone .
India has successfully developed its rocket and satellite technology .
More than a dozen Indian satellites currently orbit the Earth .
But this latest mission is the first time it is sending a spacecraft beyond the Earth 's orbit .
If successful , India joins the Asian powers China and Japan , which have already undertaken their own lunar missions .
But it 's doing it at a fraction of the cost - $ 80 m compared to China 's $ 187 m lunar probe launched last year and Japan 's $ 480 m Kayuga mission .
Search for water Chandrayaan - 1 was launched on India 's PSLV , which has had only one failure in 13 launches .
In April , it successfully launched 10 satellites in one go , shattering a world record held by Russia .
So why is there renewed interest in the Moon , 36 years after the pioneering Apollo manned missions ?
Chandrayaan is India 's most ambitious space venture to date Indian scientists say there is still a lot to be learnt about Earth 's nearest neighbour .
" There is a wealth of information that exists about the Moon .
At the same time , there is also certain questions which are not answered fully , " says MYS Prasad , associate director of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre .
" For example , 41 % of the Moon 's surface cannot be observed directly from the Earth .
The experiments that Chandrayaan will carry out are designed to enhance this knowledge . "
The mission 's main objectives are to create a three - dimensional atlas of the Moon , study its chemical and mineral composition , look for Helium - 3 - which could be a future energy source - and search for the presence of water - ice .
Chandrayaan - 1 will also carry a Moon Impactor - a smaller satellite that will be ejected on to the lunar surface and will be used for a closer inspection .
An idea suggested by the former Indian President , APJ Abdul Kalam , the impactor will also be painted with the Indian flag and thereby , symbolically , it will be " planted " on to the Moon .
International interest
But this is more than just a national project .
The satellite is carrying a total of 11 instruments , including high - resolution cameras and spectrometers that will help it in analysing the lunar surface .
While five of the instruments are Indian , six of them have been supplied by US space agency ( Nasa ) , the European Space Agency ( Esa ) and Bulgaria .
The mission will launch from an island in the Bay of Bengal
They are being carried free of cost - an indication of how much India wants this mission to be seen as a collaborative one that can benefit everyone .
Some , like Wing Commander Rakesh Sharma - the only Indian astronaut to be sent into space - believes this is the way forward .
" During the Cold War era , there were ideologies attached to successes of this kind .
No longer .
I believe the time for competition is over , " he says .
" These kinds of missions and aims are beyond the capacity of any one country .
They have to be collaborative . "
But there are some who believe that the mission is being driven by more than just altruism .
In their eyes , India is aiming for a slice of the lucrative commercial satellite launch business .
Chandrayaan will be monitored from India 's Deep Space Network " To be in the commercial satellite launch business you need to prove yourself .
Each of these satellites is very costly and a foreign country will be very careful before they entrust ( one ) in your care , " says N Madhavan , senior editor at Business Today magazine .
It 's one reason why India believes that the investment it is making in its space programme will pay off in the long term , despite the huge costs for a country where at least a third of the population lives on less than a dollar a day .
It makes for some startling incongruities .
Forty kilometres south of the city of Bangalore lies the village of Byalalu set amidst rolling hills .
A freshly built tarmac road ribbons its way through farmland and dusty villages .
Children play by its side and water buffaloes draw wooden carts .
But just ahead , rising out of the countryside is a majestic white dish antenna , 32 m in diameter .
This is India 's Deep Space Network .
For the next two years , scientists and technicians here will monitor Chandrayaan - 1 and download its data .
For the moment , local villagers are excited - if for no other reason than because the station has given them some immediate work .
Many of them are helping to build the roads and buildings that are still not quite finished .
That itself , for many here , justifies the mission .

According to the International Maritime Bureau ( IMB ) , pirates have seized a Greek bulk carrier en route to Kenya with 25 crew on board in the Gulf of Aden some 370 kilometers from Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia .
Noel Choong , who represents the International Maritime Bureau , advised ships traveling through the gulf to take extra precautions .
" It appears that the pirates are now attacking ships in two areas , the eastern part of Somalia and northern parts of the Horn of Africa nation , " he said .
" Ships are warned to take extra measures and stay 200 nautical miles away from the coast .
They must maintain a strict watch .
The Gulf of Aden is a dangerous place for ships , with many incidents of piracy occurring regularly in the Gulf .
Four hours earlier pirates had attacked another vessel , a chemical tanker from Hong Kong , which was at the time carrying 22 crew members .
Following that attack , the gulf was described by the managing director of the Hong Kong Shipowners Association as an " incredibly dangerous place . "
In response to this , several large shipping organisations have called for countries to deploy forces from their Navies in the Gulf of Aden .
" The shipping industry 's plea is in response to a situation which it describes as in danger of spiralling completely and irretrievably out of control , " said the group which consisted of the International Chamber of Shipping , Intercargo , Bimco and Intertanko .
" Continued inaction against these violent acts could prompt shipowners to redirect their ships via the Cape of Good Hope , with severe consequences for international trade , including increased prices for delivered goods . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
How should piracy be dealt with in the Gulf of Aden ?
Add or view comments
The group also said that there have been 40 hijackings in the gulf , resulting in 133 crew members being kidnapped and 10 ships being held .
According to the IMB six gangs totalling approximately 1,200 people have carried out these attacks .

The winner of the Nobel economics prize has just been announced , and it 's something of a surprise .
This year 's award had gone to Paul Krugman , the Princeton academic who is perhaps most famous for his long - running series of opinion pieces in the New York Times .
Paul Krugman , Princeton professor
Krugman ( left ) gets the gong , and the 10 million kronor ( £ 816,000 ) , for his " analysis of how economies of scale can affect trade patterns and the location of economic activity " .
A noted liberal , Krugman is seen as a neo -Keynesian so his victory is timely .
There 's quite a revival of interest in John Maynard Keynes 's theories at present , especially his argument that government intervention is the best way to stop a downturn becoming a depression .
His victory is also unexpected .
Krugman got little mention in the speculation in the run-up to today 's announcement .
He was n't even top of the New York Times ' own shortlist ( although the NYT did give a cheeky hint that Krugman had been smartening himself up ahead of a call from Sweden ) .
The favourite in the pre-awards betting was Eugene Fama , an economist at the University of Chicago .
Fama developed the efficient market hypothesis , which argued that all traded assets – from bonds to mortgage - backed securities – are already accurately valued based on the information available to investors .
Perhaps the Nobel committee felt that this was n't really Fama 's year , as the fear and panic following the credit crunch threatens the collapse of the entire financial system .
And , to be fair , choosing any winner in the current climate is no easy task .
Rather like picking the winner of the " best run British bank " award , perhaps .
Krugman's also a great writer , as you can see from his essays on the New York Times .
Only yesterday he was applauding Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling for showing the rest of the world how to respond to the financial crisis …..
There 's a full explanation of the reasoning behind Krugman 's award in a pdf here .
Eight were found to have naturally developed immunity to the disease , which threatens to kill off the species in Britain by the middle of the century .
The discovery was described as " the first sign of hope " for the species since it began a steep decline at the end of the 19th century .
The Seven Habits of Highly Ineffective Terrorists
Most counterterrorism policies fail , not because of tactical problems , but because of a fundamental misunderstanding of what motivates terrorists in the first place .
If we ’re ever going to defeat terrorism , we need to understand what drives people to become terrorists in the first place .
Conventional wisdom holds that terrorism is inherently political , and that people become terrorists for political reasons .
This is the “ strategic ” model of terrorism , and it ’s basically an economic model .
It posits that people resort to terrorism when they believe — rightly or wrongly — that terrorism is worth it ; that is , when they believe the political gains of terrorism minus the political costs are greater than if they engaged in some other , more peaceful form of protest .
It ’s assumed , for example , that people join Hamas to achieve a Palestinian state ; that people join the PKK to attain a Kurdish national homeland ; and that people join al - Qaida to , among other things , get the United States out of the Persian Gulf .
If you believe this model , the way to fight terrorism is to change that equation , and that ’s what most experts advocate .
Governments tend to minimize the political gains of terrorism through a no-concessions policy ; the international community tends to recommend reducing the political grievances of terrorists via appeasement , in hopes of getting them to renounce violence .
Both advocate policies to provide effective nonviolent alternatives , like free elections .
Historically , none of these solutions has worked with any regularity .
Max Abrahms , a predoctoral fellow at Stanford University ’s Center for International Security and Cooperation , has studied dozens of terrorist groups from all over the world .
He argues that the model is wrong .
In a paper published this year in International Security that — sadly — does n’t have the title “ Seven Habits of Highly Ineffective Terrorists , ” he discusses , well , seven habits of highly ineffective terrorists .
These seven tendencies are seen in terrorist organizations all over the world , and they directly contradict the theory that terrorists are political maximizers :
Terrorists , he writes , ( 1 ) attack civilians , a policy that has a lousy track record of convincing those civilians to give the terrorists what they want ; ( 2 ) treat terrorism as a first resort , not a last resort , failing to embrace nonviolent alternatives like elections ; ( 3 ) do n’t compromise with their target country , even when those compromises are in their best interest politically ; ( 4 ) have protean political platforms , which regularly , and sometimes radically , change ; ( 5 ) often engage in anonymous attacks , which precludes the target countries making political concessions to them ; ( 6 ) regularly attack other terrorist groups with the same political platform ; and ( 7 ) resist disbanding , even when they consistently fail to achieve their political objectives or when their stated political objectives have been achieved .
Abrahms has an alternative model to explain all this : People turn to terrorism for social solidarity .
He theorizes that people join terrorist organizations worldwide in order to be part of a community , much like the reason inner-city youths join gangs in the United States .
The evidence supports this .
Individual terrorists often have no prior involvement with a group ’s political agenda , and often join multiple terrorist groups with incompatible platforms .
Individuals who join terrorist groups are frequently not oppressed in any way , and often ca n’t describe the political goals of their organizations .
People who join terrorist groups most often have friends or relatives who are members of the group , and the great majority of terrorist are socially isolated : unmarried young men or widowed women who were n’t working prior to joining .
These things are true for members of terrorist groups as diverse as the IRA and al - Qaida .
For example , several of the 9/11 hijackers planned to fight in Chechnya , but they did n’t have the right paperwork so they attacked America instead .
The mujahedeen had no idea whom they would attack after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan , so they sat around until they came up with a new enemy : America .
Pakistani terrorists regularly defect to another terrorist group with a totally different political platform .
Many new al - Qaida members say , unconvincingly , that they decided to become a jihadist after reading an extreme , anti-American blog , or after converting to Islam , sometimes just a few weeks before .
These people know little about politics or Islam , and they frankly do n’t even seem to care much about learning more .
The blogs they turn to do n’t have a lot of substance in these areas , even though more informative blogs do exist .
All of this explains the seven habits .
It ’s not that they ’re ineffective ; it ’s that they have a different goal .
They might not be effective politically , but they are effective socially :
They all help preserve the group ’s existence and cohesion .
This kind of analysis is n’t just theoretical ; it has practical implications for counterterrorism .
Not only can we now better understand who is likely to become a terrorist , we can engage in strategies specifically designed to weaken the social bonds within terrorist organizations .
Driving a wedge between group members — commuting prison sentences in exchange for actionable intelligence , planting more double agents within terrorist groups — will go a long way to weakening the social bonds within those groups .
We also need to pay more attention to the socially marginalized than to the politically downtrodden , like unassimilated communities in Western countries .
We need to support vibrant , benign communities and organizations as alternative ways for potential terrorists to get the social cohesion they need .
And finally , we need to minimize collateral damage in our counterterrorism operations , as well as clamping down on bigotry and hate crimes , which just creates more dislocation and social isolation , and the inevitable calls for revenge .

FringeDC On Temporary Hiatus ...
Hi everyone : I 've been having some difficulty lately keeping on a regular schedule with FringeDC , giving some issues with meeting spaces and speakers .
Although some new opportunities have opened up for both of these , I 'm currently swamped with work ( my day job , my startup , my book ) and do n't feel like I can invest enough time into FringeDC right now to guarantee there wo n't be more hickups in the near future .
Poor organization leads to lower attendance , and I want attendance to be high .
Therefore , I 'm going to put FringeDC on hiatus until late Spring 2010 .
At that point , I hope to relaunch FringeDC with a new website , shiny new presentations , and a better plan for meeting spaces .
Hope to meet up with you all again at that point .
Please check back in a few months for details !

The number of students in the United States taking the National Latin Exam has risen steadily to more than 134,000 students in each of the past two years , from 124,000 in 2003 and 101,000 in 1998 , with large increases in remote parts of the country like New Mexico , Alaska and Vermont .
The number of students taking the Advanced Placement test in Latin , meanwhile , has nearly doubled over the past 10 years , to 8,654 in 2007 .
While Spanish and French still dominate student schedules  and Chinese and Arabic are trendier choices 
Latin has quietly flourished in many high - performing suburbs , like New Rochelle , where Latin ’s virtues are sung by superintendents and principals who took it in their day .
In neighboring Pelham , the 2,750 - student district just hired a second full - time Latin teacher after a four - year search , learning that scarce Latin teachers have become more sought - after than ever .
On Long Island , the Jericho district is offering an Advanced Placement course in Latin for the first time this year after its Latin enrollment rose to 120 students , a 35 percent increase since 2002 .
In nearby Great Neck , 36 fifth graders signed up last year for before - and after - school Latin classes that were started by a 2008 graduate who has moved on to study classics at Stanford ( that student ’s brother and a friend will continue to lead the Latin classes this year ) .
Latin is also thriving in New York City , where it is currently taught in about three dozen schools , including Brooklyn Latin , a high school in East Williamsburg that started in 2006 .
Four years of Latin , and two of Spanish , are required at the new high school , where Latin phrases adorn the walls and words like discipuli ( students ) , magistri ( teachers ) and latrina ( bathroom ) are sprinkled into everyday conversation .
“ It ’s the language of scholars and educated people , ” said Jason Griffiths , headmaster of Brooklyn Latin .
“ It ’s the language of people who are successful .
I think it ’s a draw , and that ’s certainly what we sell . ”
Adam D. Blistein , executive director of the American Philological Association at the University of Pennsylvania , which represents more than 3,000 members , including classics professors and Latin teachers , said that more high schools were recognizing the benefits of Latin .
It builds vocabulary and grammar for higher SAT scores , appeals to college admissions officers as a sign of critical - thinking skills and fosters true intellectual passion , he said .

As the U.S. economy teeters on the brink of recession , Democratic leaders are revisiting an idea born of the Great Depression : gas stamps to help Americans cope with high fuel prices .
The proposal to subsidize fuel costs for lower - income families and individuals would almost certainly be popular with white , working - class voters and could boost Barack Obama ’s appeal with that critical voting bloc in this year ’s presidential election .
Democratic lawmakers and their leaders say they are serious about including it in a second economic stimulus package expected to move this month .
Meanwhile , Republicans ridicule the idea as a return to welfare - state politics , which they say characterized the Democratic Party before Bill Clinton .
“ It ’s certainly under consideration , ” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) told The Hill on Thursday afternoon .
“ It would be like food stamps for those people who need help . ”
Gas stamps would work like traditional food stamps , which some Americans have collected since the 1930s .
They would be used , however , to pay for regular unleaded instead of meat and potatoes .
Under one version of the proposal , a person earning up to $ 31,200 or a family of four earning up to $ 63,600 could receive government payments totaling $ 500 for gas .
Hoyer said he was not ready to discuss details about the proposal because he is focused on passing a comprehensive energy bill Democrats unveiled this week .
Sens. Obama ( D - Ill. ) and John McCain ( Ariz . ) , the Republican presidential nominee , said last week they would favor Congress passing another stimulus package in light of the national unemployment rate reaching 6.1 percent , its highest level since 2003 .
Democratic strategists say gas stamps could help Democrats appeal to rural and exurban voters and may tip swing states to Obama .
Rural voters have been hit particularly hard by high gas prices .
The idea for fuel stamps was first proposed by maverick Rep. Jim McDermott ( D - Wash . ) , chairman of the House Income Security and Family Support subcommittee , who remembers his family using gas stamps when he was a boy during World War II .
“ If you had to drive to work , you got to buy more gasoline than if you just drove your car on the weekends , ” he said of the wartime policy .
McDermott , who introduced the idea before the August recess , said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) made favorable mention of gas stamps Wednesday during an afternoon caucus meeting on a pending energy bill .
He said the mechanism for giving money to Americans at the pump has yet to be designed .
He suggested that state and local governments could design stamps or perhaps a credit card that would give people a discount each time they fill up their cars or trucks .
A Republican leadership aide panned gas stamps as a bureaucratic government solution to a problem that would be best solved by allowing oil companies to expand offshore drilling .
“ We do n’t need a top - down government program , we need to unleash the potential of the American people by allowing increased production of American energy , ” said Michael Steel , spokesman to House Republican leader John Boehner ( Ohio ) .
“ This is a classic example of top - down , centralized bureaucracy that Washington represents . ”
But some Democratic strategists think that gas stamps could help Obama and other candidates appeal to voters in rural and exurban areas , a demographic that leans toward the GOP .
Democratic strategist Chris Lehane said that the presidential election will likely come down to “ 2 or 3 percent of the electorate in a handful of battleground states ” and that working - class men and women from rural and exurban areas could decide the results .
“ High gas prices disproportionately impact working people who tend to live in areas that require them to drive more to get to where they work , ” Lehane said .
“ To me , this is one of those issues to talk about to a key demographic group [ Democrats ] need to talk to this election . ”
Rep. John Larson ( Conn. ) , vice - chairman of the Democratic Caucus , said gas stamps have become more popular among lawmakers in recent days .
“ That has caught people ’s attention , ” said Larson , who added the stamps would “ distribute something to assist middle - and low - income people . ”
Rep. Gene Green ( D - Texas ) , a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee who played a big role in negotiating the pending Democratic energy bill , said he favors the idea .
“ I ’ve heard talk about it , ” said Green , who said it would help residents of his Houston district .
“ We pay high prices and we do n’t have a wealthy district . ”
Democratic leaders are expected to take up a second economic stimulus package after they push the energy bill through the chamber .
Democratic leaders are also considering increased infrastructure spending , heating assistance for low - income Americans , Medicaid assistance for state governments and extended unemployment insurance , Hoyer told reporters Tuesday .

We 've taken to having tunnels .
It 's easier than having doors , is cooler in the summer , warmer in the winter , and has the added benefit of not needing shoveling out in the winter when it snows .
We are just SO friendly here that no one needs actual doors , we are far to polite to just barge into any room without at least calling , emailing and / or sending gifts beforehand .
We have drapes over bathroom entrances just to ensure that our rude bottoms are n't seen by others without warning .
( If this does happen by accident , apologizes are given all around , beer is drank to help forget the incident and then a hockey game is watched to wipe the image out of our heads . )
GST is the Good Service Tax and we all gladly pay it so that we get good and friendly service from those installing the tunnels , making sure they 're clean and sending out thank you cards to those who use them .
Ottawa has brought forward the idea of slide tunnels , so it 's easier and far more enjoyable to travel between areas .
It has also been suggested that in the summer , water should pumped into the tunnels for a water - slide type like feature .
It would cost far too much for the US to install tunnels at this point , or to start removing doors .
They could adopt a policy of nailing their doors shut so that people will gain a greater appreciation of their homes , and prevent the outside from being messed up .
This would save on clean - up costs , and policing costs , and help any pollution problems that may be occurring because of residents being outside .

WordPress is one of the great wonders of free software , an unlimited number of features and plugins that will keep anyone happy .
With a zillion developers working on this thing it must be the best most optimized software in the world right ? ..
Unfortunately that is not the case .
there are a few issues with wordpress that unless you are running a really low traffic site on some decent hardware you are going to start seeing performance issues with page loads and general just crashing your site ( with us on a Xeon system it happened around 5000 Uniques a day ) .
So what is the problem with wordpress ?
we will cover the three big ones :
1 ) Because there is no body managing the plugin development basically any dog and their cat can write a plugin and have it published on the wordpress site and just because this person can write a plugin .. doesnt mean it is good .
2 ) WordPress is ultra ultra ultra ( did I put enough ultras in there yet ? )
Database intensive .. every little thing it does it needs to query the database .. soemtimes I wonder .. did this really need a database call ?
In total one one of my sites having 34 plugins and a customized template we where doing over 500 DB queries on some page loads ( sometimes more )
3 ) WordPress takes up a huge amount of memory per page load do you want to know how taxing wordpress is on your system ?
download the WordPress system health plugin to find out , I was 10001 % amazed when I found out that Rendering Dashboard ( index. php ) was taking up almost 50 MB worth of memory .
So what can we do about all this ?
Lucky enough for the readers at this site I am willing to share my knowledge of how we saved one of our websites from constantly crashing our server with as little as 5000 uniques a day ( really thats not that many hits to be crashing servers ) .
Caching
Basically caching is going to be one of your saviors in optimizing your wordpress .
there are quite a few wordpress caching products out there but I tend to stick to the true and blue ones that have worked for me all this time :
﻿wp - super - cache : Basic settings are fine , make sure you use the ON feature and check the boxes for “ Do n’t cache pages for logged in users . ” and “ Cache Rebuild ”
wp - widget - cache : Yes Widgets also need to be cached , nothing special here but I generally use the auto expire checkbox .
db cache reloaded : I expire my DB cache every 5 minutes but if you have a pretty low traffic site you can probably cache for longer .
PHP Optimization
If you are the admin of your own server I suggest installing a PHP optimizer / accelerator such as Zend or APC .
I had much better luck with APC then I did with Zend and it took my page loads from close to 50 MB to 15 MB , thats a huge optimization .
Im not really going to show you how to install APC here but if I have time tonight ill write another quick article on howto install it on Linux Centos .
Your template code
If you are a coder or know your way around html pretty good you can help your wordpress by going through your teplate code and taking out anything that is doing a database query that doesnt need to , a prime example of this is the header .
php file :
< meta http-equiv= ” Content - Type ” content= ” <? php bloginfo( ‘ html_type’ ) ; ?> ; charset=<?php bloginfo( ‘ charset ’ ) ; ? > ” />
this can be just a static line like this :
< meta http-equiv= ” Content - Type ” content= ” text / html ; charset=UTF - 8 ″ />
More Admin stuff : Optimizing Apache
I have found this apache configuration to be the most optimal for my server , im not going to go into much detail here but basically edit your httpd .
conf file if you have admin rights to your server :
KeepAlive On
MaxKeepAliveRequests 200
KeepAliveTimeout 5
< IfModule prefork .c >
StartServers 50
MinSpareServers 15
MaxSpareServers 30
# ServerLimit 512
MaxClients 256
MaxRequestsPerChild
0
</ IfModule >
< IfModule worker . c >
StartServers 20
MaxClients 256
MinSpareThreads 25
MaxSpareThreads 75
ThreadsPerChild 25
MaxRequestsPerChild
0
</ IfModule >
Comment out some modules in Apache if you are not using them :
# LoadModule ext_filter_module modules/mod_ext_filter.so
# LoadModule expires_module modules/mod_expires.so
# LoadModule headers_module modules/mod_headers.so

Single - gender education gains ground as boys lag / Experts worry that coed classrooms geared to girls put their counterparts at a disadvantage
Peter Kenton hits a high note while singing at the Pacific Boychoir Academy school for boys in Oakland , Calif . on Thursday , May 3 , 2007 .
Increasing attention is being paid to the fact that public schools are failing many boys , whose active behavior often causes them to be labeled as problems or even learning disabled .

For more than a decade , the conventional wisdom has been that schools have shortchanged girls , who were ignored in the classroom as they lagged behind in math and science .
But now a growing chorus of educators and advocates for boys is turning that notion upside down .
Boys are the ones in trouble , they say .
They are trailing girls in reading and writing , are more likely to get in trouble or be labeled as learning disabled , and are less likely to go to college .
The educators , citing emerging brain research , say that the two sexes learn differently and that schools are more geared to girls than to their ants - in - the - pants counterparts .
But they are adopting strategies to help boys succeed , from playing multiplication baseball to handing out stress balls and setting up boys - only schools .
" The public schools teach to girls .
You have to be able to follow the rules and color in the lines , " said Livermore parent Missy Davis , who moved her son , Collin , to the private , all - boys Pacific Boychoir Academy in Oakland after he struggled in coed public and parochial settings .
" Boys get labeled immature and disrupting .
( Teachers ) do n't know how to utilize the energy . "
Juanita McSweeney , a 30 - year teaching veteran , experienced that energy two years ago when she had a class full of " strong boys " who outnumbered the girls in her fifth - grade class at Happy Valley Elementary in Lafayette .
" I was going nuts .
...
My salvation that year was two words : Koosh balls , " she said , referring to the toy balls covered with hundreds of soft rubber strands .
McSweeney had stumbled across a growing body of literature confirming what she had long intuited -- that boys and girls do learn differently -- and providing strategies to help keep boys , especially , focused and engaged .
" Instead of twiddling with your neighbor , you 'd twiddle with your Koosh ball .
The way to get rid of that extra energy seemed genius to me , " she said .
McSweeney was so enthusiastic that this year the Lafayette School District provided gender training to its entire staff and parents by the Gurian Institute of Colorado .
The firm has trained 30,000 teachers in gender differences and learning since it was founded in 2002 by Michael Gurian , a Spokane , Wash . , family therapist and author who helped kick off the boys movement in 1996 with his book " The Wonder of Boys . "
Among the neurological differences Gurian and others highlight , based on brain scans and other research :
-- Males use more cortical areas of the brain for spatial and mechanical functioning , while females use more for words and emotions -- meaning boys tend to benefit from hands - on learning , while girls are better auditory learners who write and use more words .
-- Boys have less of the " calming chemical " serotonin and more testosterone , making them more fidgety , impulsive and competition - driven .
-- Boys ' brains go more frequently into a " rest state , " leading to " zoning out " or moving around to try to stay focused .
While gender brain differences remain controversial -- only two years ago Harvard President Lawrence Summers lost his job after suggesting males may be more innately suited to science -- what may have been dismissed as pop science a decade ago is now getting serious attention from brain researchers .
" We can say confidently , and more and more confidently all the time , that the ways males and females on average are processing information is not the same , " said Larry Cahill , a fellow of the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory at UC Irvine who last year published a review of studies on neurology and gender .
" It 's kind of a zeitgeist shift from the belief that this does n't matter very much to , ' This might matter big time , and we need to figure out how . ' "
The differences , Gurian said , mean five to seven boys in a coed class of 30 will struggle in a classroom where they need to " sit still , read and write a lot , and do a lot of busy work . "
Those struggles are born out by a string of alarming statistics about boys .
While girls have made strides in math and science , boys continue to lag in reading -- and even more significantly in writing , where the gap has widened -- on tests such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress .
Boys are 2.5 times more likely to be suspended from school and 3.4 times more likely to be expelled , according to federal education statistics .
Two - thirds of special educational students are male .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nearly 10 percent of boys have learning disabilities , compared with 6 percent of girls , and boys are 2.5 times more likely than girls to be diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .
Boys also are more likely to drop out of school .
Since 1970 , women 's undergraduate enrollment in college has risen three times as fast as men's , and women now make up 57 percent of college students .
Still , some people have questioned whether the so - called " boys crisis " exists .
A report last year by Education Sector , a Washington think tank , found that boys ' reading and math scores on the national assessment test had improved since the 1970s .
It said black and Hispanic boys may be failing but that race and class play a bigger a role than gender .
But " it 's hard to ignore that we 've got a boy problem on top of the race and class problem .
Low - income boys are doing worse than low - income girls , " said Judith Kleinfeld , a University of Alaska at Fairbanks psychology professor who last year started the Boys Project , an international consortium of researchers concerned about boys .
The brain research also is reigniting interest in single - gender education .
There were three public schools nationwide offering single - gender instruction in 1995 and 262 today , still a small fraction of the country 's more than 90,000 public schools , according to Leonard Sax , executive director of the National Association for Single Sex Public Education .
Many more are in the pipeline with changes last fall to Title IX -- which banned sex discrimination in schools in 1972 -- that make it easier for schools to create voluntary single - gender classes and schools .
" The brain develops in a different sequence , " said Sax , author of " Why Gender Matters " and " Boys Adrift , " which will be published in August .
" If you teach the same subject in the same way , you have girls who think geometry is tough and boys who think poetry is stupid . "
One has only to walk into Jennifer Colker 's classroom at the 49ers Academy in East Palo Alto to see gender differences in action .
The 11 - year - old public alternative school , which has separate classes for boys and girls , is the only single - gender public school in the Bay Area .
On a recent morning near the end of the school year , the eighth - grade boys in Colker 's language arts and history class were buzzing as they worked independently making encyclopedias or history terms .
Boys bounced their knees , drummed the air , their desks -- or a neighbor -- with colored pencils and wandered the room .
They rapped , laughed and called out for Colker 's attention .
" Look what I 'm using my pencil for , " said Davion Tomlin , 13 , of Hayward , stabbing a red licorice rope with his pencil before getting up to dump it in the trash .
When the girls filed in for next period , they sat quietly in their seats .
The noise level rose considerably when they took out their encyclopedias , but most stayed rooted to their chairs .
" I have to adjust the lesson ( with the boys ) to have it be mobile and kinesthetic rather than auditory or visual , " said Colker , who engages her male students in several games .
The school 's executive director , Michelle Starkey , said its score on the state 's Academic Performance Index has increased 167 points in three years , but it 's hard to know how much is attributable to single - gender instruction because the school also has small class sizes and extra services on campus .
Having just boys in class also means the ability to tailor subjects to grab their attention , said John L. Morgan IV , a middle school English teacher at the 68 - year - old private Town School for Boys in San Francisco , one of a handful of boys ' schools in the Bay Area .
" I do ' Macbeth ' because they love the gore , " he said .
He also does n't hesitate to use gross humor .
At the 3 - year - old Pacific Boychoir Academy , which is an outgrowth of the choir , Pamela Weimer uses as much hands - on instruction as she can in her math and science classes -- from tossing a baseball during multiplication drills to offering plenty of science labs .
" Boys need to be active all the time , " said Weimer , who also heads the school .
" It 's physiological , not willful . "
The approach has worked for recent eighth - grade graduate Collin Davis , who has attention deficit disorder and was getting labeled a troublemaker in his coed classes .
" You can be yourself and act crazy and wacky , just the stuff you would n't do around girls , " said Collin .
" He 's a different kid , " said his father , Warren Davis .
" He 's doing better in school , but he 's doing better in life . "

moral of the story " Well we sure learned our lesson , " says me standin in the middle a the smoke an the rubble an the burnin burnin cities , " and that 's to never blow up someone else 's country again . "
" Unless there 's a real good reason , " says Giblets , " like self - defense or preemptive self - defense or defense from self - defense or revenge . "
" Oh well a course there 's self - defense , " says me .
" I mean just cause we wanna stop blowin up other countries does n't mean we gotta stop blowin up other countries when they blow up our country , or try to blow up our country , or maybe tried to blow up our country , or mighta been friends with somebody that coulda maybe tried to blow up our country . "
" But what if they have n't blown us up , and they have n't tried to blow us up , but they 've got all kinds of secret deadly weapons they could use to blow us up , like nukes or bombs or guns or anti-bomb guns or very large bees ? " says Giblets .
" Oh well then we haveta blow em up , " says me .
" I mean we can't just sit around waitin for the bees to come for us when we could be deploying our tactical anti-bee pre-defense defense . "
" And what if they have n't blown us up , and they have n't tried to blow us up , and they do n't have anything to blow us up with , but they are swiftly developing the potential capacity to eventually develop us - blowing - up technology ? " says Giblets .
" Well I guess you 'd haveta blow them up too , " says me .
" I mean why would they have bee - making programs in the first place if they were n't plannin to use bees to attack our anti-bee attackers ? "
" Which we 're gonna need to use to attack their bees , " says Giblets .
" So it 's all settled then , " says me .
" We 're never gonna blow up anyone else again , unless it 's self - defense , or it looks like self - defense , or it could maybe one day become self - defense , or it's in preemptive defense from their self - defense . "
" What if it 's a favor for a friend ? " says Giblets .
" Like what if there 's this country that can't blow us up , and does n't want to blow us up , and will never be able to blow us up , but one of our buddies kinda drops over on a Saturday night when we got nothin else to do anyway and they 're all ' Can you do me a solid and bomb Iran ' ? "
" Well there 's nothin wrong with bein friendly , " says me .
" I mean you gotta stick up for your friends . "
" And your friends ' friends , " says Giblets .
" And your friends ' friends ' friends .
And your friends ' friends ' sketchy neighbor who keeps his other neighbors locked up in his basement sex dungeon . "
" Well it 's not our fault if we just happen to have a lotta friends , " says me .
" I mean we can't help it if we 're popular . "
" That 's right , we 're very loved , " says Giblets .
" So loved that everybody hates us , which is why we have to blow them up . "
" It 's really very sad , " says me .
" But other than these very limited situations we should really stop blowin people up . "
" What if it 's for a good cause ? " says Giblets .
" Whattaya mean ? " says me .
" Well like what if there 's a genocide or an ethnic cleansing or a civil war or a flood or a malaria - starved orphan child on the tv that only we can save for the price of a cup of coffee and the only way to help them is by dropping thousands and thousands of bombs on their country ? " says Giblets .
" Oh wow , I never thought a that , " says me .
" No , you did n't , " says Giblets .
" It 's a good thing you have Giblets around to remind you of these weighty responsibilities . "
" Could we send them food and stuff instead ? " says me .
" No , we can 't , " says Giblets .
" All the food has been eaten .
Eaten by bees . "
" Oh man ! " says me .
" If only we 'd blown up the bee countries earlier !
How about medicine , could we send them some medicine ? "
" Can it be delivered by cruise missile ? " says Giblets .
" I do n't think we 've got the technology . " says me .
" We 'd probably better stick to bombing them then , " says Giblets .
" But only ' cause we care , " says me .
" I guess what we 're sayin is , we will never blow up this particular country , that we are standing in right now , in this particular way , ever again . "
" Unless there 's a real good reason , " says Giblets .

Would the Last Honest Reporter Please Turn On the Lights ?
An open letter to the local daily paper -- almost every local daily paper in America :
I remember reading All the President 's Men and thinking :
That 's journalism .
You do what it takes to get the truth and you lay it before the public , because the public has a right to know .
This housing crisis did n't come out of nowhere .
It was not a vague emanation of the evil Bush administration .
It was a direct result of the political decision , back in the late 1990s , to loosen the rules of lending so that home loans would be more accessible to poor people .
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were authorized to approve risky loans .
What is a risky loan ?
It 's a loan that the recipient is likely not to be able to repay .
The goal of this rule change was to help the poor -- which especially would help members of minority groups .
But how does it help these people to give them a loan that they can't repay ?
They get into a house , yes , but when they can't make the payments , they lose the house -- along with their credit rating .
They end up worse off than before .
This was completely foreseeable and in fact many people did foresee it .
One political party , in Congress and in the executive branch , tried repeatedly to tighten up the rules .
The other party blocked every such attempt and tried to loosen them .
Furthermore , Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were making political contributions to the very members of Congress who were allowing them to make irresponsible loans .
( Though why quasi - federal agencies were allowed to do so baffles me .
It 's as if the Pentagon were allowed to contribute to the political campaigns of Congressmen who support increasing their budget . )
Is n't there a story here ?
Does n't journalism require that you who produce our daily paper tell the truth about who brought us to a position where the only way to keep confidence in our economy was a $ 700 billion bailout ?
Are n't you supposed to follow the money and see which politicians were benefitting personally from the deregulation of mortgage lending ?
I have no doubt that if these facts had pointed to the Republican Party or to John McCain as the guilty parties , you would be treating it as a vast scandal .
" Housing - gate , " no doubt .
Or " Fannie - gate . "
Instead , it was Senator Christopher Dodd and Congressman Barney Frank , both Democrats , who denied that there were any problems , who refused Bush administration requests to set up a regulatory agency to watch over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and who were still pushing for these agencies to go even further in promoting subprime mortgage loans almost up to the minute they failed .
As Thomas Sowell points out in a TownHall.com essay entitled Do Facts Matter ?
" Alan Greenspan warned them four years ago .
So did the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to the President .
So did Bush 's Secretary of the Treasury . "
These are facts .
This financial crisis was completely preventable .
The party that blocked any attempt to prevent it was ... the Democratic Party .
The party that tried to prevent it was ... the Republican Party .
Yet when Nancy Pelosi accused the Bush administration and Republican deregulation of causing the crisis , you in the press did not hold her to account for her lie .
Instead , you criticized Republicans who took offense at this lie and refused to vote for the bailout !
What ?
It 's not the liar , but the victims of the lie who are to blame ?
Now let 's follow the money ... right to the presidential candidate who is the number - two recipient of campaign contributions from Fannie Mae .
And after Franklin Raines , the CEO of Fannie Mae who made $ 90 million while running it into the ground , was fired for his incompetence , one presidential candidate 's campaign actually consulted him for advice on housing .
If that presidential candidate had been John McCain , you would have called it a major scandal and we would be getting stories in your paper every day about how incompetent and corrupt he was .
But instead , that candidate was Barack Obama , and so you have buried this story , and when the McCain campaign dared to call Raines an " adviser " to the Obama campaign -- because that campaign had sought his advice -- you actually let Obama 's people get away with accusing McCain of lying , merely because Raines was n't listed as an official adviser to the Obama campaign .
You would never tolerate such weasely nit-picking from a Republican .
If you who produce our local daily paper actually had any principles , you would be pounding this story , because the prosperity of all Americans was put at risk by the foolish , short - sighted , politically selfish , and possibly corrupt actions of leading Democrats , including Obama .
If you who produce our local daily paper had any personal honor , you would find it unbearable to let the American people believe that somehow Republicans were to blame for this crisis .
There are precedents .
Even though President Bush and his administration never said that Iraq sponsored or was linked to 9/11 , you could not stand the fact that Americans had that misapprehension -- so you pounded us with the fact that there was no such link .
( Along the way , you created the false impression that Bush had lied to them and said that there was a connection . )
If you had any principles , then surely right now , when the American people are set to blame President Bush and John McCain for a crisis they tried to prevent , and are actually shifting to approve of Barack Obama because of a crisis he helped cause , you would be laboring at least as hard to correct that false impression .
Your job , as journalists , is to tell the truth .
That 's what you claim you do , when you accept people 's money to buy or subscribe to your paper .
But right now , you are consenting to or actively promoting a big fat lie -- that the housing crisis should somehow be blamed on Bush , McCain , and the Republicans .
You have trained the American people to blame everything bad -- even bad weather -- on Bush , and they are responding as you have taught them to .
If you had any personal honor , each reporter and editor would be insisting on telling the truth -- even if it hurts the election chances of your favorite candidate .
Because that 's what honorable people do .
Honest people tell the truth even when they do n't like the probable consequences .
That 's what honesty means .
That 's how trust is earned .
Barack Obama is just another politician , and not a very wise one .
He has revealed his ignorance and naivete time after time -- and you have swept it under the rug , treated it as nothing .
Meanwhile , you have participated in the borking of Sarah Palin , reporting savage attacks on her for the pregnancy of her unmarried daughter -- while you ignored the story of John Edwards 's own adultery for many months .
So I ask you now :
Do you have any standards at all ?
Do you even know what honesty means ?
Is getting people to vote for Barack Obama so important that you will throw away everything that journalism is supposed to stand for ?
You might want to remember the way the National Organization of Women threw away their integrity by supporting Bill Clinton despite his well - known pattern of sexual exploitation of powerless women .
Who listens to NOW anymore ?
We know they stand for nothing ; they have no principles .
That 's where you are right now .
It 's not too late .
You know that if the situation were reversed , and the truth would damage McCain and help Obama , you would be moving heaven and earth to get the true story out there .
If you want to redeem your honor , you will swallow hard and make a list of all the stories you would print if it were McCain who had been getting money from Fannie Mae , McCain whose campaign had consulted with its discredited former CEO , McCain who had voted against tightening its lending practices .
Then you will print them , even though every one of those true stories will point the finger of blame at the reckless Democratic Party , which put our nation 's prosperity at risk so they could feel good about helping the poor , and lay a fair share of the blame at Obama 's door .
You will also tell the truth about John McCain : that he tried , as a Senator , to do what it took to prevent this crisis .
You will tell the truth about President Bush : that his administration tried more than once to get Congress to regulate lending in a responsible way .
This was a Congress - caused crisis , beginning during the Clinton administration , with Democrats leading the way into the crisis and blocking every effort to get out of it in a timely fashion .
If you at our local daily newspaper continue to let Americans believe -- and vote as if -- President Bush and the Republicans caused the crisis , then you are joining in that lie .
If you do not tell the truth about the Democrats -- including Barack Obama -- and do so with the same energy you would use if the miscreants were Republicans -- then you are not journalists by any standard .
You 're just the public relations machine of the Democratic Party , and it 's time you were all fired and real journalists brought in , so that we can actually have a daily newspaper in our city .

A nationwide voter registration drive that has registered some 1.3 million voters this year is facing new allegations of local canvasser fraud and complaints about its practices .
As citizens registered to vote in record - breaking numbers across the country this week , local election officials raised concerns about thousands of suspicious voter registration cards collected by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , commonly known as ACORN .
The group , along with its partner Project Vote , operates one of the nation 's largest voter registration drives focusing mostly on low - income African - Americans and Latinos .
The most recent allegations emerged yesterday after Nevada authorities raided the group 's Las Vegas offices .
Authorities are investigating reports of fake or duplicate voter registrations submitted by ACORN , including some using the names of Dallas Cowboys football players .
Investigators have alleged that ACORN hired 59 inmates on work release as canvassers .
One inmate who had worked as a " team leader " for ACORN told investigators that " some of the canvassers hired by ACORN were ' lazy crackheads ' who were not interested in working and just wanted money , " according to the search warrant affidavit .
ACORN and Project Vote say they have been fully cooperating with investigators and called yesterday 's raid a " stunt " designed to discredit the groups ' work in registering more than 80,000 Nevadans .
Mike Slater , the executive director for Project Vote , says the group regularly reported concerns about potentially fraudulent applications to county election officials who ignored the information for months .
Since June , local election officials in at least nine other states have reported problems with thousands of registrations submitted by ACORN's this election year , according to media reports .
Earlier in the week , election officials in Lake County , IN reported that nearly half of the 2,040 registrations submitted by ACORN on county 's final day of registration were deemed " suspicious " because of missing or incorrect information or other irregularities .
Fake Voter Registration Cards
Sally LaSota , the director of the Lake County elections board , said information on some of the registration cards appeared to have been copied from the telephone book .
LaSota says her employees have also identified more than 100 cards with forged signatures .
" We do n't know if any of these people are legitimate , " said LaSota , who is concerned that many legitimate voters may be unable to vote due to the high volume of problematic registration dumped on their office at the very last minute .
On the campus of University of New Mexico , College Democrats sought to have ACORN kicked off campus after receiving " dismal " reports about the group practices according to the campus newspaper , Daily Lobo .
In Bernalillo County , which encompasses Albuquerque and UNM , election officials have reported 1,400 " problem cards , " many of which were collected by ACORN , to local and federal law enforcement authorities .
Maggie Toulouse
Oliver , the county clerk , said that some of the irregularities included cards with addresses that did not exist and duplicate registrations for voters with inaccurate information .
Charles Jackson , a spokesperson for ACORN , said the number of problematic registrations were " relatively low " considering that 1.3 million voter registrations collected by the group this year .
" You have these isolated incidents that people seem to amplify and make a bigger deal that it really is , " said Jackson .
ACORN has touted its success in collecting nearly 3 million voter registrations since 2004 , but the group 's track record has been marred with allegations of voter registration fraud and the criminal prosecutions of employees caught tampering and falsifying registration cards .
Last year , King County prosecutors in Washington state brought felony charges against seven ACORN canvassers in what one official described as the worst case of voter registration fraud in the state 's history .
Some OF the workers pled guilty and went to jail , while the ACORN agreed to pay the county $ 25,000 and have its activities monitored by authorities as a part of a settlement .
ACORN : New Quality Control
Jackson added that the group has a policy of firing any employee it finds tampering with registrations , and referring those former employees for criminal prosecution .
ACORN 's past problems and liberal leanings have made the group a frequent target of Republican attacks .
" It is clear that ACORN is engaging in an effort to try and take away from our election system by submitting thousands of forms that are unusable on county clerks place the burden on them , " said Republican National Committee spokesperson Danny Diaz in a conference call with reporters yesterday .
Diaz cited the recent incidents to accuse ACORN of perpetrating " systemic voter fraud . "
Jackson says there is no evidence of ACORN registrations being used to cast fraudulent votes .
" Our goal is to empower low - income people , " said Jackson .
" In no way , shape , or form do we want to tamper with the electoral process , we'd have nothing to gain from that . "

Editor 's note : Join Roland S. Martin for his weekly sound - off segment on CNN.com Live at 11:10 a.m. ET Wednesday .
If you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you .
A nationally syndicated columnist , Martin has said he will vote for Barack Obama in November .
He is the author of " Listening to the Spirit Within : 50 Perspectives on Faith " and " Speak , Brother !
A Black Man's View of America . "
Visit his Web site for more information .
Roland Martin says Howard Dean bucked other leaders and insisted on a 50 - state Democratic strategy .
( CNN ) -- If Sen. Barack Obama is able to prevail over Sen. John McCain on Tuesday , all of those Democrats who ripped Howard Dean 's 50 - state strategy over the last four years should call the head of the Democratic National Committee and offer a heartfelt apology .
First in line should be New York Sen. Charles Schumer , Chicago , Illinois , Rep. Rahm Emanuel and my CNN colleague , political strategist James Carville .
When Democrats were in the final stages of winning back Congress in 2006 , those three were at odds with Dean , saying he should forget about his pie - in - the - sky plan to have the Democratic Party competitive in all 50 states .
They reasoned that money spent on get - out - the vote efforts in non-congressional elections was futile , and all the effort should be on reclaiming Congress .
But Dean resisted their suggestions , weathering repeated calls for him to resign after that election .
Dean 's insistence on having a Democratic Party that existed in the heartland , and not just California , New York and Massachusetts , was brilliant in that it made clear that the party recognized the rest of America .
iReport.com : What would you ask Obama ?
The Democratic Party earned its liberal label because it ignored the moderate and conservative voices that paved the way for the Reagan revolution to win three consecutive elections .
Yet the decisive wins were n't just on the national level .
Texas is a prime example .
What used to be a blue dog Democratic state now has Republicans holding every statewide office .
But things are looking up .
In Dallas County , all of the county positions except for a handful were in the hands of the GOP , especially the judges .
That changed four years ago , and now the party could solidify itself this time around .
The same thing in Harris County .
The state 's most populous county saw Republicans take everything in sight .
This time around , Democrats are poised to take back Houston and surrounding cities .
Texas Democratic leaders used to cry the blues when an election was near , but after seeing the massive turnout during the primary , they have been able to build their voter database and cultivate a new generation of politicians to run for office .
Will the state go red ?
Sure .
But with a rock solid black vote , the ability to attract more Hispanic voters and a growing appeal to whites , Democrats may soon make Texas a competitive two - party state .
If Democrats are going to achieve success on the national level , they must have significant enthusiasm on the local level .
It 's hard to get your supporters ginned up for a national campaign if they see no infrastructure , especially local get - out - the - vote operations .
When Obama announced that he was implementing a 50 - state strategy , he was laughed at .
But here we are with six days left in the campaign and the Republicans are having to spend precious dollars on ads in Montana , North Carolina , Virginia , Missouri , Iowa , Colorado and Nevada , GOP locks in past elections .
Obama deserves a lot of the credit for this because his " change " campaign theme , along with the horrible leadership of Republicans nationwide , is helping his candidacy .
But changing the attitude among the nation 's Democrats was also vital , and that 's where Dean played a role .
The former governor of Vermont saw firsthand the sorry shape of the party when he ran for president in 2004 .
Republicans , led by Karl Rove , perfected their voter registration efforts , targeting voters down to the neighborhood , block and household .
They knew that to win they needed a well - oiled machine that was n't activated every four years ; it needed to be active all year round and in every election cycle .
So Dean put the people and resources behind substantial voter efforts in a number of states , and they went about rebuilding a crippled party that had no central voter registration effort , an outdated database of supporters , a fundraising arm that heavily relied on trial attorneys and Hollywood types , and a message that changed depending on the day .
In addition to seeing how Obama performs on Tuesday , we will also watch and see if Democrats are able to increase the number of governorships and legislatures they control .
That will be critical in 2010 , because that 's when the electoral map will be gerrymandered , redrawing the borders of congressional districts , and the party that rules the general assemblies , legislatures and governor 's mansions will write the rules to the game .
Old pols always said that all politics is local , and the only way for a revitalized Democratic Party to expand its reach nationally is by re-branding the party on the home front .
That takes time , money and leadership , and Howard Dean was willing to put his money where his mouth is .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin .

Californians have twice as much of flame - retardant chemicals in their blood and as much as 10 times more of them in their homes than elsewhere in the country , researchers say .
Older children and infants , who may be more susceptible to the harmful effects of the chemicals , can have several times as much as adults , the research team reported Wednesday in the journal Environmental Science & Technology .
The chemicals , known as polybrominated diphenyl ethers , or PBDEs , have been shown in animals to cause thyroid hormone disruption and to interfere with developing reproductive and nervous systems .
Widespread use of the chemicals began with the passage of a California law 30 years ago requiring furniture and bedding to withstand 12 seconds of contact with an open flame without igniting .
To meet the standard , foam and similar materials contain as much as 12 % PBDEs by weight .

U.S. furniture manufacturers stopped using one form of PBDE -- thought to be the most hazardous -- in 2004 , but it is still found in imported furniture .
A state law that would have banned a second form of PBDE did not pass in August .
The chemical is released from furniture in dust produced by abrasion and normal wear .
Children get larger doses because they come in contact with the fine dust on floors and frequently put their hands to their mouths .
“ The health effects are of particular concern for babies , children and pregnant women , ” said environmental epidemiologist Ami Zota of the Silent Spring Institute in Newton , Mass . , who led the study .
The research team , which also included scientists from UC Berkeley , Brown University in Rhode Island and Communities for a Better Environment , a California environmental activist group , collected samples from 49 homes in the San Francisco Bay Area cities of Richmond and Bolinas and 120 homes on Cape Cod and compared levels in those homes with published levels from Canada , Europe and several U.S. cities .

Levels in California homes were 10 times higher than those on Cape Cod , five times higher than those in Texas , six times higher than those in Washington , D.C. , four times higher than those in Boston and 200 times higher than those in Europe , where the chemicals are used sparingly .
The researchers also analyzed levels in blood collected by the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey .
They found levels were highest in California and the West , lower in the South , lower still in the Midwest and lowest of all in the Northeast .
Levels in children in California were three times those found in their mothers .

CHICAGO , Illinois ( CNN ) --
A former Chicago police commander was arrested Tuesday on charges related to accusations that he and officers under his command tortured and abused suspects in the 1980s , federal officials said .
Prosecutors allege Jon Burge lied and impeded court proceedings in November 2003 by giving false written answers to questions in a civil lawsuit alleging the torture and abuse of people in custody , said a news release from Patrick J. Fitzgerald , U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois .
Burge was charged with two counts of obstruction of justice and one count of perjury .
" There is no place for torture and abuse in a police station , " Fitzgerald said in the release .
" There is no place for perjury and false statements in federal lawsuits . "
More than 100 men -- all of them African - American -- have accused police under Burge 's command of abusing or torturing them .
Burge himself was found liable for torture in a civil suit in the early 1990s , but until now had never been charged with a crime .
Burge was with the Chicago police from 1970 to 1993 , the federal indictment handed up Thursday says .
He worked at Area Two police headquarters on the city 's South Side as an officer from 1972 to 1974 , a sergeant from 1977 to 1980 , and a lieutenant from 1981 to 1986 .
During that latter period , he was supervisor of detectives working in the Area Two violent crimes unit .
Later , he was commander of the bomb and arson unit and commander of Area Three detectives .
The Chicago Police Department suspended Burge in 1991 and fired him in 1993 , the indictment says .
The indictment alleges that during his time in Area Two , Burge at least once was present for , or participated in , the torture and physical abuse of suspects in police custody .
The indictment also alleges that during the time he supervised Area Two violent crimes detectives , he was aware that his detectives engaged in torture and physical abuse of suspects at least once .
Two men whose murder convictions were overturned after they spent years in prison said Burge or his officers tortured confessions out of them .
In 1973 , Anthony Holmes told police he'd killed a Chicago bar owner , but the confession came after Burge had put a bag over his head and shocked him several times with wires attached to his handcuffs , he told CNN .
" A few times , I thought I was dead , " Holmes said .
" After about the last time I thought I was dead , I said , ' Whatever you want to know , I 'm gonna tell it . ' "
Holmes served 34 years in prison before gaining his freedom .
In 1983 , Burge and his men stuck a shotgun in Darrell Cannon 's mouth and shocked him with a cattle prod to produce a confession , Cannon said .
Cannon served 23 years in prison before his conviction was thrown out in April .
" No person is above the law , and nobody -- even a suspected murderer -- is beneath its protection , " Fitzgerald 's statement said .
" The alleged criminal conduct by defendant Burge goes to the core principles of our criminal justice system . "
FBI agents arrested Burge , 60 , at his home in Apollo Beach , Florida .
He was expected to appear later Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Tampa .
He will appear at a later date in U.S. District Court in Chicago , where any trial would take place .
Authorities can't charge anyone with torture in the case because it happened too long ago , Fitzgerald said at a news conference in Chicago .
" The statute of limitations on any crimes that happened in the 1980s or 1993 , they 're gone , " he said .
CNN 's Randi Kaye contributed to this report .

For kids with an early curfew these codes were invaluable .
Once we tagged a house , our peers could use our marks to reap the best full - size chocolate bars while avoiding Chex mix and dried apricots .
Most marks were left in bright chalk at the bottom of the driveway .

" How pale is the art of sorcerers , witches , and conjurors when compared with that of the government 's Treasury Department ! "
~ Ludwig von Mises , The Theory of Money and Credit
With the Great Bailout of October 2008 the US and Europe are leading the world into a new era of political economy .
Its motto is : " Decree it and it will happen ! "
This magical slogan in the great tradition of " abracadabra " is the secret behind the idea that with a simple strike of the pen governments can and therefore should control just about everything from the economy to the climate , from energy to law , from people 's health to their consciousness and thoughts .
Since this modern political pseudoscience owes much to the great American magician Harry Houdini ( 1884–1926 ) , I suggest calling it " Houdiniomics . "
Houdini , who died on Halloween 82 years ago , chose his artist name in honor of his French colleague and predecessor Robert - Houdin and earned fame as a magician , escapologist and stunt performer .
Magic , the art of creating illusions of impossible or supernatural feats that defy the natural laws of physics as well as common logic has , of course , a longstanding tradition in all performing arts including politics .
Since the 19th century it also found its way into the social sciences under labels like " scientism , " " positivism " and " progressism , " claiming that human society can be shaped at will in order to achieve impossible feats as long as it is guided by the right ideological politics instead of proven laws and universal values .
In the wake of this doctrine the world has witnessed a good handful of astute politicians applying this new discipline with varying ideologies , all sailing under the banner of " progress " and consequently defying just about every law of economics , every traditional value of ethics , public moral and decency , breaking every written and unwritten rule and trampling on every human right imaginable .
The result was truly amazing : Within just half a century millions were killed on global battlefields , an equal amount was wiped out by starvation , other millions were incinerated indiscriminately with atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction or outright exterminated with industrial efficiency in gas chambers , torture dungeons and killing fields .
The total number of victims of this progressive 20th century is estimated at 200 Million !
One would assume that after such carnage as a result of progressive ideological politics , societies would ruefully return to ways more respectful of proven laws and universal values .
But not so .
Politics in the industrial democracies of the West , even after the bankruptcy of socialism , arguably the most progressive ideological camp , continues on the same road towards what politicians of all parties still consider progress .
Consequently we can see Houdiniomics at work today in just about every area of society .
It is not at all restricted to politicians , but has become the argumentational basis of many scientists , intellectuals , journalists , artists and philosophers .
Houdiniomics is not associated to one particular political color any more .
It has been adopted by progressives of the left as well as by conservatives of the right , as recent developments clearly demonstrate .
Houdiniomics has become the political science of politics in general .
In the age of classical liberalism , politics was not exempt from grounding arguments and actions in universally acknowledged axiomatic values .
These values , namely free will , self - ownership and property , equality and respect for life , truth and justice are absolute and , while not always practiced , were at least recognized norms in every society ( " civilized " or not ) since eternal times .
They are translated through customs , religions and traditions into natural laws and basic rules of conduct , outlawing , e.g. to injure , murder , steal , lie or cheat .
By doing so , they at least implicitly assign freedom of action and personal responsibility for this action to the individual .
They form an axiomatic ethical framework that enables every individual to generate his own ethical orientation .
They are the " Golden Rule " that says : " Do n't do to others what you do n't want them to do to you . "
If there is " progress " to be observed in history at all , it applies to the degree of individual freedom and the observation of these universal values .
A more general recognition of these values results in improved self - orientation of individuals and consequently in broader social cohesion , more stable institutions , more civilized conduct , deeper cooperation and increased wealth .
Empathy , respect , tolerance , and peace are qualities we tend to find in individuals and societies that explicitly uphold these first principles .
But since this type of progress is not a result of any " laws of history " but rather of specific cultural and social developments , ideas and discourses , it is always in danger of relapse and repeatedly did so .
The libertarian philosophy respects and conserves universal values as axiomatic first principles in the line of " natural laws " and explicitly recognizes and upholds the right of every individual to exercise these principles in full freedom and responsibility .
Voluntary cooperation and division of labor in free markets are seen as the basis of social cohesion .
Libertarians entrust the development and enforcement of rules and laws rather to institutions of the civil society than to the state as an organization of coercion and power .
The means have to incorporate the ends in this political philosophy , which consequently follows a non-interventionist , " orderly anarchistic " tendency .
Libertarians do not cling to the forms of traditions , customs or laws , but try to identify and conserve the universal principles they represent .
Universal values often get buried and suffocated under ritual and tradition , which then degenerate into mechanisms for maintaining an oppressive status quo that has long forgotten , perverted and abandoned its initial values .
Many classical liberals have turned conservatives today in confusing form with content , turning conservatism into a force of protecting repressive customs , discriminatory traditions and illegitimate privilege .
They see libertarian anarchism not as a source of sustainable order , but as a danger to the established powers .
To defend those , they do not hesitate to turn to the progressive political toolbox .
Progressive philosophy believes in the superior power of social design .
Since Plato's Republic , it assumes that societies cannot improve rapidly enough through voluntary human coordination and free discourse , but should be centrally shaped , improved and imposed following ideological doctrines independent of universal values .
In fact , if universal values stand in the way of the progressive design of the day , they should be discarded .
The progressive idea of progress is to positively define an ideal condition or society ( often justified by assumed " laws of history " ) where some selective - mostly egalitarian - values are to be concretized , and then to enforce this utopia through coercive re-distribution , control and oversight by a powerful state apparatus .
The ends justify the means in this philosophy , which has an inbuilt interventionist and statist tendency .
The progressive mind is continuously developing new concepts , projects and plans for a better world , a more just , more equal , more energy conserving , more friendly , more caring , more ecological , more vegetarian , more moral , more solidary or plainly more " conscious " society .
It claims to be " liberal " for proclaiming liberation from universal values .
But the progressive mind harbors a deeply ingrained illiberal distrust in the abilities of the individual to make the right decisions for and by him which at the same time benefit society through voluntary cooperation .
This negative anthropology towards the individual coupled with a strong belief in coercive collective solutions under the guidance of a self - proclaimed elite is a consistent strain among progressives of any brand and leads to their love affair with the state as the great provider , regulator , enforcer and decider .
The houdiniomic approach of progressism manifests itself in the belief that human culture and society can be shaped , designed and engineered independently of its underlying universal principles .
These principles are not considered absolute constituents of social cohesion , they are not upheld as the social " laws of gravity , " but are entirely plastic material in the hands of social engineers .
One of the first achievements of modern political Houdiniomics was the magic feat of the elimination of money as the world has known and understood it for thousands of year .
Money spontaneously emerged as a medium of exchange when people began to cooperate by dividing labor .
Money could originally be anything that people put enough trust in .
In small societies this trust could be based on the stability of social relations upheld through ancient customs in small , homogenous groups .
As cooperation and division of labor grew , involving more and more strangers with different customs and traditions , a common medium emerged that was held in equally high esteem by most societies : gold .
Money now was liberated from local customs because it was nearly universally valued on its own .
From then on , even today , gold remains the standard that all currencies eventually are measured by .
This had great impact on trade and commerce , but also limited the sovereignty of governments , who quickly took over the monopoly of issuing and controlling money .
Money represents and is tied to real goods and real savings of people .
As a medium of exchange it serves its function independently of its volume , size or mass .
Expanding it does not expand the total value of the money stock , but rather reduces the purchasing power of each unit .
This is why money backed 100 % by gold was essentially stable over very long periods of time .
In the system of " Fractional Reserve Banking " under the direction of a government - controlled central bank , money is whatever the government decides .
Money is no longer covered by gold , but can be created " out of thin air " by government fiat and decree .
In this houdiniomic financial system , money and credit are not part of a free market of necessarily responsible banks , lenders and borrowers , but are centrally planned by central banks .
As in every economic area , central planning of money not only lacks but actively prevents information about true supply and demand for money and credit which a free market provides in the form of price signals .
On the other hand , the price of credit ( interest rate ) set by the central bank still transmits a signal to the markets .
But since credit prices in central banking are not the result of market mechanisms , but are set politically , they inevitably give false signals to the markets : low interest rates suggesting a high savings rate encourage long term investments in capital goods .
But if these low interest rates were artificially decreed by the central bank without being backed by the respective savings , and if real savings are replaced by printing and pumping of fresh money , much of these investments will prove to be malinvestments , eventually forcing corrections by the market in the form of inflation , bankruptcies and recession .
The current financial system with its fiat money is a veritable example of applied Houdiniomics .
But in contrast to the magic theatre , where at the end of the show the curtain hides the mirrors and mechanisms before the lights go on , and audiences can end their suspension of disbelief in full comfort , life outside the theater lacks the equivalent of the curtain .
There are plenty of smoke and mirrors , but when the miracles fail , the illusions become obvious and the ancillary devices are embarrassingly exposed .
No science is complete without certain ancillary devices helping it along .
For Houdiniomics , the main ancillary device is Euphemistics , the science ( and art ) of giving unpleasant things a new , more pleasant name .
One will find Houdiniomics always closely associated with Euphemistics as both depend and build on each other .
The Great Bailout of 2008 is a good and recent example : its obvious purpose is to bail out privileged investors and failing banks and most of all , to rescue the politically convenient fractional - reserve banking system .
Such a plan is hardly popular among ordinary citizens , who eventually have to foot the bill by way of inflation , prolonged recession , higher taxes , less jobs and reduced income .
So it was officially renamed a " rescue plan " — not of the privileged investors , banks and the financial manipulation system as a whole , but of " the ordinary citizen " as politicians are busy to explain through the ever - obliging media .
Another recent example is " compliance markets , " usually describing the coercive artificial " trading " of industrial emission rights on pseudo - exchange markets .
The term " compliance market " is a typical contradictio in adjectum : markets by their very definition are institutions of voluntary exchange where buyers and sellers reach uncoerced agreements on the valuation of goods , and exchange them based on voluntary contracts .
Whenever force and coercion is introduced into a market , it seizes to be a true market and consequently its prices will not reflect the true valuations and the free will of the participants any longer .
The second ancillary device of Houdiniomics is Metaphorics , the art of using metaphors to first explain and then to prove a theory .
Metaphors are extremely helpful for applying knowledge about one area to a completely different one , when the abstract relational patterns of both are recognized to be similar .
In this case the metaphor serves as a qualitative model .
But while using a metaphor as an explanatory device can be very helpful , it can never be used to prove anything .
Scientists have a habit of setting up and then falling into this logical trap .
Metaphorics becomes especially misleading when we " reify " relations into things and qualities into quantities .
" Just , " e.g. , is a quality , an abstract value characterizing a relation like a voluntary exchange .
" Social Justice , " however , is treated as a quantitative " thing " that can be concretely measured and managed .
Value describes a preference that can mathematically only be expressed as an ordinal number ( 1. , 2. , 3 . … ) representing ranks of priorities in a specific situation .
Mathematics and computers , however , cannot calculate with qualities and ordinal numbers .
Only a quantity can be mathematically expressed as a cardinal number and integrated into a computer model .
The resulting simulations thus are principally unable to model or even predict individual action or social systems .
The metaphorical error of " artificial intelligence , " where the human brain was first used as a metaphor ( " electronic brain " ) for the computer , followed by the reversal of the metaphor , where the computer became the metaphor and then even a model for the brain , led to the reification of the human mind and consequently to the erroneous but widespread reliance on computer models .
Computers principally cannot model human creativity or the complexity of human action that emerges from it .
Intelligence is not about the quantitative number of calculations and decisions a human can make per second vs. a computer , but the quality of human ingenuity , creativity and intentionality .
A similar metaphoric fallacy is at the root of the current climate debate : to describe our warm planet , the metaphor of the greenhouse is used , although according to physics the warming mechanisms of the atmosphere have nothing at all in common with air in a greenhouse warmed by preventing air circulation and exchange .
The metaphor is plainly wrong in this context .
Yet a giant global system of indoctrination , intervention and taxation is being built on it , headed by politicians , scientists and activists , all under the magical spell of quantitative computer models .
In true houdinistic tradition , the laws of physics become irrelevant : we find scientists embracing a CO2 theory based on the physics of the perpetuum mobile , and engineers promoting the most inefficient energy conversion technologies ( like photovoltaic and wind energy ) as an imminent and efficient energy solution , although in the foreseeable future they can only be made " competitive " in markets by heavy direct government subsidies , government enforced regulations and price fixing .
But why is Houdiniomics so attractive and so persistent , in spite of consistent debunking and continuous failure to achieve its feats ?
Houdiniomics suggests that we can sustainably " liberate " ourselves from absolute constraints — whether physical , social , cultural or biological .
Through technology we could indeed overcome many limits and restrictions that seemed quite absolute to our ancestors .
It was therefore no accident that the industrial revolution was accompanied by philosophical and social movements that applied the engineering approach to the totality of human existence .
Social engineering was to leapfrog the long and tedious process of philosophical , economic and social enquiry and discourse .
The ancient idea of universal values was discarded as old - fashioned and obsolete .
The progressive idea has always been especially attractive to a few who consider themselves as intellectual vanguards of society and thus as destined leaders of others .
Through some magic they claim privileged access to reality and to superior information and thus feel uniquely qualified to evaluate and decide what is good for the rest of mankind and what is not .
Since they have absolutely no doubts about the correctness and general benefit of their ideas and judgments , they tend to condone and endorse coercion in realizing and enforcing their plans on others .
They are — at least in their own minds and in the minds of their followers — the great Houdinis of their day , shaping and reshaping society with their magic wand of governmental power and decree …
It seems that once again we are falling under the spell of a new generation of political Houdinis promising extraordinary feats through magic new deals .
Short of controlling gravity they declare to eradicate poverty by decree , manage the world 's climate , provide us with cheap renewable energy and a new compliance - market economy planned and coordinated by the wisdom of bureaucrats armed with infallible computer models …
Students and practitioners of Houdiniomics could learn from Harry Houdini to his very end : he died of a burst appendix after ignoring the symptoms and refusing professional treatment : a radical , yet minor operation .
Consequently , it took one punch to kill him .

The lunar rover Scarab designed by “ Red ” Whittaker and other people from Carnegie Mellon is being tested in Hawaii .
The test will take place at Mauna Kea , a dormant volcano , during the first two weeks of November and simulate a lunar mission .
The rover will be powered by radio isotopes and use about 100 watts of power .
This small amount of power will make it move slowly , only about 5 inches per second .
Scarab also contains a drill and will be able to take core samples and examine them .
The one meter core sample is pulverized and then heated to 900 degrees and the gases are examined .
This process takes up to 20 twenty hours .
See our previous post about Scarab here .

Continuing his series on insecure C , David Chisnall points out some problems arising from handling of integers and memory in C .

In part 1 of this series , we looked at some of the problems that C causes with novice programmers , related to error checking and variable initialization .
This week we 'll dig a bit deeper and see how C handles integer values — an unexpected cause of security holes — and look at how we can build some less error - prone memory management routines on top of C .
Integer Issues
If you 're used to high - level languages , C's support for numerical values may seem distressingly primitive .
The same might be true even if you come from assembly language , since C also does n't expose any of the condition codes found in a modern CPU to the programmer .
In a high - level language , numbers typically are arbitrary - precision , where the precision is defined by your need .
C has quite a selection of integer types .
The most common of these is int , which is expected to correspond to a machine word .
On the machines where I learned C , this was 16 bits .
Now it 's typically 32 bits , even on architectures where the machine word is 64 bits , since a lot of code has been written now assuming that it 's always 32 .
One of the most common causes of strange behavior is trying to store a pointer value in an int .
On common 32 - bit platforms , this strategy works fine .
On some 64 - bit platforms it works , but on others it does n't .
The C99 standard defines a new integer type , intptr_t , which is guaranteed to be big enough to store a pointer .
If you 're planning to store a pointer in an integer , you should always use intptr_t .
I say pointer , and this is one of the other slightly confusing corners .
C defines two kind of pointers , one that points to code and one that points to data .
A pointer to a function is n't guaranteed to be the same size as one that points to data .
On a lot of embedded platforms , it 's common to use 16 - bit pointers for code and 32 - bit pointers for data .
Casting a void* to a function pointer results in some data being discarded in this case .
The other core kinds of integer in C are char , short , and long .
C99 also introduced a long long .
None of these have fixed sizes , but they all have minimum sizes .
( Technically , they have minimum ranges of values they can store , and make no guarantees as to their internal layout . )
A short must be at least 16 bits , a long at least 32 , and a long long at least 64 .
If you need a minimum amount of precision , pick one of these , and you may get a bit more space than you requested , depending on the architecture .
I have n't mentioned chars yet because they differ subtly from the other types .
All of the other basic integer types are signed unless explicitly declared as unsigned .
This is n't always the case with char .
Sadly , it is n't never the case with chars , either — whether a char is signed or not depends entirely on the implementation .
If you 're using chars , always declare them as signed or unsigned explicitly ; if you do n't , you might be surprised later .
C has some quite surprising rules for implicit conversions between these types in operations .
It 's a common assumption that the precision of an operation will be specified by how you use it .
For example , suppose you do this :
a = b + c ;
Because you 're storing the result in a , you might assume that the calculation would be performed with whatever the type of a is .
In fact , it will be performed with the type of b or c .
This makes sense when you consider that the alternative is to have the value of ( b + c ) dependent on something other than b and c themselves .
You might assume that the type of this expression will be the type of b .
The C99 standard defines a number of rules for determining the type , but in general it will be whichever is the larger type , b or c — for example , if a is a char and b is an int , the type of the expression will be an int .
A fairly common bug comes from doing something like this :
long long a ; long b;// = something long c;// = something a = b * c ;
a is at least 64 bits , b and c at least 32 bits .
Since you can only guarantee that b and c are 32 bits , you should n't have put anything bigger than that in them , even if your compiler or platform has 64 - bit longs .
When you multiply them , you get a result that fits in a 64 - bit integer , and you store it in something that fits a 64 - bit integer .
Sounds sensible ?
It is , except for the fact that the result is truncated to 32 bits just before the assignment .
Here 's the correct way of doing this :
a = ( long long ) b * c ;
This sign - extends b to 64 bits ( or more , depending on the implementation ) .
The type promotion rules then kick in , ensuring that c has a type with as much space as b , so it 's also sign - extended .
The multiplication then occurs as a multiplication of a pair of long longs , with 32 or more leading zeros , and the result ( a long long ) is stored in a long long variable .
In general , you can avoid surprises by explicitly converting the types to something with enough precision for the operation first .
Make sure that the signedness matches on both .
This is a very common cause of errors , since you can accidentally lose the top bit when converting a big unsigned value to its signed equivalent .
A more subtle bug comes from the integer overflow .
This is especially common with malloc , where a common pattern is to write malloc ( i * sizeof ( x ) ) .
If an attacker has any influence over i , he can try to make this overflow .
For very large values of i , this will give a result much smaller than i , which is a problem .
The call to malloc will succeed , but when you attempt to use the resulting array , only the first few values will be valid .
An attacker could cause you to overwrite other data .
A simple way of avoiding this kind of hole is to use calloc ( ) instead of malloc ( ) .
( Of course , you hope that your system 's implementation of calloc will perform bounds - checking itself and not simply malloc ( ) and memset ( ) count * size bytes . )
realloc ( ) is more of a problem .
No standard way exists of doing this , so you need to do it yourself .
Fortunately , OpenSSH includes xrealloc ( ) , which is a bounds - checking version of realloc ( ) .
This includes a number of other checks , but if you do n't need all of them you can implement a simplified version :
void * xrealloc ( void * ptr , size_t nmemb , size_t size ) { void * new_ptr ; size_t new_size = nmemb * size ; if ( SIZE_T_MAX / nmemb < size ) return NULL ; return realloc ( ptr , new_size ) ; }
This test is quite simple .
SIZE_T_MAX is the largest value that a size_t can have .
When you divide by the number of elements requested , you get the maximum size that each element can be without an overflow .
If this size is smaller than the size requested , you have an overflow , and so you return NULL .
realloc returns NULL in case of an error , so you should always be checking that the return value from realloc is valid .
Unfortunately , this is a fairly common cause of memory leaks ( which , in turn , can become denial - of - service attacks ) .
If realloc ( ) returns NULL , the original pointer is still valid .
It 's common for developers to forget this principle and just do something like the following :
ptr = realloc ( ptr , newsize ) ;
When realloc ( ) return NULL , you 've lost your reference to the old memory location .
FreeBSD provides a convenience function , reallocf ( ) , which is the equivalent of this :
void * reallocf ( void* ptr , size_t size ) { void * newptr = realloc ( ptr , size ) ; if ( NULL == newptr ) { free ( ptr ) ; } return newptr ; }
If you do n't have any alternative code paths for recovering when realloc fails , you would be advised to do something of this sort .
WHEN Wendy Postle ’s two children were younger , saying “ yes ” gave her great joy .
Yes to all those toys .
The music lessons .
The blowout birthday parties .
But as her son and daughter approached adolescence , yes turned into a weary default .
“ Sometimes it was just easier to say , ‘ O.K. , whatever , ’ than to have the battle of ‘ no , ’ ” said Mrs. Postle , a working mother who lives in Hilliard , Ohio , a middle - class suburb of Columbus .
This year her husband ’s 401 ( k ) savings are evaporating .
Medical bills are nipping at the couple ’s heels .
Gas prices are still taking a toll .
Mrs. Postle recently decided that although she and her husband had always sacrificed their own luxuries for Zach , 13 , and Kaitlyn , 15 , the teenagers would now have to cut back as well .
“ No ” could no longer be the starting gun of family fights .
It would have to be an absolute .
“ I tried to tell Kaitlyn , ‘ We ’ll get the Hollister jeans at a thrift store , ’ ” Mrs. Postle recalled .
“ She got angry and said : ‘ That ’s gross !
Other people wore them ! ’ ”

We had a hectic finishing of the sampling program yesterday and this past night .
An extensive area of intense methane release was found .
At earlier sites we had found elevated levels of dissolved methane .
Yesterday , for the first time , we documented a field where the release was so intense that the methane did not have time to dissolve into the seawater but was rising as methane bubbles to the sea surface .

Those children are now young adults scattered around the globe .
Nickerson is tracking them down and interviewing them about the experience .
“ Their stories have not changed at all , ” he says .
“ Not what you would expect if they had made it all up . ”
So what exactly happened on that day in 1994 at the school in Ruwa just east of Harare ?
“ It was morning break and they were out in the school yard playing , ” says Nickerson .
“ They saw one main silver craft that had four others around it , ” says Nickerson .
“ It came down on a hill beyond the school yard that was out of bounds .
The boundary was the edge of the school yard , then it was bush and the hill .
“ They ran to the edge of the school yard to see what this thing was .
They saw this small creature walk around on top of the craft while another came down to check out the children .
He was all in black , with a very tight suit .
The children said he had big eyes ‘ like rugby balls ’ .
“ The children had direct eye contact with this creature .
There seems to have been some kind of communication with the children about the state of the world — what we are doing to the planet , the destruction we are causing , although not all the children got this message .
Some of the children were traumatized , others were excited .
The young children were the most traumatized as they were at the front of the group .
American film maker Randall Nickerson is currently visiting southern Africa to make a documentary that follows up an incident that happened at the Ariel School in Ruwa , Zimbabwe , in 1994 , when 62 children aged between eight and 12 reported seeing a UFO and “ strange beings ” during their morning break .

Perhaps the truest and most essential thing Michael Moore ever said , he said at the Oscars .

European astrologers at the turn of the 16th century forecast devastating floods for the year 1524 .
One result , as the date approached , was a " Great Fear , " as recorded by Venetian chronicler Marin Sanudo .
Another , for Venice , was a tremendous investment in public works in order to prevent the silting up of the city 's lagoon .
( Sadly , the careful consideration of Renaissance engineers of the city 's effect upon its environment had been forgotten by the mid-20th Century , when channel dredging and groundwater extraction saw Venice rapidly sink 20 centimeters in 20 years . )
And a further effect was an increased popularity of satirical doom singers .
One Venetiangoing by the name of " Master Pegasus Neptune " predicted " conjunctions of cheese and lasagna , " and comically prophesied that " In those days cats and dogs will be enemies , swords will cut better than radishes , fields and mountains will be out in the open , and the taverns will be well frequented . "
We might add , that in these days , the stock market will crash , and the stock market will rally .
That 's not the end .
Hell , that 's not even the world .
Perhaps this is more like it ?
From a dispatch last week by Dr. Oerjan Gustafsson of Stockholm University , aboard the Russian research ship Jacob Smirnitskyi in the Arctic Ocean : Days later , the British research ship the James Clark Ross reported counting " about 250 methane plumes bubbling from the seabed in an area of about 30 square miles in water less than 400 metres ( 1,300 feet ) deep off the west coast of Svalbard . "
Deeper plumes at three times the depth were found near by .
If the thawing permafrost and warming oceans lose the integrity of their methane sinks , if the billowing chimneys of Arctic methane represent their tipping point , then the climate is soon to run away from a tolerable mean .
A feedback loop even more catastrophic than Reaganomics will have been initiated .

Zimbabwe - doeslook like the end of the world ?
Another world at least , where children are eating toxic , indigestible roots to stave off hunger , though malnutrition will kill them if relief is n't sent " very fast . "
What percentage of Wall Street 's " rescue " would it take to rescue ?
What percentage of Henry Paulson 's personal wealth of $ 700 million ?
It 's crazy that it seems crazy to ask .
But that 's Zimbabwe , and Mugabe 's small time grifters are n't hooked up with the global syndicate .
There 's no need to know , and since so much of news is supposed to be , they lose .

Harvard 's John Mack soon followed , and interviewed dozens of witnesses with whom Nickerson is now following up .
One is Isabelle I do n't know what happened at Ruwa , but something real , did , which means it has more authenticity than John McCain 's David Blainesque " suspension " of his campaign , upside down , above the head of David Letterman , and more weight than the Treasury Department 's rationale for the figure of $ 700 billion .
( " It 's not based on any particular data point , " a Treasury spokeswoman told Forbes.com Tuesday .
" We just wanted to choose a really large number . " )
If we can't explain it or understand it , maybe we should fight the impulse to ignore it .
As well as real , it could be important .

This month marks the 30th anniversary of Australian pilot Frederich Valentich 's disappearance , whose last words before his microphone captured an unidentified sound of grinding metal was " That strange aircraft is hovering on top of me again .
It is hovering and it's not an aircraft .
" Driving home in a company van the evening of March 17 , 1978 , Englishman Ken Edwards saw a strange figure on top of an embankment .
As Peter Hough tells it in , The being was tall and broad , with a head like a goldfish bowl , and its arms appeared to sprout from the top of its shoulders .
It descended the steep hill at an impossible right angle to the ground , and before walking across the road anda chain link fence as if it was n't there , turned to face the van and shot narrow beams of light from its eyes into the cab .
A power surge burned out all of its major components , Edwards ' watch stopped , and he showed Hough marks on his hands that had been clutching the steering wheel which resembled sunburns .
He soon began complaining of stomach pains , and was found to be riddled with cancer , and died at 42 .
Maybe he would have anyway , if he and something unknowable had n't crossed paths , but like Barbara , his widow , told Hough , " A thing that can burn skin , stop watches and destroy an expensive radio might well be capable of bringing harm to a human being .
" Last July 20 , Vince Weiguang Li delivered an Edmonton newspaper that carried a lengthy feature on the Windigo , " a terrifying creature in native mythology that has a ravenous appetite for human flesh .

" I just do n't know what to think of it , quite frankly , " says the piece 's author , and Windigo expert , Nathan Carlson .
He 'd documented numerous cases of people believing they were " turning Windigo " who would beg to be killed " before they started eating people . "
At Li's first courthouse appearance , the only words he spoke were a soft , " Please kill me .
" On McLean 's myspace page , under , he posted " an alien , the wolfman , frankensteins monster , a vampire ....
" The Tuesday after the market dropped 777 points , the front page of a Toronto newspaper headline told me there 's a " monster lot of fear out there . "
SALT LAKE CITY 
The best deal on fuel in the country right now might be here in Utah , where people are waiting in lines to pay the equivalent of 87 cents a gallon .
Demand is so strong at rush hour that fuel runs low , and some days people can pump only half a tank .
It is not gasoline they are buying for their cars , but natural gas .
By an odd confluence of public policy and private initiative , Utah has become the first state in the country to experience broad consumer interest in the idea of running cars on clean natural gas .
Residents of the state are hunting the Internet and traveling the country to pick up used natural gas cars at auctions .
They are spending thousands of dollars to transform their trucks and sport utility vehicles to run on compressed gas .
Some fueling stations that sell it to the public are so busy they frequently run low on pressure , forcing drivers to return before dawn when demand is down .
It all began when unleaded gasoline rose above $ 3.25 a gallon last year , and has spiraled into a frenzy in the last few months .
" We 're certainly going for the clay look with this , " Dan Connors , the company 's CEO , told The Associated Press .
" Clay presents a challenge if you really get into the detail of it .

Listen to the victim , abused by the system
The basis is racist , you know that we must face this
In 1991 Pop Will Eat Itself produced one of the most damning comments on racism in society in the history of popular music .
“ Ich Bin Ein Auslander ” was specifically aimed at anti-immigrant racism in Europe , but over the past 17 years it ’s been impossible for me to hear the song without mapping its penetrating , undeniable truth onto our American context .
Our black auslanders are n’t recent arrivals ( although many of our brown ones are ) , but they nonetheless remain social , political , economic and cultural outsiders , and whatever progress they may have made in the several hundred years since they first arrived in shackles , only a fool can believe that the basis is no longer racist .
I said some time back , as the presidential election lurched into overdrive , that the heavy racist stuff was coming .
Not that it necessarily took Nostradamus to predict that , of course – as staggering prognostications go this one ranked right up there with “ the sun will rise in the East . ”
Still , the predictability and magnitude of racism in America , the absolute certainty of it , matters .
Welcome to a state where the politics of hate

UPDATE September 12 , 2012 : The New York Times reports today that the IRS will pay whistle blower Bradley Birkenfeld $ 104 million for his assistance in helping the agency pursue UBS and divulge the secrets of the Swiss banking system .
According to the Times , “ In addition to paying $ 780 million in 2009 to avoid criminal prosecution , [ UBS ] turned over account information regarding more than 4,500 American clients . ”
This led to thousands of wealthy Americans taking advantage of a tax - amnesty program offered by the government , recovering some $ 5 billion in unpaid tax revenues .
The investment firm where former McCain adviser and ex-Sen .
Phil Gramm serves as a vice chairman is taking heat for helping affluent Americans cheat the US Treasury out of some $ 2 billion — but the world might never have known had Bradley Birkenfeld not sung like a canary .
The Boston - bred Birkenfeld was a banker for UBS , a Swiss financial behemoth with major US operations .
His specialty : devising tax shelters in the form of offshore shell companies and peddling them to the superrich .
According to court documents , 85 to 90 bankers in UBS ’s wealth - management divisions drummed up business at high - roller events like the America ’s Cup yacht race and Miami ’s prestigious Art Basel exhibition ; Birkenfeld took pains to keep his customers happy , going so far for one client as to purchase diamonds overseas and smuggle them into the US in a toothpaste tube to avoid taxes and duties .
It was one of Birkenfeld ’s biggest clients who would prove his undoing — Igor Olenicoff , a Forbes 400 billionaire and major developer in Florida , Illinois , Nevada , and the Southwest .
Olenicoff ’s fortunes took a dive in 1994 , when the Internal Revenue Service , in the course of monitoring fund transfers , noticed large sums moving from Olenicoff ’s accounts to countries with a reputation as tax havens .
The suspicious IRS agents eventually called in the Justice Department ; Olenicoff , they discovered , had stashed some $ 200 million in unreported assets in UBS accounts offshore .
In 2007 , Olenicoff agreed to pay $ 52 million in back taxes , interest , and penalties for tax evasion , and for lying about his accounts .
Once the feds had Olenicoff , it was a short jump to Birkenfeld , who left UBS in 2006 and began to cooperate .
He admitted to the agents that he and fellow UBS bankers had helped Olenicoff and other wealthy clients hide their assets via fictitious firms in Switzerland , Liechtenstein , Panama , and the British Virgin Islands .
Birkenfeld and a Liechtenstein banker — now a fugitive — also advised Olenicoff to destroy banking records and use only Swiss credit cards to throw Uncle Sam off the trail .
In June , Birkenfeld arrived in a Fort Lauderdale courtroom in his gray pin-striped suit , looking forlorn as he pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and facilitating tax fraud .
( He faces up to five years in jail and $ 250,000 in fines , but legal experts expect his sentencing will be put off as long as he continues to cooperate­ . )
Birkenfeld ’s takedown was a milestone for the Justice Department — its first conviction of a foreign - based banker for conspiring to defraud the IRS .
But his crimes were no anomaly .
More than a decade of lax law enforcement has allowed tax havens to flourish in the open , even as the Bush administration has cut taxes for the wealthy here at home .
“ There ’s been a huge growth in the offshore game , ” says Jack Blum , a DC lawyer who worked on money laundering and tax fraud as a congressional investigator during the early 1990s .
“ Foreign institutions are doing a lot of selling . ”
A new Government Accountability Office report notes that Ugland House , a five - story office building on a tree - lined street in the Caymans , has witnessed a jump in its foreign corporate entities from roughly 12,000 in 2004 to nearly 19,000 this year ; around 900 are American companies .
Strapped for resources , the IRS has adopted a strategy of selective prosecution : Nail a few big fish , and hope the others will get the message .
The agency plans to add 10 new audit teams to combat offshore abuses , Blum says .
But some legislators , like Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) , say much more remains to be done .
As chair of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , Levin has been looking into ubs as well as lGT , a Liechtenstein bank owned by that principality ’s royal family .
“ The IRS does n’t have the money , the time , or the legal tools it needs to stop offshore abuses , ” he told me via email .
Meanwhile , the Birkenfeld conviction has rocked the lucrative world of tax - haven promotion .
The banker told Levin ’s committee that ubs had even trained him in illegal procedures , and outfitted his laptop with encryption software to make its contents inscrutable to US agents .
UBS does n’t deny that its American clients keep some $ 18 billion in 19,000 undeclared Swiss accounts — investments that earned ubs about $ 200 million per year , Birkenfeld told prosecutors .
Called before Congress in July , a senior UBS exec was contrite , stating that the bank would shut down its offshore services to US clients and “ take responsibility ” for what he called compliance failures .
“ On behalf of ubs , I am apologizing .
I am committing to you that we will take the actions necessary to see that this does not happen again . ”
As of mid-September , UBS was working to comply with a federal “ John Doe ” summons seeking the names behind those 19,000 accounts .
If the funds in question are indeed taxable assets , UBS ’s clients may have cost the federal government $ 2.1 billion or more over seven years .
All told , Levin estimates , offshore tax shelters deprive the Treasury of a staggering $ 100 billion a year .
With the economy in a slump and America ’s coffers drained by war spending , some congressional Democrats have been talking tough about tax cheats .
Levin introduced a bill last year , cosponsored by senators Barack Obama and Norm Coleman , that would strengthen penalties , give the Treasury Department power to pursue foreign firms , and label 34 countries or territories “ offshore secrecy jurisdictions . ”
But so far it has languished in committee .
The probe of UBS is faring better , though .
Federal prosecutors expect it will yield more indictments in the coming months .
“ There was a failure to appropriately assess the regulatory and reputational risks , ” says one source close to the probe .
“ It seems to be a pattern similar to Enron . ”
The big mess that is Spore 's DRM controversy continues as Electronic Arts has " responded " to concerns over its use of SecuROM in Will Wright 's opus .
EA corporate communications rep Mariam Sughayer claims that the uproar over limited installations is unjustified because 77 % of customers have only installed the game once , leaving 23 % that have needed to install it multiple times .
" EA has not changed our basic DRM copy protection system , " explained Sughayer .
" We simply changed the copy protection method from using the physical media , which requires authentication every time you play the game by requiring a disc in the drive , to one which uses a one - time online authentication .
" You can install the game on three computers - at your office , at home or for your family .
What you can't do is make and distribute a thousand copies online . "
No word at all , however , on the accusations that Spore 's DRM chews up RAM like it was free candy .
EA also neglected to address the fact that Spore myopically allows only one account to be created per copy purchased .
As the title looks headed to be one of the most pirated games of all time , I doubt this will appease anyone .
Still , it 's somewhat amusing that EA has stated " you ca n't make and distribute a thousand copies " with Spore 's DRM ... is n't that what everybody 's doing right now ?
Investigation ties Palin to ' extreme right - wing fringe ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday October 10 , 2008
Print This Email This The McCain campaign has attempted to make an issue out of Barack Obama 's limited connections with former Weather Underground member William Ayers .
However , according to a new investigative report , vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin herself has had a far close and more extensive association with Alaska 's own political extremists than she has ever acknowledged .
The story at Salon.com by Max Blumenthal and David Neiwart offers an in - depth examination of the crucial role played in Palin 's political career by two members of the secessionist Alaska Independence Party ( AIP ) .
When Blumenthal appeared on Thursday 's Rachel Maddow Show , he began by explaining that AIP -- which has links to both neo-Confederate parties in the South and the theocratic Constitutional Party -- serves as " a haven for anti-government extremists , anti-government militia members , and conspiratorial figures who believe that the United States government plans to implement a New World Order . "
AIP advocates secession from the United States , and its founder , Joe Vogler , is known for having proclaiming " I 'm an Alaskan , not an American .
I 've got no use for America or her damned institutions . "
The extent of Palin 's connection to AIP has previously been uncertain .
Her husband Todd was a member of the party until 2002 , but although Palin attended some conventions and sent them a message earlier this year saying , " Keep up the good work , " she herself never belonged to the group .
The Atlantic 's Marc Ambinder suggested a week ago that Todd Palin 's membership in AIP should not be an issue , writing that " Maybe Todd Palin did n't believe in all of the principles the AIP espoused ... indeed , the AIP seems to be a bit of a cultural relic in Alaska , a quirky old friend .
...
That [ Sarah ] did n't dump him because he associated with some dum - dum secessionists is probably a sign of good judgment . "
However , Blumenthal told Maddow that when he and co-author David Neiwert , who has been investigating anti-government militias since the 1990's , interviewed people in Palin 's home town of Wasilla , they found that " Sarah Palin is far more intimately associated with the extreme right - wing fringe of Alaska than the media has acknowledged or than she is willing to acknowledge . "
Blumenthal said that Palin used former AIP chairman Mark Chryson and a local John Birch Society activist known as " Black Helicopter " Steve Stoll " to advance her political career on a local and state level -- and she sought to reward them with plum political appointments . "
In 1996 , Chryson and Stoll helped Palin with her campaign of negative , character - based attacks on the incumbent mayor , and after Palin was elected she attempted to appoint Stoll to the seat she had formerly held on the Wasilla city council .
That appointment was blocked by another council member , who considered Stoll a " violent influence , " but Palin continued to work with Chryson and Stoll on various initiatives .
Chryson now says , " Every time I showed up her door was open .
And that policy continued when she became governor . "

A man eats lunch in a file photo .
REUTERS / Will Burgess
LONDON ( Reuters ) - People who eat quickly until full are three times more likely to be overweight , a problem exacerbated by the availability of fast food and the decline of orderly dining habits , Japanese researchers said on Wednesday .
The findings , published in the British Medical Journal , highlight how eating styles , and not just what or how much is eaten , can contribute to an obesity epidemic fueled by the spread of Western - style affluence in many parts of the world .
The World Health Organization classifies around 400 million people as obese , 20 million of them under the age of five .
The condition raises the risk of diseases like type 2 diabetes and heart problems .
For their study , Hiroyasu Iso and colleagues at Osaka University asked more 3,000 Japanese volunteers aged 30 to 69 about their eating .
About half of the men and a little more than half of the women said they ate until full .
About 45 percent of the men and 36 percent of the women said they ate quickly .
Those who said they ate until full and ate quickly were three times more likely to be fat than people in the “ not eating until full and not eating quickly ” group , the researchers found .
They cited as causes both the availability of cheap food in big portions and habits like watching television while eating .
To counteract the “ supra- additive effect ” of speedy or glut eating among children prone to obesity , parents should encourage them to eat slowly and in calm surroundings , the study found .
With today ’s time poor society , many of us struggle to find the time and the energy to exercise .
Sure we know we should and we know it ’s good for us but between work and family responsibilities , it may seem almost an impossible task to start and maintain a healthy exercise routine .
The best exercise for you is quite simply one you ’ll do regularly .
The purpose of the following tips is to help those looking for a way to make a start .
If you ’re looking to break out of an unhealthy sedentary lifestyle , you ’ve come to the right place .
Go for a walk during your lunch break
Instead of surfing the Internet during your lunch break , get out off the office for a brisk walk .
Doing so will be great for clearing your head and relieving some stress .
If there is a park nearby , enjoy a brisk walk and take your lunch with you .
I say brisk not rushed .
Rushing only drains your energy levels because we expend a lot of nervous energy .
The best time to eat is after exercise .
This is because the body more readily assimilates the protein , fat and carbohydrates you consume .
After eating take a slower walk back to the office .
This will help you better digest the meal you just ate .
Take the stairs at work
On your way out for lunch , do n’t use the elevator .
Take the stairs instead .
Same again when you get back from your lunchtime walk .
Even if your office is on level 50 try taking the elevator most of the way down and finish off the last couple of stories via the stairs .
Whatever you do , start out small and gradually work your way up .
Walking stairs are a fantastic exercise that will hit different muscles depending on whether you ’re going down or coming up .
Best of all you were going out for lunch anyway , right ?
When you go shopping park your car up the back
Have you ever noticed someone circling the carpark for an hour looking for a parking spot right near the shop entrance ?
Often , such people are in the most in need of exercise .
Around and round they go .
All the while getting more frustrated and worked up .
By the time they actually get to park , they ’ve wasted more nervous energy then it would have cost them to enjoy a healthy walk from the first available spot .
If you ’ve been guilty of this , then stop trying to score a parking spot near the entrance .
Drive directly to the part of the parking lot that is empty and enjoy the exercise .
Play with your children
Healthy children are bundles of endless energy .
The next time you go to tell your children to go outside and play so you can relax and watch TV , do n’t .
Take your own advice and join your children in playing outside .
Not only will you get much needed exercise you ’ll also enjoy spending quality time with your children .
They will never be the same age as they are today so do n’t let the opportunity pass you by only to regret it when your children are grown .
The best thing is it wo n’t even feel like exercise !
Grow your own vegetables
This is another fantastic thing to do that will pay off in multiple ways .
Gardening is a very healthy activity , even more so if you ’re growing your own fresh herbs and vegetables .
Gardening will get you outside and into the sunshine , reconnect you with nature and the earth , and is a fantastic activity to share with your children .
This simple activity could have a very positive impact upon the future health of your children as they grow up and begin making their own food choices .
Consider also that the vegetables you grow for yourself will not need to be harvested by large machinery and then shipped thousands of miles to a location where they may be kept in cold storage for weeks , even months .
All such activities produce greenhouse gasses and contribute to global warming .
Get a dog
I left this tip to last and I ’m not sure if I should have included it .
The reason being I do n’t want anyone to go out and purchase a dog only to never actually play with it or take it for walks .
So if you do n’t think you ’re quite ready for the extra responsibility of caring for another being that is dependent on you , try my previous tips first .
Otherwise buying a dog may just be one of the best things you ever did .
The type of dog you decide on should be appropriately sized for your living arrangements but big enough that it will be a lot of fun to play with and take for walks .
Again this is something that I think will enrich your life .
Time spent playing and walking your dog should n’t even feel like exercise .
What do you do today to sneak in a bit of exercise into your daily routine ?
Let us know in the comments , I am sure it will help others .

Exceptions include drinking at a block party or “ similar function for which a permit has been obtained ” as well as premises licensed for the sale and consumption of alcohol .
The punishment for violations is a fine of no more than $ 25 or imprisonment of up to five days , or both .
Paul J. Browne , the Police Department ’s chief spokesman , said in statement about Mr. VanRy ’s summons : “ The officer observed a violation .
The subject has a right to dispute it . ”
Mr. VanRy will contest the summons at a court appearance in November by pleading not guilty .
He questioned the notion that his stoop is considered a “ public place ” as defined by the law .
Besides , he pointed out , Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was photographed by The New York Post in May sipping a glass of wine at Brooklyn Bridge Park .
“ It ’s one of those laws that a lot of people know it ’s there , but how heavily it should be enforced is a question , ” Mr. VanRy said .
Steve Wasserman , a lawyer with the criminal practice of the Legal Aid Society , questioned the wording of the law , adding that legal arguments could be made that a stoop is not a place that a “ substantial group of persons ” can gain access to .
“ This is an open question , ” he said of the law .
“ There ’s also a larger constitutional question , if a piece of your private property were being treated as if it were a public place .
You could n’t get arrested for drinking that beer in your kitchen .
Now you ’re sitting on your stoop .
The stoop may be more like your kitchen than your sidewalk . ”
Richard Briffault , a professor at Columbia University Law School and an expert in property and local government law , said Mr. VanRy ’s summons illustrated the thin line between private and public property .
“ It ’s quite possible to be on private property and in public at the same time , ” he said .
Report : Satellite images show ethnic cleansing source of reduced Iraq violence RAW STORY
Published : Friday September 19 , 2008

This A study of the Pentagon 's satellite imagery concludes that ethnic cleansing -- not last year 's surge of U.S. military forces -- is the main factor in the reduction of violence in Iraq .
The report 's conclusion about the surge 's ineffectiveness are supported by many Iraq experts and international organizations who credit a population shift with the decline of sectarian violence , especially in Baghdad , Reuters reported .
Conducted by the University of California , the study analyzed the use of nighttime light across Baghdad and how it changed before , during and after the surge .
It 's findings show only some neighborhoods have higher levels of output , suggesting the others had been ethnically cleansed before the surge .
" By the launch of the surge , many of the targets of conflict had either been killed or fled the country , and they turned off the lights when they left , " geography professor John Agnew of the University of California Los Angeles , who led the study , said in a statement .
" Essentially , our interpretation is that violence has declined in Baghdad because of intercommunal violence that reached a climax as the surge was beginning , " said Agnew , who studies ethnic conflict .
In other words , ethnic violence did the job before American soldiers got the chance .
Sectarian violence between Baghdad 's neighborhoods has been documented by an independent commission that correlates with much of the report 's findings .
But FP Passport , a foreign policy blog , offered several caveats to its conclusion .
For example , the blog asks why there were also security improvements outside the capital in places such as Anbar province ?
Republican presidential nominee John McCain has long criticized his opponent Sen. Barack Obama for not having backed the surge , which McCain boasts as the single factor in the reduction of violence .
CNN Security Analyst Peter Bergen disagrees .
" ... [ B]oth the Democrats and the Republicans have been overemphasizing the surge .
If it was just about the surge , the violence would be back up again because the surge is over . "
In a speech last July , McCain said , " It is precisely the success of the surge in Iraq that shows us the way to succeed in Afghanistan , " but one country has very little to do with the other , Slate.com reported .
A recent military analysis posits that a surge of troops in Afghanistan , where rising violence has drawn the attention of U.S. forces , will not succeed .
The article contends U.S. military leaders do not adequately understand the country 's situation .
Which is exactly what the study of ethnic cleansing suggested about commanders in Iraq .
The first sentence of the University of California 's summary , written by co-author Thomas Gillespie , says this :
" Geographers and social scientists find it increasingly difficult to intervene in debates about vital matters of public interest , such as the Iraq war , because of the ideological polarization and lack of respect for empirical analysis that have afflicted US politics in recent years . "

TAMARAC , Florida ( CNN ) -- " Schlep . "
A senior discusses Sen. Barack Obama with organizers of the Great Schelp in Tamarac , Florida , on Sunday .
A Yiddish word meaning to pull , yank or tug , schlep is a good way of describing what it took for Mike Bender to persuade his grandparents to vote for Sen. Barack Obama for president .
Bender 's grandparents , Kenny and Selma Furst , 90 and 87 years old , should have been an easy sell to support the Democratic nominee for president .
Like many of the estimated 650,000 Jews living in Florida , the Fursts are lifelong , passionate Democrats and a crucial vote for any Democratic candidate hoping to win the battleground state .
But when Bender -- who is not affiliated with Obama 's campaign but supports him -- brought up the idea of voting for Obama over Thanksgiving dinner last year , he was met with an uncharacteristic silence .
" Their reaction was , as they said , ' I 'm a little meschugah , ' " Bender said , adding that the expression meant " crazy . "
For Selma Furst , voting for an African - American for president seemed unthinkable .
Watch a " few little known Jewish facts " on Obama »
" I grew up with Jewish people and Italian people , but I never lived in a neighborhood that was black , " she said .
" Somebody said to me , ' What do you object to about him ? '
I said , well , truthfully , our colors are different . "
Overcoming the prejudices of his grandparents ' generation would be difficult , Bender realized .
But he was not going to be alone .
Ari Wallach , co-executive director of Jews Vote , a Jewish advocacy group , also said he saw reluctance among some older , traditionally Democratic Jews to support Obama .

But Wallach said it was n't just a question of race .
He cited a months - long misleading Internet campaign that aimed to convince voters that Obama is a Muslim or that he would reverse the United States ' policy of supporting Israel .
Obama is Christian and says he backs a strong U.S. - Israel relationship .
" The older demographic particularly were being hit with tons and tons of Obama smear e-mails , " Wallach said .
" If you really want to talk to them in a way that will bring them over to the Obama side , you want to do it one to one , ideally with people they love .
And grandparents love no one more than their grandkids . "
And so the Great Schlep was born .
The idea was that young , Jewish Democrats would flood Florida and convince their elders that voting for Obama was OK .
To get the word out about the Great Schlep , Wallach and his colleagues turned to comedian Sarah Silverman .
Silverman makes the case for Obama in a Web video in which she attempts to show similarities -- some tenuous -- between an African - American man and an older Jewish woman .
She raves about the Democratic candidate 's brisket and points out that Barack comes from the Hebrew word for " lightning . "
Watch the Great Schlep »
The video ends with Silverman advising Obama supporters to let their grandparents know that should they fail to vote Democratic in the presidential election in November , maybe they should n't expect many more family visits .
The Silverman video quickly became a Web sensation , garnering about 2 million hits in the two weeks since it was posted on thegreatschlep.com , organizers said .
Thousands of people pledged to call their relatives in Florida and more than 100 people volunteered to pay their own way to travel to the Sunshine State to campaign for Obama among Jewish voters , Wallach said .
Bender saw the Silverman video on YouTube in Los Angeles , California , where he works as a writer .
Despite the humor of Silverman 's call to schlep , the video 's message resonated with Bender because of the difficulty he faced convincing his own grandparents .
" I thought it was brilliant , " Bender said .
He decided to go to Florida and try one more time .
When Bender recently returned to his grandparents ' retirement community in Tamarac , Florida , near Fort Lauderdale , he was greeted with several surprises .
Months of telephone conversations and his trip had paid off :
His grandparents told him shortly after he arrived that they were going to support Obama .
The next surprise was that his schlep had generated interest around their retirement community .
A lot of interest .
So many other seniors wanted to hear about Obama that the venue for a meeting on the subject had to be changed from the Furst 's living room to a ballroom in the community 's clubhouse .
An hour before Bender started to make his case about Obama on Sunday , groups of senior citizens were staking out space in the ballroom .
Soon there were more than 100 people and no more chairs .
Sporting an Obama T - shirt with Hebrew writing on it , retiree Morty Brill said , " The economy , the war , you think you can trust Republicans to fix them ? "
If there were any people in the room with reservations about Barack Obama , they kept those doubts to themselves .
As Bender told the crowd that Obama was not a Muslim and that Obama was a staunch supporter of Israel , he was met with heads nodding in agreement throughout the room .
However , Bender felt the need to drive the point further .
If Obama was elected , he said , then Bender would not worry so much about politics and " would have more time to find a nice Jewish girl to marry . "
Whether Mike Bender 's schlep really changed any minds is anyone 's guess , but the applause from the crowd was deafening .

She ’s fluent in three languages .
She ’s studied everywhere from Tehran to Tokyo to Cambridge , Mass .
And she ’s invented a space - age material so light and strong that it could revolutionize everything from vehicle bumpers to armor to biomedical devices .
The ultra - high - strength composite metal foam created by Afsaneh Rabiei is a highlight of a well - traveled career during which the researcher has tried to learn everything she can about advanced materials .
The result : a brand new material that can save energy and lives .
“ Basically , it is a new material for all sorts of safety devices , ” said Rabiei , associate professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at North Carolina State University .
Rabiei ’s invention is n’t the first metal foam , but she says it ’s the strongest .
The main weakness of existing metal foams is the varying sizes of their cells — tiny pockets of space inside the material .
Instead , Rabiei used cells of standard sizes and combined them with a metallic matrix to support the cell walls .
That helps
A light , strong material Rabiei has been working on high - performance materials for more than 20 years .
She studied materials science and engineering while getting her undergraduate degree at Sharif University of Technology in Tehran , Iran , in 1986 .
After spending some time in industry — getting more experience in casting , welding and materials testing — she returned to academia and obtained her Ph.D. in 1997 from The University of Tokyo .
Her work on the metal foams began when she was a post - doctoral researcher at Harvard University .
Along the way , she ’s become fluent in English , Japanese and Persian and written four books and dozens of other publications .
The National Science Foundation awarded her a CAREER award in 2003 , and her goal with the funding was to develop a light , strong material that could be used saving lives and energy in the aerospace , medical , automotive and other industries .
After five years of work — with a group of her students — she has the results .
Rough traffic accident calculations show that by inserting two pieces of her composite metal foam behind the bumper of a car traveling 28 mph , the impact would feel the same to passengers as impact traveling at only 5 mph .
Applications : airplanes , boats
The results are most striking when the material is tested in a lab .
The test itself is exciting : a high - powered machine smashes a piece of steel foam straight down into the base plate of the machine , and then does the same thing with a piece of bulk steel .
When she examines the base plates under both samples , there ’s a clear indentation left under the bulk steel sample , while the plate under the foam shows no indentation .
The test shows how the foam absorbed the energy and protected the plate , while the steel simply transferred it to the base plate with no protection .
And since the bulk steel is three times heavier than the steel foam , it ’s easy to see how the foam could attract car manufacturers looking for a bumper that will improve safety and gas mileage .
Rabiei sees plenty of uses for her invention , including in airplanes , boats , and structures that need impact protection with maintaining low weight .
It ’s this high strength - to - density ratio — defining a material that ’s both strong and light — that makes Rabiei ’s foam unique .
“ This material showed a much higher strength - to - density ratio than any metal foam that has ever been reported , ” she said .

The Federal Reserve Board has authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to borrow securities from certain regulated U.S. insurance subsidiaries of the American International Group ( AIG ) , under section 13 ( 3 ) of the Federal Reserve Act .
Under this program , the New York Fed will borrow up to $ 37.8 billion in investment - grade , fixed - income securities from AIG in return for cash collateral .
These securities were previously lent by AIG ’s insurance company subsidiaries to third parties .
As expected , drawdowns to date under the existing $ 85 billion New York Fed loan facility have been used , in part , to settle transactions with counterparties returning these third - party securities to AIG .
This new program will allow AIG to replenish liquidity used in settling those transactions , while providing enhanced credit protection to the New York Fed and U.S. taxpayers in the form of a security interest in these securities .
You may have seen it last week .
There were charges of fraud levelled at the Obama campaign because donations from names like ' Doodad Pro ' were not reported by his campaign .
In the last election , there were claims that Republicans invoked anti-fraud measures to suppress legitimate voting by groups that tend to vote Democratic .
In both cases , there was more hyperbole than substance .
There is fraud , but the immediacy of the internet has magnified it into being much more substantial than it is and University at Buffalo Law School Professor James A. Gardner cautions against giving too much importance to charges of voter fraud in American elections and supposed incompetence in administering elections .
The process in the overwhelming majority of elections , he says , is working well .
" We have to be careful about political propaganda being spread about how voter fraud , and to a lesser extent incompetence in the administration of elections , threatens democracy , " says Gardner , an authority on election and constitutional law , and the UB Law School 's vice dean for academic affairs .
" This simply is not true , " says Gardner .
" There are more than 500,000 elected officials in the U.S. Virtually every one of these elections comes off without a hitch .
The news media have a tendency to focus exclusively on the extremely rare but dramatic cases in which the outcome of a very close race is put in doubt by a very small number of possibly tainted ballots or a malfunction of voting technology or human error in the administration of elections .
" These are very rare exceptions to the rule . "
Gardner says another common false impression is that elections in the U.S. are always close , and that the smallest errors or the occasional fraudulent ballot among thousands have the potential to destroy democratic self - government .
" That 's not the case , " says Gardner .
" In fact , the overwhelming majority of elections in the U.S. are so lopsided that no amount of error or fraud could change the result , and many , many elections are completely uncontested .
Uncontested and lopsided elections may be a sign of something wrong with the system , but it has nothing to do with the administration of elections . "
Gardner said election law and procedure still merit close scrutiny but some efforts are overkill .
For example , a recent Supreme Court decision upheld voter ID requirements in Indiana even though voter fraud was " essentially a non-existent problem . "

We admire people who look into the eye of adversity , dig in their heels and persevere , no matter what the odds .
But in investing , it 's best to stare defeat in the face , lace up your sneakers and run screaming into the woods .
Much of financial literature lauds the virtue of long - term buy - and - hold investing , and it 's true :
If you invest in stocks over very long periods , you typically earn more than you would from less risky investments , such as bank CDs and bonds .
If you 're willing to hang on through the tough times , your investment rewards can increase with the risks you take .
That said , there are some perfectly good reasons to sell , too .
For example , while it's all well and good to hold a diversified portfolio of stocks through booms and busts , specialized stock funds and individual stocks carry far more risk than , say , a fund that tracks the Standard & Poor 's 500 - stock index .
The axiom that " rewards increase with risk " has limits , just like , " The faster you drive , the sooner you get there . "
If all you had to do to achieve wealth was to take on more risk , then all financial wisdom would boil down to buying lottery tickets .
If you own stocks or funds with above - average risk , selling is a better option than holding through catastrophic losses , which can lead to the permanent destruction of wealth , not the creation of more of it .
After all , if you lose 50 % , you then have to earn 100 % just to get even .
And a long - term investment outlook does n't necessarily mean keeping every holding until the bitter end .
Some companies become obsolete over time .
Of the 500 companies in the index in 1957 , for example , only 57 stocks remained by 2007 .
In short , there 's nothing inherently wrong with selling .
And if you hold your stocks or funds in a taxable account , selling has a distinct advantage :
You can reap excellent tax benefits from selling your losers .
You can use your losses to offset any amount of long - term capital gains .
Let 's say you bought 500 shares of Ford 10 years ago .
At the time , your shares cost $ 44.625 apiece , for a total cost of $ 22,313 .
At the end of August , you decided you had suffered enough and sold all 500 shares at $ 4.46 a share .
( You did n't reinvest your dividends . )
Your proceeds : $ 2,230 — a loss of $ 20,083 !
On the bright side , let 's say you also enjoyed a $ 10,000 long - term gain from a stock that you feel has peaked .
( Most long - term capital gains — the profits on investments sold after more than a year — are taxed at 15 % . )
Your tax on your $ 10,000 gain , then , would be $ 1,500 .
Suppose you also had a short - term gain of $ 5,000 on another stock .
( Bear in mind that this is in the magical realm of examples , where people actually saw gains this year . )
Short - term gains are taxed at ordinary income tax rates , which , in this case , is 25 % .
So you 'd owe an additional $ 1,250 on your short - term gain .
Fortunately , your losses will come to your rescue .
Your $ 20,083 loss would offset your $ 10,000 long - term gain and your $ 5,000 short - term gain .
That would save you $ 2,750 in taxes .
You can deduct an additional $ 3,000 in losses from your income .
Any remaining losses — in this case , $ 2,083 — can be carried over to your 2009 tax return .
If you 're convinced that your loser will someday become a winner , you can buy shares in the company again , though you must wait 30 days .
If you repurchase your stock sooner than that , you 'll generate what 's called a wash sale , and the IRS will disallow your losses .
If you own a mutual fund , you can buy another fund immediately — as long as it's not too close in nature to the fund you sold at a loss .
It 's probably not a wise idea , for example , to sell your shares of the Vanguard 500 Index fund and buy shares of another fund that tracks the S&P 500 .
But you could buy shares of the Vanguard International Explorer fund , for example , without running afoul of the wash - sale rules .
If you own a fund that charges an upfront commission , or load , consider moving between funds in the same fund family .
Most will let you do so without charging another commission .
You could move from the American Funds Growth Fund of America to the American Funds EuroPacific fund , for example , without paying another sales charge .
If you move outside the fund family , though , you 'll pay an additional sales charge , unless you switch to a no - load fund family .
No one likes losses , and tax relief does only a little to ease your pain .
But if you 're in a losing investment and you see no hope in sight , then gird your loins , stare disaster right in the eyes and run like crazy .

After nearly eighty years , the New York Times reports that Russia may now finally be moving to de-collectivize and privatize its farmlands .
From 1928 to 1933 , Stalin pursued a ruthless drive to collectivize all agriculture in the Soviet Union , and implemented a series of events in the Ukraine ( “ the breadbasket of Europe ” ) to crush the people seeking independence from Russian rule .
The result was massive resistance and a catastrophic famine — one of the greatest mass starvations in modern world history , as is documented in Robert Conquest ’s seminal book , The Harvest of Sorrow : Soviet Collectivization and the Terror - Famine .
Now , perhaps the horrendous “ experiment ” in farm collectivization may come to an end :
Russia occupies an unusual niche in the global food chain .
Before the Russian Revolution and the subsequent forced collectivization of farming under Stalin , it was the largest grain exporting nation in the world .
Today , roughly 7 percent of the planet ’s arable land is either owned by the Russian state or by collective farms , but about a sixth of all that agricultural land — some 35 million hectares — lies fallow .
[ A hectare is about two and a half acres . ] . . . .
Yields in Russia , however , are tiny .
The average Russian grain yield is 1.85 tons a hectare — compared with 6.36 tons in the United States and 3.04 in Canada .
However , most of the discussions to privatize appear to entail large - scale , land purchases / grants with government restrictions on the ability to subdivide and sell , inhibiting a viable and fluid , decentralized , real estate market .
If so , cronyism and mercantilism would be the likely outcome , with higher prices and major disparities in economic opportunity .
And without the benefits from a truly free market in farmlands , political pressures to re-nationalize could result :
[ T ]he business of buying and reforming collective farms is suddenly and improbably very profitable , attracting hedge fund managers , Russian oligarchs , Swedish portfolio investors and even a descendant of White Russian émigré nobility .
Earlier reformers envisioned the collective farms eventually breaking up into family farms .
But the new business model rests on a belief that Russia ’s long , painful history of collectivization is destined to end in large corporate farms .
Some trade and agriculture experts say there is still a danger that a country like today ’s Russia , which jealously guards its natural resources , could one day renationalize farms or form a cartel that dictates to landowners .
Interestingly enough in 1929 , Russia had about 20 million family farms , which were combined by Stalin into 240,000 collective farms .
Fortunately , two percent of the land remained in small , private plots , producing as much as 30 percent of farm output for the nation .
This lesson will hopefully not be lost in the new movement toward de-collectivization .
And since according to the U.S. General Services Administration , the federal government here directly owns about 30 % of the land in the U.S. , would n’t de-collectivization be advisable for Americans as well ?
E.C. Pasour , Jr. and Randal Rucker discuss this need for de-socialization in their Independent Institute book , Pork Barrels and Plowshares : The Political Economy of Agriculture .
Professor : ' W. ' film aimed at independent voters David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Monday October 13 , 2008
Print This Email This With just over 20 days to go before the United States selects a new leader , Oliver Stone 's latest biopic , W. , has its sights set squarely on one key demographic : Independent voters .
" We wanted Americans to see this character , who they voted for , a little bit better , " said director Oliver Stone to CNN reporter Kareen Wynter .
" Stephen J. Ross , professor of film and politics as USC , says Stone 's decision to release the film just 18 days before the presidential election was no accident , " reported Wynter .
" It is the impact , I think , that he wants to have right now , " said Ross .
" And he 's aiming not at the Democrats , not at the Republicans , but at those Independents -- that 20 percent that both sides are still battling for . "
The professor also suggested that the marketing campaign for W. could backfire .
" There are people that could see Oliver Stone 's film as an example of negative campaigning , as a character smear against an outgoing president , " said Ross .
" Oliver Stone is a filmmaker who often crosses the line , like Michael Moore . "
" Whether it 's seen as a character assassination , or art imitating life , W. , like most of Stone 's films , will probably leave audiences loving or hating it , " said Wynter .
When the CNN reporter asked the White House about Stone 's latest opus , she received an expected " no comment . "
W. will be in theaters nation - wide on Friday .

When Sex Is Not as Private as You Expect Police across the U.S. crack down on sexual toys and acts , even if simulated .
July 18 , 2008  --
People are ( or will be ) having sex all around America today .
But that 's nobody 's business .
Sex is a private matter , right ?
Except that local authorities sometimes say it is their business .
At a public park in Columbus , Ohio , a topless woman asked a man to expose himself .
The park appeared empty to him , but police were actually videotaping him from an unmarked car nearby as part of a sting operation .
Once he exposed himself , police officers drove up and arrested him , not her .
Columbus law says being topless is OK , even if you 're female .
Sex in parks is a long tradition .
Movies show how teens have always used parks and the backseats of cars as places to fool around .
And if a cop catches them , they 'll often tell the kids to put their clothes back on and move along .
But that 's not how some local authorities react in the real world .
' I Was Horrified '
Authorities in Johnson City , Tenn. , responded to complaints that gay men were using a local park for sex by setting up a sting operation .
Ken Giles , 54 , was one of the men they arrested , but he says he simply stepped off the trail to go to the bathroom .
" I just thought I was in trouble for urinating in public , " he said .
Police allege that Giles exposed himself to an undercover officer .
They charged him with indecent exposure and disorderly conduct but did more than just arrest him .
Before Giles and the other men were convicted , police released the names , photos and addresses of everyone who had been arrested .
On his way to court , Giles saw his picture in the newspaper and front page headlines .
" I was horrified , " he said .
He says he was told to plead guilty and did so to avoid a harsher punishment that would have come had Giles pled innocent and then been found guilty .
Afterward , his employer fired him .
" When I lost my job over it my wife was so upset and distraught and distressed that she had a major heart attack , " said Giles , whose wife died shortly after ABC News interviewed him .
" Right now , it 's just about destroyed my life . "
Another man , also named by the police , committed suicide .
Sex therapist Marty Klein said this is part of America 's " War on Sex " .
" Let 's not just simply arrest them , let 's humiliate them , " he said .
" Let 's drag them through the mud .
And that will make people think twice about ever doing that sort of thing again . "
Johnson City Police Chief John
Lowry said the town was just doing what 's necessary to keep parks safe .
" Anytime someone 's charged like that , it becomes public record , " he said .
" It 's no different than drug stings that we 've done , prostitution stings , things like that . "
Peter Sprigg , senior director of policy studies at the Family Research Council in Washington , D.C. , agreed .
" Anybody who 's arrested for any crime , that becomes a matter of public record , " he said .
" We do n't grant privacy to people who have been arrested for and charged with crimes . "
I pointed out that some people lost their jobs in Johnson City and that one man killed himself .
" That 's very unfortunate , " Sprigg said .
" But we do n't make arrest records confidential just in order to protect people 's feelings . "
Cracking Down on Chippendales
Now , it 's one thing if people engage in sex outdoors , in a public place , but it 's another thing when it 's indoors and frequented by people who want to be there .
But police sometimes object to that , too .
Chippendales , a male burlesque show geared toward women , is n't as racy as you might think .
They keep their private parts private and they say their routines are PG - 13 .
The men dance , show off their bodies and flirt with some women in the audience .
" We make 80 - year - old ladies giggle like they 're 18 again , " Dancer Kaleb Art said .
For years , Chippendales has toured the country , performing in big towns and small ones .
They have never had a problem with authorities , until last year when they came to Jake 's Sports Bar in Lubbock , Texas .
Ten minutes before the show , police showed up to lay down the law .
Lots of police , said bar owner , Scott Stephenson .
" We had 16 uniformed officers , a [ police car ] , a K - 9 unit , undercover agents , " Stephenson said .
Police warned the dancers to avoid " simulated sex acts " and the Chippendales dancers peppered police with questions to determine what was allowed and what was off - limits .
" [ Police said ] if ladies try and come up and touch you , you know , you can't allow that , which we do n't allow that anyways , " Art said .
A dancer even went onstage and warned the audience of the limits set by Lubbock 's City Council .
They did their usual show and it went smoothly , until the portion of the show where the dancers venture into the crowd to thank the audience .
" Right when we stepped off that stage and went in the crowd , it was just like , ' Boom , ' " Art said of the police reaction .
Arts says the police told the dancers to " ' gather your stuff , you 're going to jail . '
It 's kind of like , really ? "
Eight Chippendales dancers , their tour manager , promoter and the manager of the bar were all taken to jail .
The audience was n't pleased and started chanting " City Council sucks . "
One woman complained to ABC's Lubbock affiliate KAMC , " I 'm mad , because I paid to see this show .
And to me , it 's stupid .
They 're just dancing !
It 's no big deal ! "
Tour manager Scott Shelton says they were never told exactly what they did wrong .
" They were n't able to explain it to us that night , the next morning .
I have n't been able to get an explanation since . "
In a statement to " 20/20 , " Lubbock police claim some of the dancers thrust their pelvic areas toward women in the audience — what they call a " simulated sex act " — in violation of the sexually oriented business code .
After a night in jail , the charges were dropped and the Chippendales group was free .
Sex Toys for ' Medical Reasons '
Finally , some states have laws that creep right into the bedroom .
In Alabama , state legislators have banned the sale of sex toys .
That upset Sherri Williams , who has owned Pleasures , the " One - Stop Romance Shop , " for 14 years .
Williams says her customers certainly seem happy that her store is here .
" There 's not a day that goes by that I do n't get a thank you , or , ' Oh , gosh , I so much appreciate you telling me about that , ' " she said .
But then came the ban on adult sex toys .
Sherri Williams ' husband , Dave Smith , said there 's something odd about the law .
" You know in the state of Alabama I can buy a gun , " he said .
" I can carry it in my pocket . "
But if he buys a vibrator , someone could get arrested and fined up to $ 10,000 — almost five times the limit for drunken driving .
American Civil Liberties Union president Nadine Strossen helped Sherri Williams challenge the law .
" When you have a right to engage in certain sexual conducts , sometimes products are involved . …
You have a right to use sex devices in the privacy of your own bedroom .
You can't enjoy that right unless you can buy the sex toys , " she said .
But the 11th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled on Jan. 31 , 2001 that communities have a " legitimate legislative interest in discouraging prurient interests in autonomous sex " — masturbation , in other words — because that may be " detrimental to the health and morality of the State . "
After numerous appeals affirming the inital ruling , the case was finally settled when the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal last October .
Oddly , however , Pleasures is still in business , because the law makes an exception if a sex toy is sold for a medical purpose .
" I do not sell sex toys for enjoyment , no , " Williams said .
" I only sell sex toys for medical reasons . "
Her shop hands out a questionnaire to every customer , asking questions such as , " Do you or your partner have difficulty having an orgasm ? " or " Do you climax too quickly ? "
Saying " yes " once constitutes a medical purpose .
Who 's the government protecting ?
It 's not as if anyone has been killed by a vibrator .
The Alabama state senator who sponsored the legislation would n't talk .
But Sprigg of Family Research Council shared his opinion .
" The government is protecting actually the people who patronize those shops because I do n't think it 's in their interest to use pornography and sex toys , " he said .
But do n't adults get to choose what 's in their interest ?
" We have to look at society 's interest as well , " Sprigg said .
" Society does have an interest in people 's private sexual behavior . "
No , it does n't , shopowner Williams countered .
She believes private should mean private .
" They will have to pry this vibrator from my cold dead hand before I stop selling them , " she said .
This article is excerpted from the Mental Floss book In the Beginning : The Origins of Everything .
1. Tambourines
Long before the Tambourine Man played a song for Bob Dylan , tambourine - like instruments were being used by Ojibwe and Cree people in what is now Canada , in several Middle Eastern cultures , in South India , China , and in Eastern Europe .
In ancient Egypt , tambourines were used by temple dancers , and were used in festivals and processions by the Greeks and Romans .
Over in Western Europe , the tambourine began to gain popularity in the mid-18th century as an orchestral instrument , particularly when that infamous rebel of the classical music world , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , began to employ it in several compositions .
Today , while the tambourine is still occasionally used in orchestral music , it 's more commonly associated with Western folk music .
2. Kettle Drum
The kettle drum varies greatly across cultures , but the earliest versions may date back to at least 4000 B.C.E. in Mesopotamia .
Babylonian artifacts have also been found with instructions for building kettle drums inscribed on them .
Used throughout the ancient Middle East and in many Islamic cultures , kettle drums first arrived in western Europe thanks to soldiers returning home from the Crusades .
It 's no surprise then that in Western cultures , kettle drums have typically been associated with the military :
The kettle drum was used in battle as an imposing noise to signal the opposing army 's impending doom , as well as to keep their own soldiers marching in time .
3. Guitars
The first guitar was a variation on a lute , a stringed instrument with a curved back , designed in western Europe in the 13th century .
A few hundred years later , the Spanish " vihuela "  had come into being , and by the mid-16th century , the " guitarre "  had become a popular instrument in Spain , and was subsequently introduced into France .
Musically - inclined Spanish and Portugese colonists brought their guitars with them on their trips to Africa and the New World .
In the Carribean , regional variants on the guitar sprang up , as indigenous people adopted the instruments to fit traditional music : the tres , from Cuba , and the cuatro , from Puerto Rico , are two such instruments .
Further south , the charango came into being — an instrument sometimes made out of the shell of an armadillo — and in Mexico , the huge bass guitar known as a guitarron became a mainstay of mariachi music .
The guitar largely remained part of the rhythm section until the birth of the recording industry in the United States .
Guitar makers and players " “ as well as the industry execs " “ wanted louder guitars , and a few people began to look at electronic amplification as a means to this end .
In 1931 , a man named Adolph Rickenbacker collaborated with George Beauchamp to make the first electric guitar pickup : a magnet with a coil of wire wrapped around it , which when electrified by a current amplified the sound produced by the vibration of the guitar strings .
By the end of the 30s and into the 40s , the " electric sound "  was being pioneered by jazz , country , and blues guitarists like Merle Travis and Muddy Waters .
But it was rock and roll that really popularized the electric guitar — in particular , the new solid - body guitar ( as opposed to the " hollow body "  of earlier guitars ) .
Several guitar makers had experimented with the solid - body style , but it was Leo Fender , a radio repairman , who would put the style on the map in 1950 , and forever changed the course of American pop music .

4. Violin
The European violin — a four stringed instrument played with a bow , and held between the chin and shoulder — was developed in the 16th century to accompany dances or to echo the melody sung by a vocalist .
In the 17th century , the full range of the violin was utilized in operas , concertos , and sonatas , and was used as a solo instrument for the first time .
The instrument really took off , however , in the years between 1650 and 1750 , when all of Europe was succumbing to the violin craze .
The hub of violin - making activity was the town of Cremona in northern Italy , where some estimates place the number of violins produced at 20,000 .
As home to some of the most famous violin - makers of all time , Cremona boasted the likes of Nicola Amati ( who died in1684 ) and his apprentices , Guarneri del Gesu and Antonio Stradivari .
Stradivari , of course , is better known as Stradivarius — the Latin version of his family name being the one he chose to sign his instruments with .
Stradivarius was famous for his attention to detail and his experimentation , choosing different types of wood , varnishes , and structural techniques to slightly alter the sound ; each Stradivarius violin produced a unique tone , which is part of why they are so prized today .
In the last 37 years of his life , Stradivarius cranked out an average of one instrument a week — violins and cellos — which was an astounding feat , considering the amount of attention he devoted to each instrument .
There are about 1,000 " Strads "  still in existence , which can each fetch up to $ 2 million .
5. Accordion
Beloved instrument of Steve Urkel and Weird Al Yankovic , the accordion 's history lies in the wind instruments of Asian and African societies .
In fact , " free reeds , "  which create the distinctive sound when air passes over them , have been used in Chinese instruments for over 2000 years .
The modern accordion was first designed in Austria in the early 19th century — unlike modern accordions , however , it only featured a keyboard on one side , with the other end was used to operate the bellows .
Today , there are three types of accordions : the piano accordion ( which has a piano - like keyboard on one end of the instrument ) ; the concertina ( a hexagonal instrument which has no keys , only buttons on each end ) ; and the button accordion ( which is pretty much what it sounds like ) .
All three types work by expanding and squeezing together the bellows , forcing air over the free reeds inside and causing them to vibrate , with the keys and buttons determining the pitch .
6. Harmonica
In the small town of Trossingen , Germany , in 1857 , a clockmaker named Matthias Hohner started producing " mouth organs , "  based on an earlier design by Christian Buschmann in 1821 .
While another Trossinger , Christian Messner , had already started manufacturing harmonicas by 1930 , Hohner was the first to mass - produce them , and the first to ship them across the Atlantic to the US , in 1868 .
It was n't long before the mouth organ , now known as the harmonica , became an essential component of a variety of musical styles in the west , including folk , country - western , and ( of course ) the blues .
7. Saxophone
The saxophone is the baby of the reed family , brought into the world in 1841 at the Brussels Exhibition by the Belgian inventor Adolphe Sax .
Originally made in 14 different sizes and keys , today three or four horns dominate the scene ( with the soprano , the tenor , the alto and the baritone are the most prominent ) .
In 1845 , Sax organized a " battle of the bands "  in which he led a group of musicians playing his new saxophone ( as well as other brass instruments ) in competition against an ensemble playing the traditional instruments of the French military band .
Sax 's band was so enthusiastically received by the audience that the French government decided — shockingly — to adopt the saxophone as part of their standard band lineup .
We can call this as some type of monument of the Russian money value rouble .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Citigroup 's losing streak continued after reporting a $ 2.8 billion loss Thursday , as the bank found itself stung yet again by credit and mortgage - related writedowns .
During the third quarter , the company said it lost $ 2.8 billion , or 60 cents a share .
A year ago , the company reported a profit of $ 2.21 billion , or 44 cents a share .
This marked the fourth - consecutive loss for Citigroup , the nation 's largest bank by assets .
The company has lost more than $ 20 billion in the past four quarters .
The latest results , however , were somewhat encouraging as the loss was smaller - than - expected .
Analysts were expecting a loss of 70 cents a share , according to Thomson Reuters .
Still , that did little to comfort investors as Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) shares tumbled 2 % Thursday , extending Wednesday 's painful 13 % decline .
" [ The numbers ] still show that the company is mismanaged , " said William Smith , president of SAM Advisors LLC , whose firm owns shares of Citigroup .
" Part of this is the macro - environment as all the banks are having writeoffs .
But Citi is above and beyond . "
Citigroup CEO
Vikram Pandit attributed the company 's latest performance to more than $ 13.2 billion in writedowns the company took during the quarter , including a $ 4.4 billion charge in its securities and banking division .
But Pandit gave an optimistic assessment of the company 's ongoing restructuring plan .
During the third quarter , the company sold assets while trimming its payroll by 11,000 workers as part of a previously announced layoff program .
" We expect these improvements will enable us to realize the full earnings power of our franchise as the economy stabilizes , " Vikram Pandit , Citigroup CEO said in a statement .
While writedowns continued to eat away at the company 's latest results , Citigroup also found itself hit hard by credit costs during the quarter .
Both its consumer banking and massive credit card business swung to a loss during the quarter , as the souring state of the domestic economy and housing market forced Citi to bulk up its credit loss reserves .
But credit problems were not limited to the United States .
Citigroup , which has a footprint in some 100 countries around the globe , reported rising credit losses in a handful of markets including Mexico , Brazil and India .
Citigroup chief financial officer Gary Crittenden warned investors during a conference call Thursday morning that losses related to consumer credit could continue growing well into 2009 .
Citigroup 's report is yet another dose of bad news for both the New York City - based bank and the overall financial sector .
Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) , the investment bank that agreed last month to sell itself to Bank of America , announced a bigger - than - expected loss Thursday morning .
Fearing further fallout in the banking sector both domestically and abroad , government officials around the world enacted measures in recent days to help prop up the industry .
As part of that plan , top U.S. regulators unveiled plans to inject $ 250 billion into the nation 's banking system , with half of that amount going to nine major financial institutions including Citigroup , as well as rivals JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) .
Crittenden backed the plan , saying it would only further strengthen Citigroup 's capital position .
He said that the firm would not treat it like a " windfall " but pointed out that some of the money could be used for acquisitions .
" It does present the possibility of taking advantage of opportunities that were closed to us , " he said .
Citigroup has showed a lot of interest lately in bulking up its retail branch network .
Last week , Citigroup pulled out of its plans to buy the banking assets of Wachovia ( WB , Fortune 500 ) after it could not reach an agreement with Wells Fargo on how to split Wachovia 's assets .
Although Cit 's proposed deal was brokered by the FDIC and prevented Wachovia from failing , Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) subsequently made an offer to buy all of Wachovia .
That deal was approved by the Federal Reserve over the weekend .
Since then speculation has turned to what Citigroup might try and buy next .
Crittenden said that the bank also considered offers for two other banks recently .
One is widely believed to be failed savings and loan Washington Mutual , which was ultimately acquired by JPMorgan Chase .

WASHINGTON ( AP )  Colin Powell will have a role as a top presidential adviser in an Obama administration , the Democratic White House hopeful said Monday .
" He will have a role as one of my advisers , " Barack Obama said on NBC's Today in an interview aired Monday , a day after Powell , a four - star general and President Bush 's former secretary of state , endorsed him .
" Whether he wants to take a formal role , whether that 's a good fit for him , is something we'd have to discuss , " Obama said .
POLITICS BLOG : Obama and Powell to work together ?
CAMPAIGN LATEST : Powell endorses Obama for president Being a top presidential adviser , especially on foreign policy , would be familiar ground to Powell on a subject that 's relatively new to the freshman Illinois senator .
Obama has struggled to establish his foreign policy credentials against GOP candidate John McCain , a decorated military veteran , former prisoner of war and ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee .
In the NBC interview , Obama said Powell did not give him a heads - up before he crossed party lines and endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate on the network 's Meet the Press a day earlier .
In that interview , Powell called Obama a " transformational figure " in the nation 's history and expressed disappointment in some of McCain 's campaign tactics .
But , Powell said , he did n't plan to hit the campaign trail with Obama before the Nov. 4 election .
" I wo n't lie to you , I would love to have him at any stop , " Obama said with a grin Monday .
" Obviously , if he wants to show up he 's got an open invitation . "
Powell 's endorsement came just hours after Obama 's campaign disclosed that it raised $ 150 million in September — obliterating the old record of $ 66 million it had set only one month earlier .
He expressed disappointment in the negative tone of McCain 's campaign , his choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as a running mate and their decision to focus in the closing weeks of the contest on Obama 's ties to 1960s - era radical William Ayers , saying " it goes too far . "
McCain , meanwhile , seemed dismissive of Powell 's endorsement , saying it was n't a surprise , that the two share mutual respect and are longtime friends .
The Republican from Arizona pointed out on Sunday that he had support from four other former secretaries of state , all veterans of Republican administrations : Henry Kissinger , James A. Baker III , Lawrence Eagleburger and Alexander Haig .
At a boisterous rally Sunday , Obama said McCain was " out of ideas and almost out of time . "
He and his aides appear so confident of his prospects that apart from a brief stop in Madison , Wis. , next Thursday , Obama currently has no plans during the next 10 days to return to Pennsylvania , Minnesota , New Hampshire or any other state that voted for John Kerry in 2004 .
Instead , he intends to spend two days this week in Florida , where early voting begins on Monday , and travel to Virginia , Iowa , Ohio , Colorado , New Mexico and possibly Nevada and Indiana .
Those states hold 97 electoral votes combined , and Bush won all in 2004 .
Obama also may stop in West Virginia , where his campaign recently bought statewide television advertising in a late attempt to put the state 's five electoral votes into serious contention .

McCain is miserable about having to run a campaign that ’s antithetical to his persona .
Advisers worry about ‘ grumpy McCain ’
When Politico ’s Ryan Grim approached Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) after the evening of the Senate bailout vote , the reporter did n’t even get his question out .
“ Excuse me , you ’re bothering me , ” McCain said .
Advertisement
It was a surprising rebuke from a politician who once was famous for palling around with reporters , and who was so media - friendly that he was sometimes known as “ the senator from ‘ Meet the Press . ’ ”
But what friends call “ grumpy McCain ” is showing up regularly on the campaign trail , and several top advisers worry that it ’s hurting his campaign by making him appear peevish and hunkered down when the country is looking for a larger and more optimistic brand of leadership .
After his first debate with Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill. ) , both spectators in the hall and commentators on TV noted that McCain had deliberately avoided looking at his rival .
A close McCain friend said the reason is clear : McCain is miserable about having to run a campaign that ’s antithetical to his persona .
“ He is basically having to be somebody that he is n’t , ” said the friend , who remains strongly supportive .
“ He is just not a guy that goes on the attack in public .
For him to be on the attack constantly , attacking Obama ’s character … McCain is uncomfortable with that , and it ’s made him grumpy . ”
Part of his ill temper apparently flows from the hazing being delivered his vice presidential nominee , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
When a Philadelphia graduate student in line for cheesesteaks asked Palin a question about Pakistan , McCain later called it “ gotcha journalism . ”
The examples are adding up .
When McCain sat down with Time magazine , a reporter asked him to define honor , and he snarled , “ Read it in my books . ”
The magazine headlined its prickly McCain interview , “ McCain ’s prickly Time interview . ”
When McCain sat down with The Des Moines Register 's editorial board for another interview , he got into a testy exchange with an editor who raised conservative criticism of his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
" If there 's a Georgetown cocktail party person who , quote , calls himself a conservative and does n't like her , good luck .
Good luck .
Fine , " McCain replied .
When one of the Iowa journalists suggested that the ad about lipstick on a pig was not worthy of his campaign , McCain snapped : “ That certainly is your opinion .
But [ that does n’t change ] my positions and my honorable service to this country .
So I respect your opinion .
I strongly disagree with your assertion . ”
A senior McCain campaign official said the idea that McCain is crabby is " silly " and noted , " McCain opened the first debate with a joke ! "
The apparent shift in mood is in part a reflection of his changed circumstances .
In the past , McCain had been known for occasionally freezing out or chiding reporters who annoyed him , but these occasional episodes just seemed to be part of his maverick package .
Now some advisers fear that he ’s becoming known for being too cranky — acting out David Letterman ’s jokes about an old man shouting , “ Get off my lawn . ”
In particular , some advisers say his harshly negative attacks on Obama do not fit the worrisome circumstances facing the country .
“ People do not want that — they ’re not going to put up with it , ” a campaign official said .
“ They will in advertising , but not from the man himself . "
One longtime adviser said McCain has a choice in tonight ’s debate , which has a town hall format that will make it hard to ignore Obama .
“ He either has to go out and be Ronald Reagan and let the paid advertising just burn the house down on Obama , or he can go out and be Bob Dole — ‘ Where is the outrage ? ' ” the adviser said .
If he does n’t turn to the Reagan approach in terms of his personal conduct and demeanor , he ’ll lose .
The adviser was referring to the 1996 GOP nominee , whose attacks on Bill Clinton ’s character that year never took hold , causing him to bray indignantly , “ Where ’s the outrage ? ”
“ McCain ca n’t appear to be desperate , ” the adviser continued .
“ He ’s got to be upbeat and enthusiastic , and he ’s really got to channel Reagan .
If he goes into this debate and beats the [ heck ] out of Obama , Obama ’s numbers are going to come up . ”
To make that switch , McCain will have to overcome an aversion to Obama that he no longer bothers to gloss over .
When Obama crossed over to the Republican side of the Senate floor the night of the bailout vote and offered his hand to his rival , “ McCain shook it , but with a ‘ go away ’ look that no one could miss , " David Nather reported on CQPolitics.com .
“ He tried his best not to even look at Obama , ” Nather wrote .
“ Finally , with a tight smile , McCain managed a greeting : ‘ Good to see you . ’
Obama got the message ... and quickly beat a retreat back to the Democratic side . ”
A thin layer of water frost is visible on the ground around NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander in this image taken by the Surface Stereo Imager at 6 a.m. on August 14 , 2008 .
The frost began to disappear shortly after as the sun rose on the Phoenix landing site .
After morethan four months on the arctic plains of the red planet , NASA 's Phoenix MarsLander 's days are finally numbered .
As the sun begins to set for the frigidMartian winter , the spacecraft will lose its energy supply , freeze andeventually fall into a mechanical coma from which it will likely never wake up .
Phoenix 's mission has been to dig upsamples of Martian dirt and the subsurface layer of rock - hard water ice at itslanding site in Mars ' Vastitas Borealis plains .
The lander has been scanning the samples for signs of the region ?s past potentialfor habitability .
Phoenix landedon Mars on May 25 , late spring in the Martian northern hemisphere .
Themission was originally slated to last three months , to the end of August , butwas extended twice ; first to the end of September and recently through the endof December .
But whetheror not Phoenix will survive that long is uncertain and depends on how thespacecraft 's systems handle its ever - dwindling energy supply and the harshconditions of the Martian winter .
" We 'reat the mercy of Mars , " said Phoenix project manger Barry Goldstein , ofNASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
Wintersets in
As winterdescends on the Martian arctic , two important things will happen :
The sun willsink below the horizon , and " it 's going to get cold , " said Phoenixmeteorological team member Peter Taylor of York University in Toronto , Canada .
Of course , Mars is never warm by Earth standards ( it is further from the sun and lacks ourplanet 's thick , heat - trappingatmosphere ) , but summer above the Martian arctic circle is downright balmycompared to the winter .
Middaytemperatures at Phoenix 's landing site hit about - 4 degrees Fahrenheit ( - 20 degrees Celsius ) in the summer ( as measured by the lander 's meteorological mastthermometer ) .
Nighttime temperatures then still dropped to - 112 F ( - 80 C ) .
Currently , those daytime temperatures have started dipping down to - 22 F ( - 30C ) , with nighttime temperatures hitting about - 130 F ( - 90 C ) .
Bymid-November , those night temperatures are expected to plummet to - 184 F ( - 120C ) .
The reasonof course , is that setting sun .
The sun isconstantly above the horizon during the arctic summer , just as it is on Earth .
Come fall , it starts to dip below the horizon more and more each day untilwinter , when it sets for good and doesn ?t rise again until the spring .
The sun hasalreadybegun to sink below the horizon for part of the day at Phoenix 's location , Goldstein said .
Phoenix 's landing site is at a latitude similar to northern Alaska on Earth .
Dwindlingenergy
The coldertemperatures and setting sun combined will diminish the energy available to Phoenix for its science operations .
During thesummer , there is plenty of sunlight hitting Phoenix 's wing - like solar arrays , its sole source of power on the planet .
But once the sun is gone , so is itsenergy supply .
" Thesun is going down , so there 's less and less energy being fed into the batteriesthrough the solar panels , and that really is the biggest problem " facing the mission , Taylor said .
Specifically , the orientation of Phoenix 's solar arrays limits how much sunlight it can takein as the sun changes its position in the sky .
" Theproblem is that the solar panels are horizontal , and we can't tilt them , so asthe sun gets lower and lower on the horizon , there 's less and less power beinggenerated , " Taylor explained .
At thebeginning of the mission , Goldstein said , Phoenix 's solar arrays were generatingabout 3300 Watt - hours per sol , or Martian day ( about 24 hours , 39 minutes ) ? that 's enough energy to light a 60 - Watt light bulb for 55 hours .
On Sept.13 , or 109th sol since landing , energy generation had already dipped down to 2400 Watt - hours per sol .
" Andwe 're steadily decreasing , " Goldstein said .
The energycut - off point for the lander will come around the time the arrays can onlygenerate about 1000 Watt - hours , which is " the absolute minimum amount ofenergy that it takes for the spacecraft to wake up in the morning , " Goldstein told SPACE.com .
" Notsurprisingly , we kind of hit that number at about the middle to end ofNovember " according to model projections , Goldstein added .
Those modelsare somewhat conservative in their estimates he said , so it 's possible thelander could hold on for a few extra days , " but it 's not going to bemuch , " he said .
Mission leaders are planning to have alltheir science operations , such as gatheringand analyzing samples , completed by that cut - off date .
Mission scientists had planned to gatherall the remaining samples ( for the one unused cell in the wet chemistry lab and the four unused ovens in the Thermal and Evolved - Gas Analyzer , both of whichanalyze the composition of samples ) by the end of September .
Since that didn ' thappen , they are now aiming to complete sample gathering by mid-October .
Goldsteinsaid he changed the strategy of sample analysis to focus on gathering all theremaining samples and then analyzing them instead of processing them one - by - one .
This shift was made because moving the robotic arm and scraping up the dirt andice is still a tricky process that involves using an unknown amount energy , whereas sample analysis involves a known , discrete amount of energy and will beeasier to budget as energy supplies diminish .
( Another complication is theenergy that must be used to keep the instruments warm enough to function , whichtakes a chunk out of the remaining energy supplies . )
" Sothe sooner we get as many of the samples into the cells , the better , " Goldstein said .
After October , the lander will essentially transition into a weather station , observing the transitioninto winter for as long as it can hold on .
" We 'llkeep measuring temperatures and pressures as long as we can , " Taylor said .
If possible the team will also try to use the lander 's lidar to takemeasurements of the clouds that have been gathering overhead as theatmosphere has cooled and its camera to take images of the frost that hasalready started forming on the ground .
Frostforming
The frostthat has already begun to accumulate in the area around Phoenix 's landing site , as well as the sheer cold temperatures will also affect the lander , thoughtheir impact will mostly come after Phoenix ceases operations .
Imagestaken recently with the lander 's Surface Stereo Imager have shown pockets offrost forming on the ground , especially in the trenches that Phoenix hasbeen digging , Taylor said .
So far , thefrost has n't formed on the lander ?
except for on the small mirror used to viewthe wind telltale at the top of the meteorological mast ?
because Phoenix stayswarmer than the ground around it .
" Ingeneral the lander itself is designed to absorb as much solar radiation as itcan , and to emit relatively little radiation in the infrared .
So the landerdeck has been much hotter than the surrounding ground surface , forinstance , " Taylor explained .
" It 's a bit like the top of a relativelywarm computer , if you like . "
The landerwill likely stay warmer than its surroundings for awhile after Phoenix losesthe energy it needs to operate , " so it 'll be pretty late on when frostactually starts to form on the lander , " Taylor said .
So Phoenix is n'tlikely to get any pictures of itself coated in frost .
Right nowthe frost that is forming is all water ice because it is not yet cold enough at Phoenix 's latitude for carbon dioxide ice to form , though it eventually will .
Whether the frost will come as a thin coating or a thick sheet , like Mars ' polar ice caps , is n't known .
" We 'renot sure how much CO2 will deposit at this latitude ?
most of it is on thepolar cap , " Taylor said .
Taylor tends to think the frost won' tbuild up as much as at higher latitudes .
" We 'll see little flakes of ice , we'll see ice crystals and frost , but it wo n't be [ like ] the ice that freezeson your windscreen on a winter 's morning , " he said .
After Phoenix shuts down , the only way to observe the mounting frost will be through NASA ?s MarsReconnaissance Orbiter 's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) camera .
Scientists are n't sure just how much HiRISE will be able to see , butthe team is hoping it will be able to shed some light on Phoenix fate , sincecommunication with the lander will be lost .
" Wewo n't be able to talk , but we 'd sure like to watch , " Goldstein said .
Resurrection ?
The bigquestion will be what happens when Phoenixemerges on the other side of winter :
Can it live up to its name and come backto life when spring brings back the sun ?
Not likely , Goldstein and Taylor said .
Phoenixdoes have a built in reboot program that its designers call a " Lazarusmode , " " where when energy comes back into the vehicle from the solararrays ?
if and when energy comes ?
it'll automatically try to reboot and tryto communicate , " Goldstein explained .
But he doubts that will happen .
" Iwould be overjoyed to hear something come back from Phoenix ; I 'm extremely ?
Ifind it very , very unlikely , " Goldstein said .
The reasonGoldstein , and others on the Phoenix team , think it unlikely that Phoenix will make a comeback is simple :
The lander has entered conditions on the surfacebeyond what it was built and tested to withstand .
" Wepassed the warranty a long time ago , " Goldstein said .
Thebuild - up of frost is part of the problem .
While the amount of ice reaching downto Phoenix 's latitude may only be a thin layer , it could also be enough toencase the lander in ice .
Phoenix 's engineering team tested the lander ' ssurvivability under many scenarios , but " that was a test I refused to doduring development , survivability if encased in CO2 ice , " Goldstein said .
( " I was going to call that the Ted Williams test , " he joked , referring to the legendary Boston Red Sox player who had his body cryogenicallyfrozen after he died . )
But evenwithout being entombed in carbon dioxide ice , Phoenix likely wo n't survive theharsh winter because even in the summer , the lander needs heaters to keep itselectronics warm enough to function .
Phoenix 's circuit boards and wiring aregenerally regulated to about - 40 degrees Fahrenheit ( - 40 degrees Celsius ) foroptimum performance .
" Sowill they survive past that ?
Yeah they will , but at some point they 're going toget so cold that they wo n't survive , " Goldstein said .
Mostelectronics can only last down to about - 148 or - 193 F ( - 100 or - 125 C ) , afterwhich some of the materials that make them up go below their glassificationtemperature .
Goldsteinexplains glassification this way : " Think about a rubbery substance or aplastic substance becoming brittle like glass , and once that happens , it startsto crack , " Goldstein said .
If Phoenix 's electronic components crack , it 's unlikely the lander will be able to resurrectitself even when sunlight returns to the northern hemisphere in the spring .
" Thekind of temperatures we 're talking about with no energy to keep the vehiclewarm , it 's pretty difficult to imagine , " Goldstein said .
Come springon Mars ( summer on Earth , as the Martian year is longer ) , when sunlight has been streaming down long enough topotentially re-awaken the spacecraft , NASA will likely listen for any beepscoming from Phoenix , though Goldstein does n't think they 'll hear anything .
Soonce Phoenix dips below its energy threshold around the end of November , thatwill likely be all she wrote for the mission .
" It 'sa fun project but we 're getting near the end , " Goldstein said .
Five scientists had to evacuate a remote research camp in northern Alaska last week to escape a new threat : a polar bear stuck on the land because of the warmer global climate .
Polar bears normally lumber around out on the Arctic sea ice at this time of year , hunting seals for dinner .
But recent warming has kept the ice miles away from shore , so the polar bears are land - locked and unable to reach their prey .
Just what their condition is or how dangerous the bears are around humans is unknown , so the scientists decided on July 30 to leave their camp when one was spotted nearby .
" We saw the polar bear on our first clear day after several days of poor weather , " said Joe Liebezeit , a conservation scientist for the New York - based Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) .
" The bear did n't come near us , but the prospect of maintaining a round - the - clock vigil while trying to do our surveys had us concerned . "
The WCS team was on the shorelines north of Teshekpuk Lake on the Beaufort Sea studying the feeding of shorebirds before their southward migrations .
These shorelines have experienced dramatic erosion as the climate has warmed .
The scientists were working to understand how this erosion affects the ability of the shorebirds to get enough food energy before they migrated to Asia , South America and other distant sites .
" It is ironic that our efforts to understand how climate change is affecting wildlife were disrupted by the top Arctic predator displaced by climate , " said Steve Zack , also of the WCS .
Polar bears were recently added to the Endangered Species List because of the potential danger that global warming poses to their habitat .
Arctic sea ice extent hit a record low last summer ; average sea ice extent at the end of the summer was 1.65 million square miles ( 4.28 million square kilometers ) , almost 30 percent lower than the previous record low .

American politician and military officer
For other people named John McCain , see John McCain ( disambiguation )
John Sidney McCain III ( August 29 , 1936 – August 25 , 2018 ) was an American politician and US Navy officer , who served as a United States Senator for Arizona from 1987 until his death in 2018 .
He previously served two terms in the United States House of Representatives and was the Republican nominee for president of the United States in the 2008 election , which he lost to Barack Obama .
McCain graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1958 and received a commission in the United States Navy .
He became a naval aviator and flew ground - attack aircraft from aircraft carriers .
During the Vietnam War , McCain almost died in the 1967 USS Forrestal fire .
While on a bombing mission during Operation Rolling Thunder over Hanoi in October 1967 , he was shot down , seriously injured , and captured by the North Vietnamese .
McCain was a prisoner of war until 1973 .
He experienced episodes of torture and refused an out - of - sequence early release .
During the war , McCain sustained wounds that left him with lifelong physical disabilities .
He retired from the Navy as a captain in 1981 and moved to Arizona , where he entered politics .
In 1982 , McCain was elected to the United States House of Representatives , where he served two terms .
He entered the U.S. Senate in 1987 and easily won reelection five times .
While generally adhering to conservative principles , McCain also had a reputation as a " maverick " for his willingness to break from his party on certain issues .
His supportive stances on LGBT rights , gun regulations , and campaign finance reform were significantly more liberal than those of the party 's base .
McCain was investigated and largely exonerated in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as one of the Keating Five ; he then made regulating the financing of political campaigns one of his signature concerns , which eventually resulted in passage of the McCain–Feingold Act in 2002 .
He was also known for his work in the 1990s to restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam .
McCain chaired the Senate Commerce Committee from 1997 to 2001 and 2003 to 2005 , where he opposed pork barrel spending .
He belonged to the bipartisan " Gang of 14 " , which played a key role in alleviating a crisis over judicial nominations .
McCain entered the race for the Republican nomination for president in 2000 but lost a heated primary season contest to Governor George W. Bush of Texas .
He secured the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 but lost the general election .
McCain subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative stances and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration , especially with regard to foreign policy matters .
In 2015 , he became Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
He refused to support then - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in 2016 .
While McCain opposed the Affordable Care Act , he cast the deciding vote against the ACA - repealing American Health Care Act of 2017 .
After being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2017 , McCain reduced his role in the Senate in order to focus on treatment .
He died on August 25 , 2018 , at age 81 .
Following his death , McCain lay in state in the Arizona State Capitol rotunda and then in the United States Capitol rotunda .
His funeral was televised from the Washington National Cathedral , with former U.S. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama giving eulogies .
Early life and military career , 1936 –1981
Early life and education
John Sidney McCain III was born on August 29 , 1936 , at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone , to naval officer John S. McCain Jr. and Roberta ( Wright ) McCain .
He had an older sister Sandy and a younger brother Joe . [ 1 ]
At that time , the Panama Canal was under U.S. control . [ 2 ]
McCain 's family tree includes Scots - Irish and English ancestors . [ 3 ]
His great - great - great grandparents owned High Rock Farm , a plantation in Rockingham County , North Carolina . [ 4 ]
His father and his paternal grandfather , John S. McCain Sr. , were also Naval Academy graduates and both became four - star admirals in the United States Navy .
[ 5 ]
The McCain family moved with their father as he took various naval postings in the United States and in the Pacific . [ 1 ] [ 6 ]
As a result , he attended a total of about 20 schools .
[ 7 ]
In 1951 , the family settled in Northern Virginia , and McCain attended Episcopal High School , a private preparatory boarding school in Alexandria . [ 8 ] [ 9 ]
He excelled at wrestling and graduated in 1954 . [ 10 ] [ 11 ]
He referred to himself as an Episcopalian as recently as June 2007 , after which date he said he came to identify as a Baptist . [ 12 ]
Following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather , McCain entered the United States Naval Academy , where he was a friend and informal leader for many of his classmates [ 13 ] and sometimes stood up for targets of bullying .
[ 5 ]
He also fought as a lightweight boxer . [ 14 ]
McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him , such as literature and history , but studied only enough to pass subjects that gave him difficulty , such as mathematics . [ 5 ] [ 15 ]
He came into conflict with higher - ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules , which contributed to a low class rank ( 894 of 899 ) , despite a high IQ . [ 13 ] [ 16 ] McCain graduated in 1958 . [ 13 ]
Naval training , first marriage , and Vietnam War assignment
McCain began his early military career when he was commissioned as an ensign and started two and a half years of training at Pensacola to become a naval aviator . [ 17 ]
While there , he earned a reputation as a man who partied .
[ 7 ]
He completed flight school in 1960 and became a naval pilot of ground - attack aircraft ; he was assigned to A - 1 Skyraider squadrons [ 18 ] aboard the aircraft carriers USS Intrepid and USS Enterprise [ 19 ] in the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas . [ 20 ] McCain began as a sub- par flier [ 20 ] who was at times careless and reckless ; [ 21 ] during the early to mid-1960s , two of his flight missions crashed and a third mission collided with power lines , but he received no major injuries . [ 21 ]
His aviation skills improved over time , [ 20 ] and he was seen as a good pilot , albeit one who tended to " push the envelope " in his flying . [ 21 ]
On July 3 , 1965 , McCain was 28 when he married Carol Shepp , who had worked as a runway model and secretary . [ 22 ]
McCain adopted her two young children Douglas and Andrew . [ 19 ] [ 23 ]
He and Carol then had a daughter whom they named Sidney . [ 24 ] [ 25 ]
McCain requested a combat assignment [ 26 ] and was assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal flying A - 4 Skyhawks . [ 27 ]
His combat duty began when he was 30 years old in mid-1967 , when Forrestal was assigned to a bombing campaign , Operation Rolling Thunder , during the Vietnam War . [ 22 ] [ 28 ]
Stationed in the Gulf of Tonkin , McCain and his fellow pilots became frustrated by micromanagement from Washington , and he later wrote , " In all candor , we thought our civilian commanders were complete idiots who did n't have the least notion of what it took to win the war . " [ 28 ] [ 29 ]
On July 29 , 1967 , McCain was a lieutenant commander when he was near the center of the USS Forrestal fire .
He escaped from his burning jet and was trying to help another pilot escape when a bomb exploded ; [ 30 ] McCain was struck in the legs and chest by fragments . [ 31 ]
The ensuing fire killed 134 sailors and took 24 hours to control . [ 32 ] [ 33 ]
With the Forrestal out of commission , McCain volunteered for assignment with the USS Oriskany , another aircraft carrier employed in Operation Rolling Thunder . [ 34 ]
There he was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal and the Bronze Star Medal for missions flown over North Vietnam . [ 35 ]
Prisoner of war
McCain was taken prisoner of war on October 26 , 1967 .
He was flying his 23rd bombing mission over North Vietnam when his A - 4E Skyhawk was shot down by a missile over Hanoi . [ 36 ] [ 37 ]
McCain fractured both arms and a leg when he ejected from the aircraft [ 38 ] and nearly drowned after he parachuted into Trúc Bạch Lake .
Some North Vietnamese pulled him ashore , then others crushed his shoulder with a rifle butt and bayoneted him . [ 36 ]
McCain was then transported to Hanoi 's main Hỏa Lò Prison , nicknamed the " Hanoi Hilton " . [ 37 ]
Although McCain was seriously wounded and injured , his captors refused to treat him .
They beat and interrogated him to get information , and he was given medical care only when the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was an admiral . [ 39 ]
His status as a prisoner of war ( POW ) made the front pages of major American newspapers . [ 40 ] [ 41 ]
McCain spent six weeks in the hospital , where he received marginal care .
He had lost 50 pounds ( 23 kg ) , he was in a chest cast , and his gray hair had turned white . [ 36 ]
McCain was sent to a different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi . [ 42 ]
In December 1967 , McCain was placed in a cell with two other Americans who did not expect him to live more than a week . [ 43 ]
In March 1968 , McCain was placed into solitary confinement , where he remained for two years . [ 44 ]
In mid-1968 , his father John S. McCain Jr. was named commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater , and the North Vietnamese offered McCain early release [ 45 ] because they wanted to appear merciful for propaganda purposes [ 46 ] and also to show other POWs that elite prisoners were willing to be treated preferentially . [ 45 ]
McCain refused repatriation unless every man taken in before him was also released .
Such early release was prohibited by the POWs ' interpretation of the military Code of Conduct which states in Article III : " I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy " . [ 47 ]
To prevent the enemy from using prisoners for propaganda , officers were to agree to be released in the order in which they were captured . [ 36 ]
Beginning in August 1968 , McCain was subjected to a program of severe torture . [ 48 ]
He was bound and beaten every two hours ; this punishment occurred at the same time that he was suffering from heat and dysentery . [ 36 ] [ 48 ]
Further injuries brought McCain to " the point of suicide " , but his preparations were interrupted by guards .
Eventually , McCain made an anti-U.S. propaganda " confession " . [ 36 ]
He had always felt that his statement was dishonorable , but as he later wrote , " I had learned what we all learned over there : every man has his breaking point .
I had reached mine . " [ 49 ] [ 50 ]
Many U.S. POWs were tortured and maltreated in order to extract " confessions " and propaganda statements ; [ 51 ] virtually all of them eventually yielded something to their captors .
[ 52 ]
McCain received two to three beatings weekly because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements . [ 53 ]
McCain refused to meet various anti-war groups seeking peace in Hanoi , wanting to give neither them nor the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory . [ 54 ]
From late 1969 , treatment of McCain and many of the other POWs became more tolerable , [ 55 ] while McCain continued to resist the camp authorities . [ 56 ]
McCain and other prisoners cheered the U.S. " Christmas Bombing " campaign of December 1972 , viewing it as a forceful measure to push North Vietnam to terms . [ 50 ] [ 57 ]
McCain was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years until his release on March 14 , 1973 , along with 108 other prisoners of war . [ 58 ]
His wartime injuries left him permanently incapable of raising his arms above his head . [ 59 ]
After the war , McCain returned to the site with his wife Cindy and family on a few occasions to try to come to terms with what had happened to him there during his capture . [ 60 ]
Commanding officer , liaison to Senate and second marriage
McCain was reunited with his family when he returned to the United States .
His wife Carol had been severely injured by an automobile accident in December 1969 .
She was then four inches shorter , in a wheelchair or on crutches , and substantially heavier than when he had last seen her .
As a returned POW , he became a celebrity of sorts . [ 61 ]

McCain underwent treatment for his injuries that included months of physical therapy . [ 62 ]
He attended the National War College at Fort McNair in Washington , D.C. during 1973 – 1974 . [ 63 ]
He was rehabilitated by late 1974 and his flight status was reinstated .
In 1976 , he became Commanding Officer of a training squadron that was stationed in Florida . [ 61 ] [ 64 ]
He improved the unit 's flight readiness and safety records , [ 65 ] and won the squadron its first - ever Meritorious Unit Commendation . [ 64 ]
During this period in Florida , he had extramarital affairs and his marriage began to falter , about which he later stated , " The blame was entirely mine " . [ 66 ] [ 67 ]
McCain served as the Navy 's liaison to the U.S. Senate beginning in 1977 . [ 68 ]
In retrospect , he said that this represented his " real entry into the world of politics and the beginning of my second career as a public servant . " [ 61 ]
His key behind - the - scenes role gained congressional financing for a new supercarrier against the wishes of the Carter administration . [ 62 ] [ 69 ]
In April 1979 , [ 62 ] McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley , a teacher from Phoenix , Arizona , whose father had founded a large beer distributorship . [ 67 ]
They began dating , and he urged his wife Carol to grant him a divorce , which she did in February 1980 ; the uncontested divorce took effect in April 1980 . [ 23 ] [ 62 ]
The settlement included two houses , and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident ; they remained on good terms . [ 67 ]
McCain and Hensley were married on May 17 , 1980 , with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart attending as groomsmen . [ 22 ] [ 67 ]
McCain 's children did not attend , and several years passed before they reconciled . [ 25 ] [ 62 ]
John and Cindy McCain entered into a prenuptial agreement that kept most of her family 's assets under her name ; they kept their finances apart and filed separate income tax returns . [ 70 ]
The residence of John and Cindy McCain in Phoenix , Arizona
McCain decided to leave the Navy .
It was doubtful whether he would ever be promoted to the rank of full admiral , as he had poor annual physicals and had not been given a major sea command . [ 71 ]
His chances of being promoted to rear admiral were better , but he declined that prospect , as he had already made plans to run for Congress and said he could " do more good there . " [ 72 ] [ 73 ]
McCain retired from the Navy as a captain on April 1 , 1981 . [ 35 ] [ 74 ]
He was designated as disabled and awarded a disability pension . [ 75 ]
Upon leaving the military , he moved to Arizona .
His numerous military decorations and awards include the Silver Star , two Legion of Merits , Distinguished Flying Cross , three Bronze Star Medals , two Purple Hearts , two Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals , and the Prisoner of War Medal . [ 35 ]
House and Senate elections and career , 1982 –2000
U.S. Representative
McCain set his sights on becoming a representative because he was interested in current events , was ready for a new challenge , and had developed political ambitions during his time as Senate liaison . [ 67 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ]
Living in Phoenix , he went to work for Hensley & Co. , his new father - in - law Jim Hensley 's large Anheuser - Busch beer distributorship . [ 67 ]
As vice president of public relations at the distributorship , he gained political support among the local business community , meeting powerful figures such as banker Charles Keating Jr. , real estate developer Fife Symington III ( later Governor of Arizona ) and newspaper publisher Darrow " Duke " Tully . [ 68 ]
In 1982 , McCain ran as a Republican for an open seat in Arizona 's 1st congressional district , which was being vacated by 30 - year incumbent Republican John Jacob Rhodes . [ 78 ]
A newcomer to the state , McCain was hit with charges of being a carpetbagger . [ 67 ]
McCain responded to a voter making that charge with what a Phoenix Gazette columnist later described as " the most devastating response to a potentially troublesome political issue I 've ever heard " : [ 67 ]
Listen , pal .
I spent 22 years in the Navy .
My father was in the Navy .
My grandfather was in the Navy .
We in the military service tend to move a lot .
We have to live in all parts of the country , all parts of the world .
I wish I could have had the luxury , like you , of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the First District of Arizona , but I was doing other things .
As a matter of fact , when I think about it now , the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi . [ 67 ] [ 79 ]
McCain won a highly contested primary election with the assistance of local political endorsements , his Washington connections , and money that his wife lent to his campaign . [ 67 ] [ 68 ]
He then easily won the general election in the heavily Republican district . [ 67 ]
In 1983 , McCain was elected to lead the incoming group of Republican representatives , [ 67 ] and was assigned to the House Committee on Interior Affairs .
Also that year , he opposed creation of a federal Martin Luther King Jr. Day , but admitted in 2008 : " I was wrong and eventually realized that , in time to give full support [ in 1990 ] for a state holiday in Arizona . " [ 80 ] [ 81 ]
At this point , McCain 's politics were mainly in line with those of President Ronald Reagan ; this included support for Reaganomics , and he was active on Indian Affairs bills . [ 82 ]
He supported most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration , including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts , such as backing the Contras in Nicaragua . [ 82 ]
McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon , citing unattainable objectives , and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late ; in the interim , the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds . [ 67 ] [ 83 ]
McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984 , [ 67 ] and gained a spot on the House Foreign Affairs Committee . [ 84 ]
In 1985 , he made his first return trip to Vietnam , [ 85 ] and also traveled to Chile where he met with its military junta ruler , General Augusto Pinochet . [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 88 ]
Growing family
In 1984 , McCain and Cindy had their first child , daughter Meghan , followed two years later by son John IV and in 1988 by son James . [ 89 ]
In 1991 , Cindy brought an abandoned three - month - old girl needing medical treatment to the U.S. from a Bangladeshi orphanage run by Mother Teresa . [ 90 ]
The McCains decided to adopt her and she was named Bridget . [ 91 ]
First two terms in the U.S. Senate
McCain's Senate career began in January 1987 , after he defeated his Democratic opponent , former state legislator Richard Kimball , by 20 percentage points in the 1986 election . [ 68 ] [ 92 ]
McCain succeeded longtime American conservative icon and Arizona fixture Barry Goldwater upon the latter 's retirement as U.S. senator from Arizona . [ 92 ]
In January 1988 , McCain voted in favor of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 , [ 93 ] and voted to override President Reagan 's veto of that legislation the following March . [ 94 ]
Senator McCain became a member of the Armed Services Committee , with which he had formerly done his Navy liaison work ; he also joined the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee . [ 92 ]
He continued to support the Native American agenda . [ 95 ]
As first a House member and then a senator — and as a lifelong gambler with close ties to the gambling industry [ 96 ]
— McCain was one of the main authors of the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act , [ 97 ] [ 98 ] which codified rules regarding Native American gambling enterprises . [ 99 ]
McCain was also a strong supporter of the Gramm - Rudman legislation that enforced automatic spending cuts in the case of budget deficits .
[ 100 ]
McCain soon gained national visibility .
He delivered a well - received speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention , was mentioned by the press as a short list vice - presidential running mate for Republican nominee George H. W. Bush , and was named chairman of Veterans for Bush . [ 92 ] [ 101 ]
McCain became embroiled in a scandal during the 1980s , as one of five United States senators comprising the so - called Keating Five . [ 102 ]
Between 1982 and 1987 , McCain had received $ 112,000 in lawful [ 103 ] political contributions from Charles Keating Jr. and his associates at Lincoln Savings and Loan Association , along with trips on Keating 's jets [ 102 ] that McCain belatedly repaid , in 1989 .
[ 104 ]
In 1987 , McCain was one of the five senators whom Keating contacted in order to prevent the government 's seizure of Lincoln , and McCain met twice with federal regulators to discuss the government 's investigation of Lincoln . [ 102 ]
In 1999 , McCain said : " The appearance of it was wrong .
It 's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators , because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence .
And it was the wrong thing to do . " [ 105 ]
In the end , McCain was cleared by the Senate Ethics Committee of acting improperly or violating any law or Senate rule , but was mildly rebuked for exercising " poor judgment " .
[ 103 ] [ 105 ] [ 106 ]
In his 1992 re-election bid , the Keating Five affair was not a major issue , [ 107 ] and he won handily , gaining 56 percent of the vote to defeat Democratic community and civil rights activist Claire Sargent and independent former governor , Evan Mecham . [ 108 ]
Political Independence
McCain developed a reputation for independence during the 1990s . [ 109 ]
He took pride in challenging party leadership and establishment forces , becoming difficult to categorize politically . [ 109 ]
As a member of the 1991 –1993 Senate Select Committee on POW / MIA Affairs , chaired by fellow Vietnam War veteran and Democrat , John Kerry , McCain investigated the Vietnam War POW / MIA issue , to determine the fate of U.S. service personnel listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War . [ 110 ]
The committee 's unanimous report stated there was " no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia . " [ 111 ]
Helped by McCain 's efforts , in 1995 the U.S. normalized diplomatic relations with Vietnam . [ 112 ]
McCain was vilified by some POW / MIA activists who , despite the committee 's unanimous report , believed large numbers of Americans were still held against their will in Southeast Asia . [ 112 ] [ 113 ] [ 114 ]
From January 1993 until his death , McCain was Chairman of the International Republican Institute , an organization partly funded by the U.S. government that supports the emergence of political democracy worldwide . [ 115 ]
In 1993 and 1994 , McCain voted to confirm President Clinton 's nominees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg whom he considered to be qualified for the U.S. Supreme Court .
He later explained that " under our Constitution , it is the president 's call to make . " [ 116 ] McCain had also voted to confirm nominees of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush , including Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas . [ 117 ]
Campaign Finance Reform
McCain attacked what he saw as the corrupting influence of large political contributions — from corporations , labor unions , other organizations , and wealthy individuals — and he made this his signature issue . [ 118 ]
Starting in 1994 , he worked with Democratic Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold on campaign finance reform ; their McCain–Feingold bill attempted to put limits on " soft money " .
[ 118 ]
The efforts of McCain and Feingold were opposed by some of the moneyed interests targeted , by incumbents in both parties , by those who felt spending limits impinged on free political speech and might be unconstitutional as well , and by those who wanted to counterbalance the power of what they saw as media bias .
[ 118 ] [ 119 ]
Despite sympathetic coverage in the media , initial versions of the McCain–Feingold
Act were filibustered and never came to a vote . [ 120 ]
The term " maverick Republican " became a label frequently applied to McCain , and he also used it himself .
[ 118 ] [ 121 ] [ 122 ]
In 1993 , McCain opposed military operations in Somalia . [ 123 ]
Another target of his was pork barrel spending by Congress , and he actively supported the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 , which gave the president power to veto individual spending items [ 118 ] but was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1998 . [ 124 ]
In the 1996 presidential election , McCain was again on the short list of possible vice - presidential picks , this time for Republican nominee Bob Dole . [ 107 ] [ 125 ]
The following year , Time magazine named McCain as one of the " 25 Most Influential People in America " . [ 126 ]
In 1997 , McCain became chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee ; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee 's purview , but in response said the small contributions he received were not part of the big - money nature of the campaign finance problem . [ 118 ]
McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998 , proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns , discourage teenage smokers , increase money for health research studies , and help states pay for smoking - related health care costs .
[ 118 ] [ 127 ]
Supported by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans , the bill failed to gain cloture . [ 127 ]
Start of third term in the U.S. Senate
In November 1998 , McCain won re-election to a third Senate term ; he prevailed in a landslide over his Democratic opponent , environmental lawyer Ed Ranger . [ 118 ]
In the February 1999 Senate trial following the impeachment of Bill Clinton , McCain voted to convict the president on both the perjury and obstruction of justice counts , saying Clinton had violated his sworn oath of office . [ 128 ]
In March 1999 , McCain voted to approve the NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , saying that the ongoing genocide of the Kosovo War must be stopped and criticizing past Clinton administration inaction . [ 129 ]
Later in 1999 , McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Feingold for their work in trying to enact their campaign finance reform , [ 130 ] although the bill was still failing repeated attempts to gain cloture . [ 120 ]
In August 1999 , McCain 's memoir Faith of My Fathers , co-authored with Mark Salter , was published ; [ 131 ] a reviewer observed that its appearance " seems to have been timed to the unfolding Presidential campaign . " [ 132 ]
The most successful of his writings , it received positive reviews , [ 133 ] became a bestseller , [ 134 ] and was later made into a TV film . [ 135 ]
The book traces McCain 's family background and childhood , covers his time at Annapolis and his service before and during the Vietnam War , concluding with his release from captivity in 1973 .
According to one reviewer , it describes " the kind of challenges that most of us can barely imagine .
It 's a fascinating history of a remarkable military family . " [ 136 ]
2000 presidential campaign
McCain announced his candidacy for president on September 27 , 1999 , in Nashua , New Hampshire , saying he was staging " a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests , and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve " .
[ 131 ] [ 137 ]
The frontrunner for the Republican nomination was Texas Governor George W. Bush , who had the political and financial support of most of the party establishment . [ 138 ]
McCain focused on the New Hampshire primary , where his message appealed to independents . [ 139 ]
He traveled on a campaign bus called the Straight Talk Express . [ 131 ]
He held many town hall meetings , answering every question voters asked , in a successful example of " retail politics " , and he used free media to compensate for his lack of funds .
[ 131 ]
One reporter later recounted that , " McCain talked all day long with reporters on his Straight Talk Express bus ; he talked so much that sometimes he said things that he should n't have , and that 's why the media loved him . " [ 140 ]
On February 1 , 2000 , he won New Hampshire 's primary with 49 percent of the vote to Bush 's 30 percent .
The Bush campaign and the Republican establishment feared that a McCain victory in the crucial South Carolina primary might give his campaign unstoppable momentum . [ 131 ] [ 141 ]
The Arizona Republic wrote that the McCain–Bush primary contest in South Carolina " has entered national political lore as a low - water mark in presidential campaigns " , while The New York Times called it " a painful symbol of the brutality of American politics " .
[ 131 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ]
A variety of interest groups , which McCain had challenged in the past , ran negative ads . [ 131 ] [ 145 ]
Bush borrowed McCain 's earlier language of reform , [ 146 ] and declined to dissociate himself from a veterans activist who accused McCain ( in Bush 's presence ) of having " abandoned the veterans " on POW / MIA and Agent Orange issues . [ 131 ] [ 147 ]
Incensed , [ 147 ]
McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton , which Bush said was " about as low a blow as you can give in a Republican primary " .
[ 131 ]
An anonymous smear campaign began against McCain , delivered by push polls , faxes , e-mails , flyers , and audience plants . [ 131 ] [ 148 ]
The smears claimed that McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock ( the McCains ' dark - skinned daughter was adopted from Bangladesh ) , that his wife Cindy was a drug addict , that he was a homosexual , and that he was a " Manchurian Candidate " who was either a traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days .
[ 131 ] [ 143 ]
The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with the attacks . [ 143 ] [ 149 ]
McCain lost South Carolina on February 19 , with 42 percent of the vote to Bush 's 53 percent , [ 150 ] in part because Bush mobilized the state 's evangelical voters [ 131 ] [ 151 ] and outspent McCain . [ 152 ]
The win allowed Bush to regain lost momentum .
[ 150 ] McCain said of the rumor spreaders , " I believe that there is a special place in hell for people like those . " [ 91 ]
According to one acquaintance , the South Carolina experience left him in a " very dark place " . [ 143 ]
McCain 's campaign never completely recovered from his South Carolina defeat , although he did rebound partially by winning in Arizona and Michigan a few days later . [ 153 ]
He made a speech in Virginia Beach that criticized Christian leaders , including Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell , as divisive conservatives , [ 143 ] declaring " ... we embrace the fine members of the religious conservative community .
But that does not mean that we will pander to their self - appointed leaders . " [ 154 ]
McCain lost the Virginia primary on February 29 , [ 155 ] and on March 7 lost nine of the thirteen primaries on Super Tuesday to Bush . [ 156 ]
With little hope of overcoming Bush 's delegate lead , McCain withdrew from the race on March 9 , 2000 . [ 157 ]
He endorsed Bush two months later , [ 158 ] and made occasional appearances with the Texas governor during the general election campaign . [ 131 ]
Senate career , 2000 –2008
Remainder of third Senate term
McCain began 2001 by breaking with the new George W. Bush administration on a number of matters , including HMO reform , climate change , and gun control legislation ; McCain–Feingold was opposed by Bush as well .
[ 120 ] [ 159 ]
In May 2001 , McCain was one of only two Senate Republicans to vote against the Bush tax cuts . [ 159 ] [ 160 ]
Besides the differences with Bush on ideological grounds , there was considerable antagonism between the two remaining from the previous year 's campaign . [ 161 ] [ 162 ]
Later , when a Republican senator , Jim Jeffords , became an Independent , thereby throwing control of the Senate to the Democrats , McCain defended Jeffords against " self - appointed enforcers of party loyalty " .
[ 159 ]
Indeed , there was speculation at the time , and in years since , about McCain himself leaving the Republican Party , but McCain had always adamantly denied that he ever considered doing so .
[ 159 ] [ 163 ] [ 164 ]
Beginning in 2001 , McCain used political capital gained from his presidential run , as well as improved legislative skills and relationships with other members , to become one of the Senate 's most influential members . [ 165 ]
After the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , McCain supported Bush and the U.S. - led war in Afghanistan . [ 159 ] [ 166 ]
He and Democratic senator Joe Lieberman wrote the legislation that created the 9/11 Commission , [ 167 ] while he and Democratic senator Fritz Hollings co-sponsored the Aviation and Transportation Security
Act that federalized airport security . [ 168 ]
In March 2002 , McCain–Feingold , officially known as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 , passed in both Houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Bush . [ 120 ] [ 159 ]
Seven years in the making , it was McCain 's greatest legislative achievement . [ 159 ] [ 169 ]
[ 118 ] McCain 's Senate website from 2003 to 2006 illustrated his concern about pork barrel spending .
Meanwhile , in discussions over proposed U.S. action against Iraq , McCain was a strong supporter of the Bush administration 's position . [ 159 ]
He stated that Iraq was " a clear and present danger to the United States of America " , and voted accordingly for the Iraq War Resolution in October 2002 . [ 159 ]
He predicted that U.S. forces would be treated as liberators by a large number of the Iraqi people .
[ 170 ]
In May 2003 , McCain voted against the second round of Bush tax cuts , saying it was unwise at a time of war . [ 160 ]
By November 2003 , after a trip to Iraq , he was publicly questioning Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , saying that more U.S. troops were needed ; the following year , McCain announced that he had lost confidence in Rumsfeld . [ 171 ] [ 172 ]
In October 2003 , McCain and Lieberman co-sponsored the Climate Stewardship
Act that would have introduced a cap and trade system aimed at returning greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels ; the bill was defeated with 55 votes to 43 in the Senate . [ 173 ]
They reintroduced modified versions of the Act two additional times , for the final time in January 2007 with the co-sponsorship of Barack Obama , among others . [ 174 ]
In the 2004 U.S. presidential election campaign , McCain was once again frequently mentioned for the vice - presidential slot , only this time as part of the Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry . [ 175 ] [ 176 ] [ 177 ]
McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had .
[ 176 ] [ 177 ] [ 178 ]
At the 2004 Republican National Convention , McCain supported Bush for re-election , praising Bush 's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks .
[ 179 ]
At the same time , he defended Kerry 's Vietnam War record . [ 180 ]
By August 2004 , McCain had the best favorable - to - unfavorable rating ( 55 percent to 19 percent ) of any national politician ; [ 179 ] he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously , though the two remained situational allies rather than friends . [ 161 ]
McCain was also up for re-election as senator , in 2004 .
He defeated little - known Democratic schoolteacher Stuart Starky with his biggest margin of victory , garnering 77 percent of the vote . [ 181 ]
Start of fourth Senate term
In May 2005 , McCain led the so - called Gang of 14 in the Senate , which established a compromise that preserved the ability of senators to filibuster judicial nominees , but only in " extraordinary circumstances " .
[ 182 ]
The compromise took the steam out of the filibuster movement , but some Republicans remained disappointed that the compromise did not eliminate filibusters of judicial nominees in all circumstances .
[ 183 ]
McCain subsequently cast Supreme Court confirmation votes in favor of John Roberts and Samuel Alito , calling them " two of the finest justices ever appointed to the United States Supreme Court . " [ 117 ]
McCain speaks on the Senate floor against earmarking , February 2007 .
Breaking from his 2001 and 2003 votes , McCain supported the Bush tax cut extension in May 2006 , saying not to do so would amount to a tax increase . [ 160 ]
Working with Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy , McCain was a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform , which would involve legalization , guest worker programs , and border enforcement components .
The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act was never voted on in 2005 , while the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 passed the Senate in May 2006 but failed in the House . [ 172 ]
In June 2007 , President Bush , McCain , and others made the strongest push yet for such a bill , the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 , but it aroused intense grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others , some of whom furiously characterized the proposal as an " amnesty " program , [ 184 ] and the bill twice failed to gain cloture in the Senate . [ 185 ]
By the middle of the 2000s ( decade ) , the increased Indian gaming that McCain had helped bring about was a $ 23 billion industry . [ 98 ]
He was twice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee , in 1995 – 1997 and 2005 –2007 , and his Committee helped expose the Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal . [ 186 ] [ 187 ]
By 2005 and 2006 , McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory
Act which would have limited creation of off - reservation casinos , [ 98 ] and also limited the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos . [ 188 ]
Owing to his time as a POW , McCain was recognized for his sensitivity to the detention and interrogation of detainees in the War on Terror .
An opponent of the Bush administration 's use of torture and detention without trial at Guantánamo Bay , saying : " some of these guys are terrible , terrible killers and the worst kind of scum of humanity .
But , one , they deserve to have some adjudication of their cases ... even Adolf Eichmann got a trial " .
[ 189 ]
In October 2005 , McCain introduced the McCain Detainee Amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill for 2005 , and the Senate voted 90 –9 to support the amendment .
[ 190 ]
It prohibits inhumane treatment of prisoners , including prisoners at Guantánamo , by confining military interrogations to the techniques in the U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation .
Although Bush had threatened to veto the bill if McCain 's amendment was included , [ 191 ] the President announced in December 2005 that he accepted McCain 's terms and would " make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture , whether it be here at home or abroad " .
[ 192 ]
This stance , among others , led to McCain being named by Time magazine in 2006 as one of America 's 10 Best Senators .
[ 193 ]
McCain voted in February 2008 against a bill containing a ban on waterboarding , [ 194 ] which provision was later narrowly passed and vetoed by Bush .
However , the bill in question contained other provisions to which McCain objected , and his spokesman stated : " This was n't a vote on waterboarding .
This was a vote on applying the standards of the [ Army ] field manual to CIA personnel . " [ 194 ]
Meanwhile , McCain continued questioning the progress of the war in Iraq .
In September 2005 , he remarked upon Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers ' optimistic outlook on the war 's progress : " Things have not gone as well as we had planned or expected , nor as we were told by you , General Myers . " [ 195 ]
In August 2006 , he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency : " We [ have ] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be . " [ 172 ]
From the beginning , McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007 .
[ 196 ]
The strategy 's opponents labeled it " McCain 's plan " [ 197 ] and University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said , " McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now . " [ 172 ]
The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year , even within the Republican Party , [ 198 ] as McCain 's presidential campaign was underway ; faced with the consequences , McCain frequently responded , " I would much rather lose a campaign than a war . " [ 199 ]
In March 2008 , McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq , as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began . [ 200 ]
2008 presidential campaign
McCain formally announced his intention to run for President of the United States on April 25 , 2007 , in Portsmouth , New Hampshire . [ 201 ]
He stated that : " I 'm not running for president to be somebody , but to do something ; to do the hard but necessary things , not the easy and needless things . " [ 202 ]
McCain 's oft - cited strengths as a presidential candidate for 2008 included national name recognition , sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives , his ability to reach across the aisle , his well - known military service and experience as a POW , his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign , and an expectation that he would capture Bush 's top fundraisers .
[ 203 ]
During the 2006 election cycle , McCain had attended 346 events [ 59 ] and helped raise more than $ 10.5 million on behalf of Republican candidates .
McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions , while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make .
[ 204 ]
Despite being considered the front - runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began , [ 205 ] McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed .
McCain had fundraising problems in the first half of 2007 , due in part to his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 , which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate . [ 206 ] [ 207 ]
Large - scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July , but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race .
[ 207 ]
Later that month , the candidate 's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed .
[ 208 ]
McCain slumped badly in national polls , often running third or fourth with 15 percent or less support .
The Arizona senator subsequently resumed his familiar position as a political underdog , [ 209 ] riding the Straight Talk Express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events .
[ 210 ]
By December 2007 , the Republican race was unsettled , with none of the top - tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major vulnerabilities with different elements of the Republican base electorate .
[ 211 ]
McCain was showing a resurgence , in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire — the scene of his 2000 triumph — and was bolstered further by the endorsements of The Boston Globe , the New Hampshire Union Leader , and almost two dozen other state newspapers , [ 212 ] as well as from Senator Lieberman ( now an Independent Democrat ) . [ 213 ] [ 214 ]
McCain decided not to campaign significantly in the January 3 , 2008 , Iowa caucuses , which saw a win by former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee .
McCain 's comeback plan paid off when he won the New Hampshire primary on January 8 , defeating former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney in a close contest , to once again become one of the front - runners in the race . [ 215 ]
In mid-January , McCain placed first in the South Carolina primary , narrowly defeating Mike Huckabee . [ 216 ]
Pundits credited the third - place finisher , Tennessee 's former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson , with drawing votes from Huckabee in South Carolina , thereby giving a narrow win to McCain . [ 217 ]
A week later , McCain won the Florida primary , [ 218 ] beating Romney again in a close contest ; Giuliani then dropped out and endorsed McCain . [ 219 ]
On February 5 , McCain won both the majority of states and delegates in the Super Tuesday Republican primaries , giving him a commanding lead toward the Republican nomination .
Romney departed from the race on February 7 . [ 220 ]
McCain 's wins in the March 4 primaries clinched a majority of the delegates , and he became the presumptive Republican nominee . [ 221 ]
McCain was born in the Panama Canal Zone .
Had he been elected , he would have become the first president who was born outside the contiguous forty - eight states .
This raised a potential legal issue , since the United States Constitution requires the president to be a natural - born citizen of the United States .
A bipartisan legal review , [ 222 ] and a unanimous but non-binding Senate resolution , [ 223 ] both concluded that he was a natural - born citizen .
If inaugurated in 2009 at the age of 72 years and 144 days , he would have been the oldest person to become president . [ 224 ]
McCain addressed concerns about his age and past health issues , stating in 2005 that his health was " excellent " .
[ 225 ]
He had been treated for melanoma and an operation in 2000 for that condition left a noticeable mark on the left side of his face . [ 226 ]
McCain 's prognosis appeared favorable , according to independent experts , especially because he had already survived without a recurrence for more than seven years . [ 226 ]
In May 2008 , McCain 's campaign briefly let the press review his medical records , and he was described as appearing cancer - free , having a strong heart , and in general being in good health . [ 227 ]
McCain clinched enough delegates for the nomination and his focus shifted toward the general election , while Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton fought a prolonged battle for the Democratic nomination .
[ 228 ]
McCain introduced various policy proposals , and sought to improve his fundraising . [ 229 ] [ 230 ]
Cindy McCain , who accounted for most of the couple 's wealth with an estimated net worth of $ 100 million , [ 70 ] made part of her tax returns public in May . [ 231 ]
After facing criticism about lobbyists on staff , the McCain campaign issued new rules in May 2008 to avoid conflicts of interest , causing five top aides to leave . [ 232 ] [ 233 ]
When Obama became the Democrats ' presumptive nominee in early June , McCain proposed joint town hall meetings , but Obama instead requested more traditional debates for the fall . [ 234 ]
In July , a staff shake - up put Steve Schmidt in full operational control of the McCain campaign . [ 235 ]
Rick Davis remained as campaign manager but with a reduced role .
Davis had also managed McCain 's 2000 presidential campaign ; in 2005 and 2006 , U.S. intelligence warned McCain 's Senate staff about Davis 's Russian links but gave no further warnings . [ 236 ] [ 237 ] [ 238 ] [ 239 ]
Throughout the summer of 2008 , Obama typically led McCain in national polls by single - digit margins , [ 240 ] and also led in several key swing states .
[ 241 ]
McCain reprised his familiar underdog role , which was due at least in part to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year .
[ 209 ] [ 241 ]
McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign , and the restrictions that go with it , while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976 . [ 242 ] [ 243 ]
The Republican 's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead , compared to Obama's . [ 244 ]
On August 29 , 2008 , McCain revealed Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his surprise choice for a running mate . [ 245 ]
McCain was only the second U.S. major - party presidential nominee ( after Walter Mondale , who chose Geraldine Ferraro ) to select a woman as his running mate and the first Republican to do so .
On September 3 , 2008 , McCain and Palin became the Republican Party 's presidential and vice presidential nominees at the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul , Minnesota .
McCain surged ahead of Obama in national polls following the convention , as the Palin pick energized core Republican voters who had previously been wary of him . [ 246 ]
However , by the campaign 's own later admission , the rollout of Palin to the national media went poorly , [ 247 ] and voter reactions to Palin grew increasingly negative , especially among independents and other voters concerned about her qualifications . [ 248 ]
McCain 's decision to choose Sarah Palin as his running mate was criticized ; New York Times journalist David Brooks said that " he took a disease that was running through the Republican party – anti-intellectualism , disrespect for facts – and he put it right at the centre of the party " .
[ 249 ]
Laura McGann in Vox says that McCain gave the " reality TV politics " and Tea Party movement more political legitimacy , as well as solidifying " the Republican Party 's comfort with a candidate who would say absurdities ... unleashing a political style and a values system that animated the Tea Party movement and laid the groundwork for a Trump presidency . " [ 250 ]
Although McCain later expressed regret for not choosing the independent Senator Joe Lieberman as his VP candidate instead , he consistently defended Palin 's performances at his events . [ 251 ]
On September 24 , McCain said he was temporarily suspending his campaign activities , called on Obama to join him , and proposed delaying the first of the general election debates with Obama , in order to work on the proposed U.S. financial system bailout before Congress , which was targeted at addressing the subprime mortgage crisis and the financial crisis of 2007 –2008 . [ 252 ] [ 253 ]
McCain 's intervention helped to give dissatisfied House Republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement . [ 254 ] [ 255 ]
After Obama declined McCain 's suspension suggestion , McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26 . [ 256 ]
On October 1 , McCain voted in favor of a revised $ 700 billion rescue plan . [ 257 ]
Another debate was held on October 7 ; like the first one , polls afterward suggested that Obama had won it . [ 258 ]
A final presidential debate occurred on October 15 . [ 259 ]
Down the stretch , McCain was outspent by Obama by a four - to - one margin . [ 260 ]
During and after the final debate , McCain compared Obama 's proposed policies to socialism and often invoked " Joe the Plumber " as a symbol of American small business dreams that would be thwarted by an Obama presidency . [ 261 ] [ 262 ]
He barred using the Jeremiah Wright controversy in ads against Obama , [ 263 ] but the campaign did frequently criticize Obama regarding his purported relationship with Bill Ayers . [ 264 ]
His rallies became increasingly vitriolic , [ 265 ] with attendees denigrating Obama and displaying a growing anti-Muslim and anti-African - American sentiment . [ 266 ]
During a campaign rally in Minnesota , Gayle Quinnell , a McCain supporter , told him she did not trust Obama because " he's an Arab " .
[ 267 ]
He replied , " No ma'am .
He 's a decent family man , citizen , that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues . " [ 266 ]
McCain 's response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as a marker for civility in American politics .
[ 265 ] [ 268 ]
Meghan McCain said that she cannot " go a day without someone bringing up ( that ) moment , " and noted that at the time " there were a lot of people really trying to get my dad to go ( against Obama ) with ... you 're a Muslim , you 're not an American aspect of that , " but that her father had refused .
" I can remember thinking that it was a morally amazing and beautiful moment , but that maybe there would be people in the Republican Party that would be quite angry , " she said . [ 269 ]
Results of the presidential election
The election took place on November 4 , and Barack Obama was declared the projected winner at about 11:00 pm Eastern Standard Time ; McCain delivered his concession speech in Phoenix , Arizona about twenty minutes later . [ 270 ]
In it , he noted the historic and special significance of Obama being elected the nation 's first African American president .
[ 270 ]
In the end , McCain won 173 electoral votes to Obama 's 365 ; [ 271 ]
McCain failed to win most of the battleground states and lost some traditionally Republican ones .
[ 272 ]
McCain gained 46 percent of the nationwide popular vote , compared to Obama 's 53 percent . [ 272 ]
Senate career after 2008
Remainder of fourth Senate term
Following his defeat , McCain returned to the Senate amid varying views about what role he might play there .
[ 273 ]
In mid-November 2008 he met with President - elect Obama , and the two discussed issues they had commonality on . [ 274 ]
Around the same time , McCain indicated that he intended to run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2010 .
[ 275 ]
As the inauguration neared , Obama consulted with McCain on a variety of matters , to an extent rarely seen between a president - elect and his defeated rival , [ 276 ] and President Obama 's inauguration speech contained an allusion to McCain 's theme of finding a purpose greater than oneself . [ 277 ]
U.S. President Barack Obama and McCain at a press conference in March 2009
Nevertheless , McCain emerged as a leader of the Republican opposition to the Obama economic stimulus package of 2009 , saying it had too much spending for too little stimulative effect .
[ 278 ]
McCain also voted against Obama 's Supreme Court nomination of Sonia Sotomayor — saying that while undeniably qualified , " I do not believe that she shares my belief in judicial restraint " [ 279 ] — and by August 2009 was siding more often with his Republican Party on closely divided votes than ever before in his senatorial career .
[ 280 ]
McCain reasserted that the War in Afghanistan was winnable [ 281 ] and criticized Obama for a slow process in deciding whether to send additional U.S. troops there . [ 282 ]
McCain also harshly criticized Obama for scrapping construction of the U.S. missile defense complex in Poland , declined to enter negotiations over climate change legislation similar to what he had proposed in the past , and strongly opposed the Obama health care plan . [ 282 ] [ 283 ]
McCain led a successful filibuster of a measure that would allow repeal of the military 's " Do n't ask , do n't tell " policy towards gays . [ 284 ]
Factors involved in McCain 's new direction included Senate staffers leaving , a renewed concern over national debt levels and the scope of federal government , a possible Republican primary challenge from conservatives in 2010 , and McCain 's campaign edge being slow to wear off .
[ 282 ] [ 283 ]
As one longtime McCain advisor said , " A lot of people , including me , thought he might be the Republican building bridges to the Obama Administration .
But he 's been more like the guy blowing up the bridges . " [ 282 ]
McCain in his Senate office , November 2010
In early 2010 , a primary challenge from radio talk show host and former U.S. Congressman J. D. Hayworth materialized in the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Arizona and drew support from some but not all elements of the Tea Party movement .
[ 285 ] [ 286 ]
With Hayworth using the campaign slogan " The Consistent Conservative " , McCain said — despite his own past use of the term on a number of occasions [ 286 ] [ 287 ] —
" I never considered myself a maverick .
I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities . " [ 288 ]
The primary challenge coincided with McCain reversing or muting his stance on some issues such as the bank bailouts , closing of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp , campaign finance restrictions , and gays in the military . [ 285 ]
When the health care plan , now called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , passed Congress and became law in March 2010 , McCain strongly opposed the landmark legislation not only on its merits but also on the way it had been handled in Congress .
As a consequence , he warned that congressional Republicans would not work with Democrats on anything else : " There will be no cooperation for the rest of the year .
They have poisoned the well in what they 've done and how they 've done it . " [ 289 ]
McCain became a vocal defender of Arizona SB 1070 , the April 2010 tough anti-illegal immigration state law that aroused national controversy , saying that the state had been forced to take action given the federal government 's inability to control the border . [ 286 ] [ 290 ]
In the August 24 primary , McCain beat Hayworth by a 56 to 32 percent margin . [ 291 ]
McCain proceeded to easily defeat Democratic Tucson city councilman Rodney Glassman in the general election . [ 292 ]
In the lame duck session of the 111th Congress , McCain voted for the compromise Tax Relief , Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization , and Job Creation Act of 2010 , [ 293 ] but against the DREAM Act ( which he had once sponsored ) and the New START Treaty . [ 294 ]
Most prominently , he continued to lead the eventually losing fight against " Do n't ask , do n't tell " repeal .
[ 295 ]
In his opposition , he sometimes fell into anger or hostility on the Senate floor , and called its passage " a very sad day " that would compromise the battle effectiveness of the military .
[ 294 ] [ 295 ]
Fifth Senate term
While control of the House of Representatives went over to the Republicans in the 112th Congress , the Senate stayed Democratic and McCain continued to be the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee .
As the Arab Spring took center stage , McCain urged that the embattled Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak , step down and thought the U.S. should push for democratic reforms in the region despite the associated risks of religious extremists gaining power . [ 296 ]
McCain was an especially vocal supporter of the 2011 military intervention in Libya .
In April of that year he visited the Anti-Gaddafi forces and National Transitional Council in Benghazi , the highest - ranking American to do so , and said that the rebel forces were " my heroes " .
[ 297 ]
In June , he joined with Senator Kerry in offering a resolution that would have authorized the military intervention , and said : " The administration 's disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive . " [ 298 ] [ 299 ]
In August , McCain voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011 that resolved the U.S. debt ceiling crisis .
[ 300 ]
In November , McCain and Senator Carl Levin were leaders in efforts to codify in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 that terrorism suspects , no matter where captured , could be detained by the U.S. military and its tribunal system ; following objections by civil libertarians , some Democrats , and the White House , McCain and Levin agreed to language making it clear that the bill would not pertain to U.S. citizens .
[ 301 ] [ 302 ]
In the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries , McCain endorsed former 2008 rival Mitt Romney and campaigned for him , but compared the contest to a Greek tragedy due to its drawn - out nature with massive super PAC - funded attack ads damaging all the contenders .
[ 303 ]
He labeled the Supreme Court 's 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision as " uninformed , arrogant , naïve " , and , decrying its effects and the future scandals he thought it would bring , said it would become considered the court 's " worst decision ... in the 21st century " .
[ 304 ]
McCain took the lead in opposing the defense spending sequestrations brought on by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and gained attention for defending State Department aide Huma Abedin against charges brought by a few House Republicans that she had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood . [ 305 ]
McCain continued to be one of the most frequently appearing guests on the Sunday morning news talk shows .
[ 305 ]
He became one of the most vocal critics of the Obama administration 's handling of the September 11 , 2012 , attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi , saying it was a " debacle " that featured either " a massive cover - up or incompetence that is not acceptable " and that it was worse than the Watergate scandal .
[ 307 ]
As an outgrowth of this strong opposition , he and a few other senators were successful in blocking the planned nomination of Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton as U.S. Secretary of State ; McCain 's friend and colleague John Kerry was nominated instead . [ 308 ]
Regarding the Syrian civil war that had begun in 2011 , McCain repeatedly argued for the U.S. intervening militarily in the conflict on the side of the anti-government forces .
He staged a visit to rebel forces inside Syria in May 2013 , the first senator to do so , and called for arming the Free Syrian Army with heavy weapons and for the establishment of a no - fly zone over the country .
Following reports that two of the people he posed for pictures with had been responsible for the kidnapping of eleven Lebanese Shiite pilgrims the year before , McCain disputed one of the identifications and said he had not met directly with the other . [ 309 ]
Following the 2013 Ghouta chemical weapons attack , McCain argued again for strong American military action against the government of the Syrian president , Bashar al - Assad , and in September 2013 cast a Foreign Relations committee vote in favor of Obama 's request to Congress that it authorize a military response .
[ 310 ]
McCain took the lead in criticizing a growing non-interventionist movement within the Republican Party , exemplified by his March 2013 comment that Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and Representative Justin Amash were " wacko birds " . [ 311 ]
During 2013 , McCain was a member of a bi-partisan group of senators , the " Gang of Eight " , which announced principles for another try at comprehensive immigration reform . [ 312 ]
The resulting Border Security , Economic Opportunity , and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 passed the Senate by a 68 – 32 margin , but faced an uncertain future in the House . [ 313 ]
In July 2013 , McCain was at the forefront of an agreement among senators to drop filibusters against Obama administration executive nominees without Democrats resorting to the " nuclear option " that would disallow such filibusters altogether . [ 314 ] [ 315 ]
However , the option would be imposed later in the year anyway , to the senator 's displeasure . [ 316 ]
These developments and some other negotiations showed that McCain now had improved relations with the Obama administration , including the president himself , as well as with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , and that he had become the leader of a power center in the Senate for cutting deals in an otherwise bitterly partisan environment . [ 317 ] [ 318 ] [ 319 ]
They also led some observers to conclude that the " maverick " McCain had returned . [ 315 ] [ 319 ]
McCain was publicly skeptical about the Republican strategy that precipitated the U.S. federal government shutdown of 2013 and U.S. debt - ceiling crisis of 2013 in order to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act ; in October 2013 he voted in favor of the Continuing Appropriations Act , 2014 , which resolved them and said , " Republicans have to understand we have lost this battle , as I predicted weeks ago , that we would not be able to win because we were demanding something that was not achievable . " [ 320 ]
Similarly , he was one of nine Republican senators who voted for the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 at the end of the year . [ 321 ]
By early 2014 , McCain 's apostasies were enough that the Arizona Republican Party formally censured him for having what they saw as a liberal record that had been " disastrous and harmful " . [ 322 ]
McCain remained stridently opposed to many aspects of Obama 's foreign policy , however , and in June 2014 , following major gains by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive , decried what he saw as a U.S. failure to protect its past gains in Iraq and called on the president 's entire national security team to resign .
McCain said , " Could all this have been avoided ? ...
The answer is absolutely yes .
If I sound angry it 's because I am angry . " [ 323 ]
McCain addresses anti-government protesters in Kyiv Ukraine , pledging his support for their cause , December 15 , 2013 .
McCain was a supporter of the Euromaidan protests against Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych and his government , and appeared in Independence Square in Kyiv in December 2013 . [ 324 ]
Following the overthrow of Yanukovych and subsequent 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine , McCain became a vocal supporter of providing arms to Ukrainian military forces , saying the sanctions imposed against Russia were not enough . [ 325 ]
In 2014 , McCain led the opposition to the appointments of Colleen Bell , Noah Mamet , and George Tsunis to the ambassadorships in Hungary , Argentina , and Norway , respectively , arguing they were unqualified appointees being rewarded for their political fundraising . [ 326 ]
Unlike many Republicans , McCain supported the release and contents of the Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture in December 2014 , saying " The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow .
It sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad .
It is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us .
But the American people are entitled to it , nonetheless . " [ 327 ]
He added that the CIA 's practices following the September 11 attacks had " stained our national honor " while doing " much harm and little practical good " and that " Our enemies act without conscience .
We must not . " [ 328 ]
He opposed the Obama administration 's December 2014 decision to normalize relations with Cuba . [ 329 ]
The 114th United States Congress assembled in January 2015 with Republicans in control of the Senate , and McCain achieved one of his longtime goals when he became chairman of the Armed Services Committee . [ 330 ]
In this position , he led the writing of proposed Senate legislation that sought to modify parts of the Goldwater - Nichols Act of 1986 in order to return responsibility for major weapons systems acquisition back to the individual armed services and their secretaries and away from the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition , Technology and Logistics . [ 331 ]
As chair , McCain tried to maintain a bipartisan approach and forged a good relationship with ranking member Jack Reed . [ 330 ]
In April 2015 , McCain announced that he would run for a sixth term in Arizona 's 2016 Senate election . [ 332 ]
While there was still conservative and Tea Party anger at him , it was unclear if they would mount an effective primary challenge against him . [ 333 ]
During 2015 , McCain strongly opposed the Obama administration 's proposed comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear program ( later finalized as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JCPOA ) ) , saying that Secretary of State Kerry was " delusional " and " giv[ing ] away the store " in negotiations with Iran . [ 334 ]
McCain supported the Saudi Arabian - led military intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh , [ 335 ] saying : " I 'm sure civilians die in war .
Not nearly as many as the Houthis have executed . " [ 336 ]
McCain accused President Obama of being " directly responsible " for the Orlando nightclub shooting " because when he pulled everybody out of Iraq , al - Qaeda went to Syria , became ISIS , and ISIS is what it is today thanks to Barack Obama 's failures . " [ 337 ] [ 338 ]
McCain campaigning with former Governor Romney in Mesa , Arizona during his 2016 re-election campaign
During the 2016 Republican primaries , McCain said he would support the Republican nominee even if it was Donald Trump , but following Mitt Romney 's 2016 anti-Trump speech , McCain endorsed the sentiments expressed in that speech , saying he had serious concerns about Trump 's " uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues " . [ 339 ]
Relations between the two had been fraught since early in the Donald Trump presidential campaign , 2016 , when McCain referred to a room full of Trump supporters as " crazies " , and the real estate mogul then said of McCain : " He insulted me , and he insulted everyone in that room ...
He is a war hero because he was captured .
I like people who were n't captured ... perhaps he was a war hero , but right now he 's said a lot of very bad things about a lot of people . " [ 339 ] [ 340 ]
McCain also vocally opposed a federal loan guarantee for a development project Trump was contemplating on the West Side of Manhattan in 1996 .
[ 341 ]
Following
Trump becoming the presumptive nominee of the party on May 3 , McCain said that Republican voters had spoken and he would support Trump . [ 342 ]
McCain himself faced a primary challenge from Kelli Ward , a fervent Trump supporter , and then was expected to face a potentially strong challenge from Democratic Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick in the general election . [ 343 ]
The senator privately expressed worry over the effect that Trump 's unpopularity among Hispanic voters might have on his own chances but also was concerned with more conservative pro-Trump voters ; he thus kept his endorsement of Trump in place but tried to speak of him as little as possible given their disagreements . [ 344 ] [ 345 ] [ 346 ]
However McCain defeated
Ward in the primary by a double - digit percentage point margin and gained a similar lead over Kirkpatrick in general election polls , and when the Donald Trump Access Hollywood controversy broke , he felt secure enough to on October 8 withdraw his endorsement of Trump . [ 343 ]
McCain stated that Trump's " demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults " made it " impossible to continue to offer even conditional support " and added that he would not vote for Hillary Clinton , but would instead " write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president . " [ 347 ] [ 348 ]
McCain , at 80 years of age , went on to defeat Kirkpatrick , securing a sixth term as United States Senator from Arizona . [ 349 ]
In November 2016 , McCain learned of the existence of a dossier regarding the Trump presidential campaign 's links to Russia compiled by Christopher Steele .
McCain sent a representative to gather more information , who obtained a copy of the dossier . [ 350 ]
In December 2016 , McCain passed on the dossier to FBI Director James Comey in a 1 - on - 1 meeting .
McCain later wrote that he felt the dossier 's " allegations were disturbing " but unverifiable by himself , so he let the FBI investigate . [ 351 ]
On December 31 , 2016 , in Tbilisi , Georgia , McCain stated that the United States should strengthen its sanctions against Russia . [ 352 ]
One year later , on December 23 , 2017 , the State Department announced that the United States would provide Ukraine with " enhanced defensive capabilities " . [ 353 ]
Sixth and final Senate term
National March on the NRA in August 2018 .
The [ 354 ]
Thein August 2018 .
The NRA spent $ 7.74 million to support John McCain .
McCain chaired the January 5 , 2017 , hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee where Republican and Democratic senators and intelligence officers , including James R. Clapper Jr. , the Director of National Intelligence , Michael S. Rogers , the head of the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command presented a " united front " that " forcefully reaffirmed the conclusion that the Russian government used hacking and leaks to try to influence the presidential election . " [ 355 ]
In June 2017 , McCain voted to support President Trump 's controversial arms deal with Saudi Arabia . [ 356 ] [ 357 ]
Repeal and replacement of Obamacare ( the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ) was a centerpiece of McCain 's 2016 re-election campaign , and in July 2017 he said , " Have no doubt : Congress must replace Obamacare , which has hit Arizonans with some of the highest premium increases in the nation and left 14 of Arizona 's 15 counties with only one provider option on the exchanges this year . "
He added that he supports affordable and quality health care , but objected that the pending Senate bill did not do enough to shield the Medicaid system in Arizona . [ 358 ]
In response to the death of Chinese Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo , who died of organ failure while in government custody , McCain said that " this is only the latest example of Communist China 's assault on human rights , democracy , and freedom . " [ 359 ]
In September 2017 , as the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar became ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya Muslim minority , McCain announced moves to scrap planned future military cooperation with Myanmar . [ 360 ]
In October 2017 , McCain praised President Trump 's decision to decertify Iran 's compliance with the Iran nuclear deal ( JCPOA ) while not yet withdrawing the U.S. from the agreement , saying that the Obama - era policy failed " to meet the multifaceted threat Iran poses .
The goals President Trump presented in his speech today are a welcomed long overdue change . " [ 361 ]
Brain tumor diagnosis and surgery
McCain returns to the Senate for the first time following his cancer diagnosis and delivers remarks on July 25 , 2017 , after casting a crucial vote on the American Health Care Act
On July 14 , 2017 , McCain underwent a minimally invasive craniotomy at Mayo Clinic Hospital in Phoenix , Arizona , in order to remove a blood clot above his left eye .
His absence prompted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to delay a vote on the Better Care Reconciliation Act . [ 362 ]
Five days later , Mayo Clinic doctors announced that the laboratory results from the surgery confirmed the presence of a glioblastoma , which is a very aggressive cancerous brain tumor . [ 363 ]
Standard treatment options for this tumor include chemotherapy and radiation , although even with treatment , average survival time is approximately 14 months . [ 363 ]
McCain was a survivor of previous cancers , including melanoma . [ 226 ] [ 364 ]
President Donald Trump publicly wished Senator McCain well , [ 365 ] as did many others , including former President Obama . [ 366 ]
On July 19 , McCain 's senatorial office issued a statement that he " appreciates the outpouring of support he has received over the last few days .
He is in good spirits as he continues to recover at home with his family in Arizona .
He is grateful to the doctors and staff at Mayo Clinic for their outstanding care , and is confident that any future treatment will be effective . "
On July 24 , McCain announced via Twitter that he would return to the United States Senate the following day . [ 367 ]
Return to the Senate
McCain votes no on repealing the Affordable Care Act by giving a thumbs down .
McCain returned to the Senate on July 25 , less than two weeks after brain surgery .
He cast a deciding vote allowing the Senate to begin consideration of bills to replace the Affordable Care Act .
Along with that vote , he delivered a speech criticizing the party - line voting process used by the Republicans , as well as by the Democrats in passing the Affordable Care Act to begin with , and McCain also urged a " return to regular order " utilizing the usual committee hearings and deliberations .
[ 368 ] [ 369 ] [ 370 ]
On July 28 , he cast the decisive vote against the Republicans ' final proposal that month , the so - called " skinny repeal " option , which failed 49 – 51 . [ 371 ]
McCain did not vote in the Senate after December 2017 , remaining instead in Arizona to undergo cancer treatment .
On April 15 , 2018 , he underwent surgery for an infection relating to diverticulitis and the following day was reported to be in stable condition . [ 372 ]

Death and funeral
Memorial Service for Arizona Senator John S. McCain
On August 24 , 2018 , McCain 's family announced that he would no longer receive treatment for his cancer . [ 375 ]
He died the following day at 4:28 p.m. MST ( 23:28 UTC ) , with his wife and family beside him , at his home in Cornville , Arizona . [ 376 ] [ 377 ]
McCain lay in state in the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix on August 29 , which would have been his 82nd birthday .
This was followed by a service at North Phoenix Baptist Church on August 30 .
His remains were then moved to Washington , D.C. to lie in state in the rotunda of the United States Capitol [ 378 ] on August 31 , which was followed by a service at the Washington National Cathedral on September 1 .
He was a " lifelong Episcopalian " who attended , but did not join , a Southern Baptist church for at least 17 years ; memorial services were scheduled in both denominations .
[ 379 ] [ 380 ]
Prior to his death , McCain requested that former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama deliver eulogies at his funeral , and asked that both President Donald Trump and former Alaska Governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin not attend any of the services .
[ 381 ] [ 382 ]
McCain himself planned the funeral arrangements and selected his pallbearers for the service in Washington ; the pallbearers included former Vice President Joe Biden , former Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold , former Secretary of Defense William Cohen , actor Warren Beatty , and Russian dissident Vladimir Vladimirovich Kara - Murza . [ 383 ]
Multiple foreign leaders attended McCain 's service : Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg , President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko , Speaker of Taiwan 's Congress Su Jia-chyuan , National Defense Minister of Canada Harjit Sajjan , Defense Minister Jüri Luik and Foreign Minister Sven Mikser of Estonia , Foreign Minister of Latvia Edgars Rinkēvičs , Foreign Minister of Lithuania Linas Antanas Linkevičius , and Foreign Affairs Minister of Saudi Arabia Adel al - Jubeir . [ 384 ] [ 385 ] [ 386 ]
Dignitaries who gave eulogies at the Memorial Service in Washington National Cathedral included Barack Obama , George W. Bush , Henry Kissinger , Joe Lieberman , and his daughter Meghan McCain .
The New Yorker described the service as the biggest meeting of anti-Trump figures during his presidency . [ 387 ]
Many American political figures paid tribute at the funeral .
Those who attended included former United States Presidents Obama , Bush , Clinton , Carter ; First Ladies Michelle , Laura , Hillary , Rosalyn ; and former Vice Presidents Biden , Cheney , Gore , and Quayle .
Former President George H.W. Bush ( who died 3 months and 5 days after McCain ) was too ill to attend the service , and President Trump was not invited .
Many figures from political life , both current and former and from both political parties , attended .
Figures included John F. Kelly , Jim Mattis , Bob Dole , Madeleine Albright , John Kerry , Mitch McConnell , Paul Ryan , Nancy Pelosi , Chuck Schumer , Mitt Romney , Lindsey Graham , Jeff Flake , Elizabeth Warren , and Jon Huntsman .
Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner attended to the displeasure of Meghan McCain . [ 388 ] Journalists Carl Bernstein , Tom Brokaw , and Charlie Rose , as well as actors Warren Beatty and Annette Bening and comedians Jay Leno and Joy Behar also attended the funeral . [ 389 ]
On September 2 , the funeral cortege traveled from Washington , D.C. through Annapolis , Maryland , where the streets were lined with crowds of onlookers , to the Naval Academy . [ 390 ]
A private service was held at the Naval Academy Chapel , attended by the brigade of midshipmen and McCain 's classmates .
After the chapel service , McCain was buried at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery , next to his Naval Academy classmate and lifelong friend Admiral Charles R. Larson . [ 391 ]
Many celebrities paid tribute to the late Senator on Twitter .
Those included , Tom Hanks who tweeted " Duty .
Honor .
Country .
Our nation thanks you , John McCain .
There has been no finer son of America " .
Whoopi Goldberg , Ellen DeGeneres , Reese Witherspoon , Jimmy Kimmel , and Khloe Kardashian also tweeted out remembrances of the late Senator . [ 392 ]
Arizona Governor Doug Ducey was empowered to appoint McCain 's interim replacement until a special election is held in 2020 to determine who is to serve out the remainder of McCain 's term , which ends in January 2023 and thus appointed the then former Arizona U.S. Senator Jon Kyl to fill the vacancy . [ 393 ] [ 394 ]
Under Arizona law , the appointed replacement must be of the same party as McCain , a Republican . [ 395 ]
Newspaper speculation about potential appointees has included McCain 's widow Cindy , former Senator Jon Kyl , and former Representatives Matt Salmon and John Shadegg . [ 396 ] [ 397 ]
Ducey said that he would not make a formal appointment until after McCain 's final funeral and burial ; on September 4 , two days after McCain was buried , Ducey appointed Kyl to fill McCain 's seat . [ 398 ] [ 399 ]
Tributes
McCain received many tributes and condolences , including from Congressional colleagues , all living former Presidents – Jimmy Carter , George H. W. Bush , Bill Clinton , George W. Bush , Barack Obama – and former Vice President Joe Biden , as well as Vice President Mike Pence and President Richard Nixon 's daughters Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower . [ 400 ] [ 401 ] [ 402 ] [ 403 ]
French President Emmanuel Macron , Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen , Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman , Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison , who had just taken office the previous day , and former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull , British Prime Minister Theresa May and former Prime Minister David Cameron , Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former Prime Minister Stephen Harper , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and foreign minister Heiko Maas , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi , Afghanistan chief executive Abdullah Abdullah , Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi , the 14th Dalai Lama , and former Vietnamese ambassador to Washington Nguyễn Quốc Cường also sent condolences . [ 404 ] [ 405 ] [ 406 ] [ 407 ] [ 408 ] [ 409 ]
Colonel Trần Trọng Duyệt , who ran the Hỏa Lò Prison when McCain was held there , remarked , " At that time I liked him personally for his toughness and strong stance .
Later on , when he became a US Senator , he and Senator John Kerry greatly contributed to promote Vietnam - US relations so I was very fond of him .
When I learnt about his death early this morning , I feel very sad .
I would like to send condolences to his family . " [ 410 ]
In a TV interview , Senator Lindsey Graham said McCain 's last words to him were " I love you , I have not been cheated . " [ 411 ]
His daughter , Meghan McCain , shared her grief , stating that she was present at the moment he died . [ 412 ]
At the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards , McCain was recognized in the " In Memoriam " segment , right before Aretha Franklin .
Many fans questioned the inclusion of McCain in the segment because he was n't known for television .
He had , however , appeared in various television projects , including hosting and several cameo appearances on Saturday Night Live .
He also made appearances on Parks and Recreation and 24 . [ 413 ]
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) announced that he would introduce a resolution to rename the Russell Senate Office Building after McCain . [ 414 ]
A quarter peal of Grandsire Caters in memory of McCain was rung by the bellringers of Washington National Cathedral the day following his death .
[ 415 ]
Another memorial quarter peal was rung on September 6 on the Bells of Congress at the Old Post Office in Washington . [ 416 ]
Negative reaction from the White House
The American flag flies at half - staff at the White House for Senator John McCain – video from Voice of America
President Trump reportedly rejected the White House 's plans to release a statement praising McCain 's life , and he initially said nothing about McCain himself in a tweet that extended condolences to McCain 's family . [ 417 ]
In addition , the flag at the White House , which had been lowered to half - staff the day of McCain 's death ( August 25 ) , was raised back to full - staff at 12:01 a.m. on August 27 . [ 418 ]
Trump reportedly felt that media coverage of McCain 's death was excessive given that McCain was never president . [ 419 ]
In contrast with the White House 's initial decision , many governors , both Democratic and Republican , had ordered flags in their states to fly at half - staff until McCain 's interment , and Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer requested support from the Defense Department so that flags would be flown at half - staff on all government buildings . [ 420 ] [ 421 ]
Following public backlash from the American Legion and AMVETS , Trump relented and ordered the White House flag back to half - staff later in the day on August 27 .
Trump belatedly issued a statement praising McCain 's service to the country , and he signed a proclamation ordering flags to be flown at half - staff until McCain 's interment at the Naval Academy Cemetery . [ 422 ] [ 423 ]
In March 2019 — seven months after McCain 's death — Trump issued a series of public statements that criticized McCain at least four times in five days . [ 424 ]
Trump also claimed that he approved McCain 's funeral but was not thanked for it .
However , the Washington National Cathedral responded that no governmental or presidential approval was needed for McCain 's funeral because he was not a former president .
McCain 's lying in state was approved by the Senate , while Trump did approve the transport for McCain 's body . [ 425 ] [ 426 ] [ 427 ]
Trump also described himself as having " got the job done " on the Veterans Choice Act while claiming McCain failed on the same issue .
However , McCain was actually one of the two main authors of the bill , which President Barack Obama signed into law in 2014 .
Trump had signed the VA MISSION Act of 2018 ( S. 2372 ) , an expansion of that law worked on by McCain that includes McCain 's name in its full title .
Trump also claimed that McCain graduated " last in his class " , though McCain was actually fifth from last . [ 428 ] [ 429 ]
Political positions
Various advocacy groups have given McCain scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group . [ 431 ]
The American Conservative Union awarded McCain a lifetime rating of 82 percent through 2015 , while McCain registered an average lifetime 12 percent " Liberal Quotient " from Americans for Democratic Action through 2015 . [ 432 ]
CrowdPac , which rates politicians based on donations made and received , gave Senator McCain a score of 4.3C with 10C being the most conservative and 10L being the most liberal . [ 433 ]
The non-partisan National Journal rates a Senator 's votes by what percentage of the Senate voted more liberally than him or her , and what percentage more conservatively , in three policy areas : economic , social , and foreign .
For 2005 – 2006 ( as reported in the 2008 Almanac of American Politics ) , McCain 's average ratings were as follows : economic policy : 59 percent conservative and 41 percent liberal ; social policy : 54 percent conservative and 38 percent liberal ; and foreign policy : 56 percent conservative and 43 percent liberal . [ 434 ]
In 2012 , the National Journal gave McCain a composite score of 73 percent conservative and 27 percent liberal , [ 435 ] while in 2013 he received a composite score of 60 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal . [ 436 ]
Columnists such as Robert Robb and Matthew Continetti used a formulation devised by William F. Buckley Jr. to describe McCain as " conservative " but not " a conservative " , meaning that while McCain usually tended towards conservative positions , he was not " anchored by the philosophical tenets of modern American conservatism " . [ 437 ] [ 438 ]
Following his 2008 presidential election loss , McCain began adopting more orthodox conservative views ; the magazine National Journal rated McCain along with seven of his colleagues as the " most conservative " Senators for 2010 [ 439 ] and he achieved his first 100 percent rating from the American Conservative Union for that year . [ 430 ]
During Barack Obama 's presidency , McCain was one of the top five Republicans most likely to vote with Obama 's position on significant votes ; McCain voted with Obama 's position on such votes more than half the time in 2013 and was " censured by the Arizona Republican party for a so - called ' liberal ' voting record " . [ 440 ]
From the late 1990s until 2008 , McCain was a board member of Project Vote Smart which was set up by Richard Kimball , his 1986 Senate opponent . [ 441 ]
The project provides non-partisan information about the political positions of McCain [ 442 ] and other candidates for political office .
Additionally , McCain used his Senate website to describe his political positions . [ 443 ]
Cultural and political image
McCain and his wife Cindy watch in 2011 as their son Jimmy pins aviator wings on their son Ensign John Sidney McCain IV .
[ 444 ] Public opinion of John McCain
McCain 's personal character was a dominant feature of his public image . [ 445 ]
This image includes the military service of both himself and his family , [ 446 ] the circumstances and tensions surrounding the end of his first marriage and beginning of second , [ 25 ] his maverick political persona , [ 118 ] his temper , [ 447 ] his admitted problem of occasional ill - considered remarks , [ 92 ] and his close ties to his children from both his marriages . [ 25 ]
McCain 's political appeal was more nonpartisan and less ideological compared to many other national politicians . [ 448 ]
His stature and reputation stemmed partly from his service in the Vietnam War . [ 449 ]
He also carried physical vestiges of his war wounds , as well as his melanoma surgery . [ 450 ]
When campaigning , he quipped : " I am older than dirt and have more scars than Frankenstein . " [ 451 ]
Writers often extolled McCain for his courage not just in war but in politics , and wrote sympathetically about him . [ 59 ] [ 445 ] [ 449 ] [ 452 ]
McCain 's shift of political stances and attitudes during and especially after the 2008 presidential campaign , including his self - repudiation of the maverick label , left many writers expressing sadness and wondering what had happened to the McCain they thought they had known . [ 453 ] [ 454 ] [ 455 ] [ 456 ]
By 2013 , some aspects of the older McCain had returned , and his image became that of a kaleidoscope of contradictory tendencies , including as a Republican In Name Only or a " traitor " to his party [ 457 ] and , as one writer listed , " the maverick , the former maverick , the curmudgeon , the bridge builder , the war hero bent on transcending the call of self - interest to serve a cause greater than himself , the sore loser , old bull , last lion , loose cannon , happy warrior , elder statesman , lion in winter . " [ 316 ]
In his own estimation , McCain was straightforward and direct , but impatient . [ 458 ]
His other traits included a penchant for lucky charms , [ 459 ] a fondness for hiking , [ 460 ] and a sense of humor that sometimes backfired spectacularly , as when he made a joke in 1998 about the Clintons that was widely deemed not fit to print in newspapers : " Do you know why Chelsea Clinton is so ugly ?
– Because Janet Reno is her father . " [ 461 ] [ 462 ]
McCain subsequently apologized profusely , [ 463 ] and the Clinton White House accepted his apology . [ 464 ]
McCain did not shy away from addressing his shortcomings , and he apologized for them . [ 92 ] [ 465 ]
He was known for sometimes being prickly [ 466 ] and hot - tempered [ 467 ] with Senate colleagues , but his relations with his own Senate staff were more cordial , and inspired loyalty towards him . [ 468 ] [ 469 ]
He formed a strong bond with two senators , Joe Lieberman and Lindsey Graham , over hawkish foreign policy and overseas travel , and they became dubbed the " Three Amigos " . [ 306 ]
McCain acknowledged having said intemperate things in years past , [ 470 ] though he also said that many stories have been exaggerated .
[ 471 ]
One psychoanalytic comparison suggested that McCain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper , [ 472 ] and cultural critic Julia Keller argued that voters want leaders who are passionate , engaged , fiery , and feisty . [ 447 ] McCain employed both profanity [ 473 ] and shouting on occasion , although such incidents became less frequent over the years .
[ 474 ] [ 475 ]
Lieberman made this observation : " It is not the kind of anger that is a loss of control .
He is a very controlled person . " [ 474 ]
Senator Thad Cochran , who knew McCain for decades and had battled him over earmarks , [ 476 ] [ 477 ] expressed concern about a McCain presidency : " He is erratic .
He is hotheaded .
He loses his temper and he worries me . " [ 474 ]
Yet Cochran supported McCain for president when it was clear he would win the nomination . [ 478 ]
The Chicago Tribune editorial board called McCain a patriot , who although sometimes wrong was fearless , and that he deserves to be thought of among the few US senators in history , whose names are more recognizable than some presidents . [ 479 ]
All McCain 's family members were on good terms with him , [ 25 ] and he defended them against some of the negative consequences of his high - profile political lifestyle . [ 480 ] [ 481 ]
His family 's military tradition extends to the latest generation : son John Sidney IV ( " Jack " ) graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2009 , becoming the fourth generation John S. McCain to do so , and is a helicopter pilot ; son James served two tours with the Marines in the Iraq War ; and son Doug flew jets in the navy .
[ 25 ] [ 482 ] [ 483 ]
His daughter Meghan became a blogging and Twittering presence in the debate about the future of the Republican Party following the 2008 elections , and showed some of his maverick tendencies .
[ 484 ] [ 485 ]
In 2017 Meghan joined the cast of the popular ABC talk show The View as a co-host . [ 486 ]
Senator McCain himself also appeared as a guest on the program . [ 487 ]
McCain appeared in several television shows and films while he was a sitting senator .
He made uncredited cameo appearances in Wedding Crashers and 24 and had two uncredited cameos in Parks and Recreation .
McCain also hosted Saturday Night Live in 2002 and appeared in two episodes in 2008 . [ 488 ]
Awards and honors
In addition to his military honors and decorations , McCain was granted a number of civilian awards and honors .
In 1997 , Time magazine named McCain as one of the " 25 Most Influential People in America " . [ 126 ]
In 1999 , McCain shared the Profile in Courage Award with Senator Russ Feingold for their work towards campaign finance reform . [ 130 ]
The following year , the same pair shared the Paul H. Douglas Award for Ethics in Government . [ 489 ]
In 2005 , The Eisenhower Institute awarded McCain the Eisenhower Leadership Prize . [ 490 ]
The prize recognizes individuals whose lifetime accomplishments reflect Dwight D. Eisenhower 's legacy of integrity and leadership .
In 2006 , the Bruce F. Vento Public Service Award was bestowed upon McCain by the National Park Trust . [ 491 ]
The same year , McCain was awarded the Henry M. Jackson Distinguished Service Award by the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs , in honor of Senator Henry M. " Scoop " Jackson . [ 492 ]
In 2007 , the World Leadership Forum presented McCain with the Policymaker of the Year Award ; it is given internationally to someone who has " created , inspired or strongly influenced important policy or legislation " .

In 2015 , the Kyiv Patriarchate awarded McCain its own version of the Order of St. Vladimir . [ 495 ]
In 2016 , Allegheny College awarded McCain , along with Vice President Joe Biden , its Prize for Civility in Public Life . [ 496 ]
In August 2016 , Petro Poroshenko , the President of Ukraine , awarded McCain with the highest award for foreigners , the Order of Liberty . [ 497 ]
In 2017 , Hashim Thaçi , the President of Kosovo , awarded McCain the " Urdhër i Lirisë " ( Order of Freedom ) medal for his contribution to the freedom and independence of Kosovo , and its partnership with the U.S. [ 498 ]
McCain also received the Liberty Medal from the National Constitution Center in 2017 . [ 499 ]
In the spring of 2018 McCain was decorated with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun from the Japanese Emperor for ' strengthening bilateral relations and promoting friendship between Japan and the United States ' . [ 500 ]
McCain received several honorary degrees from colleges and universities in the United States and internationally .
These include ones from Colgate University ( LL.D 2000 ) , [ 501 ]
The Citadel ( DPA 2002 ) , [ 502 ] Wake Forest University ( LL.D May 20 , 2002 ) , [ 503 ] [ 504 ] the University of Southern California ( DHL May 2004 ) , [ 505 ] Northwestern University ( LL.D June 17 , 2005 ) , [ 506 ] [ 507 ] Liberty University ( 2006 ) , [ 508 ]
The New School ( 2006 ) , [ 509 ] and the Royal Military College of Canada ( D.MSc June 27 , 2013 ) . [ 510 ] [ 511 ] [ 512 ]
He was also made an Honorary Patron of the University Philosophical Society at Trinity College Dublin in 2005 . [ 513 ]
On July 11 , 2018 , USS John S. McCain , originally named in honor of the Senator 's father and grandfather , was rededicated in the Senator 's name also . [ 514 ] [ 515 ]

A Bethlehem man who celebrated his sentence of probation for microwaving a cat by posting a message on his Web site was sent to jail today .
Northampton County Judge F. P. Kimberly McFadden asked Shawn T. McGonigal , 28 , if he was a baseball fan and watched the World Series .
McGonigal said yes .
Strike one was microwaving a kitten , injuring its feet , ears , whiskers and mouth in October 2007 at his former apartment in the first block of East Main Street , Bath .
McGonigal pleaded guilty to cruelty to animals .
Strike two was lying to his probation officer about his prior criminal record , even though McGonigal said today he complied with everything else .
But the third swing that sent McGonigal to prison was his MySpace page message posted after he was sentenced to 18 months probation that said " FTW $ 1,500 fine no jail time party ! "
McGonigal was charged with overt acts , violating his probation .
McGonigal 's probation officer provided the judge with a printout of the Web page , and McFadden shook her head and chuckled as she read it .

We Republicans really need to get more creative when it comes to user - generated videos .
Any others I missed ?
Let me know and I ’ll post them .
When " Weird Al " Yankovic packs for the road , he brings the following items :
One red leather Michael Jackson jacket , one foam - rubber double chin , one Segway , one garden hoe , one silver dress suit , five Amish beards , five Jedi robes , and two accordions .
That 's actually just a partial inventory , as Yankovic employs so many costumes and hairpieces during his shows that a makeshift dressing room must be set up directly behind the stage — a sort of musical - parody triage unit .
His performances usually last two and a half hours , and between each song he slips back to this space , where a wardrobe assistant affixes whatever wig or fake appendage he needs for the next number .
When he reemerges , he 'll have morphed into one of his countless music - video personas :
There 's Yankovic as the bearded laborer from " Amish Paradise " ( a riff on Coolio 's " Gangsta 's Paradise " ) , as the marble - mouthed grunge singer from " Smells Like Nirvana " ( a satire of " Smells Like Teen Spirit " ) , and as the diet - obsessed nag from " Eat It " ( a parody of Michael Jackson 's " Beat It " ) .
At some point , Yankovic will switch into an old bowling shirt or thick , aviator - style glasses , his standard uniform in the ' 80s and '90s : Yankovic has been imitating others for so long that nowadays he occasionally has to imitate himself .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .

Weird Al Yankovich " Hey Ricky "
This year marks the 25th anniversary of Yankovic 's first music video , " Ricky , " in which he reimagined Toni Basil 's " Mickey " as an ode to I Love Lucy .
The clip introduced the world to an accordion - playing spaz with a coif like Rick James and a voice like an urgent goose .
Though many people at the time considered Yankovic to be thoroughly disposable — just another Reagan - era fad , like parachute pants or the Contras — he never went away .
In fact , Yankovic had his biggest hit just two years ago , when he reworked Chamillionaire 's rap hit " Ridin ' " as the geek - pride anthem " White & Nerdy " ( " X - Men comics , you know I collect 'em / The pens in my pocket , I must protect ' em " ) .
The song was Yankovic 's first track to break the Billboard Top 10 .
But Yankovic is n't just popular .
He is also the unlikely forefather of the infectious , hyperlinked , quasi - referential comedy that 's become the lingua franca of the Web .
Yankovic 's influence can be seen in the slow - jam pinings of Obama Girl , the cross-cultural pairings that turn Yoda and SpongeBob SquarePants into hardcore rappers , and in the nimble hands of that couch potato who farts out " Bohemian Rhapsody " with his palms ( 1.8 million YouTube views and counting ) .
You can even detect traces of his style in the perfectly metered wordplay of " Lazy Sunday , " the 2005 Saturday Night Live short that earned YouTube — and viral humor — its first barrage of mainstream attention .
" Ever since I was old enough to listen to music , I 've been listening to Weird Al , " says 30 - year - old " Sunday " cocreator Andy Samberg .
" For my generation , he 's a huge influence . "

Much like the big - name artists he once so expertly spoofed , Yankovic now inspires not just imitators but also competitors .
He 'll soon commence work on his 13th studio album , which will have to compete against his own singsongy progeny — the amateur satirists who can devise , record , and edit their own parodies in days , if not hours .
To make matters more complicated , whereas Yankovic could once mine such inexhaustible icons as Jackson and Nirvana for laughs , he now has to contend with the likes of Jessica Simpson or Kevin Federline — celebrities who are more or less already self - parodies .
Being a music satirist in 2008 is a bit like being a political cartoonist after the Harding administration : too many easy targets , too few sacred idols .
" Back in the ' 80s , ' Purple Rain ' would be number one for half a year , " Yankovic says .
" You still have Top 40 radio now , but it 's 40 different stations .
There are n't many hits that everybody knows , and there are n't many real superstars .
That makes it more difficult for me . "
Weird Al 's 10 Greatest Hits Go and ahead and fire up YouTube .
We 'll wait .
But if there 's any wisdom to be divined from Yankovic 's success , it 's that nothing — not critical slags nor commercial slumps nor a middling creative economy — can quash an ingeniously crafted spoof .
" When he struck gold with ' Nerdy , ' I thought that was the coolest thing , " says musician Ben Folds , who played piano on a cut on Yankovic 's album Poodle Hat .
" The music - business ship is going down , and Weird Al is standing on the bow , rockin ' out . "
Yankovic lives in Los Angeles , in a house with a pool in the front and a view of Ricardo Montalban 's estate in the back .
On a midsummer afternoon , he greets me wearing a polo shirt , jeans , and a pair of Crocs and promptly gives me a tour of his home .
Previous tenants include marijuana advocate Jack Margolis and , later , corpulent rapper Heavy D , who left behind a plus - size shower and an industrial - grade oven .
Yankovic has heard a rumor that the property was once used as an adult - film set .
" That 's the history of this place , " he says .
" Drugs , rap , porn , and the Yankovics . "
Yankovic turns 49 in October and remains lithe enough to execute high kicks and back bends during his performances .
His hair , graying only slightly , is absolutely volcanic : two long sheaths of curls that are parted down the middle and hang to his shoulders .
( He still occasionally grows out his mustache , but in his live act he impersonates Eminem and Taylor Hicks — excess facial hair screws with the verisimilitude . )
Most first - time guests are encouraged to ride the Segway used in the " White & Nerdy " video , but alas , it has already been packed away for an upcoming tour .
Still , there 's no shortage of Yankovic memorabilia , including a closet lined with Hawaiian - print shirts and rows of out - of - production Vans sneakers .
At one point , I turn a corner in a hallway and spot a full - size promotional cardboard cutout depicting Yankovic from his mid-'80s period .
This is the Al I all but deified back when he was opening his concerts with a gurney and a chain saw ( for " Like a Surgeon " ) , when albums like " Weird Al " Yankovic in 3 - D were stone - cold fourth - grade classics , and when no other performer was so adept at embracing popular culture while simultaneously mocking it .
Near the kitchen there 's a life - size Yoda , a leftover from the Star Wars - themed birthday party that Yankovic recently threw for his 5 - year - old daughter , Nina .
He 's been married since 2001 to Suzanne Krajewski , a former film and TV executive he met through Bill Mumy , the Lost in Space child star who 's also a part - time novelty musician .
" We had this relationship where we talked over the phone for weeks , " Yankovic says .
" Going to meet her for our first date , I was like , ' I hope she 's cute , ' cause I just might marry her . ' "
Yankovic says this with an abrupt giggle — in fact , he says just about everything with an abrupt giggle and often follows up even the slightest introspective remark with a self - deprecating jab .
Before meeting Yankovic , I half - feared he would turn out to be one of those childhood heroes who ages into a twisted , bitter dick .
But rest assured : Weird
Al is thoroughly , comfortingly awesome .
Weird Al Yankovic " Another One Rides The Bus " Raised in the LA suburb of Lynwood , Yankovic 's first moment of onstage asininity was the high school valedictory speech he delivered in 1976 .
" I went into a rant about how the polar ice caps are going to melt and drown us all , " he remembers .
" It was this crazed Howard Beale kind of thing .
People were freaked out . "
Throughout high school , Yankovic had been recording comedy songs and submitting his cassette demos to Dr. Demento , the novelty - record radio host whose weekly broadcast helped popularize such one - offs as " The Purple People Eater " and " Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer . "
Demento listened to Yankovic 's early tracks , not knowing quite what to make of the fog - thick whir of accordion .
" At the time , the accordion was about as unhip as you could get , " says Demento , aka Barret Eugene Hansen .
Early Yankovic singles like " Another One Rides the Bus " and " My Bologna " were recorded with minimal orchestration — sometimes just a drumbeat backing Yankovic 's playing ( today " Bus " sounds like a gypsy - punk number ) .
But because he was cracking wise about junk food and public transportation , the songs were funny even to people who did n't care for the original versions .
" Bologna " earned enough national attention to warrant him a onetime deal with Capitol Records for the single .
But he struggled to get an album contract .
Weird Al Yankovic " My Bologna " " Song parodies are considered the lowest form of comedy , " Yankovic says .
" At the time , labels figured that novelty artists sell singles , not albums , and the record industry was n't in the business of selling singles . "
He eventually signed with Scotti Brothers , an independent label distributed by CBS and also home to Survivor and James Brown .
Beginning in 1983 , Yankovic recorded and released five albums on Scotti , including " Weird Al " Yankovic in 3 - D ( featuring the song " Eat It , " which earned him a Grammy at the age of 25 ) , Dare to Be Stupid , and his much - heralded response to Michael Jackson 's Bad , dubbed Even Worse .
All three were a mix of parodies and genre - spoofing original compositions , and all three went platinum .
Apparently , plenty of people could relate to Yankovic , even in era when Dagobah jokes were considered a sign of weakness .
" I took a lot of shit in school for having a strange sense of humor , " says Seth Green , 34 , cocreator of Robot Chicken .
" Then this guy comes out who 's named Weird , and people are loving him .
All of a sudden , I can point to someone and say , ' Hey , I 'm not the only one who thinks and feels this way . ' "
Indeed , Yankovic quickly became an outcast hero , and by the late ' 80s a good portion of the country 's weekly allowance was being spent on the likes of Even Worse .
" For a number of years , I was a cash cow for Scotti Brothers , " Yankovic says , " which put me in an uncomfortable situation :
If they were n't having a good year , it was like , ' Where 's the next Weird Al record ? ' "
Occasionally , Yankovic would be coerced into lampooning a particular song , and as a result , his back catalog is not without its share of regrets : " ' Girls Just Wanna Have Lunch , ' " he sighs , " was parody done under duress . "
Weird Al Yankovic " Girls Just Wanna Have Lunch " Yankovic 's most fertile targets were global stars — mega- artists like Jackson and Madonna who had distinctive musical and visual styles that Yankovic could exaggerate for effect .
" Everybody was watching the same videos , " he says of the pre-Laguna Beach era on MTV , when the network functioned as a sort of national radio station .
" Viewers memorized every detail , every nuance , which made my job so much easier :
If you 've got those images ingrained in your head , all you have to do is tweak them a little bit and it 's comedy gold . "
It might seem ludicrous to treat musical parody as an art form , but in fact there are a few subtle distinctions between Yankovic 's material and the countless wacky wake - up - show spoofs that followed in his wake .
( Yankovic inspired so many imitators that one fan created the Not Al Page , a fight - the - rip - offs Web site that lists years ' worth of misattributed songs . )
Consider a tune like 1986's " Living With a Hernia , " a send - up of James Brown 's " Living in America . "
Like all Yankovic tracks , it 's the result of thorough research .
" Before I even begin thinking of jokes , I bombard myself with information , " he says .
" I could probably still name three or four of the top 10 hernias . "
By the end of " Hernia , " Yankovic is giving ailment - specific shout - outs like " Epigastric ! " and " Richter 's hernia ! "
He has also made a point of avoiding topicality , and so , two decades after the release of " Hernia , " there 's nothing that dates its humor ( except for the era of the original , of course ) .
This is the kind of obsessive dedication that gives his songs an indefinite lifespan .
" Ninety percent of all parody songs are terrible , " says Paul Scheer , a member of the comedy troupe Human Giant .
" But whereas a lot of people just rhyme things and push out words because they sound familiar , Al creates funny juxtapositions and social satire .
There 's something timeless in the sentiment of the songs .
He 's kind of like Aerosmith — he 'll always have a new group of kids discovering him . "
In 1989 , Yankovic tried to expand his multimedia lampoonery to film , cowriting and starring in UHF , the story of a low - wattage , lowbrow TV station that broadcasts such gonzo shows as Conan the Librarian and Wheel of Fish .
" I had my hopes built up a bit because the movie tested extremely well , " he says .
" The studio thought , ' Oh , this is going to be our big summer movie . '
It tanked and got terrible reviews . "
Much like Office Space , UHF needed a few years to gestate before it found its audience .
" It 's so committed to being ridiculous , " SNL's Samberg says .
" Yankovic is a good example of a comedian who does really smart - slash - stupid stuff , which a lot of people dismiss as stupid - stupid .
I always wished Weird Al had made more movies . "
Today , UHF 's smash - and - grab tactic of jumbling together as many television , film , and music references as possible presages modern viral - video consumption habits ; watching it now is a bit like watching YouTube : The Movie .
After UHF flopped , Yankovic waited three years before releasing a new album , by which point perennial marks like Jackson and Madonna were funny enough on their own , turning white and releasing S&M coffee table books .
So Yankovic shifted his attention to the frowny denizens of hip hop and alt - rock , which he mined for such hits as " Amish Paradise " and " Smells Like Nirvana . "
The former song inspired a Behind the Music segment about Yankovic 's feud with Coolio — exaggerated , Yankovic says — while the latter prompted a mash note from its victim .
" Yankovic , " Kurt Cobain wrote in a journal entry from the early ' 90s , " is America 's modern pop-rock genius . "
( " I do n't know if he was being facetious or what , " Yankovic says now . )
He has always made it a policy to be sure the original artists sign off on his parodies , and by the '90s , most musicians had come to view being spoofed by Yankovic as a career milestone .
The songs are also a source of further profit — Yankovic splits his royalties with the songwriters .
But Yankovic 's 2003 album , Poodle Hat , was crippled when Eminem refused to authorize a video for a " Lose Yourself " parody called " Couch Potato . "
Yankovic had already secured permission for the song , but Eminem nixed the video at the last minute .
" I did n't have a direct line to him , " Yankovic says .
" I could n't pick up the phone and say , ' Hey man , what 's your problem ? ' "
Poodle
Hat would be Yankovic 's lowest - selling effort in almost two decades , and though he could still book months - long tours , it seemed that Yankovic was becoming a nostalgia act .
Weird Al Yankovic " Couch Potato "
Then , in the middle of this commercial lull , his parents died from carbon monoxide poisoning , the result of a closed fireplace flue .
Yankovic got the news while he was on tour — he had a show scheduled for that evening in Appleton , Wisconsin .
He went onstage anyway , continuing the tour for nearly seventy tour dates .
" It wound up being a good thing for me to continue working through it , " he says .
" Because if I did n't have anything to distract me , I probably would have spiraled into an even deeper depression .
For a couple of hours each night , I could go onstage and put on a big fake smile and pretend like everything was just OK . "
A few days after my visit to Yankovic 's house , we 're in the Las Vegas airport , where he has arrived to begin a 47 - stop summer tour .
As he walks through baggage claim , he points to a casino advertisement featuring the grinning visage of Carrot Top .
" Remember how I told you that music parody was the lowest form of comedy ? " he says .
" I forgot about prop comics . "
The next day , we 're at the Henderson Pavilion , a 6,000 - person concert hall about 13 miles from the Strip .
Yankovic heads to his dressing room to get ready ; meanwhile , I wait in the Pavilion hallway .
A group of stormtroopers loiter nearby , helmets in hand .
He enlisted members of the 501st Legion — " the world 's definitive Imperial Costuming Organization " — to perform a kick line during " The Saga Begins , " his 1999 Lucasfilm homage , and the troopers are going over their cues .
Darth Vader is here , too , but just as we 're talking about Yankovic 's exalted stature within the Star Wars community , the Sith Lord is interrupted by a cell phone call .
Shortly after 8 pm , Yankovic walks to the front of the stage , accordion in hand and one eyebrow raised deviously .
For the most part , he 'll play recent material , along with a few early hits like " Eat It " and " Yoda . "
But the highlight of the evening is when Yankovic dons a red doo-rag , Segways onto the stage , and proceeds to rap " White & Nerdy . "
The audience members — most of whom fit the song 's titular demographic — let out a cheer and start head - bobbing awkwardly to the music .
Just when he needed it , " Nerdy " gave Yankovic a pan-generational hit — a song that not only appealed to younger listeners but also reminded first - wave fans that they had n't outgrown a well - placed Star Trek joke .
When the song was released in 2006 , more than seven years had elapsed since Yankovic 's last big single , a pre-Poodle Hat spoof of Puff Daddy's " It 's All About the Benjamins , " dubbed " It 's All About the Pentiums . "
Like that song , " Nerdy " intertwined the languages of both hip hop and the Web , two entities that barely existed when Yankovic started his career but that have since replaced pop music and television as his favorite muses .
Indeed , while Yankovic released " Pentiums " primarily through traditional channels like MTV and VH1 , " Nerdy " debuted on the Internet .
His video for the single was a bombardment of geek lifestyle jokes ( making edits to Wikipedia , pointing to the rims on his Prius ) , and it went viral instantly .
It remains a fixture among YouTube 's most - viewed clips .
But that 's just the problem :
The Internet celebrates his dorky inclinations and his videos — just as it celebrates anyone with a song gag and a webcam .
Today on YouTube you can find homemade parodies of everything from Usher 's " Love in This Club " ( " Scrub in the Tub , " " Lunch in This Pub " ) to Rihanna 's " Umbrella " ( " My Nutella " ) .
This situation is complicated by the demise of the megastar :
Hit songs are now heard by fewer people , and they come and go much more quickly .
Chamillionaire 's " Ridin ' " may have been a chart - topper — but only for a matter of weeks , not months .
" Nerdy " succeeded anyway , and to understand why , it helps to look at the zip file that Yankovic forwarded me before we got to the Henderson .
It contained hundreds of pages of lyrics , notes , and various working drafts of the songs on his latest album , Straight Outta Lynwood .
In the final version of " White & Nerdy , " Yankovic sings that he 's " Got people beggin ' for my top eight spaces / I know pi to a thousand places . "
Earlier versions include : " Got people killin ' for my top eight spaces , " " Gotta lotta Hobbits in my top eight spaces , " " Got Stephen Hawking in my top eight spaces . "
All told , there are more than 200 unused lines for " White & Nerdy . "
By the time he was finished , he 'd reclaimed Chamillionaire 's original so thoroughly , listeners did n't even need to know " Ridin ' " to appreciate " Nerdy . "
But diligence and high - production videos take time , and the industry that once spurned him as a singles artist has itself shifted toward quick - hit singles .
Yankovic 's years - long lag between albums now seems like an eternity , especially when compared with the first responders on the Web , who can work up a spoof — even if it 's bad — before the flavor of the month has come and gone .
" If anybody writes a bad review , " Yankovic says , " the first thing they say is , ' He 's doing Pussycat Dolls songs ?
Are they still relevant ? ' "
Toward the end of the Henderson show , Yankovic slips into the changing area and an assistant pulls out his final , most daunting costume of the night : the " Fat " suit .
For those who have never seen Yankovic 's Grammy - winning " Fat " video , the " Fat " suit is a pear - shaped wonder , a black ensemble adorned with excess buckles and zippers .
The finishing touch is a grotesque prosthetic triple chin .
Once transformed , Yankovic looks a bit like Tweedledee — if Tweedledee landed a job at a biker bar .
As the song 's vamping bass line starts , Yankovic waddles his way through the curtain and executes a series of groin - grabs choreographed to cartoon sound effects .
By this point in the evening , he 's been running around in the hot desert air for almost two hours , but here he is , flailing about under layers of foam rubber , a roly - poly monument to comedic dedication .
SHANGHAI  Hong Kong food inspectors have found eggs imported from northeast China to be contaminated with high levels of melamine , the toxic industrial additive at the heart of an adulteration scandal in Chinese milk products .
The findings , reported over the weekend , have raised new concerns that a far wider array of China - produced foods than previously believed could be contaminated with melamine , which has already sickened more than 50,000 children in China and led to at least four deaths .
Scientists in China worry that in addition to being used to adulterate dairy supplies , melamine may have been intentionally added to animal feed in China , according to a report published on Sunday in South China Morning Post .
Tainted chicken and possibly fish and hog feed could result in poisonous meat and seafood , it said .
China is struggling to cope with a milk scandal that has devastated its fast - growing dairy industry and led to a global recall of foods that were made using Chinese dairy products , including pizza , biscuits , yogurt and other goods .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - The United States has plundered global wealth by exploiting the dollar ’s dominance , and the world urgently needs other currencies to take its place , a leading Chinese state newspaper said on Friday .
The front - page commentary in the overseas edition of the People ’s Daily said that Asian and European countries should banish the U.S. dollar from their direct trade relations for a start , relying only on their own currencies .
A meeting between Asian and European leaders , starting on Friday in Beijing , presented the perfect opportunity to begin building a new international financial order , the newspaper said .
The People ’s Daily is the official newspaper of China ’s ruling Communist Party .
The Chinese - language overseas edition is a small circulation offshoot of the main paper .
Its pronouncements do not necessarily directly voice leadership views .
But the commentary , as well as recent comments , amount to a growing chorus of Chinese disdain for Washington ’s economic policies and global financial dominance in the wake of the credit crisis .
“ The grim reality has led people , amidst the panic , to realize that the United States has used the U.S. dollar ’s hegemony to plunder the world ’s wealth , ” said the commentator , Shi Jianxun , a professor at Shanghai ’s Tongji University .
Shi , who has before been strident in his criticism of the U.S. , said other countries had lost vast amounts of wealth because of the financial crisis , while Washington ’s sole concern had been protecting its own interests .
“ The U.S. dollar is losing people ’s confidence .
The world , acting democratically and lawfully through a global financial organization , urgently needs to change the international monetary system based on U.S. global economic leadership and U.S. dollar dominance , ” he wrote .
Shi suggested that all trade between Europe and Asia should be settled in euros , pounds , yen and yuan , though he did not explain how the Chinese currency could play such a role since it is not convertible on the capital account .
A two - day Asia - Europe Meeting ( ASEM ) of 27 EU member states and 16 Asian countries was set to open on Friday .
Though few analysts expect much in the way of concrete agreements , Shi said it could prove momentous .
“ How can Europe and Asia grasp each other ’s hands and together confront the once - in - a - century global financial crisis sparked by the U.S. ; how can they construct a new equitable and safe international financial order ? ” he said .
“ The world is waiting for this Asian - European meeting to achieve big results in financial cooperation . ”

ST . LOUIS , Missouri ( CNN ) --
Polls in five crucial battleground states in the race for the White House released Wednesday suggest that Sen. Barack Obama is making some major gains .
Sen .
Barack Obama has gained ground in key toss - up states , polls show .
The CNN / Time Magazine / Opinion Research Corp. polls of likely voters in Florida , Minnesota , Missouri , Nevada and Virginia suggest a shift toward the Democratic presidential nominee .
In Florida , the state that decided the 2000 presidential election , 51 percent of likely voters say Obama , D - Illinois , is their choice for president , with 47 percent backing Republican presidential nominee John McCain .
The last CNN poll taken in Florida two weeks ago showed the race for the state 's 27 electoral votes tied at 48 percent apiece among registered voters .
A new CNN poll of polls in Florida , also out Wednesday , has Obama leading McCain by 5 points .
The CNN poll of polls is an average of the new CNN poll and other new state polls .
" The campaign season is like the hurricane season , " said Bill Schneider , CNN 's senior political analyst .
" Florida lies directly in its path .
Hurricane Obama hit Florida , and Hurricane McCain .
Tropical Storms Biden and Palin made landfall in the Sunshine State .
The impact ?
Over the last two weeks , Barack Obama has been gaining support in Florida . "
Watch Bill Schneider 's report on shifts in key battleground states . »
Obama 's also making gains over McCain in Minnesota , the state in which the Republican convention was held a month ago .
Fifty - four percent of those questioned are backing Obama , with 43 percent supporting McCain , R - Arizona .
That 11 - point lead is much larger than the 2 - point advantage Obama had in the last CNN poll taken in Minnesota a month ago .
It 's a similar story in Missouri , where 49 percent of those polled are backing Obama and 48 percent supporting McCain .
That 's a gain for Obama , who was down 5 points to McCain in CNN 's last poll in Missouri , taken three weeks ago .
The only other new poll in Missouri , a Research 2000 survey , indicates McCain ahead by 1 point .
Thursday 's vice presidential debate will be in St. Louis , Missouri .
The poll also indicates Obama has a 4 - point lead over McCain in Nevada , 51 - 47 percent .
CNN 's last survey in Nevada , taken in late August , had McCain up slightly .
A new American Research Group poll in Nevada puts McCain ahead by 2 points .
In Virginia , which has n't voted for the Democrats in a presidential contest since 1964 , the new poll suggests Obama has a 9 - point lead , 53 - 44 percent .
The last CNN survey in Virginia , taken in mid-September , had McCain up by 4 points .
But it 's a slightly different story in American Research Group 's new survey in Virginia , which indicates McCain has a 3 - point lead .
Watch ' The Situation Room ' break down the numbers »
What 's behind this shift for Obama ?
" Obama has gained ground among moderates in all five states , " said CNN polling director Keating Holland .
" That may have something to do with the first presidential debate .
Some commentators knocked Obama for agreeing with McCain as often as he did , but moderates tend to like it when candidates appear willing to see the other side 's point of view . "
" In most states , Obama also won support from senior citizens and voters making more than $ 75,000 .
Those are two groups who may have been hardest hit by the recent problems in the stock market and the financial community , " Holland added .
" Economic jitters may not last if Congress passes legislation in the next few days , but there may have been short - term gains for Obama as a result of the current economic problems . "

The new CNN / Time Magazine / Opinion Research Corp. polls are behind a shift in the CNN Electoral College Map.
CNN is moving Minnesota and its 10 electoral votes , from toss - up to leaning toward Obama .
And Missouri , with 11 electoral votes , is shifting from leaning toward McCain to toss - up .
With those moves , CNN estimates that if the presidential election were held today , Obama would win states with 250 electoral votes and McCain would win states with 189 electoral votes , with 99 electoral votes still up for grabs .
To win the White House , 270 electoral votes are needed .
Obama 's lead is up from 40 points in CNN 's last electoral map updated last week .
The poll also expanded to include three third - party candidates : independent candidate Ralph Nader , Libertarian candidate Bob Barr and Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney .
Except for a 3 - percent showing by Nader in Florida and a 4 - percent showing by Nader in Nevada , no one registered more than 2 percent in any survey .
The CNN / Time Magazine / Opinion Research Corp. polls were conducted September 28 - 30 , with 940 registered voters and 770 likely votes in Florida ; 929 registered voters and 849 likely voters in Minnesota ; 951 registered voters and 744 likely voters in Missouri ; 924 registered voters and 684 likely voters in Nevada ; and 925 registered voters and 684 likely voters in Virginia , all questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points in Florida , Minnesota and Missouri , and 4 percentage points in Nevada and Virginia .

India recently introduced a nationwide ban on smoking in public spaces .
The BBC's Geeta Pandey joined an enforcement team in the capital , Delhi , to see if the new law is being taken seriously .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement At New Delhi railway station , signboards now announce that it's a smoke - free zone .
" Smoking and spitting are strictly prohibited in this area , " the boards say .
This is one of India 's biggest railway stations and is used by nearly half a million people daily .
Thousands of people crowd the platforms .
I 'm here with a team of anti-tobacco enforcers from the Delhi authorities who are looking for people violating the ban on smoking in public places which came into effect on 2 October .
It covers an exhaustive list of places which are defined as public .
Surprise visits
" We are yet to do a review of how the ban 's doing , but we 've got positive reports from various states and it's quite satisfactory , " says Dhiraj Singh , a health ministry official .
In Delhi , officials say , they are working hard to enforce the ban .
Anti-smoking squads pay surprise visits to restaurants and pubs , bars and offices , hop inside buses and raid the railway stations .
Taxi driver Babu says he will smoke when no one 's watching
The team this afternoon at New Delhi station is headed by Dr RP Vashishth .
He says since the ban , fewer people are lighting up in public .
" Now that a lot of awareness has been created in the country , now that the raiding squads are going from place to place , the violations have come down in numbers .
" The government of Delhi has declared the city to be totally smoke - free by 2009 .
So we are going in phases , to ensure the ban is complied with .
We are here to enforce the rules , to see that there are no violations . "
The first catch of the day is a woman sitting in a crowd who has just lit up a beedi - a small hand - rolled cigarette common in India .
The enforcement team swoops .
It 's clear she has not heard of the ban .
She folds her hands and apologises .
She is let off with a warning - do n't ever smoke in public again .
" Unlike in England where legal awareness is high and compliance is high , in India awareness and literacy are very low , so it 's important to create awareness , " explains Dr Vashishth .
Sceptic
Our next offender is a taxi driver , Babu .
" Do n't you know it 's illegal to smoke in public ?
You 'll have to pay a fine of 200 rupees ( $ 4 ) , " Dr Vashishth chastises him .
" Sorry sir , I do n't have 200 rupees .
I 'm a poor man .
Please give me a concession , " Babu pleads .
Dr Vashishth says fewer people are smoking in public since the ban Dr Vashishth advises him to quit smoking .
" It 's not good for your health or that of the others around you , " he tells him .
Babu nods in agreement .
He is let off with a reduced fine of 30 rupees .
But as soon as the raiding squad leaves , he makes his scepticism known .
" I respect the team here .
They know I do n't have much money so they reduced the fine for me .
I know smoking is banned here , but what can I do ?
I 'm addicted .
As to whether I 'll smoke in public in future , I 'll just have to be careful .
If no one 's watching , I will . "
The next man the raiding squad catches is visibly angry .
He refuses to give his name to the officers and begins to argue with them .
The officers threaten to arrest him and send him to jail .
In the end , he gives in .
He has to borrow money from a friend to pay the fine .
" There are people from different sections of society .
You have to fine them accordingly .
You ca n't expect everyone to pay 200 rupees , " says Dr Kamaljeet Singh Bansal , who is part of the raiding team .
' Sorry ' " Sometimes we encounter hostility too .
People get violent .
Then we have to take help from the police .
Most offenders comply once the police arrive , " he says .
As the team is coming to the end of their shift , they chance upon an old man smoking a cigarette .
Mr Moitra says he will never smoke in public again " I did n't know I could n't smoke even in the open area , " the man , BN Noitra says .
" There is no board here , nothing that tells us that we can't smoke here .
But these officials came and fined me 50 rupees , " he says .
" It was a mistake .
I 'm sorry I will not do it again , " he says .
As the anti-smoking raids have become a regular feature in many Delhi areas in the past fortnight , the smokers are finding out the hard way that lighting up in public can be a very expensive proposition .
For the raiding squad , it has been a successful day - they have been able to get the message across to the smokers that the ban is here to stay .
It is being taken seriously , at least in Delhi .

Read On To Discover The Ab Myths Which Many So Called Experts Have No Idea About ... Dear Friend ,
My name is David Grisaffi and since 1994 , I 've been an exercise specialist , strength coach and personal trainer , working with all types of people from professional boxers to housewives who want to get rid of cellulite .
I 'm certified by the International Sports Sciences Association and also by the prestigious Chek Institute as a Corrective High Performance Exercise Kinesiologist , Health and Lifestyle Coach and Golf Biomechanics Pro. I 'm also one of only 37 trainers in the United States to hold all of these credentials .
Now You Can Have Strong , Athletic ,
Rock - Hard Abs ( No Sit Ups Required !!!)
My system is unique because it does n't require hundreds of crunches or expensive equipment , and believe it or not , there 's not a single sit up in any of my workouts .
Even more importantly , my program will not only give you the six pack abs you want , it will also give you a powerful , athletic midsection while reducing low back pain and loosening up stiff muscles and joints .
These techniques are not theories ; they 've been scientifically tested and proven in the sports training and rehabilitation world for decades .
Although many of these methods have remained closely guarded secrets within the inner circle of elite strength coaches and physical therapists , I 've now taken the complicated biomechanics , anatomy and physiology of abdominal reduction and translated it into a simple , practical , photo - filled guidebook to developing strong , rock - hard abs ... that can be used by anyone !
" David is a dedicated , intelligent sports conditioning professional with a demonstrated ability to obtain results with his clients .
He is highly qualified to work with anyone at any level .
He has my unqualified recommendation "
Charles I. Staley
Vice President of Program Development ,
International Sports Sciences Association
" David has put together a very unique strengthening , conditioning and muscle - developing core program - not just another generic " get six pack abs " abdominal course .
This is the first time in a long while that I 've seen an abdominal program that 's not centered on the usual sit ups and crunches .
In fact , there 's not a single sit up in the entire course .
David included quite a bit of nutrition info in his book too , but in my opinion , the real strong point is the core training information , the unique exercises , and the 7 routines , which progress from beginner up to " athlete " level .

I have had the honor to have worked with many of the SF 49er football team members for over a period of ( 13 ) yrs ..
Also , celebrity athletes , including Olympic gold metalists , World record holding powerlifters , Champion bodybuilders , and World class martial artists , as well as Champion marathon competitors .
I have selectively used : Firm & Flatten Your Abs : over the last few yrs . with many of these elite athletes with outstanding results .
In my professional career , with exposure to the best training programs available , nothing , & I do mean no training program remotely compares to David Grisaffi's " Firm & Flatten Your Abs " course .
In my opinion , put all of your other ab training programs in storage , as you will only need David 's program in the future .

Introducing " FIRM AND FLATTEN YOUR ABS " A Scientifically - Proven , Gimmick - Free Abdominal Program That Improves Form , Function and Fitness WITHOUT Sit-ups Or Expensive Machines According to the latest statistics , $ 518 million dollars a year is made from the sale of exercise equipment through infomercials ... and get this : $ 207 million of that is from abdominal machines alone !
If you add the sales of fat burning and ' stomach slimming ' supplements into the kitty , the total ' abdominal ' marketplace rises to a staggering $ 1.2 billion per year !
( and I 'm not even counting ' diet programs ! ' )
The last time I surfed through the TV channels , I flipped through TWO infomercials for abdominal machines , and TWO diet programs all running at the same time .
There are so many of them , that if you got suckered into every ab training or diet gimmick on the market today , you 'd go broke faster than a lightning strike .
These Ads Are Poisoning Your Brain
With Dangerous Information !
This problem is so bad today , that my job of educating people has become like digging a trench in the sand with a sewing needle .
You see , before I can even begin to teach you the TRUTH about getting muscular abs and losing fat , I have to UN - TEACH all the LIES , MYTHS and RUMORS .
This is one of the reasons I created this program , instead of just teaching one on one in my studio .
The very first thing I do in FIRM AND FLATTEN YOUR ABS is to get all that garbage out of your brain , by revealing the 14 most common AB training myths .
But I 'm getting ahead of myself Let Me First Show You
What this Program is NOT Because of all the rampant misinformation even among so - called professional trainers - you should be skeptical about ALL AB training equipment and programs .
That 's why I do n't blame you if you 're skeptical about THIS one too .
You 've heard it all and seen it all before , right ?
Well mark my words , FIRM AND FLATTEN YOUR ABS is NOT the same old rehashed crunch , leg raise , AB roller , sit up routines you read about in the muscle and fiction magazines .
In fact , it 's nothing like you 've EVER seen before
Let me prove it to you by showing you what my program does NOT contain : SIT UPS :
Sit ups , especially when your feet are anchored and you do the exercise rapidly , heavily recruit the hip flexor muscles , making sit ups mediocre at best , and dangerous at worst .
The pull on the lumbar spine can aggravate an existing back injury or even create a new one .
AB ROLLERS :
These gizmos are pitched as a safe way to ; protect your neck ; and improve your form .
The irony is that supporting your neck and head ultimately causes the opposite - your neck muscles never get used , so you get weaker and more prone to a painful and debilitating cervical injury .
INFOMERCIAL ABDOMINAL MACHINES : Every time a new AB contraption comes out , I get bombarded with emails ; This one looks different What about this one David ? ;
The truth is , no AB machine has EVER been proven more effective than exercises you can perform with your own body .
AB machines simply do not work your muscles in a functional manner and they do NOTHING to remove fat from your stomach ( THAT is achieved through diet and a small dose of cardio ) .
ENDLESS REPETITIONS OF FLOOR CRUNCHES :
The crunch is a decent , but totally overused exercise .
If crunches are your primary exercise , you 're settling for mediocre results .
Excessive floor crunching can shorten your abdominal wall , pull your head forward and encourage poor posture .
Unless you like the hunchbacked Neanderthal look , you must integrate crunches into a more complete abdominal program .
STARVATION DIETS : Forget about starvation and crash diets
Flat abs come from proper nutrition as a long - term lifestyle .
And remember , nutrition goes hand in hand with exercise like two wheels on a bicycle .
If one wheel is flat , the other wheel wo n't take you anywhere .
Although FIRM AND FLATTEN YOUR ABS is not a " Diet " it will teach you how to combine exercise with nutrition to get the waistline you 've only dreamed of before .
FAT BURNING PILLS :
How much money have you flushed down the toilet on these ; miracles in a bottle ? '
If you 're like most people , your tab is well into the hundreds or even thousands of dollars .
The entire concept of taking pills to ; burn fat ; is misguided because pills only treat symptoms – they do n't remove causes .
Without lifestyle changes , even the most powerful fat loss drug on the planet can't help you in the long runEventually , you 'll always gain back what you lost , plus interest .
Are You GUILTY Of Wasting Your Time
With These Ineffective Approaches ?
If so , PLEASE STOP !!!
An old Turkish proverb says ,
" No matter how long you 've been traveling down the wrong road , TURN BACK !
Firm And Flatten Your Abs is NO gimmick - it is the scientifically - proven road to results , based on physiologically , biomechanically and medically - correct exercise and lifestyle principles ... and doctors agree :
" I am 45 years and I have been going to fitness clubs for 20 years and always I have tried to understand / learn / improve my abs exercises .
I have to say that during these 20 years nobody , I mean all the trainers I met in those clubs were able to provide me with an efficient / healthy routine for my abs that work over time .
Most of them worked for a short period of time and ended up with pain in the low back or just barely ripped my abs short lived .
During 2008
I read in the web about David Grisaffi and bought his book , Flatten your Abs .
I took the time to read it very consciously and found that it was written in a very professional way , with a solid technical background .
I decided to do the routines and after 2 months of following the instructions I did manage to increase the strength of my core abs muscles substantially .
It was impressive how it improved my strength to do things like lifting a heavy box from the floor , carrying my child on your back , lifting weights in the gym , playing tennis etc etc , all activities / exercises that involve abs muscles of the trunk .
At same time with a strict diet I did get a better definition of the famous six packs .
Since then I have continued doing those routines , varying them from time to time as you have plenty of them in the book and my strength has continued to improve and I never had a low back pain .

" I have worked with many personal trainers for many years and of all of them David has been by far the best and most educated .
He is well trained , well organized , committed to his profession and a delightful man to know and work with .
I highly recommend him and his new eBook based on the great results I have experienced in my over all well being and the improvements made in my level of fitness . "
Jackson L. Haverly , M.D. Okay , David , So What The Heck DOES work ???
Now that you know what gimmicks and scams avoid , you 're probably thinking , ; Well , that rules out just about everything what the heck does that leave ? ;
Glad you asked , because FIRM AND FLATTEN YOUR ABS is everything that conventional fat loss and abdominal training systems are NOT FIRM AND FLATTEN YOUR ABS IS Precision , pre-training muscle strength testing and fitness assessment

Targeted exercises for every muscle in your core ( not just abs )
Strategic variation using a wide variety of exercises
Scientific core conditioning and integration to armor plate your body from injury
Individualized and proper progression from beginner to advanced stage
Scientific Exercise Sequencing

Let 's take a quick look at each : Precision Muscle Testing & Evaluation - The Secret To Designing
Safe and Personalized Exercise Programs
The first thing I 'll do is show you a few tests you can use to quickly and easily evaluate your current abdominal strength and condition .
If you jump in at the advanced level without building a foundation first , you could be asking for major trouble .
If you 've ever tried Swiss ball or ; core ; exercises and felt pain , that 's an indication that your body was n't ready for movements that advanced .
I 'll teach you exactly where to begin – safely and for maximum effects – and reveal when you are ready to move to the next level .
Targeted Exercises For Every Muscle
In Your Core
If you 're doing nothing but crunches or abdominal machines , you 're already plummeting down a slippery slope towards poor posture , muscle dysfunction and injury .
Crunches are fine , but when was the last time you did a multifidus exercise ?
How about one for the transversus abdominus ?
What about your internal obliques ?
External Obliques ?
Spinal erectors ?
Do you even know where these muscles are located and how they function ?
Do you do any exercises that help you integrate your arms , legs and core in a coordinated total body movement ?
Do you understand the difference between spinal flexion and hip flexion ?
Dynamic and Isometric contractions ?
If the answer is no , then listen up : Even if you lose the fat , you will still suffer from a weak and distended lower abdominal area unless you strengthen ALL the muscles in your midsection ( deep and superficial ) , collectively known as your ; core . ;
This is why some people with low body fat still have protruding " pooch bellies . "
" Even After 3 C- sections , I Now Have Definition ,
I 've Lost 40 lbs , The Loose Skin Is Almost Gone
And My Stomach Looks Great ! "
Six months ago , I was contemplating getting a tummy tuck .
After 3 - C sections and 2 stomach operations , I had no stomach muscles and could n't get rid of my " pouch " .
I had tried everything , every exercise for the stomach there was .
Nothing worked .
At that time , I had purchased " Burn The Fat " by Tom Venuto .
After a few e-mails between us , he recommended your exercise program to me .
After words of encouragement and motivation from you and Tom , I made a decision .
I called the Doctor and canceled my operation .
My goal was to stay committed to your exercise program , Tom 's diet plan and to myself .
David , its been six months and I have lost 40 pounds , and my stomach looks great !
Because of your great core exercises , I now have stomach definition and the loose skin is almost gone !
The muscles and strength I now have is amazing .
My Doctor is very impressed to say the least .
Thirty days into the program I could see and tell things were happening .
I have recommended your program to many of my friends and even my personal trainer .
They too are amazed at their results .
Thank you for your words of encouragement .
Best Advice I have ever taken .
You have truly helped me change my life . "

Strengthen And Injury - Proof Your Lower Back With
Scientific Abdominal And Core Conditioning
You may have seen bodybuilders and fitness cover models with ; six pack ; abs that looked mighty impressive .
However , appearances can be deceiving .
; You 're only as strong as your weakest link ; is clichéd but 100 % true .
Without a foundation of functional strength under the facade of ; pretty ; abs , you are vulnerable to muscle strains , disc herniations , Sciatic nerve pain or other injuries that could knock you out of commission for months .
My clients , on the other hand , have that incredible washboard - abs look AND the punch - proof stability , functional strength and raw power to back it up .
" I first began doing this program when I was training for my world title fight .
I had no idea that working with the core could make my punches sting and I could create more power .
Just Do It !
It works "
Greg Haugen ,
4 times World Champion Boxer The Secret of Individualized Progression
And Scientific Exercise Sequencing
If you 're a beginner or if you have any injuries or physical limitations , you must work though the exercises in the proper sequence to develop muscle control , coordination and stability before moving to the advanced stuff .
If you do n't even have the basics mastered , then following a routine you found in a magazine at random could be a disaster waiting to happen .
I 'd love to be able to work with you in my studio in Tacoma , Washington , and in fact , if you 're local , feel free to call me for information at ( 253 ) 383-5370 .
However , the reality is , I do n't know you personally and I wo n't get to meet most of the people who purchase this course online .
Since I can't evaluate you in person – I 've included guidelines in my program to show you how to test yourself for the proper starting level and to individualize your program .
You 'll also know exactly when to make the move up to the next level .
Nutrition Secrets For Maximum Fat Loss
And a Slim Waistline
Exercising without the right diet is like bailing water out of a boat with a thimble – it can be done , but it will take an awful long timeand if your ; boat ; has a hole in it , you may sink before you ever complete the chore .
Listen : Abdominal exercises do NOT burn fat .
A caloric deficit is what burns fat !
That 's why I did n't stop with just exercise .
FIRM AND FLATTEN YOUR ABS is not a diet book , but it would n't be complete without nutrition information .
You 're kidding yourself if you think AB exercises are all it takes to get the waistline you want You MUST eat properly !
" I have a great deal of respect for the training methods David taught to me .
I 've had many personal trainers but they all seem to have me lift like a bodybuilder .
Being a woman and in a highly competitive sport , the functional training David applied worked fantastic for improvement in all facets of my bowling .
His eBook is a great help while I 'm on the road too .
I have shared David 's exercises with many of my clients and they love it . "

I ’ve been tinkering a little more with the Beust Challenge , following up on my previous post .
There are a couple significant new developments to report .
First , Hynek ( Pichi ) Vychodil wrote a faster version using a permutation generator .
Second , I also ported the first “ CrazyBob ” solution using a bit mask to Erlang .
Third , I discovered that my overly literal ports were actually slowing things down .
The CrazyBob code uses an unspecified Listener class that receives the numbers in the series , and presumably computes the actual results from there .
( Aside , I cannot actually benchmark against the Java code because I have n’t found what this implementation is . )
I fudged this in my original ports by simply spawning a process , which then discarded all the messages it received .
After I noticed that the code was pegging both of my CPUs , though , I realized that message passing might actually be the bottleneck in my code .
Turns out this was the case , and removing the listener process and just computing the results in the main process actually sped things up substantially .
Finally , I got access to a machine with HiPE enabled .
So ... here ’s the results .
First on my MacBook Pro , without HiPE :
log( Max ) Original bitmask crazybob pichi 4 8 ms 2ms 3ms 3ms 5 65 ms 11ms 13 ms 14ms 6 632ms 52ms 69 ms 62ms 7 6.7s 253ms 303ms 272ms 8 72s 1.0s 1.0s 945ms 9 18 m 4.7s 3.6s 2.8s 10 ( 3h ) 13 s 7.8s 5.3s
The bitmask solution starts out the fastest , but loses out in the end to the more clever solutions .
pichi edges out the crazybob solution by about a third .
Now on Linux 2.6 with HiPE :
log( Max ) Original bitmask crazybob pichi 4 4ms < 1 ms 1ms 2ms 5 50 ms 1ms 6 ms 7ms 6 608 ms 7ms 34ms 37ms 7 6.9s 35 ms 160ms 174ms 8 78s 147ms 619ms 563ms 9 ( 18 m ) 460 ms 1.8s 1.4s 10 ( 3h ) 1.1s 4.2s 2.4s
And our new winner is ... bitmask !
HiPE barely helps the original brute - force solutions at all , while crazybob and pichi gain about a factor of two .
bitmask , on the other hand , picks up an order of magnitude , and is now only a factor of 3 slower than the posted results for the Java crazybob solution ( with unknown differences in hardware ) .
Conclusion : Erlang does n’t suck !
All Cindy McCain had to do was make on online request and they were delivered .
She made her decision to solve the lack of cell phone service , when McCain launched his presidential bid .
Cindy had requested one for their 15 acre ranch near Sedona .
She received not just one tower but two , one from Verizon and the other from AT&T .
Washington
Post has the exclusive .
Verizon delivered a portable tower know as a “ cell site on wheels ” — free of charge — to Cindy McCain ’s property in June in response to an online request from Cindy McCain ’s staff early last year .
Such devices are usually reserved for restoring service when cell coverage is knocked out during emergencies , such as hurricanes .
In July , AT&T followed suit , wheeling in a portable tower for free to match Verizon ’s offer .
“ This is an unusual situation , ” said AT&T spokeswoman Claudia B. Jones .
“ You ca n’t have a presidential nominee in an area where there is not cell coverage . ”
Over the course of the past year , Cindy McCain had offered land for a permanent cell tower and Verizon embarked on an expensive process to meet her needs , hiring contractors and seeking county land - use permits even though few people other than the McCains would benefit from the tower .
Ethics lawyers said Cindy McCain ’s dealings with the wireless companies stand out because Sen.
John McCain is a senior member of the Senate Commerce Committee , which oversees the Federal Communications Commission and the telecommunications industry .
He has been a leading advocate for industry - backed legislation , fighting regulations and taxes on telecommunications services .
McCain and his campaign have close ties to Verizon and AT&T .
Five campaign officials , including campaign manager Rick Davis , have worked as lobbyists for Verizon .
Former McCain staffer Robert Fisher is an in - house lobbyist for Verizon and is volunteering for the campaign .
Fisher , Verizon chief executive Ivan Seidenberg and company lobbyists have raised more than $ 1.3 million for McCain ’s presidential campaign and Verizon employees are among the top 20 corporate donors over McCain ’s political career , giving more than $ 155,000 to his campaigns .
McCain ’s Senate chief of staff Mark Buse , senior strategist Charles R. Black Jr. , and several other campaign staffers have registered as AT&T lobbyists in the past .
AT&T Executive Vice President Timothy McKone and AT&T lobbyists have raised more than $ 2.3 million for McCain .
AT&T employees have donated more than $ 325,000 to McCain campaigns , putting the company in the No. 3 spot for career donations to McCain , according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .
“ It raises the aura of special consideration for somebody because he is a member of the Senate , ” said Stanley Brand , a former House counsel for Democrats and an ethics attorney who represents politicians of both parties .
“ Here is a guy who is campaigning as Mr. Maverick and Mr. Reformer and he keeps skirting the edge . ”
McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers said the senator is not a regulator and Cindy McCain received no favors from Verizon .
A few days back President Bush ‘ requested ‘ that the Justice Department intervene in the vote challenge dispute in Ohio .
This is after Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner won the dispute in the courts .
Now comes word that the DOJ will likely to pass on the president ’s suggestion .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Saturn ’s rings may be more massive and older than previously thought , researchers said on Tuesday .
The most detailed look ever at Saturn 's rings , obtained by the Cassini spacecraft , is shown in this handout image released by NASA May 24 , 2005 .
REUTERS / NASA /JPL
Findings to be presented at the European Planetary Science Congress in Germany bolster the possibility that the rings were formed billions of years ago .
Because the rings appear so clean and bright , some scientists had argued the they were much younger than Saturn , possible as little as 100 million years .
But closer examination shows the rings are rougher than they look .
“ Because they are clumpy , the previous estimates of the mass of the rings are incorrect , ” Larry Esposito of the University of Colorado said in a telephone interview .
“ With more mass they can be older and still appear bright . ”
The rings encircling Saturn are one of the most dramatic features of the solar system .
The other gaseous planets in the solar system -- Jupiter , Uranus and Neptune -- also are encircled by rings , but they are not as spectacular .
There is scientific debate over the origins of Saturn ’s rings .
One idea is that the material that makes up the rings is debris from collisions involving moons orbiting the giant planet .
Another theory holds that the rings were formed at the same time as Saturn and from some of the same material that created the second - largest planet in the solar system .
Using a computer model and information from the U.S. - European Cassini spacecraft mission , Esposito and his team simulated colliding particles in Saturn ’s rings and their erosion by meteorites .
“ Both Cassini observations and theoretical calculations can allow the rings of Saturn to be billions of years old , ” Esposito said in a statement .

Fiat money is not directly convertible into a physical commodity at a specified amount .
It is a type of credit money through which a central bank issues notes in exchange for interest - paying bonds by the government .
The interest on these bonds is paid by the government primarily through the process of taxation .
That is to say , by you and me .
Since the interest plus the principle always exceeds the initial amount borrowed , the government must continually borrow more money , at additional interest , in order to repay the central bank , thus beginning an ever - increasing spiral of debt .
Eventually , the system collapses once the fiat money becomes worthless when the government is unable or unwilling to support its value through taxation .
Until then , the government creditors are able to accumulate extreme amounts of wealth .
" By a continuing process of inflation , government can confiscate , secretly and unobserved , an important part of the wealth of their citizens . "
( John Maynard Keynes , chief architect of the modern - day economic system )
All modern currencies are fiat money .
The US dollar was the sole currency of the world linked to gold following the events of World War 2 .
It was agreed to during the Bretton Wood Agreements made in July 1944 that all currencies would trade against the US dollar within a defined trading band .
Countries would maintain their currency within this trading band by purchasing or selling US securities .
Only the US dollar was directly convertible to gold at the rate of US $ 35 to the troy ounce .
The reasons for the acceptance of the US dollar as the ' anchor currency ' was because American soil was largely untouched by destruction from the war leaving most of her manufacturing capacity intact , the arrival of the atomic bomb , and that US vaults held an estimated 65 % of the world 's gold reserves .
By the late 1960's , nations around the world became increasingly concerned about the ability of the United States to keep the price of gold at US $ 35 given America 's involvement in the Vietnam War and spiralling costs for Lyndon B. Johnson 's Great Society programs .
By 1970 , the US gold reserve had shrunk to 16 % of the world total and the US trade balance swung negative for the first time .
On August 15 , 1971 , President Richard Nixon unilaterally " closed the gold window " effectively taking the US dollar off the gold standard .
The following graphs show the dramatic declines in the values of paper money .
The Swiss Franc was the best - performing currency of the 20th century , losing only 80 % of its value .
One must wonder if it can be said that currencies float against one another .
It appears to be more of a case of them sinking at different rates .

Palin on Running Wasilla : “ It ’s Not Rocket Science ”

WASILLA , Alaska– I ’m here at the Mat - Su Frontiersman ‘s offices flipping through their print archives .
I was curious about what then - Mayor Sarah Palin said at the time about giving her top managers a loyalty test and eventually firing her chief of police .
I ’m reading an article from October 1996 , in which a reporter named Laura Mitchell Harris asks Palin about her intentions for a shake up .
How would she effectively run a city without experienced leaders ?
“ ” It ’s not rocket science , ” Palin said , “ It ’s $ 6 million and 53 employees . ”

Does Linux really want Windows users ?
Linux is often criticised for its over - enthusiastic community trying to convert everybody and their grandma .
Today I saw another post asking why we should care if more people use it .
In short : yes but I ’ve got plenty of reasons to back this up …
fieldyweb ’s posting can be reduced to a few bullets :
If they ’re happy using Windows ( et al ) , why should we care ?
If their apps do n’t work , why convert them ?
Why is there so much focus on making some environments so Windows - like ?
We [ Linux users ] know it does n’t all just work yet , so why push it ?
People should use what works best for them .
While I ca n’t promise to answer all of those , I can provide some reasons that I suggest Linux to people .
Most of them are marinated in a sticky layer of selfishness : it makes Linux better for me .
Reason 1 : SPAM
One reason I would voluntarily spend my life replacing Windows with Linux on “ ma ’n ’ pa ” computers is spam .
Some 70 - odd percent of spam comes from end - user computers infected with botnet viruses .
As I discovered when I asked if ISPs should be protecting us , Windows users are collectively one of the most detrimental forces on the Internet — not because of their actions — because of their computers .
The effects of botnets are felt on any platform ; spammers wo n’t assume you ’re penis is large enough as it is if you ’re using Linux .
Just imagine how friendly your inbox would be tomorrow if everybody installed Linux today .
Reason 2 : More users == more apps and drivers
I do n’t use Linux for the tree - hugging , arty - farty reasons that most super - evangelicals cite .
I use it because it ’s nearly a perfect balance in what I need from a computer .
Also as a developer myself , it ’s pretty exciting seeing something this big moving forward at such speed .
The barrier to entry for most people is the lack of their apps that work well under Linux .
Most people write it off as soon as they hear it does n’t run Windows apps and there ’s almost no commercial application support for Linux — a fact that exists because there are n’t enough Linux users to justify Linux development .
The exact same applies for consumer hardware .
More people using Linux and demanding Linux applications and hardware drivers from vendors will destroy the vicious circle …
And that ’s a good thing for everybody already on Linux .
Reason 3 : Trial by fire
I ’m fully aware that my computer is n’t without bugs so why would I try and push more people into using it ?
Because all software development works better with more eyes .
More feedback and bug reports translates into a better roadmap for the developers .
Even if users just test a LiveCD for a few hours , it ’s easy to find out what they did and did n’t like about it and how things can be improved .
This also has significant security ramifications .
Windows is the most targeted platform for viruses and malware because it ’s has a massive market share .
Hackers trawl through reverse - engineered code to find weaknesses and while it temporarily makes Windows less secure , patching these flaws makes it more secure .
I want it to improve and become even more secure , faster , for me .

A properly supervised trial eliminating colours and preservatives from the diet of hyperactive children should be considered a part of the standard treatment , says an editorial in the Although a substantial body of evidence shows a link between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and artificial food colourings and preservatives , removing them is still considered an alternative rather than a standard treatment for ADHD , writes Professor Andrew Kemp from the University of Sydney .
In contrast , despite a lack of evidence for its effectiveness , the use of alternative medicine is widespread -- up to 50 % of children attending tertiary children 's hospitals in the U.K. and Australia have used it in the past year .
Of the three main treatments for ADHD in children -- drugs , behavioural therapy , and dietary modification -- only drugs and dietary modification are supported by data from several trials .
Yet , behavioural therapy , which has no scientific evidence base , is still thought of as necessary for " adequate treatment " , he says .
So why , Kemp asks , despite evidence to the contrary , does the removal of food additives remain an alternative rather than a standard part of treatment for ADHD ?
Data published in 2007 showed that normal ( not hyperactive ) children were significantly more hyperactive after they ate a mixture of food colourings and a preservative ( sodium benzoate ) , with obvious implications for children with ADHD .
In light of these findings , the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) reviewed the evidence linking preservatives and colourings with hyperactive behaviours from 22 studies between 1975 and 1994 and two additional meta-analyses .16 of the studies reported positive effects in at least some of the children .
However , the EFSA pointed out that hyperactivity has a wide range of social and biological causes , and exclusively focusing on food additives may " detract from the provision of adequate treatment " for children with the disorder .
But , argues Kemp , to discount the accumulating evidence of dietary factors may also do this .
Increasing numbers of children are taking drugs for hyperactivity -- 2.4 % of children in the state of Western Australia .
Removing colours and preservatives is a relatively harmless intervention , so a properly supervised and evaluated trial period of eliminating them should be considered as part of the standard treatment , he concludes .
This study shows what alternative medicine has known for years .
Preservatives and additives in food have devastating effects on humans whether it manifests in the form of ADHD , cancers , neurological disorders , gastrointestinal disorders and other chronic illnessesSource : EurekAlert !

One of the annoying / fascinating things about quantum mechanics is the fact the world does n't seem to be quantum - mechanical .
When you look at something , it seems to have a location , not a superposition of all possible locations ; when it travels from one place to another , it seems to take a path , not a sum over all paths .
This frustration was expressed by no lesser a person than Albert Einstein , quoted by Abraham Pais , quoted in turn by David Mermin in a lovely article entitled " Is the Moon There when Nobody Looks ? " :
I recall that during one walk Einstein suddenly stopped , turned to me and asked whether I really believed that the moon exists only when I looked at it .
The conventional quantum - mechanical answer would be " Sure , the moon exists when you 're not looking at it .
But there is no such thing as ` the position of the moon ' when you are not looking at it . "
Nevertheless , astronomers over the centuries have done a pretty good job predicting eclipses as if there really was something called ` the position of the moon , ' even when nobody ( as far as we know ) was looking at it .
There is a conventional quantum - mechanical explanation for this , as well : the correspondence principle , which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics in the limit of a very large number of particles ( a macroscopic body ) approach those of classical Newtonian mechanics .
This is one of those vague but invaluable rules of thumb that was formulated by Niels Bohr back in the salad days of quantum mechanics .
If it sounds a little hand - wavy , that 's because it is .
The vagueness of the correspondence principle prods a careful physicist into formulating a more precise version , or perhaps coming up with counterexamples .
And indeed , counterexamples exist : namely , when the classical predictions for the system in question are chaotic .
In chaotic systems , tiny differences in initial conditions grow into substantial differences in the ultimate evolution .
It should n't come as any surprise , then , that it is hard to map the predictions for classically chaotic systems onto average values of predictions for quantum observables .
Essentially , tiny quantum uncertainties in the state of a chaotic system grow into large quantum uncertainties before too long , and the system is no longer accurately described by a classical limit , even if there are large numbers of particles .
Some years ago , Wojciech Zurek and Juan Pablo Paz described a particularly interesting real - world example of such a system : Hyperion , a moon of Saturn that features an irregular shape and a spongy surface texture .
The orbit of Hyperion around Saturn is fairly predictable ; happily , even for lumpy moons , the center of mass follows a smooth path .
But the orientation of Hyperion , it turns out , is chaotic -- the moon tumbles unpredictably as it orbits , as measured by Voyager 2 as well as Earth - based telescopes .
Its orbit is highly elliptical , and resonates with the orbit of Titan , which exerts a torque on its axis .
If you knew Hyperion 's orientation fairly precisely at some time , it would be completely unpredictable within a month or so ( the Lyapunov exponent is about 40 days ) .
More poetically , if you lived there , you would n't be able to predict when the Sun would next rise .
So -- is Hyperion oriented when nobody looks ?
Zurek and Paz calculate ( not recently -- this is fun , not breaking news ) that if Hyperion were isolated from the rest of the universe , it would evolve into a non-localized quantum state over a period of about 20 years .
It 's an impressive example of quantum uncertainty on a macroscopic scale .
Except that Hyperion is not isolated from the rest of the universe .
If nothing else , it 's constantly bombarded by photons from the Sun , as well as from the rest of the universe .
And those photons have their own quantum states , and when they bounce off Hyperion the states become entangled .
But there 's no way to keep track of the states of all those photons after they interact and go their merry way .
So when you speak about " the quantum state of Hyperion , " you really mean the state we would get by averaging over all the possible states of the photons we did n't keep track of .
And that averaging process -- considering the state of a certain quantum system when we have n't kept track of the states of the many other systems with which it is entangled -- leads to decoherence .
Roughly speaking , the photons bouncing off of Hyperion act like a series of many little " observations of the wavefunction , " collapsing it into a state of definite orientation .
So , in the real world , not only does this particular moon ( of Saturn ) exist when we 're not looking , it 's also in a pretty well - defined orientation -- even if , in a simple model that excludes the rest of the universe , its wave function would be all spread out after only 20 years of evolution .
As Zurek and Paz conclude , " Decoherence caused by the environment ... is not a subterfuge of a theorist , but a fact of life . "
( As if one could sensibly distinguish between the two . )
Update : Scientific American has been nice enough to publicly post a feature by Martin Gutzwiller on quantum chaos .
Thanks due to George Musser .
Now he has followed up with a third book reconstructing the agency ’s recent history .
“ The Shadow Factory : The Ultra- Secret NSA From 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America , ” due out on Tuesday from Doubleday , describes what he sees as the agency ’s failures in the months before the 2001 attacks and its overreaching on the orders of President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney afterward .
Two rank - and - file government eavesdroppers who spoke with Mr. Bamford gave interviews to ABC News , where he spent a decade as a producer ; the network reported Thursday on their claims of having intercepted private calls home from American military officers , aid workers , journalists and others in Iraq .
“ I do n’t think I ’ll be invited to any more N.S.A. Christmas parties , ” Mr. Bamford said , deadpan , sitting down for an interview this week in his Washington town house .
At 62 , bald and with a salt - and - pepper mustache , Mr. Bamford is so unflamboyant that it comes as a surprise to learn that for most of the 1990s he lived aboard a 60 - foot motor yacht called the Safe House , moored in a Potomac River marina .
His relationship with the National Security Agency might be compared to a long and rocky romance , in which fascination with his quarry ’s size and capabilities has alternated with horror at its power to invade privacy .
But he insists that he is no enemy of the United States ’ largest intelligence agency or its mission .
“ I have no problem whatsoever with their eavesdropping on terrorists in the U.S. , ” Mr. Bamford said .
“ But the law says they need a court warrant . ”
The book depicts the agency before 9/11 under Michael V. Hayden , a now - retired Air Force general who is currently the director of the Central Intelligence Agency , as excessively cautious about legally pursuing terrorists in the United States .
He attributes the wariness to the trauma that the agency suffered in the 1970s when a Senate committee exposed the agency ’s warrantless surveillance of thousands of Americans , including the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Jane Fonda .
CNN ’s Lou Dobbs can’t believe what ’s going on with the Kay Hagan / Elizabeth Dole story .
It ’s not that Dole is trying to smear her opponent by labeling her as a “ Godless American . ”
Dobbs is just shocked that there are such people who could be “ Godless Americans ” :
In case you missed it , Dobbs says the following in the video :
… There is actually something called “ Godless ” ?
And Kay Hagan is associated with it [ according to Dole ’s campaign ] …? … …
I did n’t even know there was such a thing as “ Godless Americans . ”
Apparently , us “ things ” do n’t exist .

You always want to be on the lookout for these blank check scams :
Dear American :
I need to ask you to support an urgent secret business relationship with a transfer of funds of great magnitude .
I am Ministry of the Treasury of the Republic of America .
My country has had crisis that has caused the need for large transfer of funds of 800 billion dollars US .
If you would assist me in this transfer , it would be most profitable to you .
I am working with Mr. Phil Gram , lobbyist for UBS , who will be my replacement as Ministry of the Treasury in January .
As a Senator , you may know him as the leader of the American banking deregulation movement in the 1990s .
This transactin is 100 % safe .
This is a matter of great urgency .
We need a blank check .
We need the funds as quickly as possible .
We cannot directly transfer these funds in the names of our close friends because we are constantly under surveillance .
My family lawyer advised me that I should look for a reliable and trustworthy person who will act as a next of kin so the funds can be transferred .
Please reply with all of your bank account , IRA and college fund account numbers and those of your children and grandchildren to wallstreetbailout@treasury.gov so that we may transfer your commission for this transaction .
After I receive that information , I will respond with detailed information about safeguards that will be used to protect the funds .
For nearly two years , Barack Obama has made hope a chief selling point of his campaign for president .
Now , unpredictably , national despair over the foundering economy has given new resonance to his message .
The Democratic nominee unveiled a sharpened theme Wednesday , evoking the nation ’s recovery from the Depression to suggest he offers America its best chance to overcome the economic crisis that has erupted worldwide .
“ Listen here , Indiana , ” Obama told 20,000 supporters at the Indiana State Fairgrounds .
“ I ’m here today to tell you that there are better days ahead . ”
The tumultuous economy , he told the crowd , is testing America “ in a way that we have n’t seen in nearly a century . ”

“ Future generations will judge us by how we respond to this test , ” he said .
“ Will they say that this was a time when America lost its way , when it lost its purpose ?
When we allowed our own petty differences , our broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession ?
“ Or will they say that this was another one of those moments when America overcame ?
When we battled back from adversity , when we recognized the common stake we have in each other ’s success ?
This is one of those moments , Indiana . ”
Since the start of his campaign , the Illinois senator has talked relentlessly of tax cuts and other relief for families hamstrung by the rising costs of gasoline , healthcare and college .
But the message , absent a real - world sense of immediacy , never completely clicked .
Now , with job losses and home foreclosures mounting , with voters aghast at the colossal taxpayer bailout of Wall Street giants and tumbling stock prices that have diminished their retirement savings , it is all too immediate .

Obama ’s recasting of his rhetoric on the economy combines a sober assessment of the tasks ahead , ones unimaginable when his campaign began , with the brand of optimism that fueled his candidacy from the start .
Not incidentally , it echoed the tough - minded optimism employed by Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Bill Clinton in 1992 .
Both used a gift for pairing optimism and empathy to great success in their election campaigns .
On Wednesday , Obama wryly invoked Reagan at the fairgrounds .
“ Back in 1980 , Ronald Reagan asked the electorate whether you were better off than you were four years ago , ” he told supporters .
“ At the pace things are going right now , you ’re going to have to ask whether you ’re better off than you were four weeks ago . ”

The fact that Obama was even stopping in Indiana less than four weeks before the election attested to the gains he has made as economic turmoil has come to dominate the White House contest .
It has been 44 years since Indiana voted to put a Democrat in the White House .
But polls show it is one of a rising number of Republican - leaning states up for grabs .
Also on the list are North Carolina , Missouri and Virginia -- all states where deep dissatisfaction with the country ’s direction , especially on the economy , has hampered Republicans .
“ I never thought I ’d see the day when Indiana would be in play in a presidential election , ” said Brian Crist , 37 , an Indianapolis real estate lawyer and Democrat who held his 5 - year - old daughter , Kate , in his arms at the muddy fairgrounds .
“ I took my daughter out of school , because I thought this was really important to see . ”
Even with a more forceful emphasis on the economic realities , Obama has been vague about what lies ahead .
At the fairgrounds , Obama called for shared sacrifice , saying a recovery would require all Americans to “ pull our weight . ”
Left unanswered was whether that suggested a reassessment of his agenda .
Advertisement
“ We ’re going to have to regain our nerve , our vision , our courage , because now more than ever , we ’re all in this together , ” he said .
Describing his plans to cut taxes and expand health coverage , he called for spurring the economy for “ not just the person who owns the factory , but the men and women who work on the factory floor . ”
“ Because if we ’ve learned anything from this economic crisis , it ’s that we ’re all connected , we ’re all in this together , ” he said .
“ That ’s right ! ” a woman shouted at the stage .
Advertisement
Obama ’s speech came a day after his second debate with Republican rival John McCain .
While McCain spent much of Wednesday criticizing Obama , the Democrat spent less time focusing on McCain .
Sometimes he was elliptical :
“ I know these times are tough , and I know that many of you are anxious about the future , ” Obama said .
“ But this is n’t the time for fear or for panic .
This is time for resolve and steady leadership . ”
Left unspoken was the contrast between “ steady ” and “ erratic , ” the Obama campaign ’s word of choice to describe McCain ’s response to the Wall Street meltdown .
( Obama ’s running mate , Joe Biden , did speak harshly of McCain while campaigning in Florida , calling him “ an angry man , lurching from one position to another , ” according to the Associated Press . )
If Obama averted the kind of slashing character assaults that McCain ’s campaign has directed his way this week , he did ridicule McCain and the Bush administration on policy matters .
Advertisement
“ We ca n’t afford four more years of no regulation on Wall Street , when Washington is n’t paying attention , and CEOs are getting golden parachutes and multimillion - dollar bonuses , while their workers are suffering and their investors are getting the shaft , ” Obama said .
“ We ’ve seen enough of where that leads us . ”
“ Enough ! ” the crowd hollered from a steep bank of bleachers , picking up a chant .
“ Enough ! ”

Welcome to this multi-part series of articles on Exploring Small Strobes by Yanik Chauvin from Yanik ’s Photo School .
In part 1 on Exploring Small strobes , I looked at why using flash guns instead of the built - in flash and studio strobes .
Today , I ’ll be going through the importance of using your speedlight off camera .
So , we already know that direct flash from your built - in flash gives unflattering results , to say the least .
Using your speedlight in the same way wo n’t change much .
I did mention that you can redirect the light by rotating the head of your flash gun and bouncing the light off ceilings and walls but you ’re still very limited in your creativity .
So what ’s a photographer to do ?
I ’ll tell you .
Get that speedlight off your camera to unleash its full potential !
FOLLOW THIS SERIES OF ARTICLES !
BACK – Why should I Use a Speedlight
NEXT – Going Wireless
To get back to the title of this article “ why use speedlights off camera ” , it can be summed up into a few words : Total creative light control .
So there you have it !
I hope you enjoyed this article … .
Ok , ok .
Just kidding . ;)
So what do I mean by total creative light control ?
Well , it can be interpreted very broadly so I ’ve tried to break it down by giving it some practical applications .
By all means , this is n’t a complete list but it ’s a great starting point for you to define and explore your own creative light control .
I ’ll look at :
Replacing natural light
Replacing artificial light
Macro Lighting
Background Lighting
Backlighting
Multiple speedlights
Replacing Natural Light
We have two main sources of natural light on planet Earth : the sun and the moon ( and technically moonlight is sunlight reflecting off of the moon . ) .
But sometimes when we want to use them , they ’re just not there .
So , do we give up ?
No , no , no .
Why ?
Because we ’re creative photographers who master off camera flash !
Ok , master is a big word but hey , you ’ll be close to that at the end of this series . ;)
So how do you recreate sunlight or moonlight ?
It ’s actually not that difficult .
You first have to know that the light coming from these natural sources is hard ( not diffused ) so you just use your flash without any light diffusers on it .
The next thing you need to know is that the light comes from above .
So your flash should be higher than your subject .
The next thing is the light color .
Sunlight is warm and moonlight is cool .
If you have colored gels , you can use an orange one for the sun and a blue one for the moon .
If you do n’t have gels yet , you can recreate it by changing your white balance .
To get moonlight , choose Fluorescent and for sunlight you ’ll need a camera that has the option to manually change the Kelvin values and it should be set to roughly 10000K .
If you shoot RAW , this can also be done in your RAW camera software .
Replacing Artificial Light
There are lots of artificial light sources that can be imitated with your speedlight .
You can fake light coming from lamps , TVs , laptops , candles … just to name a few .
Of course , your speedlight must be off camera for that to work .
The key points to remember here are : 1 - light source warmth , 2 - light source direction and , 3 - light source intensity .
So you ’ll have to adjust your flash accordingly .
Here ’s an example of a candlelight setup .
As you can see , the speedlight is at the same height as the candle and it has an orange gel to imitate the light ’s natural warmth .
Since candlelight is n’t a powerful light source , the flash is powered down .
Macro Lighting
If you need your flash for your macro photography , it has to be set off camera .
Why ?
If your speedlight is on your camera , your macro lens will prevent the light from reaching your subject since you subject is so close to the lens .
Some companies like Nikon , have even created a special off camera lighting system for macro photography that you can sometimes see in action in the popular TV series CSI .
A part from lighting your subject , using your speedlight for macro photography will also give you creative control over speed and your DOF ( depth of field ) .
Background Lighting
Sometimes you might need to light your background like I had to do for the intro shot of the speedlight or for this beer shot .
It might also be background interiors like hotel lobbies or light coming through a window with your main subject being in the foreground .
Or even getting your background completely white for product shots .
Using your imagination could also create some pretty cool result like this shot that I took in western Canada .
Yes , there ’s a speedlight inside the tent but there ’s also a speedlight shining on the background trees .
You can see the complete tutorial here .
Backlighting
Backlighting basically means lighting from behind your main subject .
This technique can be used to cut out your subject from the background like a hair light or creating a silhouette like in this example where 2 speedlights were used behind a glass wall .
Multiple Speedlights
This is an obvious one !
You can only mount 1 speedlight on your camera so once you add 2 or more , they are , by default , off camera .
And this is where the fun begins .
Being able to control multiple off camera speedlights will give you tremendous creative opportunities .
I recommend having at least 2 flash guns and if you plan on using them as a portable studio and having paying clients , go for 3 or 4 .
A few of the images above were shot using multiple speedlights .
In part 3 on Exploring Small Strobes , We ’ll look at how to trigger and control your speedlights .

The Republicans have just scored a major victory in this last election and while it is hard to predict exactly how this will affect senior citizens , Howard Gleckman has some interesting thoughts in an article for Forbes Magazine .
Typical of democrat scare tactics , Gleckman sees the Republican victory as a dangerous thing for government health programs .
Meals on Wheels and a wide range of other community living programs have their budgets on the chopping blocks as the Republicans and even the Democrats look to save money .
The reality is we now have 18 Trillion in debt and of than almost 1/2 of that created under Obama in the past six years .
Cuts need to be made and if a senior has a million bucks in the bank , they need to pay for their own long term care .
Medicaid and government programs are designed for the truly needy , those who have below $ 10,000 in savings .
Hard choices must be made if the debt is ever going to be tamed .
The Older Americans
Act of 1965 , which brought many of these services into being , has now been left by the wayside as government spending has exploded .
The Great Society and War on Poverty was created nearly fifty years ago and we ’ve spent over 50 trillion on trying to attack poverty and the out come has gotten worse !
Gleckman believes that the Republicans will even push for an increase in Medicaid premiums .
Some Republicans even want to lump Medicaid in with Housing and Transportation , which many Democrats fear would make it easier for States to drop these services altogether in attempts to solve our physical crisis .
It is a rough time for seniors who do not have an insurance safety net to fall back on .
The government seems poised to limit nursing home benefits just to the truly needly , not people trying to scam the system .
The senior population is about to reach unheard of levels as the Baby Boom generation reaches their golden years .
These senior boomers will need to rely more and more on their own personal savings , and insurance as the government programs continue to erode .
The space in the work force created by retiring boomers will undoubtedly lead to a smaller tax base .
This will cause the government to find further spending cuts and reduced assistance for the elderly .
The future is uncertain , we will just have to wait and see what the government is going to do with these programs .
There is a good chance that many of them will survive until we reach old age .
The question is , how effectively will they be running on their reduced budgets ?
Buying private Long Term Care Insurance yourself is the best strategy as it will give you the control on where and when you receive care , not some government bureaucrat in Washington ..
Especially when there are steps we can take right now to ensure that we are properly cared for in the future .
Buying a Long Term Care policy will help Americans to avoid getting trapped in the red tape as they take charge of their own future by buying the insurance vs. depending on the government and being a burden to society .
LTCTree is a site that we studied and found that will provide you with the tools you need to make your own decisions on Long Term Care insurance .
We match you with policies that work for your life and your budget .
There are no sales people at your kitchen table twisting your arm .
We send you the information and let you make the decisions at your own pace .
It is hard to know what the future will bring , but it is nice to know that you are covered .
More than 50 skeletons have been found at the site Archaeologists in Perth have uncovered more than 50 skeletons at the site of a medieval friary .
The team is excavating land at the corner of Riggs Road and Jeanfield Road before retail units are built .
As well as the bones , the team has discovered pieces of grave slabs , window glass and further evidence of the 13th century Carmelite friary .
It is hoped that once the finds have been processed and catalogued they can be displayed in Perth Museum .
During a previous excavation in 1982 about 20 skeletons were found at the site .
Archaeologist Derek Hall said : " Perth had four friaries - Carmelite , Dominican , Franciscan and Carthusian .
" They were taking advantage of the fact that Perth in the medieval period was a very rich Scottish burgh .
" So , they were able to exist outside the town limits and people used to pay the friars to pray for their souls and if they wanted they could also get buried in the friary burial grounds . "
The Carmelite friary which is being excavated was called Tullilum , it was founded in 1262 and stood until the Reformation in 1559 .
Mr Hall was also involved in the 1982 excavations when they discovered the eastern end of the friary church and the east range .
However , it was the skeletons which intrigued him .
The team are due to spend the next three weeks at the friary
He said : " Probably the most unexpected thing is the amount of burials that we found that are all post - Reformation - that means they 're all after the friary 's gone - because there was no record of this site being used for burials that late on .
" So , I 've no idea what they 're doing here , but there 's certainly quite a few of them and they seem to be buried in family groups . "
This time around the team uncovered even more remains of people and the buildings .
Mr Hall said : " We have good evidence of the rest of the friary church - I think we have all of it in our main trench .
" We have the cloister , which is the covered walkway , part of the west range and the very edge of the east range , so we 've got a pretty good feel for the layout of the friary complex .
" With regards to the finds , we 're getting painted window glass from the church , occasional shards of pottery , iron nails , but most of the finds so far have been the human burials . "
The archaeologists will be working at the site for about three more weeks - lifting the skeletons - before the site is covered over for building work to begin .

What are these ?
" He is interested in martial arts and we have decided to do some training together , " said the burly Russian leader , in an interview with Le Figaro .
Maybe Islamic cleric Muhammad Al - Munajid is just more of a Bugs Bunny sort of guy ?
In an interview with Al - Majd Television the sheikh , a former diplomat who once served in the Saudi
Mouse Under Attack Hamas TV kills off Mickey Mouse double Associated Press Disney character lookalike who preached Islamic domination children 's television program is victim of pretend beating death by actor posing as Israeli official in show 's final episode .
' Farfur was martyred while defending his land , ' says teen presenter Hamas TV kills off Mickey Mouse double
embassy in Washington , condemned cartoons that endear rodents to their viewers .
Islamic law , he said , sees the mouse as " a repulsive , corrupting creature " while children today see mice as loveable and " awesome " because of animated shows like Tom and Jerry , and Disney staple Mickey Mouse .
" Mickey Mouse has become an awesome character , even though according to Islamic law , Mickey Mouse should be killed in all cases , " Al - Munajid tells the interviewer .
" The shari 'a refers to the mouse as ' little corrupter , ' and says it is permissible to kill it in all cases .
It says that mice set fire to the house , and are steered by Satan .
The mouse is one of Satan 's soldiers , " he goes on to say .
In August the cleric , well known for issuing creative fatwas , slammed the Beijing Olympics as the " bikini Olympics , " referring to them as " satanic . "
Nationwide , early voting is underway but not without controversy and complaints of fraud , which were the subject of much attention in the past two presidential elections .
In Ohio , one county has many votes on hold pending an investigation which is not expected to be completed before election day .
A Republican fundraiser sued the Secretary of State 's office calling for the investigation after it was found that two - thirds of the acknowledgment cards sent to 200,000 newly registered voters were returned as undeliverable .
This indicated the voter information was incorrect and possibly fraudulent but Democrats in the state say the opposing party 's motive is to interfere in the voting process for new voters who are excited about participating in this year 's historic presidential race between Senators Barack Obama and John McCain .
But allegations of fraud have been made in several other states and many of them surround voter registration efforts of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) .
In Louisiana , nine senators issued a letter of support for the FBI to investigate the non-profit organization " to determine if ACORN is engaging in organized voter fraud . " -
In Nevada , a former ACORN employee spoke with KTNV News and stated many of her co-workers used names out of phone books on registration forms and even though the group 's policies forbid such tactics , Cindy Piccinetti said employees feared losing their jobs for not meeting the quota demanded by ACORN .
Now the group is under fire after an investigation revealed dozens of their " canvassers " - were ex-felons , some still on parole .
In Pennsylvania , another former ACORN employee has been indicted on federal charges of voter registration fraud ; accused of altering registration information and making up names and addresses to meet his quota .
He was fired this past spring as a result of the scandal .
ACORN also is underattack by McCain and his running mate , Governor Sarah Palin , who are accusing the group of massive and intentional voter fraud and link it to Obama with claims his campaign donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the group they say he has past ties to .
ACORN is now on the defense , claiming that their critics are using misinformation in attempts to purge voter rolls of the 1.3 million voters they registered during their 2007 - 08 registration drives .
The group targets youth , and low - income , " minority " - communities which largely vote Democratic and make up a high percentage of voters supporting Obama .
Dems and Repubs divided
Because of this , the controversy has further split the two major political parties with many Democrats angry that ACORN 's efforts are being trashed and many Republicans calling for a full federal investigation into the group 's voter registration practices .
ACORN representatives held an Oct. 14 news conference , televised from the National Press Club in Washington , D.C. , and appeared with members of Common Cause and Demos , two voter rights groups which stand in solidarity .
" The criticism of ACORN is a diversionary issue that should not be allowed to lead what is happening this year which is an extraordinary flowering of democracy , " - Miles Rapoport , Demos President , said .
" ACORN is to be applauded , not criticized . " -
In other responses , ACORN explained that the group never received money directly from Obama 's camp but did receive $ 80,000 for voter registration efforts from another group which had received over $ 800,000 from the campaign .
Obama spokespersons , in other media reports , explained that years ago the candidate , as a young lawyer , represented a case for ACORN's Chicago office but had no deeper connection than that .
Some are attempting to bring the controversy to life in Florida -- the state which was plagued with massive allegations of voter fraud in the two most recent presidential elections .
There has been one report of an ACORN employee submitting a fake registration which led to the worker being fired .
Republican leaders are now on the march , calling for a deeper investigation but their efforts have been watered down by Republican Governor Charlie Crist 's comment that his party may be exaggerating complaints about ACORN , a group he said has not been a problem in his state .
ACORN 's head organizer in Florida , Brian Kettenring told WZVN News , " The McCain campaign and the [ Republican National Committee ] are attacking groups that empower minority voters . " -
This is occurring in addition to after - effects of a 2005 bill signed into law by then Governor Jeb Bush which limited election center hours to eight per day , instead of 12 ; and restricted the centers to be placed only in government buildings such as libraries , city halls or election headquarters .
This created more inconvenience for many voters who , in the past , voted at community oriented locations .
Now , some county sites open at 7:00 am and therefore , must close at 3:00 pm , a time when many are still at work .
Election results may be challenged as in 2000
The obstacles created by the new law may be part of the reason so many Floridians are turning out in record numbers to vote early and have been seen on national TV news reports waiting 2 - 5 hours in long lines .
The Florida Democratic Party claims 153,000 votes were cast on the first day of early voting ; 56 % of them from Democrats .
Some commentators are encouraged that those votes likely went to Obama while some others wonder whether a situation such as the 2000 Al Gore -v- George W. Bush election is about to replay itself .
That year brought many complaints from voters who felt they were wrongly turned away from polls or faced a long list of other irregularities , including those related to " hanging chads " - and other ballot problems .
It all led to a call for a hand recount which resulted in G.W.
Bush being declared the winner in the state , 22 days after the election .
Gore was still not satisfied and continued to challenge the results and it was not until Dec. 13 that he conceded and acknowledged Bush as the election winner .
Bizarre stock market activity made Volkswagen briefly the world 's biggest company by market value on Tuesday .
The carmaker 's shares peaked at 1,005 euros , which valued the company at 296bn euros ( $ 370bn ; £ 237bn ) , which is well over Exxon Mobil 's $ 343 bn value .
The panic buying was caused by traders who had short - sold VW shares desperately trying to buy them back so they could close their positions .
Porsche bought VW shares at the weekend , leaving few others available .
On Sunday , Porsche announced that it owned , or had options to buy , more than 74 % of Volkswagen 's shares .
VW 's home state of Lower Saxony controls 20 % of the shares , leaving just over 5 % available on the market .
' Buy like mad '
Before Porsche 's announcement , many traders had been betting on VW 's shares falling .
They had borrowed VW shares and sold them in the market , planning to buy them back when the shares had fallen , return them to the lender and pocket the difference .
But what actually happened was that the shares rose as a result of Porsche 's effective takeover and the traders found themselves forced to buy the shares at any price to close their positions .
In afternoon trading , VW shares had fallen back to 686 euros , up 32 % , following Monday 's rise of 146.6 % .
Last Friday , the shares closed below 200 euros .
" Each and any short - seller in the world is trying to close up their position and there is no way they can do it , except for trying to buy like mad , " said Heino Ruland , an analyst at FrankfurtFinanz .
As an indication of how silly the market valuation is , Exxon last year made profits of $ 41bn on sales of $ 390 bn .
It employs 80,800 people worldwide .
Volkswagen managed profits of about $ 8bn on sales of $ 136bn .

An historically unprecedented mess has been created by compromised central bankers and inept economic advisors , whose interference has irreversibly altered and damaged the world financial system , urgently pushed after the removed anchor of money to gold .
Analysis features Gold , Crude Oil , USDollar , Treasury bonds , and inter-market dynamics with the US Economy and US Federal Reserve monetary policy .
We are in historically unprecedented times .
The foundation is being laid for a default of USTreasurys in the wake of the greatest regulatory failure in modern history , and the collapse of the US financial system .
Anyone who cannot see that suffers from poor vision , chronic nostalgia , low mental wattage , a paycheck from Wall Street , a post in financial press media , or owning an Economics advanced degree .
So many changes come with each passing day , not week , that it boggles the mind .
Many of us predicted $ 100 updays for gold , and we almost saw one .
The wheels came off the US financial wagon long ago , but only now that fact is being recognized .
The monetization largesse finally has gone beyond the corrupt bailouts of fraud kings on Wall Street .
My longstanding forecast has been that when the monetary inflation machinery spits output beyond the sanctimonious walls of the Wall Street whorehouses , INTO THE MAINSTREAM , that the gold price would rise substantially .
That process has begun , starting with Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac , and now moving to AIG .
Only when phony money floods the system where people live , not where the elite conmen with strangehold control the counterfeit processes , will gold shine .
So many unexpected upcoming events will occur , enough to make a forecaster dream .
Let ’s begin with the most important .
Much more details are provided to Hat Trick subscribers .
RAIDS OF INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTS
This is so important a topic , that it deserves top billing !!!
Hidden inside the AIG bailout funding package , surely hastily cobbled together , but carefully enough to include a totally corrupt clause , was a handy dandy clause that permits raids .
The conglomerate financial firms are permitted at this point to use private individual brokerage account funds to relieve their own liquidity pressures .
This represents unauthorized loans of your stock account assets .
So next , if the conglomerate fails , your stock account is part of the bankruptcy process .
Finally the corrupt USGovt and corrupt Wall Street houses are desperate enough to put into policy , stated by the US Federal Reserve , outlining the authorized raid of your money .
Beware .
A good route would be to remove your money , start a subscription here , and open a GoldMoney account , then purchase physical gold or preferably silver with my offered discount .
That can not be taken from you , and will rise 5 x for gold and 10 x for silver in the next two to three years .
The actual evidence for legalized stock account raids by the financial firms can be found in recent articles in Financial Times and Wall Street Journal .
So this is not a wild claim .
The September 14th article on the Wall Street Journal entitled " Wall Street Crisis Hits Stocks " was the first exposure .
The runs on US banks are in progress .
See Washington Mutual , where private email messages have been shared by WaMu bank officers .
WaMu alone could deplete the entire Federal Deposit Insurance Corp fund for bank deposit coverage .
Eventually the FDIC will compete for USGovt federal money for bailouts and nationalizations .
Eventually , bank deposits will not receive 100 cents per dollar , in a compromise .
Next the bank runs will push banks into failure , at a time when stock accounts are under raids , without broad public knowledge .
GOLD TAKES LEAD IN CURRENCY WORLD
Did anyone notice that on Wednesday the 17th , gold was up big , like over $ 50 , silver was up big , like over 70 cents , but the USDollar was essentially flat , even up a smidgeon ?
By afternoon , the gold rise intensified , and the USDollar fell hard .
THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR : GOLD IS LEADING MOVEMENTS IN CURRENCY PRICES .
The world did flock to the USTreasurys , surely led by mangled confused central bankers who have lost control .
However , gold is finally being seen as a safe haven .
It will become highly amusing to observe a clueless cast of corrupted minds attempt to explain why gold vaults past the 1000 mark , and why silver vaults past the 20 mark .
They will offer up reasons , and if lucky , they will touch on at most three or four of the twenty relevant reasons .
Their confusion includes observation of the decline in the crude oil price .
Their eye is off the monetary panic .
Moral hazard is just an obstacle to be side - stepped in such times .
Today , Bill McCullum of PIMCO actually said “ We should not give one thought to inflationary consequences .�?
He was referring to gargantuan rescue packages and now global lending lines to central bankers .
And people wonder why gold shot up $ 80 yesterday , and why silver silver shot up over $ 1 yesterday .
PREPARE IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE FOR GOLD TO RISE OVER $ 100 ON SUCCESSIVE DAYS , AND FOR SILVER TO RISE OVER $ 2 ON SUCCESSIVE DAYS .
Inflation is soon to be seen as the remedy to prevent monetary collapse .
Gold just hit 900 , and silver has reached 12.70 today .
The euro has risen 500 basis points just since Friday morning .
Gold is not rising sharply due to inflation concerns alone , although plenty of monetary inflation is set to continue flying through the money pipelines .
THE REAL REASON WHY GOLD IS RISING IS FOR THREAT OF SYSTEMIC FINANCIAL FAILURE CENTERING IN THE UNTIED STATES .
What factors are key to gold rising ?
Perhaps because the US financial system is imploding .
Perhaps because the USGovt nationalization demands are accelerating .
Perhaps because the threat of default for USTreasurys is seen as inevitable , even imminent .
Perhaps because nitwits who have highjacked the White House and USMilitary are planning something truly reckless on the military front in Iran .
Perhaps because the US Federal Reserve is depleted and secretly insolvent , even as they put word out of an INFINITE BALANCE SHEET .
Perhaps because enormous demand has come in physical gold & silver , despite the low price set by corrupt US PaperHangers .
Perhaps because fear has entered the room globally .
CONSOLIDATION AMONG THE DEAD
The financial firms are not just dead , they are corrupt to the core .
Perhaps one or two Wall Street firms will be left standing in a year or more .
Has anyone figured out why foreign pursuit of Wall Street firms is blocked ?
Partly because foreigners cannot assess the value of such complicated opaque assets , intertwined within nests of acid pits .
The other reason is that US banking authorities wish to keep the protected corrupt evidence within the Manhattan fold .
The South Koreans wanted a piece of Lehman Brothers , the best pieces .
But they would have had access to evidence needed eventually in criminal prosecutions .
See the KfW case of €300 million theft , possibly soon to emerge against Lehman crooks .
The German insurance titans wanted a piece of AIG , the dead insurance giant .
But they would have been handed access to evidence of extreme vulnerability or criminality .
Why were officers at Lehman permitted to remove box after box from their building , when it should be treated as a crime scene with yellow cordon tape ?
The answer has to do with the Fascist Business Model , the merger of state with business , where the syndicate facilitates fraud in deep collusion .
Why did Morgan Stanley stock go down hard after they announced early their quarterly earnings ?
Possibly because nobody believes they are honest .
Morgan Stanley might be kept afloat longer , so as to enable theft of brokerage account funds .
Lehman does not have private stock accounts , mostly bonds of the acidic type .
So Lehman is free to enter the trash heap of liquidation and the de-bone process for assets .
Meat is to be separated from bone .
John Mack of Morgan Stanley had better be careful , as he appeals for a Chinese role in a merger .
That could give the Chinese an important toe - hold in US mortgage bond ownership .
They are looking to convert mammoth USTBond garbage paper into hard assets , as a foundation to a possible migration of one hundred thousand to one million elite Chinese , to California , Arizona , Las Vegas , and Florida .
It is called colonization .
The moral of the consolidation story is that the dead are marrying the dead .
The Bank of America merger with Merrill Lynch struck me as hilarious .
Each is dead from insolvency .
Each has big counter - party risk from coverage of failed bonds .
So they will now serve as each other ’s guarantor of counter - party risk ?
Not in this world !
Imagine two fat men absent of musculature tossed overboard a ship .
They tell each other , “ Stand on my shoulders and you will be fine for breathing in this vast sea .�?
They both sink .
The end game for such ludicrous indefensible consolidation is that the Wall Street fraudulent corporations go down all together .
A friend called last night from the analyst community .
He wondered aloud that nobody could expect the speed of the breakdown .
My response was to point out a strong message mentioned here repeatedly .
Since the Bear Stearns bailout killjob merger by JPMorgan , all Wall Street investment banks are aligned in similar fashion , with common bond risk and common counter - party risk .
So when one Wall Street firm goes down , several will immediately go down , and AIG is the umbilical cord to the Main Street economy .
This point was borne out as wickedly true when the Lehman funding bailout failed .
The parties trying to bail them out , offering funds , all found themselves as subject to writedowns immediately .
The funds they offered were not available , since the loop of price reality reduced the level of the offered funds !!!
That means they are all in the same boat , and if one fails , they all fail .
So the system will desperately attempt to avoid any failing .
Thus , the entire system fails .
As simple citizens , people should be concerned that the US Federal Reserve and US Dept of Treasury have begun to take actions far outside their own legal powers .
The bailout of AIG was made illegally .
The USFed can not act to aid non -bank entities .
Senator Jim Bunning has drafted Congressional legislation to limit the USFed action outside the banking realm .
The system is losing control , especially with the law .
The parade of doomed deals continues .
Talks have begun for JPMorgan taking over Washington Mutual .
Could the JPMorgan ‘ Garbage Can ’ be inadequate soon ?
Bank of America has entered talks to take over Merrill Lynch , apparently striking a deal .
Could BOA serve as the alternative ‘ Garbage Can ’ next , whose service would be as squire to JPMorgan ?
Now Morgan Stanley is in talks to take over Wachovia .
The disaster du jour today seems to be State Street , which was down over 50 % .
The dominos are falling .
THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR : THE DEAD ARE MARRYING THE DEAD .
It is unclear what music to play at such events .
My suggestion is something from " Phantom of the Opera " would be apt .
A SHORT ‘TOLD YOU SO ’ HERE
The US financial sector became unglued this week .
In last week ’s article , the point was made that the financial system had just that one week to lift the USDollar , to raid private accounts with games like yanked credit and a raft of paper naked short gold & silver future contracts .
Then next week the brown excrement hits the fan .
Over the weekend , deals were attempted to be forged into the night .
Nobody seemed to ask the question why they were all acting like in an emergency .
What emergency ?
A condition ordered by whom ?
My maintained point is that the Bank For Intl Settlements ordered the US bankers to fix it or flush it !
Big news was expected from my analysis , and my Hat Trick Letter newsletter .
We got it !
By the way , AIG was not on the radar for numerous analysts .
It was on my radar , a secondary radar .
The big banks are primary for my observation and monitor .
WE ARE WITNESSING A CONCENTRATION OF RISK , OF RUINED CORPORATIONS , AND OF THEIR ACIDIC BALANCE SHEETS THAT IS SO GREAT THAT THE RISK OF US FINANCIAL IMPLOSION GROWS BY THE DAY !!!
Blame for speculators continues , as nitwit players within the fraud centers accuse others of speculation , and threaten prosecution by their watchdogs on leash .
Recent research failed to disclose any collusion or illegal activity in the crude oil market .
That does not stop continued claims , with hue & cry .
These criminals are pathetic , if not consistent .
Just when failed regulation is at the core of the financial crisis , Wall Street conmen and clueless Congressional legislators argue for more regulation and control , when the regulators and controllers deserve prison terms .
Instead , prosecute the regulators and controllers , and begin with Alan Greenspan , and his knights of the Stupid Table at the Federal Reserve .
The financial crisis continues each day .
Last Friday the currency markets smelled what was cited in broad terms as the end of the OPEN WINDOW for the US banks .
The euro currency rose over 220 basis points that Friday , and the pound sterling rose over 330 basis points .
Gold and silver firmed in price .
Something tipped them off , like huge flows of private money out of the Untied States .
This week , AIG and Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley dominate the news .
On two different days this week , the NYSE Dow Jones Industrial index fell over 400 points .
Today , when the Dow Jones Index was up 170 points , in a phone call to a trusted friend , we both agreed that the index would turn negative before the afternoon , and close down .
So far , that call looks correct , as it was minus 100 points before now being up 50 to 60 points .
By the way , important option put stock positions are in place against Goldman Sachs .
They point to a strong likelihood of the GSax stock falling to 80 or 85 imminently .
The knock on GSax is that they have lied about their subprime mortgage exposure , and soon will be forced to come clean .
The ‘ GS ’ stock shares plummeted from 160 in early September , now to under 100 .
Justice is served .
My guess is their executives will profit privately from shorting their own stock .
Even their 6 - month corporate paper must pay out 20 % in bond yield in order to attract funds .
UNIVERSAL MONETARY INFLATION
OK , so finally the US Federal Reserve has opened the monetary spigots to England , to Europe , to Switzerland , to Japan , and later to Canada .
Not only is the monetary spigot overflowing inside the Untied States , it is overflowing from the US to the world .
At least to the world affected ( infected ) by US control .
The total central bank infusions of liquidity ( translated : phony money ) is $ 180 billion in the last several hours alone !!
This huge amount is not enough to quiet the LIBOR or the 2 - year USTreasury swaps .
Gold is rising versus the pound sterling , the euro , the yen , and Canadian Dollar , aka the loonie .
This trend is new and powerful .
Central bankers are growing desperate .
Their measures to open numerous lending facilities have not stopped lending constraints .
Even commercial paper has fallen by $ 52 billion last week .
Clownish anchors and analysts cannot seem to comprehend what is going on with the central bankers , liquidity injections , market tanking , USDollar decline , and gold & silver zoom .
They wonder why the USDollar would continue to fall after central bankers reacted responsibly .
BECAUSE THE USTREASURY IS DOOMED FROM INSOLVENT BANKS , EXTREME DEMANDS FROM NATIONALIZATION , AND RECESSION , AGAINST A BACKDROP OF ENDLESS WAR FOR PRIVATE SYNDICATE BENEFIT .
It is obvious !
Gold smells a systemic failure .
FOREIGN CREDITORS UNITE
A hidden initiative has been in progress for the last two weeks .
Foreigners are forced to supply credit for the Untied States .
Nations led by Russia , China , Arabs , and Japanese are meeting to form a formal committee .
They have a common purpose , to maintain and manage massive US $ - based debt securities in danger .
Their continued credit support is hampered by three magnificent factors , each a show stopper .
1 ) The US banks are insolvent , 2 ) The Wall Street bankers export fraudulent bonds , and 3 ) The USMilitary has acted with chronic aggression in violation of established contracts , international treaties , and disrespect for sovereign boundaries .
So they are working to organize a committee of giant USTreasury Bond creditors .
They wish to confront the US debtor with a single voice .
Regard this important step as a prelude to possible default of the USTreasurys .
It is one thing to be in trouble from insolvency .
Add corruption from export of fraud , and you have a bigger problem .
Throw in military aggression , complete with misreporting by a controlled press , and you have a crisis in need of almost immediate remedy .
My argument has been made for four years , that foreign held US debt creates a threat to national sovereignty .
Since when are the Chinese our friends and allies ?
They are business partners turned rivals , now adversaries .
Since when are Russians our friends and allies ?
They are energy and metals suppliers , betrayed by treaty violations , now adversaries , even on the military front .
Since when are Arabs our friends and allies ?
For three decades an uneasy partnership has been in existence , one that has turned into a blatant protection racket .
The endless concocted war on terrorism is seen by Arabs as a war on Islam .
USTREASURYS AT RISK
Do n’t be fooled by the drop in USTBond yields .
That is a symptom of collapse in my view .
Yesterday , it was with great disillusion yet satisfaction that my eyes and ears witnessed an interview by a Standard & Poor analyst .
He said there was no imminent danger of a USTreasury debt security downgrade , but he did say that if pushed , the S&P would put them on NEGATIVE WATCH .
Interpret that to mean the USTreasurys will soon be downgraded .
Never is a denial of such importance made without coming to fact and fruition later .
Why else is the topic even discussed ?
This line of thinking is basic when ripping the BS from US financial propaganda .
Notice the Credit Default Swap price for USTreasury Notes .
The price is around 0.24 % for the AAA - rated USGovt debt .
Without colossal continued corrupt pressure against the ratings agencies by the US thugs in financial orifices , the USGovt debt would have been downgraded immediately with the launch of the Iraq and Afghan Wars , or years earlier .
The Shock & Awe should have been reflected in USTBond risk .
CHECK OUT THE 1 - MONTH USTBILL YIELD
The US bankers have lost control badly .
Even ill - equipped USFed Chairman Bernanke admitted recently as having lost control .
He spoke to economist David Hale at a Florida financial conference last week .
Bernanke said , “ We have lost control .
We cannot stabilize the dollar .
We cannot control commodity prices .�?
The age of central bank control , ala Soviet Politburo , is coming to an end .
GOLD RECOGNIZES IT .
Check out the 1 - month USTreasury Bill yield .
Incredibly , it closed under 0.1 % yesterday .
This ultra short - term bond yield testifies to lost control and the advent of extreme conditions , the prelude to an historical storm .
Just what should the USTreasury maturity yield curve look like before a default ?
Let me check , and get back to you .
Ooops , no precedent !
The TED Spread ( difference between USTreasury and EuroDollar yield ) has jumped up , another signal of banking turmoil .
In recent days , the tight grip control of certain commodities has been lost by the Evil Ones .
Even Morgan Stanley has been forced to close down its trading desks at the Platts Window , where they trade crude oil .
The USCongress is equally lost .
Today , a quote came from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
They are unlikely to pass new legislation to overhaul financial regulations this year .
He said , “ No one knows what to do .
We are in new territory , this is a different game .
[ Neither Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke nor Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ] know what to do , but they are trying to come up with ideas .�?
Gee !
Maybe the chief architects of this grand failure have a solution ?
They should be ignored then imprisoned .
Perhaps they are seeking final opportunities to steal , raid , and pilfer from the public till during the final months of this Administration .
The 2 - year USTBill yield has also plummeted , but not as drastically .
It is now far below the official USFed Fed Funds 2.0 % rate .
Some thought the USFed might cut rates in an act of desperation this week , me included .
My guess is for two reasons , why they did not .
1 ) They did not want to project an impression of lost control , not after the Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac bailout , not after the failed Lehman Brothers deal , not after the shotgun wedding for Bank of America & Merrill Lynch , not after the secret eloped marriage in the works for JPMorgan & Washington Mutual , not after the merger of cadavers planned between Morgan Stanley & Wachovia .
And 2 ) the Bank For Intl Settlements in Switzerland might have forbidden a USFed rate cut .
My maintained position is firm , that the BIS ordered the US to fix it or flush it !
Let ’s watch to see if the 2 - year TBill yield continues lower , a signal of even more lost control .
THE USELESS INFLATION VS DEFLATION DEBATE
My greatest impatience is shown for those who attempt to argue whether inflation or deflation is winning , and where we stand .
Such pursuits of chasing one ’s tail serves to illuminate nothing and to waste time .
We have both , will continue to have both , as both intensify .
The key is for monetary inflation to enter the mainstream , which is underway finally .
One can benefit little from putting the unique crisis into convenient cans for purposes of organization .
This is not simple , and people should not attempt to simplify the ongoing collapse of the Great American Experiment in Counterfeit Monetary Systems .
To be sure , we have gone past a tipping point .
The move to flood the monetary pools of phony money beyond Wall Street is the big event .
To be sure , the bankruptcies and deep insolvent events are accelerating .
To be sure , the desperation for attempted mergers is palpable .
To be sure , central bank activity with lending , swapping , and even accepting stock equity as collateral is a sign of total absence of any safeguard toward respect of moral hazard .
Looking for inflation vs deflation labels when the failure and default of USTBonds and receivership occur TOTALLY MISSES WHAT IS GOING ON .
This is a death event for the US finances , US banking system , USEconomy structure , and USTreasurys , all rolled together like a gigantic vortex hurricane .
Looking for ( in ) vs ( de ) flation in this environment is like observing color schemes on walking dead as they attempt to merge at a ceremony .
They are of DEAD PARTIES ATTEMPTING TO SHARE COUNTER - PARTY RISK .
Looking for ( in ) vs ( de ) flation when dead partners are marrying is like DECIDING WHETHER A HONEYMOON SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN THE CARIBBEAN OR FRENCH COAST .
They both go to the recycling cemetery instead .
The place to be now is in gold and silver , preferably silver since central banks own none and because silver has strong industrial demand .
Besides , a silver default of sorts has been in effect for several months .
It is with pleasure to attend again the upcoming Cambridge House conference in Toronto on October 4 and 5 .
Thankfully , my Frequent Flyer miles were used to cover the airfare from Costa Rica , where the rainy season is coming close to an end .
POR FIN !
Is that inflationary or deflationary ?
With absolute certainty , one can say WHO CARES ?
Buy gold , buy silver , do NOT use borrowed money or leverage , and rest comfortably at night , since it can not be taken from you .
Then patiently wait for gravity to work , for night to follow day , for evil to be unmasked , for foreign creditors to arrive with hatchets .

Council use anti-terror laws to spy on binmen accused of ' accepting strawberry pop bribe to take away trade waste '
A council used controversial anti-terror laws to spy on a crew of refuse collectors after receiving a tip - off that they were incorrectly emptying a dustbin .
Officials set up an undercover surveillance operation in an attempt to prove the three binmen were being bribed by a newsagent to take away trade waste when he had not paid the extra fee for it to be collected .
Bury Council in Greater Manchester said the investigation proved that the men had removed trade waste - and it also claimed they had used their refuse truck for ‘ pecuniary gain ’ because one accepted a bottle of strawberry - flavoured mineral water from the shopkeeper .
In the frame : An image from Bury Council 's surveillance of the three binmen
As a result , the refuse collectors , who can not be named for legal reasons , were suspended on full pay for ten months and then sacked .
But now they have won more than £ 100,000 between them in an out - of - court settlement after claiming unfair dismissal .
One of the collectors said : ‘ I thought the law allowing secret filming was to help protect us from terrorists - not for filming three binmen who might have made a mistake by collecting an extra bin or accepting a bottle of pop . ’
The episode is just the latest example of town halls using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( RIPA ) - introduced in 2000 ‘ in the interests of national security ’ - to investigate trivial offences .
Only nine organisations , including the police and security services , were allowed to use the Act when it was introduced .
Now that number has risen to 792 , including 474 councils .
The latest figures show councils use it more than 10,000 times a year to spy on residents suspected of crimes including dog fouling and littering .
In April , a council in Dorset used the powers to spy for weeks on a family it wrongly suspected of breaking rules on school catchment areas .
Bury Council informed Greater Manchester Police of its intention to film the binmen in October 2006 .
An official sat in a car outside Oak Bank News , Mr Amed Naseer ’s shop , on three separate occasions .
But one of the binmen said : ‘ None of us had been told the shopkeeper had cancelled his agreement with the council to collect his trade waste .
' And anyway , there were three bins at the shop - two for household rubbish and one for glass and tins , but no trade waste .
The shopkeeper said he took his trade waste to the local tip .
‘ We were also accused of accepting a two - litre bottle of mineral water as a sort of bribe .
It was all nonsense . ’
The binmen were accused of emptying three bins from a newsagents - but the bins were not trade waste ( file pic )
The films , seen by The Mail on Sunday , do not appear to show any evidence of the mineral water or of trade waste being taken by the men .
The tribunal was set for June this year but the men reached a settlement just three days before it was due to begin .
As part of the agreement , they are prevented from revealing exactly how much the council paid them .
Brian Bamford , from Unison , the union which represents the binmen , said : ‘ The council ’s decision to film the men would be hilarious if it was n’t so serious .
It is like something from the pages of a George Orwell novel .
Now council taxpayers will pick up the bill . ’
A Bury Council spokesman said : ‘ The council has a duty to investigate allegations that have properly been made .
The council considers that the use of its powers under the RIPA in this case were proportionate and lawful . ’
£ 60 to keep your wheelie rat - free
Householders are paying up to £ 60 a year to have wheelie bins cleaned because the abolition of weekly collections has raised their fears of infestations by rats , lice and maggots .
Specialist companies are being set up to disinfect bins .
One firm , the Wheelie Bin Cleaning Service , says it is already washing 200,000 bins a month .
Most companies charge £ 2.50 to £ 5 per bin .
Environmental scientist Doretta Cocks , founder of the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collection , said : ‘ It is unreasonable that householders already saddled with high council tax bills have to pay extra to keep bins clean as a result of councils cutting collections . ’
Expect to see Palin look - alikes galore this Halloween .
Wiggles Dog Wigs earlier this month started selling Palin - style wigs for canines after a customer request .
So far owner Ruth Regina says she 's sold about 150 of the wigs , which start at $ 39 - making it a top seller .
Meanwhile , owner of Miami Beach - based WigSalon.com , Joseph Aronesty , said strong sales of $ 25 " Sarah Palin style wigs " indicate she 'll be the hit character of the season .
Four wigs that Aronesty re-branded after the Alaskan governor now make up about 25 % of his weekly sales , and customers are buying approximately 10 times as many of those pieces as they did before Palin hit the national scene .
And depending on the outcome of the election , the now instantly recognizable coif wo n't disappear after Oct. 31 .
" If they win , we have four years of Sarah Palin wigs , " he said .
The defacto standard for open source version control systems has been Subversion for the last several years .
While CVS is still in use some places , Subversion is miles ahead .
While Subversion has served many people well , it has some failings that make it inappropriate for several project classes .
The most important of these are open source projects .
This post is going to look at why Subversion sucks for open source projects .
I 'll look at how these arguments also apply to internal business source code management in a future post .
The primary problem with Subversion is the centralized repository .
This manifests itself in several ways .
Firstly , you must have operations level access to create a new project repository .
Secondly , you must have commit access to touch the history of a project .
Thirdly , developers are dependent on the project infrastructure to contribute .
There are probably more , but today I 'll talk about these .
Creating new Subversion project repositories
Creating a new Subversion repository requires access to the svn-admin command on the box running a project 's subversion repositories .
This means access ( possibly indirect ) to a shell account .
This raises the bar quite high to be able to create new repositories .
This might not seem like a big deal .
There 's even an ugly hack pattern to work around it .
Instead of creating new repositories , organizations put everything in the same Subversion repository .
An example of this anti-pattern can be seen in the ASF Subversion repository .
This is plain bad design .
Navigating through these massive repositories is a pain , dealing with commit access becomes a much more vast security issue and the structure of the trunk / tags / branches pattern is broken .
Touching project history
Touching project history might seem like a holy right that should be reserved vetted people , but this is wrong .
Users , not project leads , are the final deciders of code value .
Political differences in a project should not impact what code is finally distributed .
Maintaining patches out of tree violates the fundamental premise of source code management systems ;
That source code management should be automated , and not done by hand .
Source code management systems that encourage out of tree maintainers to abandon source code management are therefore very problematic .
The other assumption is that an official project contributor is always more qualified than a non-contributor has been shown to be false several times .
In fact , it 's a central premise in the free software movement , the open source community 's Right To Fork and the basis of any free market paradigm .
Relying on a source code management system that has a centrally controlled access list therefore runs fundamentally counter to ideals that contribute to software quality .
This does n't imply that Subversion leads to worse software , or that it is n't reconcilable to these ideals through clever workarounds , but the dissonance is there and needs to be addressed .
Dependence on infrastructure
The third disadvantage of a central repository is that the lack of local history means one relies on infrastructure availability for source code management .
There are primarily two situations where this is important : when the infrastructures fail or when they are unavailable .
Infrastructure failure can happen if a server goes down , if a local internet connection fails or a host of other events that affect access to the central repository .
Being able to continue to perform source code management under these conditions is important , because infrastructure failure will happen .
For open source projects this is important because time is the most valuable asset a developer can contribute .
Other than infrastructure failure , developers are often able to code in places where infrastructure simply is n't available .
Internet access is growing more and more ubiquitous , but there are still places to code that do n't have access .
Whether it's on an airplane , train , in a car or at a cafe without wifi , there are times when project infrastructure simply is n't available and as previously mentioned , time is the most valuable asset of an open source project .
The alternative : Distributed source code management
My distributed source code management system of choice is Git , but that does n't mean it 's right for you .
The popular choices these days are Git , Mercurial and Bazaar .
There are others , with tradeoffs of their own .
While distributed source code management systems do n't solve how to create central project repositories , they make repository creation trivial .
This is a big deal .
It means that you can start an experimental project with full source code management without polluting the namespace of central repository .
Instead of using the stupid One Big Repository anti-pattern , repositories are cheap things that can be created and destroyed on demand .
Some work must be done to make central repository hosting easier , which has given rise to services like GitHub , BitBucket ( Mercurial ) and Launchpad ( Bazaar ) .
These are great ways to trivially host open source projects .
Since they 're offered as free services to open source projects , the need to maintain any repository oriented infrastructure simply melts away .
The way distributed source code management systems deal with commit access is ingenius .
Since anyone can create history , but a project lead still owns their repository , the project lead can pick and choose history elements rather than digging through patchesets .
Instead of sending a patch over email , someone can maintain a fully revisioned repository and send individual commits .
This reduces the load for both contributor and project lead , as well as supporting the old commit access structure .
Distributed version control systems give people the ability to maintain a full project history along with patchsets out of tree as the default mode of operation .
The issue of touching history simply goes away .
Since these distributed systems give full repository access locally , the dependence on infrastructure falls away , allowing people to continue to work during infrastructure failures or in areas without access to infrastructure and sync their changes back when they finally become available again .
There are other advantages of these systems over Subversion , but these are the ones related to the core assumption of centrally hosted revision control versus locally hosted revision systems .
The business end of things
So far the assumption has focused on open source projects , but almost all these points apply in some fashion to the business case as well .
The cases are more varied and not necessarily as clear , but they are all there .
I 'll look at these issues in a future post .
But a more extreme form of the disease occurs among athletes who take part in close - contact sports , such as sumo , rugby and judo .
Known as Herpes gladiatorum , or scrumpox , it causes painful , virus - filled blisters to form on the face and the neck that can damage the skin .
Fever , headaches and an infection of the lymph nodes can also result .
As it is highly infectious , players who have the blisters are usually taken out of competition to prevent them from passing it on .
In a study published in a British journal , Japanese scientists looked at blood samples from 39 sumo wrestlers in Tokyo who had been diagnosed with the gladiatorum virus between 1989 and 1994 .
Tests revealed that some of the wrestlers had been infected only once , while in others , the disease had recurred several times .
The culprit for this was a variant of HSV1 - 1 called BgKL , which reactivates , spreads more efficiently and causes more severe symptoms than other strains , they found .
The authors , led by Kazuo Yanagi of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo , believe the gladiatorum virus was transmitted by other wrestlers in the " stable " where they live and train together .
" Two of the wrestlers died as a result of their infections , so cases like this do need to be investigated , " Yanagi said in a press release .
" This research will aid future studies on herpes and may help identify herpes genes that are involved in recurrence and spread of disease . "
The study appears in the Journal of General Virology , published by Britain 's Society for General Microbiology .

Rick Hasen's web log « " McCain Campaign Calls for Investigation of ACORN - Obama Ties " | Main | Heated Sixth Circuit Opinion in Ohio Matching Case ; En Banc Decision May Come Tomorrow » " The Purge Surge : Why the GOP is Nuts About ACORN " I have just posted this piece at The Huffington Post .
It begins :
What explains the Republicans ' fixation on ACORN in recent days ?
From Sen. McCain 's campaign manager to GOP luminaries to the McCain campaigns own new web ad , ACORN appears to be target # 1 of the GOP campaign against Senator Obama , surpassing even a focus on William Ayers .
The claims are that ACORN is engaging in massive voter fraud through its voter registration activities , and -- according to the new web ad -- that the group forced banks to take on risky loans that have led to the country 's financial crisis .
Though at first glance it may look like this is about tying Senator Obama to a group that has been under investigation for its voter registration activities , the real point appears to be part of a broader Republican strategy to remove likely Democratic voters from the voter rolls and to lay the groundwork to contest the outcome of the presidential election in the event of an extremely close result in a battleground state .

Lotus Engineering , in collaboration with Jaguar , is starting up a project they 're calling " Omnivore , " a task which , if successful , could see traditional internal combustion engines go the way of the dodo .
Lotus is planning to meld the two - cycle engine with new technologies — direct injection and a variable compression ratio — to create an engine able to run on almost any fuel .
If you 've ever wondered what the future of the internal combustion looked like , you 're getting a peek now .
Put your propeller cap on and join us for a pocket protector talk after the jump .

Used to be that a gas engine was a gas engine and a diesel was a diesel .
With the advent of reliable direct injection , variable displacement cylinder heads that do n't turn into grenades , and incredibly sensitive monitoring and control systems , it 's now possible to run an engine in ways would have never worked in the past .
Consider the main barrier to high - compression gasoline engines in the past — preignition .
High octane numbers were a band - aid for that problem , but that also caused fuel economy to plummet .
Direct injection virtually eliminates the issue , allowing engineers to put the fuel right into the chamber exactly when it 's needed , high pressure be damned .
It 's even conceivable to run a gasoline engine on the diesel cycle with direct injection .
Now add the idea of operating with a two - cycle engine to the mix and things get really weird .
Two - strokes are traditionally dirty , dirty engines to run .
The huge amount of fuel used and inelegant combustion leads to lots of pollution but huge amounts of power , since you 've got twice as many power strokes compared to a four - stroke .
However , a two - stroke with direct injection and a variable compression ratio would be able to burn almost anything under super - high compression ratios , resulting in temperatures and pressures sufficient to completely burn almost any fuel .
Of course , that assumes you can build powerful enough injectors and internal components that do n't turn into Swiss cheese in extreme conditions .
Let 's just say this :
Lotus is setting out on a path that 's going to get a lot of powertrain engineering PhD 's hot and bothered .
If they succeed , future car engines will shrink and be more powerful as a result .

Scahill : Blackwater now in the private intelligence business David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday July 31 , 2008
Print This Email This Jeremy Scahill , author of Blackwater : The Rise of the World 's Most Powerful Mercenary Army , is worried about the giant mercenary firm 's latest foray into private intelligence .
" They 're marketing their services to not only foreign governments , but to Fortune 500 corporations , " he recently told an interviewer .
The forthcoming paperback edition of Scahill 's book on Blackwater , which appeared in hardcover in February 2007 , will include 100 pages of new material , including a discussion of last September 's shooting spree in Baghdad by Blackwater operatives -- which killed 17 Iraqi civilians but for which nobody has ever been charged .
" This is a company that has been accused of murdering Iraqi civilians , " Scahill pointed out , " of shooting the bodyguard to the Iraqi vice - president , of causing blowback attacks on United States troops , of hurting the morale of the United States military -- that has cost United States taxpayers over a billion dollars for its operations in Iraq . "
However , Scahill 's greatest concern at present appears to be Blackwater 's venture into the private intelligence business .
" Blackwater started a private intelligence company , " he explained , " a private CIA essentially , called Total Intelligence Solutions .
And the man running Total Intelligence Solutions is J. Cofer Black .
He 's a thirty - year veteran of the Central Intelligence Agency .
He also was the guy who ran the CIA 's extraordinary rendition program , the government - sanctioned kidnap - and - torture program . "
" His thirty - year CIA career , his network of contacts , his knowledge that was gained through his work in the most sensitive areas of the United States government is now on the open market for hire , " Scahill said sadly .
" This is n't a liberal or conservative thing , " concluded Scahill .
" You have a lot of traditional conservatives who are outraged at what they see as the degradation of the United States armed forces .
...
This has everything to do with the future of war - making and global stability . "

" Roomba " , ein vollautomatischer Staubsauger - Roboter mit Rollen als Füßen , Infrarotsensoren als Augen und einer besonderen Vorliebe für Hundehaare , ist der bislang erfolgreichste Consumer - Roboter in der Geschichte .
Sein Produzent , die US - Firma iRobot , setzte seit dem Verkaufsstart im September 2002 mehr als 1,5 Millionen Stück des Frisbee - förmigen Gadgets ab .
Und viele Kunden lieben ihre Roombas – sie kaufen sie für weitere Familienmitglieder , schreiben überaus positive Testberichte auf Review - Websites und formieren Internet - Fanclubs samt Foren .
Es gibt sogar Roomba - Besitzer , die den Staubsauger wie ein Haustier ausstaffieren .
Bei all dem Erfolg und Enthusiasmus für das Produkt sollte man eigentlich erwarten , dass inzwischen zahlreiche Roomba - Klone auf dem Markt sein müssten .
Nach fast vier Jahren folgte jedoch nur ein einziges Produkt dem Staubi - Robi nach – " Scooba " , ein Roboter - Wischmopp , der mit seiner eigenen Reinigungsflüssigkeit kommt und harte Böden wie Holz , Fließen und Linoleum putzt und trocknet .
Allerdings stammt " Scooba " ebenfalls von iRobot .
Das Gerät wurde in diesem Quartal offiziell vorgestellt , ob es ein Erfolg wird , bleibt abzuwarten .
Die Idee , Roboter in jedem Haushalt zu haben , wirkt heutzutage noch mehr wie Zukunftsmusik als beim Roomba - Verkaufsstart .
Warum das so ist , lässt sich nicht leicht sagen .
Vielleicht ist es mangelndes Kundeninteresse , vielleicht aber auch die fehlende Vorstellungskraft der Produktentwickler .
Oder :
Es ist unklar , ob sich Roboter überhaupt für bestimmte Tätigkeiten eignen .
Helen Greiner gehört zum dreiköpfigen iRobot - Gründerteam und glaubt , dass der Markt für Heim - und Büroroboter noch deutlich wachsen wird .
Sie gründete iRobot 1990 mit ihrem Informatik - Studienkollegen Colin Angle sowie Rodney Brooks , einem Professor am MIT - Labor für Computerwissenschaften und künstliche Intelligenz .
Greiner besitzt einen Bachelor - Abschluss in Maschinenbau und einen Master - Abschluss in Informatik .
Technology Review : Ihr Staubsauger - Roboter Roomba hat gezeigt , dass es einen Markt für Heim - Roboter gibt .
Trotzdem sind inzwischen seit seiner Einführung mehr als vier Jahre vergangen – und weder iRobot noch seine Konkurrenten haben Consumer - Roboter für andere Aufgaben herausgebracht .
Warum ?
Helen Greiner : Im Gegenteil , wir haben .
Unser Bodenreinigungsroboter Scooba ist gerade fertig geworden .
Er ist ein ganz anderer Roboter als Roomba .
Staubsaugen und die Bodenreinigung sind zwei völlig verschiedene Haushaltsarbeiten .
TR : Verzeihen Sie unseren Fehler .
Was wir meinten , war folgendes :
Was macht Roomba so besonders – und warum hat es bislang niemand geschafft , seinen Erfolg zu kopieren ?
Greiner : Der große Unterschied zwischen Roomba und den Robotern , die vor ihm kamen , liegt in der Praxistauglichkeit des Systems und seinem Preis .
Er kostet ungefähr soviel wie ein normaler Staubsauger .
Gleichzeitig muss man ihn nicht durch die Gegend schieben .
Er kann unter Möbel und Betten saugen .
Sein
Wert übersteigt den Preis , den die Kunden zahlen müssen – bei Robotern für 1500 oder 2000 Dollar wäre das nicht so .
TR : Um den Preis des Roomba günstig zu halten , mussten Sie Funktionen weglassen .
Wie haben
Sie entschieden , was man braucht und was nicht ?
Greiner : Das war schwer .
Wie Sie wissen , kommen wir selbst vom MIT und sind allesamt Technologen .
Unser erster Roomba kostete 199 Dollar und man schaltete ihn einfach an und er erledigte seinen Job .
Genau das brauchte der Kunde .
Wir wussten , dass wir Dinge wie eine Fernsteuerung oder eine Ladestation hätten mitliefern können , was ja an sich tolle Sachen sind , aber das hätte den Preis erhöht .
Als sich die Leute dann daran gewöhnt hatten , dass man sich diese Dinger für einen vernünftigen Preis ins Haus holen kann , kamen sie selbst mit Ideen auf uns zu .
" Wäre es nicht cool , wenn er sich selbst aufladen könne ? " oder " Wäre es nicht toll , wenn er sich jeden Tag zur gleichen Zeit einschalten könnte ? " waren solche Fragen .
Erst dann haben wir diese Zusatzfeatures herausgebracht .
( Heute gibt es vier Roomba Modelle – vom High - End- Modell " Scheduler " für 340 Dollar bis hin zum " Roomba Red " für 150 Dollar , Anm. d. Red. )
TR : Neben dem günstigen Preis ist der Roomba auch leicht zu bedienen .
Er besitzt ein sehr einfaches Benutzerinterface : Einen Anschalter , einen Reinigungs - Knopf und einen " Hier Reinigen " - Button .
Wie viel Gehirnschmalz hat man in dieses Interface gesteckt ?
Greiner : Wir wussten , dass wir das Gerät ganz einfach gestalten mussten .
Unser erster Roomba war noch nicht einfach genug – er hatte Einstellungen wie " klein " , " mittel " und " groß " für verschiedene Raumgrößen .
Aber die meisten Leute wissen gar nicht , wie viel Quadratmeter ein Raum hat .
Nun schaltet man Roomba einfach auf " Reinigen " und er findet das selbst heraus .
Er macht einfach weiter , bis er fast keinen Saft mehr hat .
Das ist ein wesentlich leichteres Interface .
Diese Einfachheit ist ein großes Unterscheidungsmerkmal im Vergleich zu anderen Robotern und Computersystemen .
Man drückt einen Knopf und schon geht 's los .
Greiner : Der Scooba bewegt sich ähnlich durch den Raum , was für uns natürlich praktisch war .
Der tatsächliche Reinigungsmechanismus ist aber ein völlig anderer , weil er mit Flüssigkeiten zu tun hat .
Wir mussten uns sogar mit der Chemie der Seife auseinandersetzen .
Wir arbeiteten mit Clorox zusammen , um eine Seife zu entwickeln , auf der der Roboter nicht ausrutscht .
Es muss ein Roboter - freundliches Reinigungsmittel sein .
Und dann wäre da noch der Umgang mit Flüssigkeiten an sich .
Scooba nimmt erst Schmutz auf , gibt die Reinigungsflüssigkeit ab , schrubbt und saugt sie dann in seinen hinteren Bereich .
Schmutziges und klares Wasser werden dabei getrennt behandelt .
TR : Ist das Ziel erreicht , Roboter einfach und preiswert zu gestalten , wird es Zeit , sich Aufgaben für neue Roboter zu suchen .
Welche könnten das bei iRobot sein ?
Greiner : Man könnte etwa an professionelle Reinigungsdienste denken .
Jeder Boden in jedem Büro , jedem Geschäft und jeder Schule wird in der Nacht gereinigt .
Außerdem gibt es immer mehr alte Menschen – und die wollen unabhängig zu Hause weiterleben können .
Man könnte sich also etwa Fensterwäscher , Badreiniger , Toilettenputzer , Rasenmäher oder auch Schnee - und Laubbeseitiger vorstellen .
Es geht grundsätzlich immer um Sachen , die die Menschen ungern erledigen , beziehungsweise nicht häufig genug tun .
Genau hier ist der Endkundenbedarf groß .
TR : Warum gibt es nicht mehr Firmen , die Heimroboter herstellen ?
Greiner : Ich denke , dass das Zusammenbringen so vieler Teile für ein solches Gerät nicht besonders einfach ist .
Roboter erfordern Elektrotechnik , Maschinenbau , Informatik , Produktentwicklung und einen genauen Blick auf die Kostenstruktur und den Bedarf der Menschen in ihren Haushalten oder , wie in unserer anderen Abteilung , beim Militär .
Es gibt höchstens noch andere Firmen , die sich gut mit Roboter - Software auskennen .
Wir selbst haben hier ein Team versammelt , das alle Disziplinen vereint .
Und dieses
Team konzentriert sich immer auf den Kunden .
