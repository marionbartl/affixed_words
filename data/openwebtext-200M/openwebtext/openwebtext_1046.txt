Terracotta Warrior
Archaeologists in China ’s northern Xi’an city have excavated another 100 terracotta warriors , including a much - prized army officer , near the tomb of the nation ’s first emperor , state media said .
A new excavation at the famed site began over a month ago in a bid to unravel the mysteries surrounding the ancient terracotta army near Xi’an , capital of Shaanxi province .
“ Our most exciting discovery so far is the army officer , ” Xinhua news agency quoted chief archaeologist Xu Weihong as saying .
So far , the majority of discovered figures are archers , infantrymen and charioteers that the Qin Emperor , who had the site built , hoped would follow him into the afterlife .
Less than 10 armoured generals have been unearthed with the army , part of a burial site for Qin Shi Huang , who presided over the unification of China in 221 BC and is seen as the first emperor of the nation .
Xu said the army officer was found lying on its stomach behind four chariots , and was largely intact compared with other newly - discovered warriors , according to Xinhua .
“ The original colours have faded after more than 2000 years of decay , but a corner of the officer ’s robe suggested it was in colours other than the grey - ish clay , ” he said .
The latest excavation is the third in the site ’s largest pit — one of three open to the public — since 1974 when the army of terracotta warriors and horses was discovered by a peasant digging a well .
Up to 5000 more life - size figures are believed to still be buried in the pit and awaiting excavation .
The Terracotta Army is one of the greatest archaeological finds of modern times , and was listed as a World Heritage Site in 1987 .

About 50 rungs further down the innovation ladder , some new Apple patent applications revealed this morning are definitely less interesting and complex than the few we covered last week .
In fact , considering some of the technology has already existed for quite some time we ’re not even sure why Apple is attempting to patent a few of these things .
In any case however , it ’s never a bad idea to stop and take a look at where the iPhone and iPhone OS may be headed in the future so let ’s start at the top .
The drawing above depicts an object identification interface that would allow the iPhone to recognize and deliver information about an object as a result of analyzing a photo / image or by scanning a bar code / RFID tag .
Novel ?
Definitely not .
Useful ?
Probably .
Hit the jump for more .
This next patent application covers something Apple was very proud of as a recent addition to iPhoto ’09 — facial recognition .
The difference here is that Apple envisions using the technology for controlling access and various handset functions which , if you ask us , does n’t sound overly appealing or useful .
In fact , we ’d venture to say it ’s less intuitive than other currently available options …
Like typing a password .
Here we have a message filtering patent application that describes various methods for controlling and filtering different text - based communications :
Control application includes an instructional tool or study aid where the administrator sets one or more modes , such as language , vocabulary , grammar , spelling , punctuation and / or other content of a text - based communication based on , for example , a user ’s age or grade level .
This can be especially useful , for example , such as when a child ’s grades go down .
A parent can then institute a condition to improve a child ’s grades .
For example , the control application may require a user during specified time periods to send messages in a designated foreign language , to include certain designated vocabulary words , or to use proper designated spelling , designated grammar and designated punctuation and like designated language forms based on the user ’s defined skill level and / or designated language skill rating .
If the text - based communication fails to include the required language or format , the control application may alert the user and / or the administrator / parent of the absence of such text .
Well is n’t Apple conscientious ?
Next up are a couple of patent applications pertaining to messaging that are designed to make things a bit easier and more efficient .
Above is a group messaging feature that will check the delivery status of sent messages after a predetermined time interval and alert the sender when certain recipients have not read the message .
Status reports , mmm .
The differentiating factor here we suppose , is the interface .
Related to the patent above , Apple also filed an application for a process that would notify users of unread messages and emails or new voicemails from a specific contact before a new message is delivered to said contact .
Not a bad idea .
Last but not least — actually it probably is least — the ability to change voice output .
Fair enough …
Despite the restrictions involved in playing back audio files , users of media devices may wish to change the audio output of audio files .
A mother , for example , might wish to change the narrator ’s voice in a pre-recorded , commercially available audiobook to her own voice , so that her child can listen to the audiobook as narrated in the mother ’s voice in her absence .
In another scenario , a student listening to a lecture as a podcast file might want to change the audio of certain sections of the lecture to sound like someone else ’s voice , so as to emphasize important parts of the lecture .
Sounds like more trouble than it ’s worth if you ask us , but perhaps there ’s more of a demand for Oprah ’s voice reading steamy romance novels than we were aware of .

Survey : “ It ’s The Economy , Stupid !
Opinion by Gilbert Mercier , NEWS JUNKIE POST
A survey from the Pew Research Center , released on July 8 , shows that the American public is hearing more negative news about the economy than good ones .
From January to May , it was a mix of good and bad news .
However , in the last few weeks the number of people saying that the economic news is mostly bad has increased .
Currently , 41 percent say they are hearing mostly bad news about the economy , it was 37 percent in June and 31 percent in May .
Only 3 percent of Americans say they are hearing good news about the economy .
Americans are keeping a close eye on economic news , 38 percent say they follow report on the condition of the economy very closely .
Since May , more Americans see news on the economy front as mostly bad .
This is particularly true among Independents .
Currently , 45 percent of Independents say they are hearing mostly bad news on the economy .
Among Republicans , it is 48 percent .
50 percent of Republicans say it is a mix of good and bad news .
Even among Democrats , the survey shows that 30 percent say the economic news has been mostly bad compared to 21 percent in May.
64 percent of Democrats think it is a mix of good and bad news .
In the last few days , various people from the Obama administration have been floating the idea of a second stimulus package .
This idea is favored by liberal economists as well as some notable figures of the financial world such as Warren Buffet .
At this juncture , and despite the risk of inflation and the increase of the budget deficit it seems that a second stimulus package is the best option for the Obama administration to boost the economy , and avoid a substantial erosion in the polls for President Obama and the Democrats .
If the economy and consumer confidence does n’t pick up before the end of the year , it will become easier for the GOP to keep calling the current recession “ Obama ’s recession , ” even so it is largely inaccurate .
This factor could make another White House ’s bid by President Obama in 2012 a lot more challenging .
An interesting piece of correspondence today from a person who observed how easy money dramatically transformed the technology industry , from rationality into mania .
I am deeply involved in the technology industry -- specifically computer software and the Internet -- and I lived through the tech bubble .
What impressed me about the tech bubble was not only the mania and the crash , which you describe quite well , but also how much damage the tech bubble itself did to my industry .
That damage has been lasting .
We do n't see it because we 're still coasting on the value that was created back when virtue , hard work , and real innovative thinking ruled this field .
I grew up with computers , getting my first and learning to program it around age four or five .
I remember back before the bubble .
Innovators would work for years on genuine significant innovations , often either privately in their basements or in academia .
When those innovations started to really blossom , they would cautiously and prudently step out into the business world and attempt to commercialize them .
There was venture capital available if something actually took off , but it was hard to get ( read : you had to actually have a business or at least something with provable solid demand and a valid business model ) .
It was this world which gave us the PC and the Internet .
The PC came out of personal and academic experimentation that was then cautiously commercialized starting with communities of enthusiastic hobbyists .
The Internet emerged from two things really : academic research ( DARPAnet , etc. ) and personal hobbyists building their own private communications networks between private bulletin board systems ( BBSes ) .
When the academic research networks met the BBS hobbyists , the Internet Service Provider was born .
The rest is history .
The web browser was invented by an academic institute to categorize scientific papers and make them available to other scientists .
It was commercialized by someone who had direct contact with that program and saw its commercial potential .
It all just came together naturally , organically .
Yes there was government backing at the academic level and to build early experimental networks , but it was a far different animal from inflationary bubble cash .
Ph.D research is real work ... the total opposite of flipping and coasting on a bubble .
It was glorious and fun .
I remember those days .
I was younger , but I lived through it .
I really have to underscore how exciting and fun it was .
Anyone could get into it , and there was a sense that if you worked hard and smart you could make your mark on the field regardless of who you were .
There was a real community around the whole thing , often referred to as " hackerdom . "
( Hacker in the classical positive sense , not the criminal sense . )
People helped each other .
They met , exchanged ideas , and had a great time .
Then the bubble came .
Billions and billions of inflationary money is always being created , and its always looking for somewhere to flow .
When the PC revolution converged with the ' net revolution and " it all came together , " M1 once again found a great way to become M2 .
The nature of the VC business changed dramatically almost overnight .
Before , VCs invested in solid businesses or at least provably solid ideas ( in the case of early - stage high - risk VC ) .
Now , VCs just wanted to get in on " dot com . "
It did n't matter if it was solid or not .
If it was " dot com " it was gold .
So much money started to flow into the sector you could make money just by getting a slice of the pie and then flipping it ... just like housing in 2004 - 2005 .
Also just like housing , this attracted an avalanche of new people to the sector .
Your mom wanted to become a technology entrepreneur .
* Everyone * wanted to start a startup or work for one .
All you needed was a very fluffy hand - wavey business plan and * some * kernel of potential value and you could grab some of that flipper cash .
As the bubble got bigger , standards dropped ... just like housing .
Eventually you did n't even need the kernel of value .
Like the housing bubble , it was exciting while it was happening .
Like a hard drug high , you do n't realize the damage it 's doing until it wears off .
It was only after , in retrospect , that it became clear just how the bubble had damaged the field .
The first casualty was the benevolent fun community .
" Hackerdom " is all but dead .
The flood did two things : 1 ) it brought in a huge sudden flood of drab careerists and manic opportunists who did n't actually care about the field and 2 ) it made every little kernel of an idea something to be guarded and squabbled over .
The sharing stopped .
The community ended .
After all , if you reveal when you 're doing then someone else will steal it and beat you to the punch .
It turned into a race to guard and protect and then hype and cash out .
The second casualty was quality and genuine innovation .
In a flipping environment , quality does n't matter .
Quality and innovation are deeply linked in technology , so by extension innovation no longer mattered .
By innovation , I mean * real * innovation ... the kind that actually takes brains and hard work .
So everyone set aside the hard deep innovation they were working on to chase the mundane but hype - laden trend of the week .
The third casualty was long - term investment and commitment to things once they entered the commercialization stage .
Instead of " how will you become profitable " and " how will you sustain your business " the question became " what is your exit strategy ? "
This means " how will you flip it ? "
The fallout of the bubble persists today .
The bubble mentality still dominates even though it no longer really works ... the easy money moved on to drown housing and I 'm sure will move on to something else soon .
I described the tech field pre-bubble , so now let me describe the desolation .
I would describe the tech field -- particularly the " startup " world of today -- as a bunch of hucksters and manic sociopaths leading the jaded .
Your typical tech entrepreneur has disdain for genuine innovation .
It 's a waste of time , and the people who do it are silly geeks who do n't " get it . "
Sitting in front of a monitor for years and trying to make really hard stuff happen is , like , work !
Most of the time nobody even pays you for it , or if you 're an academic instead of a basement hacker you might get a graduate stipend or a professors ' salary .
Suckers work .
People who really " get it " leverage and hype and flip , doing the absolute minimum amount of actual work required .
Of course , like I said , the people who are best at doing that are manic charismatic sociopaths .
Hype , cut corners , and flip , and be sure to position yourself to screw as many people as possible while not getting screwed yourself by the time the cash out event comes .
It is , for the most part , not fun anymore .
The environment is either hostile or jaded .
I have worked for years on something hard , and I lost two years of work when I started doing the fun thing and trying to share and develop a community .
I almost instantly came to the notice of one of these " flippers " and got lied and hyped into joining what turned out to be an absurd business venture .
I had to walk away from quite a bit of work in order to guard myself against future IP issues .
I am rebuilding , but it takes a long time and was quite a setback .
You can't share what you 're doing openly until you " vet " someone by really getting to know them for a while .
The whole industry is crawling with opportunists of various types , and most who are n't opportunists have absorbed the prevailing mentality that hard work and innovation are silly and will look at you with disdain and pity for doing it .
I am sitting here hoping for a second great depression .
Maybe if everything completely crashes and resets then the field will finally heal and we 'll have the old world of exciting innovation and responsible honest business back .
I would rather eat garbage out of a dumpster for the next two years if after that I could have sanity return .
But a violent purge is not going to happen ... though I do see some " green shoots . "
Not the kind the pundits talk about of course ... the green shoots I 'm talking about are manic hype - laden hot air businesses going bankrupt .
Despite the propping up of the economy , it is happening .
I give a silent cheer whenever one gives up the ghost .
Die !
Die worthless hype !
The vacuous flippers and con men continue to mill around , but subsequent bubbles are luring them away .
I cheer too whenever I see one leave tech for " greener pastures . "
Look !
Over there !
There 's a bubble in pork bellies !
Go !
Good riddance .
So I suppose that if the bubble machine stays away from our field we might finally return to sanity .
" Hackers " will start innovating again , and real honest sustainable businesses run by businessmen without diagnosable mental disorders will begin once again to dominate the field .
We can only hope .
Comoros is an archipelago of three main islands about 2,900 kilometres south of Yemen , between Africa 's southeastern coast and Madagascar . ( ( CBC ) )
A French navy captain said Thursday his vessel has detected the black boxes of a Yemenia Airways plane that crashed last month near the Comoros Islands .
Comoran authorities , meanwhile , are still investigating the cause of the June 30 crash .
A woman from Ottawa was among the 152 victims of Flight 626 , which crashed into the Indian Ocean between the southeastern African coast and Madagascar while en route from the Yemeni capital of San'a to Comoros .
A 12 - year - old girl was the only known survivor .
Capt .
Marc Reina told The Associated Press from the French island of Reunion that his crew has found where the black boxes lie beneath the Indian Ocean and mapped the area off the Comoran coast .
He said that underwater robots should begin operating in August to retrieve the black boxes , which lie too deep for divers to reach .
The plane 's cockpit voice and flight data recorders could help explain why it crashed as it tried to land in heavy winds .
In the course of gathering electronic evidence in an investigation , apparently the Justice Department sometimes has trouble telling the difference between a subpoena of " stored communications " and warrantless wiretapping .
But it should n't be that hard to distinguish between demanding existing e-mail records from an ISP and ordering an ISP to proactively collect a user 's e-mail over a period of six months so that you can then go back and subpoena the collection .
So , the EFF filed an amicus brief in Warshak v. United States to help ensure that the DOJ 's apparent confusion is n't transmitted to the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals .
As part of a 2005 criminal investigation of Stephen Warshak for fraud , the government invoked the Stored Communications
Act of 1986 to justify issuing a secret order to Warshak 's ISP , NuVox , demanding copies of Warshak 's e-mail .
When Warshak found out that the DOJ was reading his e-mails , he filed a civil suit against the government , claiming that the manner in which the e-mail snooping was carried out violated both the SCA and the Fourth Amendment .
Two years later , in the landmark case of Warner v. United States , the Sixth Circuit Court ruled in Warshak 's favor , establishing that users have an expectation of privacy in their email communications just like they do when they use the telephone .
( The best coverage of this case was done by Orin Kerr at the Volokh Conspiracy . )
The present case in which the EFF filed its latest brief is the actual criminal case against Warshak , and this time the EFF is arguing that not only did the government violate the SCA and the Fourth Amendment , but it went against the DOJ 's own surveillance manual as well .
In the EFF 's telling of the facts surrounding the case , the government approached NuVox under seal and asked them to " prospectively preserve " Warshak 's communications for several months .
Then , once NuVox had built up a body of such stored email communications , the feds invoked the SCA to obtain them from NuVox without a warrant .
The EFF argues that " the government misused the SCA to conduct a ' back door wiretap ' of Warshak 's emails and bypass the Wiretap Act 's strict requirements , including its requirement of probable cause . "
The EFF 's brief quotes the relevant section of the DOJ 's surveillance manual , which goes out of its way to make clear the difference between preserving existing records and prospectively preserving records that have n't yet been created :
Agents may direct providers to preserve existing records pending the issuance of compulsory legal process .
Such requests have no prospective effect , however .
Agents who send � 2703 ( f ) letters to network service providers should be aware of [ a ] limitation [ ] .
[ T ]he authority to direct providers to preserve records and other evidence is not prospective .
That is , � 2703 ( f ) letters can order a provider to preserve records that have already been created , but cannot order providers to preserve records not yet made .
If agents want providers to record information about future electronic communications , they must comply with the electronic surveillance statutes discussed in Chapter 4 [ i.e. , the Wiretap Act for communications content , and the Pen Register Statute for non- content communications information ] .
One wonders if the Obama DOJ under Holder will drop the case entirely , given its predecessors ' evidence gathering shenanigans .
The administration has been a huge disappointment to civil liberties advocates so far in a number of high - profile , terrorism - related cases , opting to maintain more continuity with the Bush administration than the ACLU and other advocacy groups would like .
Israel and the US are within sight of a compromise deal on halting settlement construction in the West Bank and paving the way to a resumption of political negotiations with moderate Palestinian leaders .
Widespread indications that Israel will agree to a partial freeze on settlement construction were reinforced yesterday when its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped a " bridging formula " on settlement building would be reached .
Mr Netanyahu will hold detailed negotiations in London today with the US presidential envoy George Mitchell .
Mr Netanyahu has already said a meeting with the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is possible during or immediately after the UN General Assembly in New York on 23 September .
Barack Obama may well announce the resumption of negotiations alongside the two men .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Abbas has said he will not resume talks without a freeze .
Washington has argued that a moratorium would allow talks on the borders of a future Palestinian state which would then determine where Jewish homes could and could not be built .
Mr Netanyahu has been seeking in return a promise from the US that if its offer of engagement with Iran is rebuffed , it will lead to swift and stringent sanctions , including on oil and gas , as pressure on Tehran to halt its perceived military nuclear programme .
He also wants steps by Arab states towards " normalisation " of relations .
While Saudi Arabia has been reluctant for such moves without a final Israeli - Palestinian peace deal , smaller Gulf states – most publicly Bahrain – have appeared warmer to the idea .
The pressure to resume negotiations is likely to prove irresistible for Palestinians , but the settlement freeze appears to fall short of their expectations .
It seems likely to allow for about 2,500 housing units , already deemed under construction , to go ahead .
Mr Netanyahu yesterday confidently reasserted that no freeze could apply to the Israeli Arab East Jerusalem .
Also Mr Netanyahu has urged Britain to stop supporting the Israeli Army veterans ' group Breaking the Silence , which is strongly critical of the military assault on Gaza in January .
Previous | Next The Plumber That Can't Posted at : 2009-07-21 09:40:44 Original ad :
I NEED CASH !
I am a handyman and can do all kinds of work .
I do plumbing , dry wall , electric , general construction , and any other job you need done !
Email or call From Dan Gibson to *************@********.org
Hello ,
Your handyman skills are needed .
I have a problem I was hoping you would be able to help me with .
Last night , when I was throwing up , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet and flushed it .
It is a small phone , so I am pretty sure it made its way to my septic tank in the backyard .
I need to get this phone back .
It has an irreplaceable picture of my friend Tim hooking up with a fat chick , and I need this picture so I can taunt him with it for the rest of his life .
I will hire you to sift through my septic tank to find the phone .
It is a 1250 gallon septic tank , and has not been drained in a while .
On the plus side , I will let you keep anything you find that is not my phone .
There is probably a ton of spare change that was accidentally flushed , and maybe some other treasures .
The pay for this job could potentially be huge .
Please let me know when you can help .
I am free all week .
Just contact me via e-mail , because my phone obviously is in a world of shit ( no pun intended )
Thanks ,
Dan
From ivan ******* to Me
you must be out of your fucking mind .
From Dan Gibson to ivan *******
So is that a yes ?
Your handyman ad said that you did plumbing .
Dan
From ivan ******* to Me
yeah but did it say that i swim through tanks of fucking shit ?
no .
you couldnt pay me a thousand dollars to do that .
From Dan Gibson to ivan *******
Well I just thought that was implied with " I do plumbing . "
I did n't realize it meant that you did n't take jobs that you are too scared to do .
I just remembered , a while ago , my ex-wife 's engagement ring was accidentally flushed when I was nailing her on the toilet .
If you find it , it is yours .
It is only a cubic zirconia ( fooled her , ha ha ! ) , but it is still probably worth about $ 50 .
I also just flushed some air fresheners down the toilet , to freshen up the septic tank for you .
Are you going to help me now or what ?
From ivan ******* to Me
Wow
You sound like a real classy guy .
you dont need a handyman what you need is a fucking septic tank expert with a death wish .
fuck off .
From Dan Gibson to ivan *******
Nah , I think I just need a REAL handyman , not some pussy who says he does plumbing but then backs out when he finds out that the job is too hard .
It is n't even a hard job , so I do n't know what your problem is .
Hell , my 10 - year - old son could do this .
In fact , he has done this before .
I 'd ask him to do it again but the ex took my kids and moved to Arizona .
Will you hurry up and do the job ?
The phone is still ringing when I call it from the house , but the battery life will not last that long .
I think I can even hear it when I stand outside over my septic tank .
Tell you what , while you are sifting through it , I 'll flush down some soap to clean the tank a little bit .
From ivan ******* to Me
gee i wonder why your wife took your kids ... FUCK OFF .
you are a fucking retard !!

MIAMI , July 6 ( UPI ) --
Memory impairment was reversed in aged mice , bred to develop symptoms of Alzheimer 's disease , after they were given caffeine , U.S. researchers said .
Researchers at the University of South Florida said back - to - back studies show caffeine significantly decreased abnormal levels of the protein linked to Alzheimer 's disease -- both in the brains and in the blood of mice exhibiting symptoms of the disease .

Both studies build upon previous research by the University of South Florida that showed caffeine in early adulthood prevented the onset of memory problems in mice bred to develop Alzheimer 's symptoms in old age .
" The new findings provide evidence that caffeine could be a viable ' treatment ' for established Alzheimer 's disease , and not simply a protective strategy , " lead author Gary Arendash said in a statement .
" That 's important because caffeine is a safe drug for most people , it easily enters the brain , and it appears to directly affect the disease process . "
The Alzheimer 's mice received the equivalent of five 8 - oz. cups of regular coffee a day -- 500 milligrams of caffeine .
In the study , half of the 55 mice genetically altered to develop memory problems mimicking Alzheimer 's disease were given caffeine , and half were given water .
At the end of the two - month study , the caffeinated mice performed much better on tests measuring their memory and thinking skills .
The study was published online in the Journal of Alzheimer 's Disease .
A teenage girl who acted as a “ honey trap ” to lure a smitten 16 - year - old boy to his death at the hands of a love rival is facing a life sentence .
Samantha Joseph was convicted of murder at the Old Bailey for leading Shakilus Townsend to the cul - de- sac where he was killed by a masked and hooded gang .
The love struck teenager bled to death after being beaten with baseball bats and stabbed six times in a “ relentless and merciless attack ” .
He was besotted with Joseph , a schoolgirl from Brockley , south east London , and told his mother he wanted to marry her , but she told others she was using him and treated him like “ s*** ” .
While Joseph , who was 15 at the time , was happy for Shakilus to shower her with gifts , she was still obsessed with another teenager , gang member Danny McLean .
McLean had dumped her when he found out about her relationship with Shakilus but she was prepared to do anything to get him back .
CCTV pictures from the day of the attack in July last year show Joseph wearing a see - through floral dress as she met Shakilus and took a bus with him .
He thought they were on their way to meet her cousin but in fact she was playing a “ dangerous double game ” luring him to the ambush in Thornton Heath , south London , while secretly keeping in touch with McLean by mobile phone .
She laughed as his attackers caught him and began raining down blows with fists , feet and baseball bats before she turned and walked away .
McLean — who had himself been injured by a bat during the furious melee — plunged a knife into his chest , raking it across his liver before twisting the blade .
As he lay bleeding to death Shakilus called out for his mother and cried : “ I do n't want to die . ”
Joseph , who can now be named after trial Judge Richard Hawkins lifted an order banning her identification , was later seen walking off with McLean , carrying his hoodie and a cream - coloured handbag stained with his blood .
McLean was wearing a bright orange bandana , the colour identifying him as a member of the “ Shine My Nine ” gang to which he and the other attackers belonged .
Joseph later set about trying to “ rub out ” any trace of her relationship with Shakilus , deleting his online Bebo account and telling friends to erase his number from their phones .
In court she admitted agreeing to lead him into the ambush so that he could get beaten up but said she did not realise he would be seriously hurt .
But jurors rejected her explanation and she was found guilty of murder along with McLean ( 18 ) of Thornton Heath .
Brian Altman QC , prosecuting , told jurors : “ Shakilus had been seeing her for a matter of weeks , but she was playing a dangerous game , because she was cheating on Danny McLean .
“ It is clear that he had come to learn of her deception and , by way of recompense , she agreed to set up the hapless Shakilus Townsend in a honey trap with a lethal and tragic twist .
“ She was more than equal to the task .
“ She played her part to perfection , duping Shakilus who could see no wrong in her , the others in hot pursuit of him . ”
Shakilus 's mother Nicola Dyer , ( 34 ) said : “ He said he was really in love with this girl , that she was to be his future wife and that she was going to have his kids — he was really smitten with her . ”
Brothers Tyrell Ellis ( 19 ) and Don-Carlos Ellis ( 18 ) from Thornton Heath , were also convicted of murder , together with Andrew Johnson - Haynes , a 19 - year - old former public schoolboy from Croydon .
Two other youths , Andre Thompson and Michael Akinfenwa , both 17 , were found guilty of the charge as well .
The defendants were remanded in custody to be sentenced on a date to be fixed .

TOKYO -- Look out Ichiro Suzuki and Daisuke Matsuzaka .
A pair of baseball - playing robots that can pitch and hit with incredible results have been developed in Japan .
The pitching robot , with its three - fingered hand , can throw 90 percent of its pitches in the strike zone , wo n't need any relief from the bullpen and never asks for a pay raise .

The batting robot , which has a sensor to determine if pitches are strikes or balls , hits balls in the strike zone almost 100 percent of the time , does n't swing at pitches outside the strike zone , and is guaranteed to pass all drug tests .
The two robots were created by University of Tokyo professor Masatoshi Ishikawa .
" The demand level of the robotics technology of each robot is very high , " Ishikawa said .
" What was difficult was to create a mechanism to satisfy such a high level of demand . "
The pitching robot throws a plastic foam ball at 25 miles per hour , but Ishikawa is hoping to increase the speed to 93 mph and make it able to throw off - speed pitches like curves and sliders .
Ishikawa is also working on getting the batting robot to be able to hit to all parts of the field .
The robots do n't resemble humans but instead the type of robots on a car assembly line .
Japan boasts one of the leading robotics industries in the world , and the government is pushing to develop the industry as a road to growth .

August 1 , 2009 -- Parti Sosialis Malaysia --
The 40,000 - strong mobilisation today in Kuala Lumpur and the thousands who did not make it because of police roadblocks gave a very clear and precise message to Malaysia 's Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak : repeal the draconian Internal Security Act ( ISA ) .
The pro-ISA gathering fizzled out or was drowned by the immense anti-ISA gathering led by the Abolish ISA Movement – a coalition of 83 organisation including Parti Sosialis Malaysia ( PSM ) .
This has been the biggest ever gathering organised against the ISA since the draconian law was enacted 49 years ago .
The police used chemical - laced tear gas on the peaceful and well organised crowd .
More than 400 people were arrested , including scores of PSM supporters .
The gathering , spearheaded by the Parti Islam Se - Malaysia ( PAS , Islamic Party of Malaysia ) and other opposition parties , was the biggest opposition rally since the 2008 general election .
The PSM and JERIT played prominent roles with the other parties in organising this huge gathering .
It was a victory for the democratic movement and a blow to the government and the pro-ISA group .
The prime minister yesterday called on the anti-ISA protesters to give him ideas on how to improve this draconian law which his government said that they are in the process of amending .
The message today was clear that the people want the ISA abolished .
The ISA has been used for the last five decades , by all the prime ministers , against democratic movements , the workers ' movement , civil society and student movements to enable the government to cling to power .
It was the deadliest weapon in its arsenal in the hands of the ruling party .
The PSM applauds the brave people who came to the streets today to make a point .
A huge number of young people who participated in the rally were given hope that the strugggle ahead is bright .
ABOLISH THE ISA NOW !
[ S. Arutchelvan is secretary general of the PSM . ]
438 individuals arrested at the anti-ISA rally in KL
August 1 , 2009 -- According to CPO KL , DCP Datuk Muhammad Sabtu Osman , the police have arrested 438 people at the anti-ISA rally in KL today and most of them are detained at Markas Pasukan Gerakan Am Cheras and a small group detained in Bukit Jalil Police Station .
From 2.30 pm onwards , the police have been shooting tear gas and spraying chemical - laced water cannons towards the 10,000 - strong crowd near Sogo shopping complex in Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman to force them to disperse .
Another 2,000 - strong crowd that marched from Masjid Negara to Pasar Seni were surrounded by FRU and police at Dataran Merdeka .
Tear gas and chemical - laced water cannons were also used during aggressive attempts at dispersing the crowd .

SUARAM condemns the use of tear gas and chemical - laced water cannons against the protesters .
The police also used excessive and violent force against the protesters .
The traffic in KL is in total lock down because of police roadblocks that are used to screen for protesters and to deny their right to assembly and freedom of expression which are guaranteed under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Federal Constitution of Malaysia .
Even with the crackdown of the police on this Anti-ISA rally , it is still a massive success as around 20,000 people have attended and voiced out their dissatisfaction on Najib Razak ’s government , and that the draconian Internal Security Act ( ISA ) should not just be reviewed , but abolished .
We demand that the police release all arrested individuals immediately and unconditionally .
We also demand that the police stop harassing the Malaysian people from exercising their rights to assembly and stop the assault on freedom of expression .
Released by , Wong Chai Yi , SUARAM Coordinator
Urgent action needed :
Please write protest letters to the government and the police to express your strongest condemnation of the arrests and the ongoing denial of rights of expression .
Please also demand the Malaysian government for the immediate and unconditional release the three activists .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- JetBlue Airways will offer an " all - you - can - jet " pass for $ 599 in which passengers can book an unlimited number of flights within a one - month span , the airline said Wednesday .
Pass holders can fly to any of JetBlue 's ( JBLU ) 56 destinations between Sept. 8 and Oct. 8 , with no seat limitations or blackout dates , the company said in a release .
Airline equities analyst Bob McAdoo , of Avondale Partners , said he " has never seen a promotion like this before . "
In fact , Air Canada had a similar promotion in 2007 , where it offered an unlimited flight pass starting at $ 1,657 per month .
Still , with JetBlue flights already slashed as low as $ 100 , customers might have to fly 6 or 7 times in a month before they break even .
" This is a way to get people to pay attention , with publicity that does n't cost the company much , " McAdoo said .
" They 're doing this at a time when there are probably a lot of seats available anyway . "
Customers must buy the $ 599 pass by Aug. 21 , and they can book flights within three days of the departure date .
All travel using the pass must be booked between Aug. 12 and Oct. 5 .
Taxes and fees are included for domestic flights , and changes or cancellations made less than three days before departure cost $ 100 .

PDT 1997 ADVANCED BIOLOGY LAB by Linda Loring
I work as a technician in a health research laboratory .
We end up handling some pretty scary stuff .
A lot of the work we do has to do with AIDS , and we also have some defense contracts involving research into ways of counteracting biological warfare .
All in all , we work with a good many substances no human should come in contact with , or even take a chance on breathing .
Substances like that are handled in a special section of the laboratory .
No one is allowed in the room when it 's in use .
Sealed containers are passed in through a sort of miniature air lock , and once the inner door of the lock is opened , the containers are opened and the contents moved around using special mechanical arms .
The mechanical arms are manipulated from a control room .
From the control room you can see into the lab through thick , airtight windows .
You can't see into the control room from the lab , ordinarily , because the laboratory area is brightly lit while the control room is fairly dim .
The whole set - up is amazingly high - tech .
The eight mechanical arms can reach anywhere in the lab , and their " hands " , each with a " thumb " and two " fingers " , have tremendous strength but are also capable of precise movement , even in microscopic dimensions .
Normally we manipulate the arms and their hands by putting our own hands into special glove - like fixtures and moving our own fingers the way we want their mechanical counterparts to move .
Larger or smaller movements require separate controls , and a whole sequence of movements can be programmed into the computer , which then controls all movements .
We can interrupt the computer 's control if something unexpected happens , reposition things manually , and tell the computer to pick up right where it left off .
There are six videotape cameras in the lab , and they can be directed to cover any part of the room from almost any angle .
The special video recorders are in the control room , and when we need to make a presentation to someone outside the lab , signals from those recorders can be fed into a standard VCR and recorded in full color onto regular videotape .
All of this equipment is , as I said , normally used to work with deadly viruses and other toxins .
But , as I recently discovered , it can be put to other uses as well .
The discovery took place late last Saturday night .
I 'd been working on an experiment using several laboratory rats .
It was n't my job to give them food and water , but the weekend staff sometimes " forgets " to take care of the animals in the contagion room .
My rats were already pretty weak , and if they went all weekend without food and water , they 'd probably be dead by Monday morning , and I 'd have to start the experiment over from the beginning .
I 'd fretted about the rats all day , and finally , after coming out of a late movie a little before midnight , I decided to go over to the lab and check on them myself .
I pulled into the parking lot behind the lab , noticing absently that there was another car parked down at the end of the dark lot .
I did a double take when I recognized the car - it was one of those little Mazda two - seater jobs , and it belonged Kristin , a /k / a the " ice queen " .
Kristin was the newest of the research biologists , having come to work at the lab only two months earlier .
She was a real whiz with the computer system that controlled the mechanical arms in the contagion room , but that was n't the attribute she was best known for .
The severe clothes she wore could n't hide the fact that she was really stacked , and I had to admit that her pale blonde hair and her face were n't bad either .
All of us females in the lab , researchers and technicians alike , were jealous of the way the men had drooled over her at first , but from what I 'd heard , none of them had been able to get to first base with her .
That was why some of them had begun referring to her as the " ice queen " .
Usually when one of the women 's cars stayed in the lot all night one could infer that she was spending the night elsewhere , after a successful date with one of the men who worked in the lab .
That seemed unlikely , from what I knew of Kristin 's reputation , but I decided that her personal life was n't any of my business anyway , and went inside .
The outer door of the building used a regular key , and then I had to use first another key and then a specially coded magnetic card to get into the secure area of the lab .
By the time I 'd made it through the last door I was aware that the lights were on in the contagion room .
That did n't surprise me a lot , because the weekend staff was often careless about the lights , too .
Still , I was curious enough to slip into the darkened control room in order to see , without being seen , whether someone was in the C - Room , as we called it .
Someone was there , all right , and the sight just about blew my mind !
Kristin lay on her back on one of the work counters , totally nude , her clothing in a pile on the floor .
That would have been astounding enough , but what made the scene really incredible was that the " fingers " on one of the mechanical arms were fondling one of her breasts while those on a second arm were busy admidst the pale hair between her legs !
Incredulous at what I was seeing , I sat down to watch .
The computer beside me was on and the screen indicated that it was in the " engaged " mode , which meant it was controlling the mechanical devices in the C - Room .
Kristin had obviously done a little extra-curricular programming , and from what I could tell she seemed to have done a very good job !
I could n't hear anything from the next room , but Kristin 's head and body were in constant motion as the mechanical digits caressed first one breast and then the other , pulled gently at her engorged nipples , and glided easily in and out of the dark slit that was only half - hidden by her silky pubic hair .
I stood up quietly and slipped a blank tape into the VCR .
I did n't know what I might do with the tape , but the way my own juices were starting to flow , I suspected that I was going to want to watch this scene again - in living color , no less !
It was while I was loading the tape that I noticed a third mechanical arm .
It was motionless now , but Kristin plainly did n't expect it to remain so , because its padded fingers were clamped around the base of the largest dildo I 'd ever seen !
For some reason the sight of that dildo really pissed me off .
I can't explain exactly why it bothered me so much , but here was a woman with the most perfect body I 'd ever seen , or even imagined , who could have any man she even looked at .
But instead of taking any of the offers she'd had , she constructed her perfect mechanical lover , and now she was waiting for it to fuck her !
If she were really ugly , maybe I could accept what she was doing .
For Kristin to do it , though , seemed like a gesture of contempt for the rest of us , who had to settle for mortal lovers and their fragile egos , their clumsy foreplay , their sweaty bodies and their ordinary - sized cocks that so often had to be coaxed laboriously to life .
I decided to retaliate .
Without any definite plan in mind , I switched on the video monitor in the control room , so I could see and hear what was being recorded on the video tape , and disengaged the computer .
Kristin looked surprised as the magic fingers stopped their kneading and probing , and then astonished as the hand that had been toying with her pussy moved up to her waist .
Astonishment gave way to alarm as I used the arm to roll her onto her stomach .
She began to struggle , making incoherent sounds , but I pushed two of the mechanical hands into the small of her back to hold her in place on the flat counter .
I had n't decided what to do next , but the sight of her perfect ass , wiggling as she tried vainly to get her knees under her , gave me an idea .
I spread the arms slightly and opened their fingers to grip Kristin firmly on either side of her narrow waist .
With their immense strength the mechanical arms had no trouble lifting her off the counter .
I swung her into the middle of the room , where she hung suspended by her middle about five feet off the floor , head down , boobs jutting , legs kicking and arms flailing helplessly .
" Stop it " , she yelled , " whoever you are !
Put me down , now ! "
I offered no response as my eyes searched the C - Room for a suitable object .
I found a perfect one on another work counter - a 50 - centimeter scale .
It was like a ruler except that it was made out of thick , clear plastic , twenty inches long , two inches wide and about a quarter of an inch thick .
I activated the third arm - the one holding the dildo - and Kristin , looking upside down between her legs , must have seen it move , because she started screaming and kicking wildly .
" No !
Do n't you dare touch me with that ! " , she shrieked .
She relaxed a little when she realized the arm was moving past her .
I fully intended to make use of the dildo , but not just yet .
Opening the mechanical fingers , I dropped the dildo on the counter and picked up the plastic scale .
It took a little maneuvering to get the hand to hold the scale properly , clutching it near the end and locking the fingers so that a minor flick of the mechanical " wrist " imparted considerable speed and momentum to the heavy scale .
Then I moved the arm into position behind and slightly to the side of Kristin 's creamy white ass .
All I knew about spanking I 'd learned as a child , bent over the edge of the kitchen table while my mother applied a yardstick to the seat of my jeans or , on a few occasions , to my bared bottom .
That had taught me that spankings were both painful and humiliating , and those were precisely the sensations I wanted the ice queen to experience .
I gave the mechanical wrist an experimental flick , and was rewarded with a sharp yelp of pain through the control room speaker .
The plastic scale had landed on the left cheek of Kristin 's ass , but it had n't bounced away as I thought it would have if I 'd been holding the scale in my own hand .
I tried a lighter touch , but it was evidently too light , because Kristin did n't make a sound .
In a matter of minutes , though , I became quite adept , if I say so myself .
Each swing of the makeshift paddle resulted in a satisfying yell from Kristin and left another pink blotch on the silky skin of her bottom .
I picked up the tempo as I became more confident , and let the scale wander over the backs of her thighs as well as her ass .
In almost no time the ice queen was sobbing and begging for the paddling to stop .
She had n't been spanked as a child , I guessed , or she 'd have more endurance .
I responded to her pleas with a blistering flurry of smacks that really covered the target area and had Kristin kicking and screaming .
Any effort she might have made earlier to keep her legs closed was abandoned , and the video camera had perfect view of her wet beaver - though it could n't have been as wet as mine was !
Then I moved the arm over to the other work surface and laid the scale carefully on the edge of the counter .
I picked up the gross - looking dildo and began moving the arm back toward Kristin .
She saw it coming and began shrieking in protest again .
I decided that I enjoyed being the spanker instead of the spankee enough that I could let Kristin decide when she preferred the dildo to the paddle .
I dropped the dildo , picked up the plastic scale , and resumed my attack on that perfectly shaped ass .
By that time I was becoming a real virtuoso , and the feeling between my legs was leading me to think that I should take up bare - bottom spanking as a serious hobby , if not a full - time profession .
Kristin yelled and begged as I peppered her immobilized butt and flailing thighs with dozens of stinging blows .
Once her ass and the backs of her thighs had turned a nearly uniform shade of crimson , I stopped the spanking and exchanged the scale for the dildo again .
Again Kristin protested when she the saw the mechanical fingers grasp the plastic cock , but when I put it down and moved toward the scale , she quickly said " No , no more of that , do n't hit me any more ! "
She said nothing as I moved the dildo slowly toward her .
The camera had a clear view of Kristin 's pussy but I did n't , so I halted the arm carrying the dildo a couple of feet away from her , and used the other robot arms to turn her until she was facing almost directly away from me .
Then I had to move the camera so that it had essentially the same view I did , and zoomed it to provide a close - up shot .
I wondered suddenly , as I swung the third arm around and thrust the flesh - colored dildo toward Kristin 's glistening cuntlips , if this was how a man felt as he prepared to shove his dick into a woman 's waiting pussy .
Too bad , I thought , that the mechanical appendages had no nerves ; it would have been a blast to feel what a man feels at the moment of entry .
Kristin groaned as I touched the tip of the dildo against the outer lips of her pussy .
I increased the pressure , watching in fascination as her clitoris flattened and her lips spread to surround the enormous phallus .
I pushed harder , and Kristin gave a sharp cry as two inches of the ribbed dildo sank out of sight .
By that time , I was sure , the latex - covered plastic was well into her vagina , and I must have the angle about right or she'd be screaming her head off .
My own pussy convulsed with envy as I gave the control a shove and buried another seven inches of artificial cock in the ice queen .
The moan that came through the speaker did n't sound much like pain .
I pulled the dildo back several inches and pushed it in again .
The movement required almost no effort , and I marveled at how quickly Kristin had adapted to an object of that size .
I started stroking in and out , wishing again that the dildo had nerves and could somehow transmit to me the sensations it was feeling .
I wondered if any man had ever been inside the ice queen to feel those sensations .
That thought resurrected some of my earlier anger , and I decided that I 'd be damned if I was going to stand there fucking some woman who thought she was too good to get screwed by a flesh and blood man - especially when I had a nice vibrator at home that I 'd been neglecting lately .
I stopped thrusting with the dildo , which provoked little whimpers from my colleague in the next room , and quickly programmed the computer to continue with a four - inch back - and - forth stroke , along the same axis , for another fifteen minutes , then to withdraw the third arm , lower the other two near the floor , and separate them .
Fifteen minutes would be plenty of time for the ice queen to get her rocks off a time or ten , and then to start imagining the scene the next morning when the weekend crew came in and found her suspended naked and being humped continuously by computer - controlled device that only she knew how to program .
It would also give me plenty of time to get out of the building and several miles away before a much - relieved biologist could start trying to identify her unknown tormentor .
I let the VCR record the first gasps of ecstasy , then popped the tape out and slipped it into my purse .
I left the recorder on , so Kristin would know she 'd been on candid camera , and hurried out to my car .
I could check on my mice the next day .
Kristin cleaned up well ; there was no sign of her nighttime adventure when I went by the lab about noon the next day , although I did notice that the plastic scale was nowhere to be found .
My mice had been fed and watered , and were doing as well as could be expected , considering the stuff I 'd injected into them .
The first item on the agenda at our staff meeting on Monday morning was an announcement that Kristin had resigned .
No one knew just why , but the director wished her well , in absentia , in whatever her new endeavors might be .
And I 've decided to learn everything there is to know about programming the computer that controls the mechanical arms in the C - Room .
The vibrator was comforting , but I 've thought of some experiments I might like to conduct here , late some Saturday night .

Since the number of miles traveled by motor vehicles in the USA peaked in November 2007 , the nation 's 12 - month total has dropped by 123 billion miles .
The nation heads into the Independence Day holiday weekend amid the longest and steepest decline in driving since the invention of the automobile .
Since the number of miles traveled by motor vehicles in the USA peaked in November 2007 , the nation 's 12 - month total has dropped by 123 billion miles , or slightly more than 4 % .
That 's a bigger decline than the drop of just above 3 % during the 1979 - 80 Iranian revolution that triggered a spike in gasoline prices in the USA .
The 4 % drop is the equivalent of taking between 8 million and 10 million drivers off the road .
" We may be witnessing the beginning of a fundamental shift in American driving habits , " says Ed McMahon , senior research fellow at the Urban Land Institute , a non-profit group that promotes innovative development .
The Federal Highway Administration 's miles - traveled report for April , the most recent available , suggests a slight flattening out .
While April 's total was up 0.6 % from April 2008 , continuing rises in joblessness and gas prices are likely to limit driving , McMahon says .
JULY 4TH : Creativity helps keep celebrations MORE : Statue of Liberty gets her view back FUEL FORUM : Discuss how prices are affecting your holiday budget
As the USA prepares to celebrate the Fourth of July , many Americans are choosing to watch fireworks close to home .
AAA projects that the number of people taking a trip of 50 miles or more this holiday weekend will drop 1.9 % from a year ago .
The leisure travel organization attributes the projected decline to uncertainty about the economy , " especially rising joblessness and sagging personal incomes . "
The recent spike in gas prices also might be a concern , AAA says .
Gas prices were the driving force behind the nation 's change in driving habits , says analyst Alan Pisarski , author of Commuting in America .
" When people saw $ 3 a gallon , when they saw $ 4 a gallon , it was something akin to sticker shock .
It really did have an effect on people 's behavior . "
He says people started taking transit , carpooling , merging trips and cutting back on vacation travel .
Many stayed with alternative modes of transportation even after gas prices retreated last year .
Bernard Assaf , 36 , a software engineer from a northern Atlanta suburb , says he wo n't get back in his car for the 40 - mile round trip to work even if gas prices plummet .
With help from The Clean Air Campaign , an Atlanta non-profit that promotes transportation alternatives , he now carpools to a satellite parking lot 7 miles from home , then takes public transit to his office .
" For me , it 's not just about the price of gas , " he says .
" If I put 40 miles a day on my car vs. 14 miles , that 's a big difference .
I 've gotten too used to doing things besides gripping the steering wheel to go back . "
Pisarski and McMahon say the drop in miles traveled has had a greater impact on people living in far - flung suburbs , which were hardest hit by both the housing collapse and high gas prices , and those in rural communities .
John Crabtree , spokesman for the Center for Rural Affairs , a non-profit rural advocacy and economic development group based in Lyons , Neb. , says it 's " a double - edged sword " for many rural communities .
More people are shopping close to home , giving local merchants a boost .
" But if you or your child need to go the doctor , and you live 40 miles form the nearest health care provider , it makes a difference whether gas is $ 2 a gallon or $ 3 a gallon , " Crabtree says .
" People are forced to make difficult choices . "
The driving drop - off also signals a reversal in auto ownership among African Americans and Hispanics , which had been increasing since 1970 , Pisarski says .
" That will limit access to jobs , and will be a factor in the overall economy in getting people back to work , " he says .
McMahon says his research shows that people over the past three years are trending toward compact , transit - oriented developments that mix residential , retail and office uses and encourage walking .
Even when the economy recovers , he says , people wo n't resume driving at previous rates .
" We 've crossed the Rubicon here in terms of a change , " he says .

Given a choice between their worldview and the facts , it 's always interesting how many people toss the facts .
Right now , the United States is plagued by an army of " birthers " who claim that because Barack Obama was not really born in America , he 's not legitimately president .
Their evidence is non-existent , their arguments loopy , but people who find our non-white president unacceptable would rather scour the Hawaiian medical records system and invent bizarre theories than face their own internal turmoil .
Or racism .
What people were willing to believe about Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans four years ago is a more serious matter .
Of racism .
And cliche .
The story , as the mainstream media presented it at the time , was about marauding hordes of looters , rapists and murderers swarming through the streets .
The descriptions were pretty clearly focused on African - Americans , the great majority left behind in the evacuation of the city ( which was then two - thirds black anyway ) .
There were supposed to be a lot of murder victims and murderers in the Superdome , the sports stadium the city opened up as a refuge of last resort .
The rumours were believed so fervently that they were used to turn New Orleans into a prison city , with supplies and would - be rescuers prevented from entering and the victims prevented from evacuating .
The belief that a Hobbesian war of all - against - all had broken loose justified treating the place as a crime zone or even a hostile country rather than a place in which grandmothers and toddlers were stranded in hideous conditions , desperately in need of food , water , shelter and medical attention .
Louisiana 's governor at the time , Kathleen Blanco , announced as she dispatched National Guard troops : " I have one message for these hoodlums : these troops know how to shoot and kill , and they are more than willing to do so if necessary , and I expect they will . "
She and the city 's mayor had called off the rescue efforts to focus on protecting private property – with lethal force if necessary .
The sheriff of the suburb across the Crescent City Connection bridge from downtown New Orleans turned back stranded tourists and locals at gunpoint .
" As we approached the bridge , " wrote two stranded paramedics , " armed Gretna sheriffs formed a line across the foot of the bridge .
Before we were close enough to speak , they began firing their weapons over our heads . "
Katrina was a fairly terrible natural disaster .
But it turned into a horrific social catastrophe because of the response of the people in power , spurred on by their willingness to believe a hysterical , rumour - mongering media .
( Journalists on the ground were often fiercely empathic and right on the mark , but those at a remove were all too willing to believe the usual tsunami of cliches about disaster and human nature . )
The story that few can wrap their minds around is that ordinary people mostly behaved well – there were six bodies in the Superdome , including four natural deaths and a suicide , not the hundreds that the federal government expected when it sent massive refrigerator trucks to collect the corpses .
On the other hand , people in power behaved appallingly , panicking , spreading rumours , and themselves showing an eagerness to kill and a pathological lack of empathy .
Amusingly , the New Orleans Police Department stripped a Cadillac dealership of its cars , some of which were found as far away as Texas .
Less amusingly , they shot a couple of unarmed – and , of course , black – family groups on the Danziger Bridge shortly after the storm in the only such incident to receive much press coverage .
A middle - aged mother had her forearm blown off ; a mentally disabled 40 - year - old on his way to his brother 's dental office was shot five times in the back and died , and a teenager was also killed .
Truth , the first casualty of war , is pretty imperilled in disasters , too .
One group of suburban white men who believed the rumours or just anticipated that in the absence of authority we all become monsters became monsters themselves , even as they fantasised they were preserving order .
These men in Algiers Point across the river from the city of New Orleans gathered an arsenal and launched their own little murder spree , killing several black men and injuring and threatening others .
They were the real rampaging gangs , and they were not shy about what they did – they boasted of it to videographers and have talked openly about it since .
And with confidence , since there have to date been no legal repercussions .
They claimed to be defending their property and their neighbourhood , but their most vocal surviving victim , Donnell Herrington , was an armoured truck driver trying to evacuate after he had stayed behind to take care of his grandparents .
Herrington , who rescued those grandparents and dozens of neighbours by boat from their flooded apartment complex , then tried to find an evacuation point in Algiers for himself , and was shot twice at close range with a shotgun and nearly bled to death before neighbours got him to the hospital .
The vigilantes shot him because he was black , and because they could get away with it , and because they were inflamed by the news accounts .
The story was not hard to find , and I picked up a lot of pieces of it while doing research for a book on disaster and civil society .
Though New Orleans was overrun by national and international journalists , no one would touch it until I enlisted the brilliant investigative journalist AC Thompson .
Despite his cover story in the Nation that included admissions of murder , many still deny that the killings took place .
Given a choice between their worldview and the facts , some choose the worldview .
Most people behave beautifully in disasters ( and most Americans , incidentally , believe Obama was born in this country ) .
The majority in Katrina took care of each other , went to great lengths to rescue each other – including the " cajun navy " of white guys with boats who entered the flooded city the day after the levees broke – and were generally humane and resourceful .
A minority that included the most powerful believed they were preventing barbarism while they embodied it .
We are entering an era of heightened disaster , thanks to climate change .
Being prepared for disaster will mean being prepared to sift truth from rumour , and being prepared to adjust our worldview .
There is some incredible ugliness to the truth about Katrina .
But , four years on , the lies hide more beauty , and hide where our dangers and our salvation may lie in times of crisis .

Dear Colleagues :
Animal welfare — the notion that we should treat animals “ humanely ” — has been around for 200 years .
It has gotten nowhere .
We are using more animals now in more horrific ways than at any time in human history .
The 19th century founders of animal welfare opposed human slavery but they never opposed the property status of animals because they thought that although animals could suffer , they had no interest in their lives .
That is , animals do not care that we use them but only care about how we use them .
According to the welfarists , animals are not self - aware and do not have an interest in continuing to live ; they only have an interest in not suffering a painful death .
So the welfarists of the 19th century did not advocate the abolition of animal slavery as they advocated the abolition of human slavery .
Instead , they advocated that we have laws that require the “ humane ” treatment of animals .
What the welfarists did not realize , however , was that as long as animals remained property , the level of protection provided by these laws would necessarily remain very low because it costs money to protect animal interests .
As a general matter , we will spend that money and protect those interests only when it results in an economic benefit for us .
Nothing has changed .
The welfarists of the 21st century still maintain that animals do not have an interest in their lives and that killing them does not itself raise a moral problem .
Peter Singer , who is the modern proponent of the welfarist theory of the 19th century , states this explicitly .
This view that animals have no interest in continued life explains why PETA has no problem with killing 90 % of the animals it rescues .
For the welfarists , death is not itself a “ harm . ”
And , for the most part , animal welfare regulations only improve the economic efficiency of animal exploitation .
In other words , we protect animal interests only when we get an economic benefit .
Animal welfare campaigns , such as the campaign for the controlled - atmosphere killing / stunning of poultry , or the elimination of the gestation crate are based explicitly on economic efficiency .
That is , these reforms are promoted on the ground that they will improve production efficiency .
After 200 years of a doctrine that is speciesist ( nonhuman animal life itself has no moral value ) and that has demonstrated that it is useless as a practical matter , it is time for a change .

DARPA has awarded an extension to AeroVironment for their work on the Nano Air Vehicle project .
The prototype seen above , called Mercury , is an ornithopter which means it flaps it ’s wings .
It is the first to show controlled hovering .
Look closely , there ’s no rudder or tail .
Mercury uses the two wings for both lift and control .
Ornithopters themselves are n’t new , we ’ve even covered them before .
Usually they use the flapping wings for propulson and a tail to steer as they travel like an airplane .
We would really love to see some detail shots of Mercury .

For file sharing purposes I have always had at least one hidden account on my computer .
Currently I have one that I use to connect my Linux box to my Windows 7 box , and a second for allowing friends to copy MP3s and Movies off my drive when I go to lan parties .
Unfortunately , when you create an account for sharing purposes Windows will automatically add it to the login screen .
Since this not only causes clutter on our login screen , but a security threat as well , I will show you how to remove this user from the list .
The process for hiding an account has not changed since Windows XP .
This involves tweaking the registry so I do not recommend proceding if you are not comfortable doing so .
To access the registry editor , select Start -> Run or hold down your Windows key and hit R .
In the next prompt , enter regedit and hit enter .
Navigate to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT \CurrentVersion \Winlogon and create a sub -key named SpecialAccounts if it does not already exist .
Inside of that key you will create another called UserList .
Make sure UserList is selected and on the right hand side right click and select New -> DWORD ( 32 - bit ) Value .
Give this new value the same name as the user account that you would like to hide .
To confirm that it worked hold down your Windows key and hit L which will lock the computer .
If you see the user in your list then lock back into your admin user and double check your configuration .
If not , then you have successfully hidden it .
To make this process a little more simple , you can create a text file will the following contents and save it with a .reg extension .
This is very handy if you need to do it on serveral computers or if like myself you have many registry tweaks you need to apply each time you reinstall Windows .
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 [ HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts \UserList " lan"=dword:00000000
In this example I use lan as the username , you can of course use whichever username you like just make sure to update the value in the DWORD value .
After saving this file you can simply double - click the registry file and it will automatically apply it for you .
In the event that you would like to log into this user you can activate the old Pre -XP login screen by hitting CTRL +
Alt + Del at the login screen .
You will be prompted for a username and password , enter the appropriate values and hit ok .
Keep in mind this will create a desktop profile for the user the first time you log into it , so the first time you do this it may take a bit longer .
This is a reading list I am putting together for an anarchist discussion of the “ hipster ” phenomenon .
Let me know if you have any other suggestions !
( CNN ) --
If you have a hard time crawling out of bed in the morning , it could be that your body is biologically programmed to start the day later .
Some people who appear to have insomnia are biologically night owls , one expert says .
Experts say a spectrum of natural sleeping and waking rhythms exists , ranging from extreme morning people to extreme " night owls . "
A new study examines how morning people compare with night owls on a strength test and looks at what other physiological processes may contribute to their performance .
Researchers tested participants ' leg muscle strength at various points in the day .
They looked at nine " early birds " and nine " night owls , " who were classified as such based on a questionnaire .
Surprisingly , morning people 's strength tends to remain constant throughout the day , but night owls have peak performance in the evening , said researchers from the University of Alberta in Canada .
" We thought that morning people would be better at this in the morning , but they never changed , " said study co-author Olle Lagerquist , a Ph.D. candidate in neurophysiology at the University of Alberta .

Heavy snoring can be a danger sign
That may be because evening people show increased motor cortex and spinal cord excitability in the evening , about 9 p.m. , meaning they had maximal central nervous system drive at that time , Lagerquist said .
Morning people , on the other hand , never achieve this level of central nervous system drive because the excitability of the motor cortex does not coincide with the excitability of the spinal cord .
In other words , these two measures never peak at the same time , he said .
Early birds ' brains were most excitable at 9 a.m. and slowly decreased throughout the day .
Researchers do n't know whether this means evening people who are athletes are necessarily better off .
Although night owls may maximize their strength in the evening , they are at a serious disadvantage if they have to compete in the morning .
Morning people , on the other hand , would have the same average performance regardless of the time of the competition , Lagerquist said .
Based on the findings , Lagerquist recommends that people who struggle athletically in the morning try going to the gym at night , as they may feel more awake and perform better then , he said .
The study reinforces findings that athletic performance varies over the course of the day , said Dr. William Schwartz , professor of neurology at the University of Massachusetts .
Although the study is small -- 18 people participated -- it highlights problems with being a night owl that sleep experts often see in patients .
American society favors morning people , because the typical work day begins in the morning and ends in the evening , said Dr. Nancy Collop , Medical Director of the Johns Hopkins Sleep Disorders Center .
Her sleep center tends to have many more night owls seeking help than early risers , she said .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : 10 tips for better sleep
Fairly commonly , people come to the sleep clinic at Johns Hopkins having been mislabeled as insomniacs when they are just night owls , Collop said .
" Their body clock is separate from what their work clock is supposed to be , " Collop said .
It 's very difficult for a night owl to become a morning person , Collop said .
At a sleep clinic such as the one at Johns Hopkins , people seeking to change their habits may be asked to sit in front of a very bright light early in the morning and to take melatonin to help them sleep earlier .
Melatonin is a hormone that helps regulate circadian rhythms , the daily rhythms that persist in the body within a period of about 24 hours .
The tendency to do certain actions at particular times of the day is a phenomenon seen across the animal kingdom .
Even single - celled organisms do different tasks at different times of the day , Collop said .
More complex organisms also need a rest period built into the 24 - hour cycle .
In humans , light drives this cycle , she said .
The part of the brain called the hypothalamus contains the human body 's " clock , " Schwartz said .
There is evidence that biological rhythms are dictated by genes , although people can train themselves to some degree , he said .
Teenage and young adult males have the highest risk for delayed sleep phase , or night - owl tendency , she said .
But it 's hard to know how much of that comes from genetics and how much comes from social pressures , she said .

Should we just assume that Barack Obama is going to do everything wrong ?
Today he renominated “ Helicopter ” Ben Bernanke for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve .
By doing so , Obama has put his big , fat stamp of approval on incredibly stupid monetary policies that are pulverizing the once powerful U.S. economy into oblivion .
Not that Barack Obama or anyone else in the U.S. government has much control over the Federal Reserve at all .
You see , the “ Federal Reserve ” is about as “ federal ” as Federal Express is .
It is a private central bank owned and operated for profit by the international central bankers that own or control most of the other central banks around the world .
If you do not know this yet , here is a shocker for you ….. the currency and the money supply of the United States is not controlled by the U.S. government .
It is managed and manipulated by a cabal of elite international bankers in order to make themselves as much money as possible .
Not that Obama ever even pretended that he was going to stand up to these bankers .
The instant that he nominated Timothy Geithner ( the head of the New York Fed – the most important branch ) to be the treasury secretary , it was apparent that Obama was in bed with the international bankers .
But what most Americans do not realize is that the reckless and runaway expansion of the U.S. money supply by the Federal Reserve is absolutely destroying the wealth of all Americans .
Take a minute to examine the chart below …..
This chart shows the growth in the U.S. money supply in fifteen year intervals .
Since about 1985 you will notice that the money supply has been radically expanding , but the real shocker is at the end of the chart .
Due to the Fed recklessly pumping money into the economy , the graph is basically going almost straight up now .
Now , if you do not understand the implications of this , let us explain them for you .
What this is going to do is cause nasty , hair - raising inflation like the United States has never , ever seen .
The buying power of all bank accounts is going to fall like a rock .
The accumulated wealth of the American people is going to diminish dramatically .
You see , rapid inflation is like a hidden tax on everyone and everything .
All of those seniors who carefully budgeted for retirement are going to be in for a nasty surprise .
The value of everyone ’s dollars is going to rapidly go down the toilet .
Fortunately , there are some conservative members of Congress that are trying to do something about this .
For example , U.S. Representative Ron Paul has introduced a bill to perform a real audit of the Federal Reserve for the first time ever .
Dozens upon dozens of conservative Republican members of Congress have co-sponsored this legislation to audit the Fed ( H.R. 1207 ) .
Ron Paul has been extremely critical of the Fed for many years , but during this past year he has really ramped up his criticism .
The following is one example :
“ The Federal Reserve in collaboration with the giant banks has created the greatest financial crisis the world has ever seen .
The foolish notion that unlimited amounts of money and credit created out of thin air can provide sustainable economic growth has delivered this crisis to us .
Instead of economic growth and stable prices , ( The Fed ) has given us a system of government and finance that now threatens the world financial and political institutions .
Pursuing the same policy of excessive spending , debt expansion and monetary inflation can only compound the problems that prevent the required corrections .
Doubling the money supply did n’t work , quadrupling it wo n’t work either .
Buying up the bad debt of privileged institutions and dumping worthless assets on the American people is morally wrong and economically futile . ”
- Republican Congressman Ron Paul from Texas to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke ( as quoted by Lew Rockwell )
But the Federal Reserve is not about to roll over and let the U.S. Congress look inside of their books so easily .
In fact , they are fighting it tooth and nail and they have most of the key Democrats on their side at this point .
Since the bill to audit the Fed was introduced , both Bernanke and Geithner have strongly denounced it in interviews , and they have even go so far as to issue veiled threats through the media .
For example , in an interview released by Digg and the Wall Street Journal , Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said that auditing the Fed is a “ line that we do n’t want to cross ” and that such a move would be “ problematic for the country ” .
Problematic for the country ?
Just to look at the books of the Fed ?
What would happen if we cross that line ?
Would the Fed cut off the flow of credit and crash the U.S. economy ?
You can see video of Geithner making these comments below :
For the U.S. Treasury Secretary to be making comments of this nature is beyond shocking .
He is supposed to be representing the American people – not his old bosses at the Federal Reserve .
The reality is that the Federal Reserve does not want what they are doing to us and how much money they are making off of it exposed to the American people .
Unfortunately , as long as their friend Obama is in office it is quite likely that they will be able to keep their dirty tricks secret .
The freelance reporter who had been held in an Iranian jail while covering the country ’s presidential election and violent aftermath for The Washington Times said Friday that he was pummeled at Tehran ’s airport , interrogated while blindfolded and held in a wing of a facility with thousands of anti-government demonstrators .
“ A gentleman wearing a uniform said I would n’t be flying tonight , ” said Iason Athanasiadis , recalling the first moments of his 18 - day detention that began with his arrest at the Tehran airport June 17 .
Mr. Athanasiadis , 30 , said he was confident about disproving the Iranian government ’s accusation of espionage but grew uncertain during the first round of questioning at Tehran ’s notorious Evin prison because he was blindfolded and slapped once by interrogators who seemed convinced of his guilt and were just pressing for evidence .
However , he said , the second and final rounds of questioning with Intelligence Ministry interrogators were more objective and less intimidating because they put on surgical masks and took off his blindfold so they could see each other eye to eye .
Mr. Athanasiadis said that from the bottom of his blindfold , he could glimpse rows of prisoners sitting on the ground with their heads between their knees and interviews being conducted in hallways because the interrogation rooms were full .
He said that he was isolated in a continuously lit , 5 - by - 8 cell and that he was kept during the latter part of his stay in a section of the prison reopened during the postelection violence .
The protests in the streets of Tehran continued Friday with thousands of people assembling again in the city ’s Revolution Square amid reports of government security forces using violence .
Officials say about 20 people have been killed since the June 12 elections , in which President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was re-elected .
Mir Hossein Mousavi , the main opposition candidate , insists he was the victor .
Mr. Mousavi ’s supporters say as many as 250 people have been killed .
The protesters ’ calls for a recount have been only partially met , and the vote tally has been declared final .
Mr. Athanasiadis told The Times ’ “ America ’s Morning News ” radio program Friday that he likely was targeted for detention because he spoke fluent Farsi and was not a full - time reporter for a major news - gathering organization , which made him “ vulnerable . ”
“ There was this Greek guy running around with a lot of friends on the ground , ” said Mr. Athanasiadis , referring to himself .
He is a dual citizen of Greece and Britain and has studied and worked in Iran for more than two years .
Describing his arrest while waiting to fly out of Tehran , Mr. Athanasiadis took responsibility for his treatment at the airport and said he was not mistreated while detained .
“ That ’s my fault , ” he said .
“ I decided to resist arrest and get the word out that I was being arrested .
I did n’t want to just disappear . …
That led to them hauling me off and giving me a couple of punches to keep me quiet . ”
But once the interrogations started , the officials were extremely kind and polite , he said .
“ There was no humiliation , which was the most important thing to me , ” he said .
Mr. Athanasiadis said an American woman jotted down the details of the airport incident and called The Times ’ newsroom .
He made clear he was arrested for suspected espionage - not overstaying his seven - day visa or violating journalism ethics , as was widely reported .
“ I was fascinated to see what evidence they had about me , ” Mr. Athanasiadis said .
That evidence was a 2005 photograph of him talking with a British diplomat and romantic text messages on a mobile phone he had borrowed from a friend , Mr. Athanasiadis said in interviews Friday , including ones with CNN and the Associated Press .
His detention coincided with a diplomatic tit - for - tat between Tehran and London that was triggered by Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , calling Britain the “ most evil ” of Iran ’s enemies during an address to the nation June 19 .
Over the next week , both countries expelled several diplomats .
When Mr. Athanasiadis was freed Sunday , Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hasan Qashqavi said the reporter had originally traveled to Iran using a British passport .
Mr. Qashqavi said when Mr. Athanasiadis returned on his Greek passport , he became involved in encouraging demonstrators to protest the election results and was arrested because of this perceived unprofessional behavior .
The spokesman gave no specifics .
Times Executive Editor John Solomon has thanked the governments of Greece and Iran for Mr. Athanasiadis ’s release .
“ We ’d like to publicly thank the Greek government for its relentless efforts to free Iason from captivity and to express our appreciation to Iran ’s government for listening to our private humanitarian pleas , setting aside whatever difference it had with Western governments and allowing Iason to reunite with his family , which had suffered so much anguish these last two weeks , ” Mr. Solomon said in a statement .
Mr. Athanasiadis was thought to be the only non-Iranian detained .
A Newsweek correspondent , Maziar Bahari , a dual Iranian - Canadian citizen , is still in custody , along with more than a dozen Iranian journalists .
Kian Tajbakhsh , an Iranian - American urban planner and former adviser to the World Bank , who spent several months in an Iranian prison in 2007 on unspecified charges , was again arrested late Thursday after a day of renewed protests , according to Hadi Ghaemi , spokesman for the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran .
Iran ’s chief of police , Esmail Ahmadi Moghaddam , recently said that more than 1,000 people have been arrested in postelection violence and that two - thirds have been freed .
Human rights groups say as many as 2,000 people have been arrested .
“ It ’s absolutely brilliant to be back in the Mediterranean , ” said Mr. Athanasiadis , now in Athens with his parents .
He said he received no news reports while in prison , except when he was visited by a Greek diplomat .
However , he could hear from his cell window protesters shouting “ Allahu Akbar [ God is great ] ” in a form of passive resistance .
Besides the Greek government and The Times , the Washington - based Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting and the New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists helped in Mr. Athanasiadis ’ release .
Mr. Athanasiadis is a graduate of Oxford University and was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University from 2007 to 2008 .
He also is a photojournalist and TV producer who reported from North Africa , the Levant , Egypt , Syria and the Arab nations of the Persian Gulf .

A deep , scratchy voice announces their presence over the loudspeaker .
" Heeeere comes Hollywood ! "
The gates open , and eight muzzled greyhounds spring forth in a speedy , thundering mass of bobbing fur , each wearing a brightly colored , numbered jersey .
Tiny puffs of dirt follow their sinewy legs .
This is the seventh race of the night at Mardi Gras Racetrack and Gaming Center in Hallandale Beach , the highest - paying dog track in Florida .
It 's August 19 , 2006 .
The race begins at 9:23 p.m .
At 9:24 , the audience will witness something horrid .
The dogs set off sprinting around an oval - shaped dirt track , chasing a loud , buzzing mechanical lure .
The lure is attached to a metal arm speeding along the inside edge of the track .
Like bulls who see the flick of a matador 's cape , the dogs lunge madly after the lure .
Greyhounds can hit 45 miles per hour in just two steps , but the lure always stays just out of their reach .
A sleek , shiny , black 2 - year - old wearing a red jersey with a white " 5 " on it — his name is BB 's Story Book , but in racing parlance , he is simply " the five " — is quick out of the box .
A few strides into the race , however , the six dog nudges Story Book inside .
Then the eight bumps him again .
This time , Story Book struggles back , running neck and neck with the eight .
As the dogs lean left into a turn , Story Book 's hind legs slip .
There 's a cloud of dust .
Story Book is sucked under the eight .
The eight stumbles but recovers , hurrying off to catch the pack .
Story Book , however , rolls out of the picture .
The announcer says matter - of - factly , " Going down , that was the five . "
As the rest of the dogs continue around the track , Story Book rolls to a stop deep in the first turn .
He stands back up , dizzy and weak .
He can still hear the mechanical lure buzzing around the track .
Then , with that amazing greyhound eyesight , he spots it .
The three dog is in the lead , just entering the final turn , when the announcer realizes what 's about to happen .
" Get the five ! " he commands .
Then again , with an added degree of disgust : " Get the five ! "
Still mixed up from his fall , Story Book sees the lure making its way back around the track .
Now it's on the straightaway coming toward him .
He takes off at full speed — in the wrong direction .
This is a no -win situation .
If the lure operator stops the arm , the seven dogs following behind it will collide in a terrifying pile of snapped bones and broken necks ; if he does n't , it will drive right through the fragile body of the dazed , 73 - pound black dog .
The lure does n't stop .
The bar hits Story Book at the collarbone , shattering his chest and bending each leg in a new , unnatural direction .
Knocked end over end , the dog lands on his back .
He lies there convulsing in front of the grandstand .
The other dogs barely dodge Story Book 's flailing body .
The announcer lets out an abhorred grunt .
As I watch video of the tragic race , I notice that Story Book has a white belly and white feet , just like my newly adopted greyhound — who raced on the very same track just a few months after this incident .
Jailamony ( her racing name ) is 4 years old .
She is sweet and revels in human affection .
But there are constant reminders of her racing life : missing teeth , patches of missing fur ( called " kennel butt " ) , a tattoos in her ear , and a noticeable limp .
The longer Jailamony lives with me , the more questions I have :
What were her racing days like ?
What happened to the other dogs from her litter ?
And what really happens to greyhounds that are n't adopted when they 're done racing ?
To answer my questions , I visited my dog 's old track .
I spoke with industry veterans and racing opponents .
And I ventured where reporters rarely tread — inside the heavily secured compound known as the Florida Kennels .
Florida , with the majority of breeding farms and nearly half the tracks in the country , is the epicenter of dog racing .
Although a well - organized antiracing lobby now has its sights set on the Sunshine State , it 's hard to tell if legislative efforts are hastening or hindering the end of this moribund industry .
----------
When I answer the front door , I 'm greeted by 60 pounds of twitchy curiosity waiting to come inside .
Jailamony has a sleek , shiny , black coat with a white chest , what look like little white socks , and a matching white tip at the end of her wagging tail .
She 's all muscle , ribs , and light - stepping legs , like a pony .
She wiggles through the door , eager to sniff every square foot of my small , two - story apartment .
When my girlfriend and I visited the Friends of Greyhounds ( friendsofgreyhounds.org ) adoption kennel in Hialeah , we saw Jailamony pressing her face against the inside of her cage .
Workers told us black dogs do n't get adopted as often because some people think they might be evil .
Jailamony gave us big take - me - home eyes , and when kennel staff tried to put her back in her crate , she hid behind my girlfriend 's legs .
We adopted her in March , on her fourth birthday .
Moments after being personally delivered to my house by Michelle Weaver , president of the adoption agency , Jailamony discovers the stuffed chipmunk we had waiting for her .
She prances around the furniture with it dangling from her mouth .
Her tail whacks everything .
She has never lived outside of a kennel .
The stairs completely confound her — she figures out how to go up , but once at the top , she peers down , befuddled by the steep , carpeted obstacle before her .
" You 're gonna change her name , right ? "
Weaver asks .
" We have n't really decided yet , " I say .
" Jailamony really is a horrible - sounding name , though . "
Cute as she is , Jailamony bears inescapable remnants from her mysterious past as a racer .
In addition to the missing teeth and fur , both ears are marked with faded , green tattoos .
The left ear has a series of numbers , and the right reads : " ESV . "
Weaver explains that it was supposed to say 35A , since Jailamony was the first , or A , puppy tattooed in a litter " whelped " ( born ) in March 2005 ( 3/5 ) .
" Sometimes [ trainers ] get nice and drunk before they tattoo the dogs , " she says , " and the first one gets screwed up like this . "
Then there 's Jailamony 's right hind leg .
It swings out awkwardly from her otherwise sleek , graceful gait .
At the bottom of the hoc ( the equivalent of a human calf ) is a hard bulb of bone .
In her last race , I learn , she broke her hoc and the bone had been set at the track .
Jailamony never puts that foot straight down , and when she squats , her leg shakes .
Greyhounds are sight hounds ; Jailamony can see a black cat in the dark at 300 yards .
They were first brought to the United States in the mid-1800s to help farmers control the jackrabbit population .
They 've been bred for thousands of years for speed , beauty , and the gentle demeanor that makes them great pets .
Ancient Egyptians considered them royalty .
Arabs admired them so much that they were the only dog permitted to sleep in tents and ride atop camels .
Greyhounds are the only breed mentioned by name in the Bible ( Proverbs 30:29 - 31 ) .
In medieval England , the law permitted only noblemen to own greyhounds .
So seeing one of these magnificent creatures limping around my living room , I wonder about their lives as professional athletes .
What did my dog go through before she came to me ?
The question haunts me , and the answer seems unknowable — like wondering about the past dalliances of someone you love .
----------
Long before spring break — before professional football , basketball , baseball , or ice hockey ; before slot machines , card rooms , and cruises to nowhere ; before most of the cities in South Florida were even incorporated — there was dog racing .
The dog tracks were as synonymous with Florida as fat men in floral print shirts .
The first track in the country opened in Hialeah in 1926 .
By the '30s and ' 40s , dog racing was South Florida 's top tourist attraction .
Every night , the grandstands were packed with young and old , rich and poor .
Greyhound racing was the shared pastime in a land devoid of Babe Ruths and Joe DiMaggios .
And racing made a lot of people rich .
After purchasing the Pittsburgh Steelers with money he won betting on horses , Art Rooney purchased the Palm Beach Kennel Club in 1970 .
His grandson , Pat Rooney Jr. , remains managing director of the track , and Pat 's brother Tom is a U.S. representative from nearby Tequesta .
Over time , however , the industry began to develop a backlash .
Stories began trickling out about dogs being killed if they were n't fast enough .
There were rumors that trainers dumped slow greyhounds in oceans and swamps to be eaten by sharks and gators .
In the '80s and '90s , the debate was over the use of live lures , such as rabbits , which have since been banned .
An Arizona woman named Joan Eidinger has tried to collect every published report of greyhound abuse over the past 15 years .
In the Greyhound Network News — a quarterly newsletter she publishes — the headlines are horrifying :
Three racing dogs found dead at a Daytona Kennel , seven greyhounds die from extreme heat in Arkansas , Iowa hauler accident kills five greyhounds , 17 dogs die of smoke inhalation in Naples .
There are stories of respiratory infections and equine influenza .
One article tells of a thousand Wisconsin racing greyhounds sold to a cardiac research lab .
Using industry breeding numbers , Eidinger estimates that between 1986 and 2006 , about 600,000 greyhounds were killed — about 80 every day .
Antiracing groups like Massachusetts - based Grey2K USA point to these sorts of atrocities when they call for states like Florida to ban greyhound racing .
Working with local organizations like the Fort Lauderdale - based Animal Rights Foundation of Florida , activists lobby legislators , take out antiracing ads in newspapers near tracks , and post videos of incidents like Story Book 's on the Internet .
The campaign seems to be working .
A ballot measure in the 2008 election will end greyhound racing in Massachusetts .
In the past five years , 15 tracks nationwide have either shut down completely or ended live racing .
Bring on the industry 's demise , says Grey2K President Christine Dorchak .
When I call to get her perspective on the industry , Dorchak rattles off a litany of greyhound racing 's alleged offenses : " [ Trainers ] feed them grade - D meat .
The dogs do n't have access to dental work .
They get the bare minimum medicine and medical treatment , if they 're lucky .
And they suffer industrialized confinement in these standardized cages for up to 22 hours a day .
" One thing about greyhounds , they are n't likely to die of old age . "
When dogs turn 4 or 5 and are finished racing , she claims , " It 's more cost - efficient for trainers and owners to kill a dog than to house and feed it . "
Pro-racing folks balk at that claim , saying that today , most greyhounds are humanely retired , not killed .
But in 2002 , Alabama investigators found the bodies of thousands of dead greyhounds on the property of 68 - year - old Robert Rhodes , a part - time security guard at a track in Pensacola .
Rhodes admitted using a .22 caliber rifle to shoot more than 2,000 dogs from all over Florida during the 20 years he worked at the track .
He was paid $ 10 per dog , which he said covered the cost of digging the holes across his 18 - acre property .
Investigators called the graveyard " a Dachau for dogs . "
----------
All across the open room , grown men are shouting at television sets .
" Come on , Two !
Move your ass , Two ! "
The betting parlor at the Mardi Gras racetrack consists of a long line of TV screens simulcasting races from most of the 13 tracks in the state , plus a row of betting machines and cashier windows .
Quiet , white - haired men in polyester pants and mismatched jackets from the ' 70s sit at Formica tables , clenching handfuls of betting tickets .
A group of men in their 40s — the youngest in the room — prefer to stand .
A few businessmen , still donning the shiny shoes and pressed slacks they wore to the office , wait impatiently as the dogs they 've bet on are loaded into starting boxes in Daytona , Jacksonville , West Palm Beach .
Collectively , these men — or the soft , folded American bills they 're handing over — are the lifeblood of the industry .
The scene is a far cry from the racing 's heyday .
Even now , on a " busy " Friday night , only about 200 men ( and virtually no women ) are here to watch the greyhounds .
The throngs of humanity around the slot machines and poker tables dwarf the dog - betting crowd .
By the time I march up to the offices to interview the director of dog racing at Mardi Gras , I 've heard so many horrific details about the industry , I 'm wondering how these people can sleep at night .
But when I meet Aldo Leone , he is no monster .
He 's a mild , friendly man with short hair , an easy smile , and a slight New England accent .
His office is small , and the wood - paneled walls are covered with paintings of greyhounds .
He tells me he got into the business as a lead - out ( the track employee who walks the dog from the paddock to the gate ) in Hollywood when he was 16 .
He 's 46 now .
It was just a job when he started , but he fell in love with the dogs .
Leone says " radical animal rights groups " like Grey2 K take rare incidents out of context and sensationalize them to scare people away from a family - friendly industry .
" They 'll tell you the dogs do n't like it , that they 're being abused .
They want to shut these tracks down , but they do n't realize they 'll just be putting more dogs out on the street . "
If not for racing , he says , the breed probably would have died out centuries ago .
" But are n't thousands of dogs euthanized every year ? " I ask .
Leone says that the antiracing groups ' breeding figures are " ridiculous . "
He says that 98 percent of racing dogs are adopted out and that the other 2 percent return to breeding farms .
" Retired greyhounds are very popular .
As you probably know , they make great pets . "
Then , without a hint of irony , he adds , " They 're becoming a commodity . "
Leone says that because Mardi Gras is the top track in the state , the dogs who can't make it here " grade off " to other tracks , like being sent down from the big leagues to a farm team .
Although I 'd spoken to a former track veterinarian who told me he treated about one broken bone per week , Leone says that injuries occur at a rate of " less than one a month " and that most are " minor , one dog stepping on another 's foot , that sort of thing . "
And that incident with BB 's Story Book ?
Leone says that night was the only time he 's seen an accident with the lure .
" That was a terrible thing , " he says .
He stares out his office window .
The sun is setting on the track .
" Nobody ever wants to see that . "
----------
Before leaving the track , I walk through the trainer 's area behind the paddock .
There are at least a dozen pickup trucks , each with a load of barking dogs waiting to go back to the kennel , 15 miles away in Hialeah .
A thin man with a mustache and dark - brown hair parted on the side — the old - fashioned way — walks a panting , exhausted brindled dog .
The dog has just come in third , earning roughly $ 80 that will be split between the trainer and owner .
The man hoses him off and walks him through a cooling pool .
This is Joe Trudden , a trainer and the owner of Tru -Paws Kennels .
He wears a polo tucked into his unbelted Levi's .
He tells me that if I want the truth about racing , I can go to the compound to see his kennel .
" Come see for yourself if you think these dogs are being abused , " he says .
I show up unannounced on a Sunday morning at the massive , gated compound called the Florida Kennels , which includes Tru -Paws .
The 70 - acre plot consists of about 50 buildings able to house 50 to 100 dogs each ( there are around 2,000 dogs total ) , a full - sized practice track , and several fenced sprinting runs .
All the dogs running at Flagler Dog Track and Entertainment Center or Mardi Gras are kept here .
Outsiders — especially reporters — are not welcome on the compound , but Trudden gets me past the security guards at the gate .
Trudden is just finishing preparation of the dogs ' food .
He starts with 75 pounds of raw meat , which comes in giant blocks labeled : NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION .
Trudden adds the contents of a tall , industrial pot that 's been simmering on the small stove at the front of his building .
It 's got chicken broth , some carrots , a few different kinds of pasta , and rice .
He mixes it all together with his bare hands .
To the food concoction , he adds a few small scoops of powdered Gatorade " to build their electrolytes . "
He scoops the mixture into silver bowls and weighs them .
Then he adds a large scoop of a standard grain dog food .
Before he hands out the bowls to the dogs in their crates , he squirts some with pancake syrup , " in case they have low glucose . "
He has a bottle of Tums handy in case he suspects one of the dogs has a bellyache .
" There 's nobody who loves these dogs more than we do , " he tells me .
" I feel like I have 60 pets . "
Trudden asks me how often I 've taken my dog to the vet since I 've had her .
Once .
" Well , these dogs each see a vet twice a week . "
He points out : " It behooves us to take good care of the dogs .
If they 're not in good shape , they 're not going to win . "
In the back of Trudden 's kennel , the Rolling Stones play from a stereo to 62 dogs in individual crates stacked two high along both walls ; each standardized crate measures 26 inches wide by 30 inches high and is 42 inches deep .
The females are on top .
" They jump better , " Trudden says .
Females receive hormones so they can race with males without fear of " accidental breeding . "
The dogs all look healthy .
Most wag their tails when they see us .
The few I look at closely have good teeth and soft fur .
Trudden knows each dog by name and kisses some of the females ' heads , calling each " mama . "
There 's a large industrial scale — each dog must weigh within one pound of what it weighed in the previous race , per track rules — and near the front door is a chart detailing each dog 's racing schedule and special needs .
On the walls are photos of Trudden and his family with past champions .
Trudden was introduced to greyhounds by his grandpa Joe , who played the dogs every day .
He fondly remembers studying the program together every afternoon and waiting anxiously to learn whether the dogs they picked had won .
When his grandfather died , Trudden scraped together $ 1,200 , bought a dog , and named it Joe 's Unicorn .
The dog won early and often , and by the early '90s , Trudden was able quit his job at the telephone company to become a full - time trainer .
Not long after that , he bought his own kennel .
One of the dogs he trained was BB 's Story Book .
I ask him about the incident with the lure .
" I was here that night , " he says .
" It 's one of the worst things I 've ever seen .
I scooped him up with my own arms . "
His voice gets softer and his eyes become glassy as he describes speeding to the animal hospital .
He kicks a rock .
" There 's nothing they could do , " he says .
BB 's Story Book was euthanized .
As Trudden works , he defends his beloved industry .
He says he has never had a healthy dog euthanized and has even kept dogs in his kennel for more than a year — at an average cost of $ 5 per day — before a spot in an adoption kennel opened up .
Trudden estimates that the industry employs 20,000 people in Florida alone .
" That 's not counting the people who sell the trucks and the tires and the gas and the food . "
Still , Trudden acknowledges that public opinion has swayed and that the end of dog racing is inevitable .
" I just hope it 's not in my lifetime , " he says .
We walk out back to the two fenced runs where the dogs are " turned out " at least twice a day .
Alongside the kennel is a small , metal whirlpool for the dogs , on the day after they race .
It 's a greyhound Jacuzzi .
After the " hydrotherapy , " he says , each dog gets a hand massage .
Trudden turns to me : " Do these dogs look abused ? "
----------
Joe Trudden might be a conscientious guy — but not every trainer is .
In December 2007 , state investigators from the Department of Business and Professional Regulation , Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering — the state agency overseeing greyhound racing in Florida — discovered a gruesome scene .
In building four , just a few hundred yards from Trudden 's kennel , 74 dogs were left in dirty cages with almost no food or medicine for months .
According to the DBPR 's report , the owner , David Dasenbrock , lived in Oregon and had stopped sending money for food or flea and tick medication .
The dogs were found emaciated , lying in piles of their own waste .
Many had gnawed themselves bloody and raw .
The floor was covered with blood , ticks , and rodent droppings .
There was a dead rat in the corner .
There was no edible food on site , and the dogs had no water .
" The smell of urine in the kennel was unbearable , " an investigator wrote .
But the DBPR has only limited power , and all it could do was issue a warning .
Four months passed and conditions only got worse .
When they returned , investigators found a trainer dipping greyhounds into a bucket of Malathion , a cheap insecticide that 's highly toxic to dogs .
It was the cheapest way to take care of the flea and tick problem .
The trainer had also been cleaning the building — with diesel fuel .
In May 2008 , Dasenbrock 's pari-mutuel license was suspended and the trainer was charged with animal cruelty , a misdemeanor .
A year later , all 74 dogs have either been adopted or are in the hands of adoption agencies .
The worst part : Nobody really knows how often this happens .
There are whispers at the track of a veterinarian nearby who will put down any greyhound , healthy or not , for $ 75 , no questions asked , but obtaining reliable statistics about casualties is impossible .
Florida tracks have no legal obligation to report injuries , deaths , or cases of neglect and abuse to the state .
Breeders , owners , and trainers never have to report how many dogs are culled , euthanized , or killed during transport .
The vast majority of regulation in Florida relates not to the welfare of the animals but to how profits are divided .
Meanwhile , in November of last year , there were two more horrific incidents two days apart .
On November 17 , a 3 - year old brindled greyhound named Birthday Toy was electrocuted after being bumped into the lure line at Sanford Orlando Kennel Club .
Then on November 19 , Jawa Spock , a 2 - year - old fawn , was euthanized at Palm Beach Kennel Club after breaking both back legs during a race .
This is why Grey2K USA is targeting Florida 's greyhound racing industry .
The group has video footage of both incidents on its website ( grey2kusa.org ) , and this April , Christine Dorchak traveled to Tallahassee to oppose new legislation that would expand gambling and subsidize greyhound racing .
She held a news conference on the back steps of the Old Capitol Building in Tallahassee with the help of Scooby and Molly , two retired greyhounds .
Whether it 's pressure from groups like Dorchak 's or because people have vast entertainment options these days , the dog racing industry is indisputably in decline .
In fact , it might have died out already if it were n't subsidized by tax breaks and other forms of gambling .
In 2000 , the Florida Legislature approved a $ 20 million tax break for the struggling pari-mutuel industry ( horse tracks , dog tracks , and jai - alai frontons ) .
Then , the pari-mutuels lobbied for the right to offer slot machines and high - stakes poker .
Since South Florida voters approved them in 2005 , slots and card rooms have become so profitable that most track owners would probably be willing to drop dog racing entirely .
( In 2007 , the state collected less than $ 6 million in taxes from the greyhound industry , compared to $ 125 million from slot machines . )
But the way the law stands , in order to keep a pari- mutuel license and have access to that juicy income flow from slots and poker , dog tracks are required to race at least 100 days a year .
Greyhound racing wo n't end unless that law is changed .
Dorchak says her group would support any bills that would rid pari-mutuels of the racing requirements .
Every year , such bills are introduced in the state Legislature , but they never make it out of committee .
In her quest , she 's found an odd ally .
Mardi Gras CEO
Dan Adkins showed up at the capitol .
Dorchak says Adkins even jokingly wore an " End Greyhound Racing " button .
" He might not be able to say it as publicly , but he hates giving that money to breeders too , " she says .
" Racing is a losing game he has to play to get the cards and slots .
They could take or leave the dogs .
It 's all about money . "
----------
Still , the more I learn about the industry , the more I want to know about my dog .
The longer I have her , the more I see that she really does love to run , even if it means she 's hopping on the hurt leg .
Most of the time , though , she likes to lie around the apartment looking adorable .
We also decided to keep her name .
Although Jailamony evokes something dark and degenerate , her past is part of who she is and what brought her to us .
The truth is , the world of greyhound racing can be just as heartbreaking and complicated as that twisted black leg with the little white sock .
It hurts to think of the toll this industry has taken on that sweet dog .
If she had n't raced , she would n't have a limp , a bald ass , and grey hair at 4 years old .
Then again , if she did n't race , I would n't have her now .
Through the adoption group , I learn that Jailamony was trained by the delightfully titled company Bad Boy Racing .
At the kennel , I see a smashed - up dog truck with those words blasted across the top of the windshield .
But I do n't find the truck owner , and I later learn the company has been sold .
In hopes of finding someone who might remember my dog , I make another trip to the track .
A funny thing about racetracks :
There are always a few old handicappers who remember every horse or dog in every race they 've ever seen , going back decades .
In another life , these men could have been great mathematicians or literature scholars ; in places like Mardi Gras , where the floor is littered with beer - drenched stubs of daily heartbreak , they are the revered wise men .
During short breaks in the action at Mardi Gras , I ask around to see whether anyone remembers betting on Jailamony .
I get a lot of " that name sounds familiar " and " if I could see the books , I 'd know the dog . "
Then someone directs me to Norman Grant .
A fidgeting , wiry black man in a ski cap , Grant recognizes the name immediately .
" A black dog , " he says .
" Your dog 's a black dog .
I remember . "
I nod .
" Your dog do n't break .
Do n't break worth a damn .
But she 's a closer .
She 's a strong , strong closer . "
Indeed , most of the races in which she placed , Jailamony came from behind .
Through a website called greyhound - data.com , I find Jailamony 's racing history and trace her heritage back 34 generations , to 1820 — about 32 generations more than I know about myself .
Her sire 's sire was Molotov , a member of the Greyhound Racing Hall of Fame who set track records in Colorado that still stand today .
The site says there were two other dogs from Jailamony 's litter registered as racers : a female named Jam It Up and a male named Speed Bump Brent .
Brent never made it past the schooling races , and like the dogs from the litter that were n't registered racers , there is no record of where he is now .
Jam It Up is still racing in Naples .
Each dog 's racing history includes racing notes written in a cryptic , handicapper code .
If a dog broke away from the pack on the back stretch and won , for example , the note might say : " Pulled Away Md Trk . "
Jailamony dominated her practice races ( to qualify at a track , a dog must finish in the top four ) .
She won her second race at Mardi Gras .
She worked her way up the ranks and earned nearly $ 2,000 in all .
But then , her firsts and seconds turned into sixths and sevenths .
The handicapping notes tell the story .
Over and over , Jailamony was " bumped 1st turn mid trk " or " crowded early . "
In race after race , the notes say she " stumbled , fell " or " broke to outside , collided " or " bounced around early . "
After 25 races at Mardi Gras , she was downgraded to Flagler in Miami .
It was there , on June 13 , 2008 , that she had her final race , the 32nd of her career .
She was wearing the 6 jersey the day she broke her leg .
The note is short .
It says : " Dropped Back 1st Turn , DNF . "
Like so many greyhounds , my dog 's life as a racer ended with those three ominous letters , DNF : Did Not Finish .
People who seek the services of auto mechanics want car repair , not " auto care . "
Similarly , most people who seek the services of medical doctors want body repair , not " health care . "
We own our cars , are responsible for the cost of maintaining them , and decide what needs fixing based partly on balancing the seriousness of the problem against the expense of repairing it .
Our health - care system rests on the principle that , although we own our bodies , the community or state ought to be responsible for paying the cost of repairing them .
This is for the ostensibly noble purpose of redistributing the potentially ruinous expense of the medical care of unfortunate individuals .
But what is health care ?
The concept of reimbursable health - care service rests on the premise that the medical problem in need of servicing is the result of involuntary , unwanted happenings , not the result of voluntary , goal - directed behavior .
Leukemia , lupus , prostate cancer , and many infectious diseases are unwanted happenings .
Are we going to count obesity , smoking , depression and schizophrenia as the same kinds of diseases ?
Many Americans would willingly pay for insurance to protect them against the exorbitant cost of treating their own leukemia .
But how many Americans would willingly pay for insurance to protect them from the expenses of treating their own depression ?
Everyone recognizes that the more fully we wish insurance companies to defray our out of pocket expenses for our car repairs , the higher the premium they will charge for the policy .
Yet foregoing reimbursement for trivial or unnecessary health - care costs in return for a more suitable health - care policy is an option unavailable under the present system .
Everyone with health insurance is compelled to protect himself from risks , such as alcoholism and erectile dysfunction , that he would willingly shoulder in exchange for a lower premium .

Introducing a new station wagon in the wagon - phobic U.S. is a calculated risk for GM .
Even the ultra-cool Dodge Magnum wagon from Chrysler could n't find enough market here to hang on .
The CTS does look very slick , with a roof that tapers nicely down to that sharp Caddy back .
And the new roof actually gives this CTS a little more rear headroom .
Beyond that , the CTS Sport Wagon differs from the CTS sedan only in its body shape .
Not that that 's a bad thing .
The CTS is arguably GM 's best product after the Corvette .

A bit tough to backtrack now that both the head of Big Pharma and the Deputy Chief of Staff at the White House both already confirmed the deal ’s existence .
Just to remind folks , this was a deal where the White House agreed not to include in the health care reform package any provisions permitting the government to negotiate down Medicare drug prices with Big Pharma .
In other words , they agreed to let Big Pharma continue charging older Americans four times what the same prescription drugs cost in Europe .
Candidate Obama repeatedly promised to stop giving Big Pharma this sweetheart deal .
Now he ’s agreed to it .
Secretly .
That ’s why people are upset .
And for that matter , why not give the government the power to negotiate across the board for cheaper drug prices , not just in Medicare ?
European drug companies charge 1/3 to 1/5 the price that American companies charge for the exact same drugs .
Yet the European drug companies do just fine surviving .
The other day I spoke to someone who works for a pharmaceutical company in Europe .
I asked them why drugs were so much more expensive in America .
Was it due to the R&D ; costs that we hear so much about , the billions that American drug companies invest in creating new drugs , so thus they simply must charge us a ton to recoup their investment ?
His answer :
They charge you four times as much because you ’re willing to pay four times as much .
GAZA CITY ( CNN ) --
It 's meant to be a children 's program , but " Young Pioneers " on Hamas - run television is well - known for pushing the boundaries of what most people would deem suitable content for children .
The martyrdom mission re-enactment using actors , was played to Reem Riyashi 's children .
One episode raised eyebrows when it first aired two years ago on al Aqsa TV , featuring two young Palestinian children being shown a re-enactment of their mother 's preparations for and execution of a suicide bombing .
The show was recently aired for the children of the bomber and other youths in a studio audience .
The young anchor sounds a defiant note : " And here we say to the occupier that we will follow her doctrine , the doctrine of the martyr mujahida Reem Riyashi , until we liberate our homeland from your illegitimate hands . "
Riyashi killed four Israelis in a 2004 attack at the Erez crossing between Gaza and Israel .
In the video , an actress playing her prepares explosives for her mission , ignoring her children 's questions about what she is doing .
" Mummy , what are you holding in your arms -- a toy or a present for me ? " her daughter asks .
Her daughter then sees a news report about the suicide bombing and sings , " Only now I understand what was more important than us . "
The camera cuts back to the faces of her two children watching the re-enactment .
The Israeli monitoring group Palestinian Media Watch publicized and condemned the program when it first appeared .
The group told CNN , " These young children are tragic victims of horrific child abuse . "
Watch a report on the controversial episode »
Dr. Eyad Sarraj , a leading Palestinian psychiatrist in Gaza , worries about how glorifying suicide bombers affects children .
" Three years ago , we did a study on children in Gaza between the ages of 12 and 14 , and we asked them , what would you like to be when you are 18 ? "
Sarraj said .
" At that time , 36 percent of boys said , ' I would like to be a martyr , ' and 17 percent of the girls said the same . "
He said children in Gaza had been so traumatized by Israeli - Palestinian violence over the years that their perceptions of life and death were damaged .
It 's possible for most people in the region to watch al Aqsa television if they have the right satellite dish , though it 's not possible to tell how many have seen the footage .
It is Hamas - run and its audience probably is restricted to those with that political affiliation .
Al Aqsa did not return CNN 's calls for comment on the program .
Two years ago , the station created a Mickey Mouse - style character that encouraged " violent resistance " against Israel and simulated the use of an AK - 47 and grenades .
Ug99 : Will Wheat Rust Cause A Catastrophic Global Famine ?
Will a wheat rust that the vast majority of Americans have never heard of lead to a catastrophic global famine ?
Agricultural scientists now fear that Ug99 , a devastating wheat fungus also known as stem rust , could wipe out over 80 percent of the world 's wheat crop as it spreads from Africa all across the globe .
In a world already on the verge of a massive food crisis , this is incredibly frightening news .
Most Americans have never even heard of Ug99 , but the truth is that it is considered by experts to be the most serious threat to the world food supply .
Ug99 is known as " stem rust " because it produces reddish - brown flakes on wheat stalks .
It is incredibly deadly and there is no known cure for it .
The Los Angeles Times recently reported that The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico now estimates that 19 percent of the world 's wheat crop , primarily located in Asia and Africa , is in imminent danger from Ug99 .
If Ug99 were to start spreading in the United States , it is estimated that approximately 10 billion dollars worth of wheat would be destroyed .
10 billion dollars .
That is a whole lot of bread .
The L.A. Times also reports that Rick Ward , the coordinator of the Durable Rust Resistance in Wheat project at Cornell University in Ithaca , N.Y. , says that " A significant humanitarian crisis is inevitable . "
Did you catch that ?
He said inevitable .
When scientists start using the word " inevitable " it is time for all of us to sit up and take notice .
Apparently Ug99 has already jumped the Red Sea and has affected areas as far as Iran already .
Wheat Experts say that wheat rust is poised to enter northern India and Pakistan , and that the wind will inevitably carry it to Russia , China and even North America .
If it does n't arrive in North America some other way first .
Jim Peterson , a professor of wheat breeding and genetics at Oregon State University in Corvallis , does not sound optimistic about this crisis :
" It 's a time bomb , " he told the L.A. Times .
" It moves in the air , it can move in clothing on an airplane .
We know it 's going to be here .
It 's a matter of how long it 's going to take . "
Are you all starting to get the picture ?
This is very , very serious .
If the worst case scenario comes to fruition , and 80 percent of the world 's wheat crop is destroyed , what will you and your family do ?
Do you have an emergency food supply ?
As if things were not bad enough , wheat experts say that Ug99 is becoming even more virulent as it spreads .
This quote from the recent L.A. Times article on Ug99 is very frightening .....
Scientists discovered a Ug99 variant in 2006 that can defeat Sr24 , a resistance gene that protects Great Plains wheat .
Last year , another variant was found with immunity to Sr36 , a gene that safeguards Eastern wheat .
It is not like the world has enough wheat right now anyway .
The truth is that exploding populations , record droughts across the globe and dwindling strategic food reserves in the major industrialized nations have brought the world to the very edge of a catastrophic global food crisis .
World food reserves currently sit at a fifty year low , and many experts are warning that we are now facing a " perfect storm " that will cause a dramatic spike in world hunger .
Even the major industrialized nations are not immune .
With U.S. wheat reserves now at a record low , USDA Undersecretary Mark Keenum had to admit last year : " Our cupboard is bare . "
Things have become so serious that even
Time magazine has now declared that we are in " a global food crisis " .
Most Americans would like to think that " wealthy nations " such as the United States are completely immune from world famine , but the truth is that the U.S. only has enough wheat held in reserve to make half a loaf of bread for each citizen .
Half a loaf of bread .
How long do you think that will last you and your family if Ug99 sweeps the globe ?
If you wo n't listen to us , perhaps you will listen to the United Nations .
In a stunning new report , the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations is warning that impoverished populations around the globe are feeling the pain of much higher food prices .
The price of important crops such as rice , which is a key staple in many impoverished nations , spiked more than 400 percent last year .
In fact , food riots broke out in many third world countries in 2008 when large numbers of people could suddenly not feed their families .
The effects of food shortages are not being seriously felt yet in the major industrialized nations where food represents about 10 to 20 percent of consumer spending , but in developing nations the poor often have to spend up to 80 percent of their meager income just on food .
Britain's chief scientist , Professor John Beddington , says that the global demand for food is going to increase by about 50 percent by 2030 , and that this will cause massive global problems of unprecedented magnitude in the years ahead .
" It 's a perfect storm , " he told the GovNet Communications Sustainable Development 09 conference in London .
" We 're not growing enough food , so we 're not able to put stuff into the reserves . "
And his pessimistic forecast does not even include the impact of Ug99 on the world food supply .
The reality is that the world is quickly running out of food and more people than ever are hungry .
Just consider these facts .....
* 1 billion people in the world go to bed hungry every single night .
* Every 3.6 seconds someone starves to death and 3/4 are children under the age of 5 .
* More than 2.8 billion people , close to half of the world 's population , live on less than the equivalent of $ 2 a day .
* About a third of all children in the world under the age of five suffer from serious malnutrition .
* The top fifth ( 20 per cent ) of the world 's people who live in the highest income countries have access to 86 percent of world gross domestic product .
The bottom fifth , in the poorest countries , have about one percent .
* The assets of the world 's three richest men exceed the combined gross domestic products of the world 's 48 poorest countries .
When you add all of this up , the reality is that we could very well be on the verge of the worst global famine in the history of humanity .
If we are to take the scientists and the government experts seriously , then it is very likely that there will come a day when you will not be able to run down to the local Wal - Mart or the local McDonald 's and grab all of the food that you want .
Food shortages are coming .
Will you and your family be ready with an emergency food supply ?
For those of you who are interested in preparing , we encourage you to check out the links and resources that we have provided for you on this site .
Let us hope and pray that things will not be as bad as scientists now fear they may be .
But if a devastating global famine does strike , you and your family will be in a much better position if you have stored up a year or two of emergency food .
Now is the time to build up your emergency food supply .
The flower - hat jellyfish
1. Jellyfish first appeared about 650 million years ago and are found in every ocean , from the surface to the deep sea .
Some are also found in fresh water
2. Medusa ( plural medusae ) is another word for jellyfish .
Medusa is also the word for jellyfish in : Greek , Finnish , Portuguese , Romanian , Hebrew , Serbian , Croatian , Spanish , French , Italian , Hungarian , Polish , Czech , Slovak , Russian and Bulgarian
3 . Since jellyfish are not actually fish , some people consider the term jellyfish a misnomer , and American public aquariums have popularized use of the terms jellies or sea jellies instead

5. Jellyfish do not have a respiratory system since their skin is thin enough that the body is oxygenated by diffusion
6. Jellyfish do not have a brain or central nervous system , but rather have a loose network of nerves , located in the epidermis , which is called a “ nerve net . ”
The Australian Spotted Jellyfish
7. Jellyfish are composed of more than 90 % water .
Most of their umbrella mass is a gelatinous material ( the jelly ) called mesoglea , which is surrounded by two layers of cells which forms the umbrella ( top surface ) .
The subumbrella ( bottom surface ) of the body is known as the bell

8. Jellyfish are dioecious ; that is , they are either male or female .
In most cases , to reproduce , both males and females release sperm and eggs into the surrounding water , where the ( unprotected ) eggs are fertilized and mature into new organisms
9 . Box jellyfish venom is the most deadly in the animal kingdon and has caused at least 5,568 recorded deaths since 1954 .
Each tentacle has about 500,000 sindasites which are harpoon shaped needles that inject venom into the victim
10 .
The lion ’s mane jellyfish is the largest known species of jellyfish .
The Arctic Lion ’s mane jellyfish is one of the longest known animals and the largest recorded specimen had a bell ( body ) with a diameter of 2.3 m ( 7 feet 6 inches ) and the tentacles reached 36.5 m ( 120 feet ) .
It was found washed up on the shore of Massachusetts Bay in 1870

A day after Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin resigned , a federal official in her home state dismissed one potential explanation for her sudden and unexpected resignation : a rumored FBI investigation into the former Wasilla mayor on public corruption charges .
Despite rumors of a looming controversy after the Republican governor ’s surprise announcement Friday that she would leave office this month , some of them published in the blogosphere , the FBI ’s Alaska spokesman said the bureau had no investigation into Palin for her activities as governor , as mayor or in any other capacity .
“ There is absolutely no truth to those rumors that we ’re investigating her or getting ready to indict her , ” Special Agent Eric Gonzalez said in a phone interview Saturday .
“ It ’s just not true . ”
He added that there was “ no wiggle room ” in his comments for any kind of inquiry .
The FBI has been active in mounting corruption investigations in Alaska , some to see whether local , state and federal lawmakers illegally received favors , money or free construction work from businesses or people seeking favors .

The most high - profile case was against former Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens , whose conviction last year on charges of lying on Senate ethics forms stemmed from charges that a politically connected developer had done work on his house illegally .
The Obama administration Justice Department threw out the charges in April , saying prosecutors had failed to turn over potentially helpful information to Stevens ’ defense team .
Some bloggers have speculated that such an FBI investigation was underway on Palin , who still had 18 months left in her term .
Also Saturday , the former GOP vice presidential nominee posted a statement on her Facebook page , not offering specifics but indicating that she had broad goals after she leaves the governor ’s office .
She did not say whether she planned to run for president in 2012 , but criticized media coverage of her announcement :

“ How sad that Washington and the media will never understand ; it ’s about country .
And though it ’s honorable for countless others to leave their positions for a higher calling and without finishing a term , of course we know by now , for some reason a different standard applies for the decisions I make . ”

We 've all had our problems with Battlestar Galactica 's weird solar flare - out of an ending , but was it actually the worst ending in the history of science fiction ?
That 's what Usenet luminary and Electronic Frontier Foundation Chairman Brad Templeton is claiming .
Advertisement
Oh , and there will be spoilers for " Daybreak Parts 2 and 3 " in this post , in case you 're still waiting for the DVDs before watching it .
Templeton 's mega essay more specifically tars " Daybreak " as " the worst ending in the history of on - screen science fiction . "
And he has clearly thought about this for months , amassing a docket of evidence that the BSG - boosters will have a hard time refuting .
And he admits that part of the reason why the ending seems so bad to him is that this was such a fantastic series , for so much of its run — this would n't have felt nearly as much like a letdown otherwise .
Advertisement
I 'm not going to attempt to summarize Templeton 's whole argument here — it 's really worth going and reading the whole thing properly — but he makes a few really great points that I have n't seen anywhere else .
First of all , BSG is not just a space opera , it 's a mystery , and the answer to all of the show 's riddles is one of the chief attractions of the final episode .
The fact that the answers tended to be either " God " or " because we said so " was , to be honest , a bit disappointing .
And because Ronald D. Moore decided to build the last two seasons around " big mysteries " instead of character - driven storylines , you can't excuse his failure to pay off those mysteries by saying the show is really all about the characters .
The other problem with God turning out to have been such a huge force in the show 's narrative arc , Templeton notes , is the Ghostbusters rule : " If someone asks you if you are a god , you say yes ! "
( And the corollary is that gods , at least in science fiction , usually turn out to be false . )
Templeton has a huge , exhaustive list of all the plot contrivances and happenstances that end up being laid at God 's door , including everything Head Six arranged during the course of the series , and it 's quite an impressive list .
It 's fine to have a Supreme Being set the story 's events in motion and cause trouble for our heroes , but not quite so great for God(s ) to swoop in and solve all our problems at the end of the story .
Advertisement
There 's also the always - tenuous relationship between science fiction and our reality — not to mention between science fiction and science .
And once you look at the science of " Daybreak , " it does start to look a bit dodgy .
There 's the fact that Galactica 's humans and the cave people of prehistoric Earth are able to interbreed , for one thing .
And then there 's Ron Moore 's total misunderstanding of who Mitochondrial Eve actually was and why she 's significant — she 's not the most common recent ancestor for all humans , who cropped up much later .
But turning Hera into Mitochrondrial
Eve means that the show has to take place 150,000 years ago , or about 100,000 years before humans started to develop any kind of technology .
And that , in turn , means the Colonial fleet left absolutely no mark whatsoever .
Advertisement
Templeton also has trouble with the " collective unconsciousness " idea that all of the stuff we see in the series , from Bob Dylan 's " All Along The Watchtower " through to the clothes and telephones our heroes use , somehow filtered down through our ancestral memory so that we could reinvent it all today .
And the hoariness of the cliche of " ancient astronauts " visiting our primitive ancestors .
( A side note : Katee Sackhoff has said there 's a line of dialogue she refused to say in the final episode .
After she puts in the notes to the magic song and jumps the fleet to Earth , President Roslin asks , " Where have you taken us ? "
And in Moore 's script , she was supposed to respond : " Somewhere ... all along the watchtower . "
But she and Mary McDonnell kept giggling when they got to that line , so it ended up getting cut .
Thank goodness . )
Advertisement
Here 's what I always come back to when I think about the BSG finale , though — I feel as though Moore put us on notice with the final episode of season three .
When we first encounter the mysterious Bob Dylan Cylon signal , and four totally random characters turn out to be Cylons , and Starbuck comes back from the dead , the show is basically hoisting a giant sign saying " You Are Now Leaving Storytelling Logic .
Please Drive Safely . "
And anyone who stuck with the show for its final season after that really can't complain , because we were duly warned .

Companies are seeking to establish electronic relationships with as many business partners as possible to enhance competitiveness , make it easier for important third parties to engage with them , cut time and space out of transaction cycle times and drive down the cost of doing business .
As a result of exponential growth in electronic information sharing , it 's no surprise that higher volumes of sensitive and confidential data are being exchanged , and correspondingly , there are many more opportunities for cybercriminals to steal valuable information .
Now more than ever , business partners need to make practical , effective data protection part of the DNA of their business - to - business ( B2B ) communities .
These problems affect any company that communicates electronically with business partners , whether it 's communicating with the bank for payroll processing or sending a purchase order to a trading partner .
For example , in the retail industry , volumes of confidential documents facilitating the buying and selling of goods up and down the supply chain between retailers , wholesalers and distributors are sent electronically and need to be protected .
In the healthcare industry , patient information is sent between hospitals , clinics and insurance providers , and business documents move between suppliers , business service providers and healthcare facilities .
Protecting business documents moving up and down the supply chain in any industry is critical to securing company confidential information .
You can establish and maintain secure electronic relationships with all of your business partners successfully by following these three foolproof tips .
1. Keep Trading Partner Information Up to Date
Because of the importance of data security today , companies are taking a wholesale look at their trading partner community .
Most companies trade within large B2B communities that use a plethora of technologies for data exchange .
The challenge then becomes how to keep up with changes made by what can be hundreds of partners to things like partner contact information , the type of connectivity allowed and security rights information .
This also involves setting up an alerting system to keep partners apprised of changes you make to the community , or when things go wrong .
One of the newer best practices for managing business communities is to give partners control over updating this information themselves , much like individuals use business networking sites such as LinkedIn to keep business associates apprised of changes in their contact information or employment status .
Fortunately , technologies such as online self - service B2B business portals now make it easy for companies and their trading partners to update relevant information as it changes and send alerts to all affected parties automatically .
This encourages more collaboration and strengthens business relationships while reducing inaccuracies and eliminating the time it takes to update information manually about each trading partner .
Empowering your trading partners to update relevant business information simply makes doing business much easier and more efficient .
2. Ensure All Electronic Communication Is Secure
Data exchange connections between trading partners must be secure .
The first step to achieving secure e-business is to understand the technological capabilities of each trading partner by conducting an audit .
If your audit identifies the use of an insecure protocol such as FTP or HTTP , the next step is to migrate that connection to a secure protocol that uses SSL or PGP with data encryption such as FTP with PGP , FTPs or HTTPs .
You can use one of two models to exchange data with your business partners .
You can either encrypt the data before it is transmitted and allow your partner to decrypt it , or you can send unencrypted documents through a secure pipe .
Either data transmission approach is secure .
The choice of which model to use will depend on the technical capabilities of each trading partner .
Above all , do n't let technology get in the way of doing business .
Supporting all types of secure protocols will enable your company to establish communications with any company , and they will appreciate your flexibility .
While the largest companies can dictate what protocols their partners must use to exchange data , the best practice for establishing a successful e-business community is to maintain an open policy to accommodate all trading partners , from the largest to the smallest .
Finally , it is also important for you to have visibility into the status of all transactions to ensure that documents were transmitted and received .
Some secure protocols such as AS2 apprise the sender of when a document is delivered by sending an acknowledgement ; with others it 's up to the administrator to set up a response system manually .
3. Determine the Best Way to Communicate With Each Partner
The reality is many companies are doing business with hundreds of business partners , some more than others .
You can maintain each relationship directly , outsource the relationship to a third party , or adopt a hybrid approach .
There are pros and cons to each method , but all approaches are viable and can be adapted to fit your company 's unique circumstance .
In most supply chains , the 80/20 rule applies .
In general , 20 percent of trading partners generate 80 percent of a company 's revenue .
If a company trades with 500 suppliers , for example , 100 of those would be responsible for 80 percent of its business .
The cost of establishing and maintaining the other 400 connections could be high with little return .
Under a hybrid strategy , you might manage your top - 20 - percent business partners using AS2 , for example , and would outsource the managing of the other 80 percent of your trading partners to a third - party provider .
This would allow you to maintain a direct link to your most important business partners , and save money by partnering with a third - party vendor to manage the multitude of smaller trading partners via a portal .
To achieve optimal efficiencies and cost savings , your goal should be 100 percent electronic connectivity with your partners .
Implementing a few best practices will make it easier for you to manage your B2B community securely .
Establishing a self - service portal enables trading partners to update changes to their technology and business themselves , reducing your company 's administrative responsibility and building stronger business relationships .
Adopting an " open " policy by supporting all secure protocols makes it easier to do business with new companies , especially those whose technology resources are limited .
Finally , realizing that " one size does n't necessary fit all " when it comes to managing partner communications can heighten your data exchange operational efficiencies while reducing costs .

So , Microsoft submits 20000 lines of code to the Linux kernel , all licensed under the GPL .
Microsoft , who considers Linux a great threat , and once called the GPL a “ cancer ” .
Opinions on this one are flying all around us , but what does Linus Torvalds , Linux ’ benevolent dictator , think about all this ?
Linus has n’t actually looked at the code yet .
It ’s driver code , low - risk and he is n’t very interested in driver code anyway .
He trusts the maintainers will do their jobs .
“ I ’ll likely look at it when the code is actually submitted to me by the maintainers ( Greg [ Kroah - Hartman ] , in this case ) , just out of morbid curiosity , ” Linus adds .
As most of you will be aware of , Linus is very forthright , and generally does n’t hold back when it comes to his opinions .
He ’s also very pragmatic , and both of these qualities come forward quite clearly when Linus talks about Microsoft ’s code drop .
I ’m not going to squeeze his words into running text .
I ’m a big believer in “ technology over politics ” .
I do n’t care who it comes from , as long as there are solid reasons for the code , and as long as we do n’t have to worry about licensing etc issues .
I may make jokes about Microsoft at times , but at the same time , I think the Microsoft hatred is a disease .
I believe in open development , and that very much involves not just making the source open , but also not shutting other people and companies out .
There are ‘ extremists ’ in the free software world , but that ’s one major reason why I do n’t call what I do ‘ free software ’ any more .
I do n’t want to be associated with the people for whom it ’s about exclusion and hatred . ”
There is not a single word here that I can disagree with .
While I think it ’s perfectly acceptable to for the Free and open source community to be a little more vigilant when it comes to Microsoft ’s forays into this world , the outright blind hatred is nothing but a detrimental force that holds the Free and open source community back .
Something else that many people wondered about was that Microsoft seems to have published the code for purely selfish reasons ; they are drivers to make Linux work better on Microsoft ’s Hyper - V technology , allowing it to compete more effectively with competing offerings .
Linus ’ opinion on this is a pretty clear “ duh ! ”
I agree that it ’s driven by selfish reasons , but that ’s how all open source code gets written !
We all “ scratch our own itches ” .
It ’s why I started Linux , it ’s why I started git , and it ’s why I am still involved .
It ’s the reason for everybody to end up in open source , to some degree .
So complaining about the fact that Microsoft picked a selfish area to work on is just silly .
Of course they picked an area that helps them .
That ’s the point of open source – the ability to make the code better for your particular needs , whoever the ‘ your ’ in question happens to be .
Does anybody complain when hardware companies write drivers for the hardware they produce ?
No .
That would be crazy .
Does anybody complain when IBM funds all the POWER development , and works on enterprise features because they sell into the enterprise ?
No .
That would be insane .
So the people who complain about Microsoft writing drivers for their own virtualization model should take a long look in the mirror and ask themselves why they are being so hypocritical .
It ’s always refreshing to hear someone level - headed discuss issues like this .
I guess this is also the reason why , after so many years , Linus is still the undisputed benevolent dictator of Linux .
And we would n’t want it any other way .
Exploiting the common land ( Image : Larry MacDougal / Rex Features )
DO YOU ever get the impression that civilisation has degenerated into an unedifying free - for - all ?
Like pigs gobbling at their troughs , we all seem to be out to get as much as possible of whatever is on offer .
Everyone is at it , from loggers felling the Amazonian rainforest and fishers fighting over the last few cod to SUV drivers running the oil wells dry and politicians on their gravy trains .
Science even has a name for the phenomenon – one that seems eerily prescient following the recent revelation about MPs ’ expense claims in the UK .
It is called the Tragedy of the Commons .
Four decades ago , ecologist Garrett Hardin published a ground - breaking paper on this phenomenon , arguing that when personal and communal interests are at odds , overexploitation of resources is inevitable .
His tragedy of the commons referred to the destruction of communal pasture when individual herders act rationally in their own best interests , each putting as many cows as possible onto the land .
The same fate , he noted , is likely to befall any shared limited resource , from the atmosphere and oceans to national parks and rivers .
Over the years , and with the rise of environmentalism , Hardin ’s ideas have become hugely influential .
Does this mean we are doomed to plunder the world ’s resources and trash our planet ?
Even Hardin was n’t entirely pessimistic .
He noted that groups can create institutions to manage their communal resources , although these usually fail because of “ free - riders ” – individuals who try to reap the benefits of cooperation without paying any of the costs .
The solution he came up with was “ mutual coercion , mutually agreed upon …

Here is a game where you play as a bear who must fatten up to prepare for a long winter hibernation .
Forage in the forest with forbearance .
Download ( Windows only ) :
Instructions :
It is very simple to play .
Just grab stuff with your paw .
You can toss stuff out the windows and sunroof if the car gets too cluttered .
I am happy with the look and feel of everything , and with how the cockpit turned out .
But I am sad that the game is fairly shallow and that I did n't add more ' stuff ' .
enjoy
original concept for posterity :
* rodent species subject to change without notice .
This goose is cooked ...

Been going kinda nuts programming .
Lo and behold , a demo ...
http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/658973/Squirrel.zip
Arrow keys move and jump , hold space to grab onto stuff with your claws .
Press Q to enable driving with WASD ( because driving with the rodent is near impossible ) .
Still loads of physics tweaking to do .
And I think not being able to see out the window when pressing the gas might be a bad idea .
The scale of everything is probably out of wack .
And of course the gameplay and making it beautiful must be done .
Oh what toil and drudgery we must endure !
Is it just me , or does it seem weird to be using direct3D to draw 2D sprites to fake a 3D world ( using 2D physics ) ?

So this game has morphed into an educational game about the ecology of bears .
It turns out , driving a car as a squirrel was n't much fun .
And physics engine + platformer = too hard .
But bears , they 're a cinch !
A few random things on my to - do list :
- heavier badger
- quantized trees
- pointless blinker
- fish acquisition
- fatness
Also turns out , I 'm getting pretty good at making bad art quickly

A colleague once defined " work " as " that which you accomplish while not distracted by the internet , " and he was onto something .
Anyone who works on a computer understands how easily personal communication ( e- mail , instant messaging , social networks ) can distract from the task at hand .
Eyebeam Lab ’s Steve Lambert , creator of Add - Art and co-creator of the New York Times spoof , released an application over the weekend that solves the problem : SelfControl , a simple open source program for Mac OS X that prevents you from resorting to well - worn procrastination techniques by blocking access to websites and e-mail servers .
" I made it because I found I checked my e-mail almost subconsciously , even when I wanted to focus , " said Lambert via e-mail .
" It was just too easy . "
SelfControl runs a blacklist to which you can add specific sites , incoming mail servers or outgoing mail servers .
This lets you customize the program to block only your personal time sinks while maintaining access to whatever you need for work or school .
" For example , you could block access to your e-mail , Facebook and Twitter for 90 minutes , " reads the description , " but still have access to the rest of the web . "
It ’s about time .
Social networking addicts with enough self control to install the program will surely thank him , e-mail access permitting .

Dear George
On the desk in front of me is a set of graphs .
The horizontal axis of each represents the years 1750 to 2000 .
The graphs show , variously , population levels , CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere , exploitation of fisheries , destruction of tropical forests , paper consumption , number of motor vehicles , water use , the rate of species extinction and the totality of the human economy 's gross domestic product .
What grips me about these graphs ( and graphs do n't usually grip me ) is that though they all show very different things , they have an almost identical shape .
A line begins on the left of the page , rising gradually as it moves to the right .
Then , in the last inch or so – around 1950 – it veers steeply upwards , like a pilot banking after a cliff has suddenly appeared from what he thought was an empty bank of cloud .
The root cause of all these trends is the same : a rapacious human economy bringing the world swiftly to the brink of chaos .
We know this ; some of us even attempt to stop it happening .
Yet all of these trends continue to get rapidly worse , and there is no sign of that changing soon .
What these graphs make clear better than anything else is the cold reality : there is a serious crash on the way .
Yet very few of us are prepared to look honestly at the message this reality is screaming at us : that the civilisation we are a part of is hitting the buffers at full speed , and it is too late to stop it .
Instead , most of us – and I include in this generalisation much of the mainstream environmental movement – are still wedded to a vision of the future as an upgraded version of the present .
We still believe in " progress " , as lazily defined by western liberalism .
We still believe that we will be able to continue living more or less the same comfortable lives ( albeit with more windfarms and better lightbulbs ) if we can only embrace " sustainable development " rapidly enough ; and that we can then extend it to the extra 3 billion people who will shortly join us on this already gasping planet .
I think this is simply denial .
The writing is on the wall for industrial society , and no amount of ethical shopping or determined protesting is going to change that now .
Take a civilisation built on the myth of human exceptionalism and a deeply embedded cultural attitude to " nature " ; add a blind belief in technological and material progress ; then fuel the whole thing with a power source that is discovered to be disastrously destructive only after we have used it to inflate our numbers and appetites beyond the point of no return .
What do you get ?
We are starting to find out .
We need to get real .
Climate change is teetering on the point of no return while our leaders bang the drum for more growth .
The economic system we rely upon cannot be tamed without collapsing , for it relies upon that growth to function .
And who wants it tamed anyway ?
Most people in the rich world wo n't be giving up their cars or holidays without a fight .
Some people – perhaps you – believe that these things should not be said , even if true , because saying them will deprive people of " hope " , and without hope there will be no chance of " saving the planet " .
But false hope is worse than no hope at all .
As for saving the planet – what we are really trying to save , as we scrabble around planting turbines on mountains and shouting at ministers , is not the planet but our attachment to the western material culture , which we cannot imagine living without .
The challenge is not how to shore up a crumbling empire with wave machines and global summits , but to start thinking about how we are going to live through its fall , and what we can learn from its collapse .
All the best , Paul
Dear Paul
Like you I have become ever gloomier about our chances of avoiding the crash you predict .
For the past few years I have been almost professionally optimistic , exhorting people to keep fighting , knowing that to say there is no hope is to make it so .
I still have some faith in our ability to make rational decisions based on evidence .
But it is waning .
If it has taken governments this long even to start discussing reform of the common fisheries policy – if they refuse even to make contingency plans for peak oil – what hope is there of working towards a steady - state economy , let alone the voluntary economic contraction ultimately required to avoid either the climate crash or the depletion of crucial resources ?
The interesting question , and the one that probably divides us , is this : to what extent should we welcome the likely collapse of industrial civilisation ?
Or more precisely : to what extent do we believe that some good may come of it ?
I detect in your writings , and in the conversations we have had , an attraction towards – almost a yearning for – this apocalypse , a sense that you see it as a cleansing fire that will rid the world of a diseased society .
If this is your view , I do not share it .
I 'm sure we can agree that the immediate consequences of collapse would be hideous : the breakdown of the systems that keep most of us alive ; mass starvation ; war .
These alone surely give us sufficient reason to fight on , however faint our chances appear .
But even if we were somehow able to put this out of our minds , I believe that what is likely to come out on the other side will be worse than our current settlement .
Here are three observations : 1 Our species ( unlike most of its members ) is tough and resilient ; 2
When civilisations collapse , psychopaths take over ; 3 We seldom learn from others ' mistakes .
From the first observation , this follows : even if you are hardened to the fate of humans , you can surely see that our species will not become extinct without causing the extinction of almost all others .
However hard we fall , we will recover sufficiently to land another hammer blow on the biosphere .
We will continue to do so until there is so little left that even Homo sapiens can no longer survive .
This is the ecological destiny of a species possessed of outstanding intelligence , opposable thumbs and an ability to interpret and exploit almost every possible resource – in the absence of political restraint .
From the second and third observations , this follows : instead of gathering as free collectives of happy householders , survivors of this collapse will be subject to the will of people seeking to monopolise remaining resources .
This will is likely to be imposed through violence .
Political accountability will be a distant memory .
The chances of conserving any resource in these circumstances are approximately zero .
The human and ecological consequences of the first global collapse are likely to persist for many generations , perhaps for our species ' remaining time on earth .
To imagine that good could come of the involuntary failure of industrial civilisation is also to succumb to denial .
The answer to your question – what will we learn from this collapse ?
– is nothing .
This is why , despite everything , I fight on .
I am not fighting to sustain economic growth .
I am fighting to prevent both initial collapse and the repeated catastrophe that follows .
However faint the hopes of engineering a soft landing – an ordered and structured downsizing of the global economy – might be , we must keep this possibility alive .
Perhaps we are both in denial : I , because I think the fight is still worth having ; you , because you think it is n't .
With my best wishes , George
Dear George
You say that you detect in my writing a yearning for apocalypse .
I detect in yours a paralysing fear .
You have convinced yourself that there are only two possible futures available to humanity .
One we might call Liberal Capitalist Democracy 2.0 .
Clearly your preferred option , this is much like the world we live in now , only with fossil fuels replaced by solar panels ; governments and corporations held to account by active citizens ; and growth somehow cast aside in favour of a " steady state economy " .
The other we might call McCarthy world , from Cormac McCarthy 's novel The Road – which is set in an impossibly hideous post - apocalyptic world , where everything is dead but humans , who are reduced to eating children .
Not long ago you suggested in a column that such a future could await us if we did n't continue " the fight " .
Your letter continues mining this Hobbesian vein .
We have to " fight on " because without modern industrial civilisation the psychopaths will take over , and there will be " mass starvation and war " .
Leaving aside the fact that psychopaths seem to be running the show already , and millions are suffering today from starvation and war , I think this is a false choice .
We both come from a western , Christian culture with a deep apocalyptic tradition .
You seem to find it hard to see beyond it .
But I am not " yearning " for some archetypal End of Days , because that 's not what we face .
We face what John Michael Greer , in his book of the same name , calls a " long descent " : a series of ongoing crises brought about by the factors I talked of in my first letter that will bring an end to the all - consuming culture we have imposed upon the Earth .
I 'm sure " some good will come " from this , for that culture is a weapon of planetary mass destruction .
Our civilisation will not survive in anything like its present form , but we can at least aim for a managed retreat to a saner world .
Your alternative – to hold on to nurse for fear of finding something worse – is in any case a century too late .
When empires begin to fall , they build their own momentum .
But what comes next does n't have to be McCarthyworld .
Fear is a poor guide to the future .
All the best , Paul
Dear Paul
If I have understood you correctly , you are proposing to do nothing to prevent the likely collapse of industrial civilisation .
You believe that instead of trying to replace fossil fuels with other energy sources , we should let the system slide .
You go on to say that we should not fear this outcome .
How many people do you believe the world could support without either fossil fuels or an equivalent investment in alternative energy ?
How many would survive without modern industrial civilisation ?
Two billion ?
One billion ?
Under your vision several billion perish .
And you tell me we have nothing to fear .
I find it hard to understand how you could be unaffected by this prospect .
I accused you of denial before ; this looks more like disavowal .
I hear a perverse echo in your writing of the philosophies that most offend you : your macho assertion that we have nothing to fear from collapse mirrors the macho assertion that we have nothing to fear from endless growth .
Both positions betray a refusal to engage with physical reality .
Your disavowal is informed by a misunderstanding .
You maintain that modern industrial civilisation " is a weapon of planetary mass destruction " .
Anyone apprised of the palaeolithic massacre of the African and Eurasian megafauna , or the extermination of the great beasts of the Americas , or the massive carbon pulse produced by deforestation in the Neolithic must be able to see that the weapon of planetary mass destruction is not the current culture , but humankind .
You would purge the planet of industrial civilisation , at the cost of billions of lives , only to discover that you have not invoked " a saner world " but just another phase of destruction .
Strange as it seems , a de-fanged , steady - state version of the current settlement might offer the best prospect humankind has ever had of avoiding collapse .
For the first time in our history we are well - informed about the extent and causes of our ecological crises , know what should be done to avert them , and have the global means – if only the political will were present – of preventing them .
Faced with your alternative – sit back and watch billions die – Liberal Democracy 2.0 looks like a pretty good option .
With my best wishes , George
Dear George
Macho , moi ?
You 've been using the word " fight " at a Dick Cheney - like rate .
Now my lack of fighting spirit sees me accused of complicity in mass death .
This seems a fairly macho accusation .
Perhaps the heart of our disagreement can be found in a single sentence in your last letter : " You are proposing to do nothing to prevent the likely collapse of industrial civilisation . "
This invites a question : what do you think I could do ?
What do you think you can do ?
You 've suggested several times that the hideous death of billions is the only alternative to a retooled status quo .
Even if I accepted this loaded claim , which seems designed to make me look like a heartless fascist , it would get us nowhere because a retooled status quo is a fantasy and even you are close to admitting it .
Rather than " do nothing " in response , I 'd suggest we get some perspective on the root cause of this crisis – not human beings but the cultures within which they operate .
Civilisations live and die by their founding myths .
Our myths tell us that humanity is separate from something called " nature " , which is a " resource " for our use .
They tell us there are no limits to human abilities , and that technology , science and our ineffable wisdom can fix everything .
Above all , they tell us that we are in control .
This craving for control underpins your approach .
If we can just persaude the politicians to do A , B and C swiftly enough , then we will be saved .
But what climate change shows us is that we are not in control , either of the biosphere or of the machine which is destroying it .
Accepting that fact is our biggest challenge .
I think our task is to negotiate the coming descent as best we can , while creating new myths that put humanity in its proper place .
Recently I co-founded a new initiative , the Dark Mountain Project , which aims to help do that .
It wo n't save the world , but it might help us think about how to live through a hard century .
You'd be welcome to join us .
Very best , Paul
Dear Paul
Yes , the words I use are fierce , but yours are strangely neutral .
I note that you have failed to answer my question about how many people the world could support without modern forms of energy and the systems they sustain , but 2 billion is surely the optimistic extreme .
You describe this mass cull as " a long descent " or a " retreat to a saner world " .
Have you ever considered a job in the Ministry of Defence press office ?
I draw the trifling issue of a few billion fatalities to your attention not to make you look like a heartless fascist but because it's a reality with which you refuse to engage .
You do n't see it because to do so would be to accept the need for action .
But of course you are n't doing nothing .
You propose to stiffen the sinews , summon up the blood , and , er … " get some perspective on the root cause of this crisis " .
Fine : we could all do with some perspective .
But without action – informed , focused and immediate – the crisis will happen .
I agree that the chances of success are small .
But they are non-existent if we give up before we have started .
You mock this impulse as a " craving for control " .
I see it as an attempt at survival .
What could you do ?
You know the answer as well as I do .
Join up , protest , propose , create .
It 's messy , endless and uncertain of success .
Perhaps you see yourself as above this futility , but it 's all we 've got and all we 've ever had .
And sometimes it works .
The curious outcome of this debate is that while I began as the optimist and you the pessimist , our roles have reversed .
You appear to believe that though it is impossible to tame the global economy , it is possible to change our founding myths , some of which predate industrial civilisation by several thousand years .
You also believe that good can come of a collapse that deprives most of the population of its means of survival .
This strikes me as something more than optimism : a millenarian fantasy , perhaps , of Redemption after the Fall .
Perhaps it is the perfect foil to my apocalyptic vision .
With my best wishes , George

One of the things about the Fortean omniverse I have always found entertaining is the way that stuff always happens in batches .
On the same day that I received this storyabout alligators in Alabama , I also received this series of photographs and what purports to be a news story : " The picture to the left was taken by a KTBS helicopter flying over Lake Wiess about 90 miles north of Birmingham , Alabama .
The helicopter pilot and the game warden were in communication via radios ; following is a transcript of their conversation : " Air1 , have you a visual on the ' gator ?
Over .
" " Approaching inlet now ; over . " " Roger , Air1 . " " ' Gator sighted .
Looks like it has a small animal in its mouth .

This alligator was found between Centre and Leesburg , Alabama , near a house !
Game wardens were forced to shoot the alligator ... guess he would n't cooperate .
Anita and Charlie Rogers could hear the bellowing in the night .
Their neighbors had been telling them that they had seen a mammoth alligator in the waterway that runs behind the Rogers ' house but they dismissed the stories as exaggerations .
" I did n't believe it , " Charles Rogers said ; however , they later realized the stories were , if anything , understated .
Alabama Parks and Wildlife game wardens had to shoot the beast .
Joe Goff , a 6 ' 5 " tall game warden , walks past the 28 - foot , 1 - inch alligator ( 8.5 metres ) he shot and killed in the Rogers ' back yard .

The 28 foot ' gator was bad photoshop .
The biggest ' gator ever recorded was 19 feet 6 inches and shot in Louisiana in 1890 .
The biggest in recent years was about 15 feet .
The only crocodilian reliably measured at over 28 feet was a 28 foot 4 inch Indo - pacific croc .
" I would like someone with a knowledge of North American deer to take a look at the first two alligator pictures and try to give us a more reliable size estimate .
Woman in hot water after attacking the Mona Lisa with a mug of English Breakfast tea
A woman is being held in Paris after attacking the Mona Lisa with a cup of English breakfast tea .
The woman threw the ceramic mug full of the steaming brew over the heads of tourists , scoring a direct hit on the most famous work of art in the world in front of stunned security guards at the French capital 's Louvre Museum .
The mug bounced off the bullet - proof glass and shattered on the floor , a security guard said .
Tourists gaze at the Mona Lisa , encased behind barriers and bullet - proof glass in the Louvre ( file photo ) .
A woman has been arrested after hurling a mug at the painting
Guards wrestled the Russian to the ground following the attack on August 2nd - a Sunday - which has only just been reported .
A museum spokesman said : ' There was no damage done to the painting whatsoever .
' It is protected by bullet - proof glass almost two centimetres thick , and also contained in a special sealed box to protect it from vibrations and humidity .
' It is one of the most well guarded works of art in the world , and it would take more than a well - aimed tea -cup to damage it . '
A source at the museum claimed the woman had bought the mug of tea at a museum cafe .
Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa is the most famous painting in the world
The woman was pounced on by two museum security guards and handed over to central Paris police after the incident on August 2 .
She is being held in custody and is said to have undergone a psychological examination .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - American attitudes have changed and the “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy toward gays serving in the U.S. military should be reviewed , former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Colin Powell said on Sunday .
President Barack Obama favors overturning the policy , which bars gay troops from serving openly in the military .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has asked military lawyers to look at ways to make the law more flexible , hailed by gay rights groups as a “ seismic political shift ” .
“ The policy and the law that came about in 1993 , I think , was correct for the time , ” Powell said on CNN ’s State of the Union .
“ Sixteen years have now gone by , and I think a lot has changed with respect to attitudes within our country , and therefore I think this is a policy and a law that should be reviewed . ” he added .
Current Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen , the United States ’ highest ranking officer , said the military will continue to carry out the policy until it is changed .
“ It is very clear what President Obama ’s intent here is , he intends to see this law changed and my advice ... is that I think we need to move in a measured way , ” Mullen said .
“ At a time when we ’re fighting two conflicts there is a great deal of pressure on our forces and their families , ” he added .

Bizarre ... I posted on FDL what WMR provided its readership with about the Schakowsky " drowning " , and followed it with the Tribune article I posted here .
The initial post was pulled , with no explanation , even though Wayne gave clear sourcing ...
After that , I tried to post a question asking why my posts are being censored , and the post did n't even go up ... it was blocked .
Brad , you expressed disdain for Madsen 's sourcing when he noted Schakowsky 's role in the ATC bribery scenario .
He provides credible cites for this tragic news , so I hope that you will let this stand ...
According to today 's Chicago Tribune , a local coroner said that McLaughlin died of asphixiation while snorkeling .
The news involving Schakowsky 's son- in - law happened after the congresswoman was identified in a WMR exclusive as being subjected to a Turkish intelligence lesbian sexual blackmail operation involving Schakowsky and a female employee of a Turkish government - run organization in Washington , DC .
The information was provided to WMR by federal law enforcement and congressional sources .

http://www.aztlan.net/israeli_sexpionage.htm
Sexpionage is a foreign espionage tactic practiced by our alleged allies , Israel and Turkey , for purpose of blackmailing elected public representatives - costing us Trillions of dollars , the abandonment of our own national security and moral principles .
JOE LIEBERMAN helped to set - up Bill Clinton in the Lewinsky affair to enable Israel to blackmail the President of the United States .
http://www.rense.com/general69/col.htm
THIS IS TREASON .
Lieberman was the first prominent Democrat to criticize Clinton for his affair with Monica Lewinsky .
Joe Lieberman knows all about Israel 's intelligence efforts inside the US to ensnare the most powerful governmental officials in lustful entaglements - as SEXPIONAGE is a primary weapon in Israel 's War Against The American People .
Lieberman knows for a fact that Chandra Levy was a Mossad plant - a " Swallow , " placed close to Gary Condit in order to seduce him ( for blackmail ) and to gather secret intelligence ( Condit was on a powerful Intelligence Committee ) .
Lieberman knows all about Israel 's Blackmail and espionage inside the United States , and he is complicit in enabling it .
Sexpionage is so important to Israel , that it has opened an office for this purpose right smack in the center of US political power --- Washington D.C.
The office fronts as a post 911 anti-terrorism institute and is located at 3811 N. Fairfax Drive , Suite 720 Arlington , VA 22203 .
The Chief of the office is non other that the immediate former Director of the Israeli MOSSAD , Shabtai Shavit .
JOE LIEBERMAN - CHOOSE SIDES .
Expose the truth behind Ariel Joseph Weinmann 's recent arrest for passing TOP SECRET American Submarine data to Israel .
This case is as big as the Pollard spy scandal , and the American Media will not even cover it .
JOE LIEBERMAN - CHOOSE SIDES .
Kobi Alexander , former Comverse CEO is wanted on FEDERAL charges .
WHERE IS KOBI ALEXANDER ?
Why is he in the WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM if he is only guilty of Securities Fraud ?
He and Dov Zakheim were OPERATIONALLY INVOLVED IN 9/11 - THAT is why Alexander is being protected by CO - CONSPIRATOR , Dick Cheney .
The reason the GOP , Mel Sembler ( the guy who facilitated the Niger Forgery AND led the Scooter Libby Legal Defense Fund ) and Rove helped LIEBERMAN GET RE - ELECTED , is that he is a mole for the Shadow Government behind 9/11 .
CHOOSE SIDES JOE .
I'M WITH THE AMERICANS .

If you believe this shady woman , who is discredited and fired by FBI 7 + years ago and who is trying to get back to FBI payrolls since , then you can believe the world is flat .
Nothing she said is new and all tall tales .
The real question is why “ sibellydancer ” now ?
It is now because Krikorian , in a desperate attempt to disprove charges of libel he shamelessly leveled against an honorable Congresswoman Schmidt , is using anything that he thinks might help him and his sick cause of peddling a bogus genocide .
But it is too little , too late .
Krikorian made his bed , now he will have to lie in it .
He will find out , the hard way , that the U.S. is a country of laws , not slanderous claims .
Armenians poisoned for decades the columns and screens in this country with their brand of racist and dishonest history .
Now they are trying to close the door on fair - minded readers from finding out the deception behind the Armenian claims .

Assuming , David Krikorian case comes to an end , and they finally release Sibel 's transcripts , and audio , and video .
What then ?
And if nothing ..
Or assuming nothing happens , yet someone ( anyone have a full list of who ) has now read and heard Sibel 's testimony , considering the material at hand in regards to national security 's secrets and the really bad oath breakers in various places in our government who purportedly gave away those secrets , how is it not even one security clearance been yanked yet just to check if it 's the testimony is accurate ?
Whoever has heard Sibel 's testimony ( if they swore an oath ) , a reality and sanity check please , take action and uphold your own sworn oath .
How can our government argue for torture ( even if it was acceptable ) when they wo n't even investigate sworn testimony about domestic enemies in our own country ?
If it stand 's like this , the way I see it is .
America and it's government are nullified .
Which begs the question , if there are no more laws , then who and what is holding us together as a country and how much longer can it possibly last with such malfeasance ?

Our daily proof that the corporate MSM is n't liberal ... we had Sibel Edmonds , Blackwater , the e-vote hacking at the Ca. college , and today 's is :
When a scandal involving the Bush administration ’s firing of US Attorneys broke in early 2007 , initial coverage by the Washington Post supported the idea that the firings had been politically motivated .
That approach , however , quickly changed to one that was far more friendly to the White House .
Emails show Washington

This piece was written for another post , but directly links to the Sibel Edmonds ' revelations .
Karl Rove :
One of three known residences for Karl Rove is at 21 Dill Lane , Rosemary Beach , FL .
Now that emails are surfacing implicating him in removal of Federal Judges , other issues more serious are also being considered .
1 . Was the governor of Alabama framed by Rove 's dirty tricks department ?
2 . If Rove is charged with High Crimes and Misdemeanors , does owning a home in Florida allow him a bolt hole ?
We now learn that Scooter Libby was a peripheral distraction to a much larger crime located in Turkey .
See 123realchange.blogger.com or Brad blog .
Follow the trail to Rove , the Insider .
Larry Franklin , convicted for spying - sentence suspended , and the Israeli Mossad are directly linked to Rumsfeld 's Office of Special Plans , Dick Cheney , Scooter Libby , and Karl Rove .
Turkey is the hub of heroin manufacturing distributed by the Russian / Israeli Mafiya .
The World Bank protected Turkey from these known crimes under Paul Wolfowitz .
Robert Zoellick , his successor is also complicit .
Patrick Fitzgerald and Jamie Gorelick ( linked to Zoellick ) were implicated in suppression evidence for 9 - 11 as early as 1995 according to Peter Lance 's book ' Triple Cross ' .
Why ?
Fear , marshal law , infrastructure for a police state in place , global overpopulation .
Solve it by eliminating 80 % of us .
Valerie Plame was on to this Turkish hub , selling of nuclear secrets , salting evidence for weapons of mass destruction to Iraq by the Carlyle Group .
The word went out to get Dick Wilson and his wife Valerie Plame .
Sworn testimony by Sibel Edmonds in the Ohio Krikorian case implicates Marc Grossman and Richard Armitage as the real criminals who outed Valerie Plame .
Karl Rove knows much .
This is why he is protected .
He is YOUR neighbor .
Think about it .
The Solution : Use every means - twitter , blogs , person to person - speaking Truth to Power .
The solar / hydrogen economy is ready for implementation .
( Jeremy Rifkin , Roy McAlister , and Justin Sutton ) .
Restore organic agriculture and nutrient density to our food .
Simplify your lifestyle .
Remember this country was established on freedom of religion .
Jesus may be the only way , but he is also the Truth .
Eliminate racism .
YWAM ( Youth with a Mission ) and Christian missionaries are imposing a global theocracy in misguided hubris exploited by godless neocons .
( The YWAM link is tenuous , but can be followed through the recent C street revelations . )
I directly heard Pat Roberston allege that Christians had the right to usher in the kingdom of heaven on earth through a theocracy .
Anyone believing in a supernatural boogeyman does not have inner peace .
Do n't give money or power to be seen .
Do it secretly .
Giving out of fear is wrong .
Separate judgment from discernment .
Learn by talking to animals and listen to them .
They will flee from you if you are arrogant .

Outing who ?
A major supporter of Friedman 's American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) crowd being the subject of blackmail and also sitting in the oversight chair for the House Intelligence Committee is just outing ?
Excuse me , but Schakowsky 's predicament primarily helps one country in the Middle East and it is not necessarily Turkey .
The AIPACers know exactly where the Schakowsky matter is going to end up --- on the front steps of the Israeli embassy in Washington , the scene of so many other espionage operations directed against the United States .
In fact , a NSA source has confided that Israel , after China , now poses the most significant hostile intelligence threat to the United States .
But Friedman has a little problem with Jan being the subject of the lesbian " hooking " operation .
Schakowsky 's husband is Richard Creamer , an ex-con who also happens to write for Friedman 's Los Angeles friend Arianne Huffington 's " Huffington Post . "
And with the body of Creamer 's son- in - law being found floating in the Caribbean waters off Mexico while the family was vacationing there , the day after WMR broke the Schakowsky story , there must be some real dread among the AIPAC " amen corner " in Los Angeles .
The truth is certainly uncomfortable for certain quarters whether they be on the web or not .
The usual suspects can always be expected to go on the attack ---
I have been experiencing the slinging of mud for years from the one - time CIA applicant who runs DailyKos not to mention the Democratic Underground lads who call WMR a " highly unrealiable and / or bigoted web site . "
It seems that Mr. Allen , also known as " Skinner , " cannot make up his mind with his " and / or " statement .

COLUMBUS - U.S. Rep. Jean Schmidt ’s Armenian - American opponent probably made false statements during the 2008 campaign about contributions she received from Turkish political action committees , a unanimous three - member panel of the Ohio Elections Commission ruled today ’ .
We , Turks are used to such immoral Armenian tactiques .
let us concentrate on the attitute of the Armenians towards the scholars or people who do not support their thesis up till now :
The home of American Professor Stanford Shaw of the University of California - Los Angeles was firebombed in retaliation for his academic courage in disputing the Armenian genocide claim , in 1977 http://www.washingtontim.../armenian-crime-amnesia/
http://209.232.239.37/gt...ewIncident.aspx?id=56624
Sixty nine academicians who specialized in Turkish , Ottoman and Middle Eastern studies from 44 different American universities and colleges published a declaration in The New York Times on May 19 , 1986 and declared : ……. No signatory of this statement wishes to minimize the scope of Armenian suffering .
We are likewise cognizant that it cannot be viewed as separate from the suffering experienced by the Muslim inhabitants of the region .
The weight of evidence so far uncovered points in the direction of serious inter-communal warfare ( perpetrated by Muslim and Christian irregular forces ) , complicated by disease , famine , suffering and massacres in Anatolia and adjoining areas during the First World War .
Indeed , throughout the years in question , the region was the scene of more or less continuous warfare , not unlike the tragedy which has gone on in Lebenon for the past decade .
The resulting death toll among both Muslim and Christian communities of the region was immense .
But much more remains to be discovered before historians will be able to sort out precisely responsibility between warring and innocent , and to identify the causes for the events which resulted in the death or removal of large numbers of the eastern Anatolian population , Christian and Muslim alike ………… the history of the Ottoman - Armenians is much debated among scholars , many of whom do not agree with the historical assumptions embodied in the wording of H.J.Res.192 . …. Such a resolution , based on historically questionable assumptions , can only damage the cause of honest historical enquiry , and damage the credibility of the American legistlative process .
The producers of the ‘ historical documentary film Sarı Gelin ( www.sarigelinbelgeseli.com) suggested to interview some of these academicians .
However they were rejected because these academicians and their families were threatened by the Armenians , via telephone calls and letters , in 1986 for signing this declaration .
Justin McCarthy ’s family had to get police protection .
Prof. McCarthy himself was threatened with losing his job if he continued his research .
http://turkishweekly.net.../top/comments.php?id=594, http://www.tallarmeniant...com/69histors-charny.htm,
http://www.tallarmeniantale.com/intimidate.htm
The Armenians sued Bernard Lewis , the French historian famous for his Middle Eastern and Ottoman studies , in France , in 1993 just because he wrote in Le Monde that ' the 1915 events were not ‘ genocide ’ .
American judge Samuel Weems ’s life was threatened by the Armenians since he published his book ‘ A terrorist State : Armenia ’ .
In Netherlands , Turkish origined party members who told that they did not agree with the Armenian thesis were discharged from the party , because of the pressure of the Armenian voters of the country .
Additionally , Turkish university students studying in the USA are under threat of Armenian students , just because they reject the Armenian claims .
In some universities it reaches to such an extreme point that one young university student needs police escort .
' Oath of Asala ' which is a branch of Asala declared that they would spare GAKAVYAN 's life in case he abandoned this apology project and disclosed the names of the people who urged him to do so , according to the Armenian newspaper " Azg " , http://www.radikal.com.tr/Radikal.aspx?
aType=RadikalHaberDetay&ArticleID=921474&Date=14.02.2009&CategoryID=98 .
The petition of Dr. Armen Gavakian from the Macquarie University in Sydney , who is also co-chair of the Turkish - Armenian Dialogue Group would read " I apologize to the Ottomans and Turks for murders committed in the name of the Armenian people and I empathize with the feelings and pain of the Ottomans and Turks . "
http://www.hurriyet.com....sh/domestic/10904739.asp
Recently , French Jack Lang who was one of the strongest supporters of 2001 ’s Armenian bill in French parliament , and was head of the then Parliamentary Foreign Relations Commission said he had voted against a controversial bill adopted by the French parliament making it a crime to deny recognition of 1915 incidents as “ genocide ” , because the action was abused for election interests .
" The denial bill was passed with the aim of an election investment , not because they understood the pains of Armenians .
Accordingly it is dangerous that history is made by politicians , " he said .
The Armenian diaspora in France directed fierce criticism at Lang over his recently published remarks .
Soon afterwards , he declared that he had not changed his position and would continue to fight for that genocide of the Armenian people be recognized especially in Turkey .
http://armenians-1915.bl...ery-intimidation-in.html, http://www.lemonde.fr/so...le-net_1150313_3224.html
And at present saying what happened in 1915 is not genocide could be life threatening in Republic of Armenia .
Imagine giving a conference with Turkish academicians there .
And did you hear any Armenian who attempted to hold a conference advocating that Armenian genocide did not occur , in Armenia ?
Even Armenian historian Sarafian , the head of the London - based Gomidas Institute , said " Freedom of expression for historians in Armenia is limited and the genocide issue has become a political tool and for historical investigations Armenia is a wrong address
.
http://www.hurriyet.com....estic/10426989.asp?scr=1.
1900
It is a fact that even books written by Armenian leaders and historians which criticize the Armenian Dashnaks like the book of Katchaznouni , the first prime - minister of the Armenian state , Dashnagzoutiun Has Nothing to do Anymore , the book of K.S. Papazian ‘ Patrionism Perverted ’ are banned in Armenia .
In spite of all these facts , the Armenians and the Western and biased journalists continuously attack the Turks , claiming that the Armenian thesis can not be discussed in Turkey , since freedom of speech is absent .
Could anybody tell me , if Armenian thesis were banned in Turkey , then how could Armenian historian Ara Sarafyan give a conference on the thesis of Armenian genocide in İstanbul and discuss them with the Turkish citizens ?
http://www.turkishdailyn...ticle.php?enewsid=102831
Moreover if all the historians who do not support the Armenian thesis were people hired by the Turkish government , and if the Turkish government pays historians if and only if they support the Turkish thesis , as claimed by the Armanian diaspora , then how has Fatma Muge Gocek , a Turkish origined scholar who supports the Armenian thesis been able to be a board member of the Institute of Turkish Studies financed by Turkish government in Georgetown University , Columbia
( http://www.turkishstudies.org/about.html ) ?
How could she give conferences supporting the Armenian views up till now ?
She is the second Turkish origined academician the Armenians approve after Taner Akçam http://www.armeniangenoc...om/showthread.php?t=2471
http://www.eraren.org/in...aleler&MakaleNo=3008
( Can you imagine Taner Akçam , who advocated the Armenian claims in Minnesota University up till now and was financed by Zorian Armenian Institute as confirmed by the university authorities ( http://www.tallarmeniantale.com/univ-Minn.htm), give conferences against the Armenian thesis ? )
Moreover , as a most important point , Turkish historians , Turkish prime minister and Turkish Assembly several times suggested Armenia to discuss these events together with historians from both sides and historians from other countries .
Everybody in Turkey knows very well that those who advocate the Armenian thesis most passionately are the Armenians themselves .
Could anybody tell me again if Turkey was a place where Armenian thesis were banned , then why did Turkish prime minister and Turkish Assembly several times call on Armenia to discuss these events with whoever they choose ?
No wisdom can overlook this hypocrisy of Western journalism and policy .

Hey !
Wait !
No Genocide !
I can prove it !
1 . So called Armenians were just lost campers who had tough time with Turkish national park system roads during time of war and bad rains .
They forgot to bring sun block to Syria , had no comfortable shoes also .
Very sorry they did not pack adequate food , water and GPS devices .
Really !
Sorry !
Whose fault is this ?
2 . Armenians are just looking for money , so they invent other non-existent groups , like so called Assyrians and Greeks , all to help them get better seats in Restaurants in Napa Valley than Dick Gebhardt , our spokesmodel .
There is no document proving these people existed .
None !
Therefore , there is no document that can prove they died !
For all we know Armenians are still there , gouging the honest Muslims of Anatolia .
Yes !
3 . At most , only 8,000 of these so called Armenian people so called died during so called Genocide , actually mass camping and hiking problems .
Right now , Kurds are also having camping problems .
Mistakes were made !
Sorry !
No Genocide !
Turkish Historical Society has proof !
Imperialistic Western Christian Crusaders ignore proof , all are racist !
4 . Please call our leading expert , an Orange County resin maker , who knows better than any so - called historian [ actually racist Turk haters , all of them ] Ergun Kirlikovali .
He can tell you !
5 . Kurds did it .
6 . Germans made us do it .
7 . Russians made it happen , the camping thing I mean .
8 . Armenians who camped in Syria were in good cardio health as a result .

Since the same person claimed that I am really Ergun Kırlıkovası , before , I decided to reply .
I am Zekiye İçli .
I have been interested in Armenian claims since my childhood which was deeply affected by Armenian terrorist activities and murders .
I live in Ankara , not in the USA .
To react Armenians ’ dishonest claims , one need not live in the USA , be a Turkish American or a member of Turkish lobby .
On this occasion , I want to remind the readers the terrorist activities of the Armenians :
Did the Armenians not establish outlawed terrorist organizations ASALA , JCAG ( Justice Commandos for Armenian Genocide ) and ARA ( Armenian Revolutionary Army ) and did they not perform dozens of murders and hundreds of terrorist activities ?
Because of these Armenian terrorist organization ’s activities , did 70 people not die ( 39 of whom being innocent Turkish diplomats ) ; were 524 people not wounded ; were 105 not pledged ?
Additionally did these organizations not perform 208 bombing activities during 1975 - 1986 ?
Then , did they not pass on their trade to kill Turkish people to the PKK .
What did the American Armenians do when Armenian Yanıkyan , who murdered the Turkish diplomats Mehmet Baydar and Bahadır Demir in Santa Barbara , California and surrendered the police ?
The Armenians gathered around the district and SALUTED the murderer !!
During the trial , bus load of Armenian children , aged 7 - 13 , were transported from Los Angeles area , and when Mr. Yanikian was escorted to the room they rose in unison to greet a man who was their hero , just because he had murdered two innocent men .
Just at that time , Armenian - Americans quickly mobilized and formed a group called " American Friends of Armenian Martyrs " to raise funds for his defense and to use the court case as " an educational campaign to bring the story of Turkish genocide before the American and world attention " ( Armenian Mirror - Spectator , March 24 , 1973 ) .
Until his death almost a decade later , a few months after he was released from prison on the order of the then California governor , George Deukmejian , Yanikian continued to receive gifts and supportive letters from Armenian - Americans ( ATAA , Armenian Atrocities and Terrorism , Washington , 1997 ; http://www.ataa.org/refe...IS6_Berkoz_Affidavit.pdf).
The Armenian criminal of Orly Airport massacre , Karapetyan , a member of ASALA , who was imprisoned for 18 years then set free by France , returned to Armenia in May 2001 , he was welcomed by the then Armenian prime minister A. Margaryan , the Armenian folk and journalists who applauded him as if he were a national hero .
A. Margaryan told that he appreciated this hero ’s service for his country .
Armenian Yerivan municipality provided work and house for the MURDERER 1179 ( www.prima-news.ru/news/articles/2001/9/13/15705.html)
The 28 January 1982 , Turkey ’s Los Angeles Consul General Kemal Arikan was killed by the dashnak militant Hampig Sassounian , who was sentenced to life imprisonment .
Sassounian 's father stated on public television , " I am glad that a Turk was killed , but my son did not do it . "
A campaign to provide funds for Sassounian 's defense raised $ 250,000 in small donations from Armenian - Americans throughout the United States .
( Michael M. Gunter , " Pursuing the Just Cause of Their People " : A Study of Contemporary Armenian Terrorism , Wesport - New York , Greenwood Press , 1986 , p. 74 . )
After Hampig Sassounian was found guilty of murdering the Turkish Consul in Los Angeles in 1982 ... Bishop Yeprem Tabakian , the prelate of the Western Prelacy of the Armenian Apostolic Church , stated : " Hampig 's conviction is an indictment directed against all Armenians . "
Archbishop Vatche Hovsepian , the primate of the Western Diocese of the Armenian Church , added : " I am truly shocked about the verdict * Levon Marashlian , of the Glendale College of Armenian history and culture , said Armenian terrorists are " patriots who have been waiting for 70 years . "
An Armenian student of Dr. Dennis Papazian , professor of history and the University of Michigan in Dearborn , was quoted as saying : " In a way , I 'm kind of proud of the terrorists . "

Since 1984 , ARF commemorate every year the suicide - attack against the Turkish embassy in Lisbonne ( 25 July 1983 ) , and describe the five terrorists as " heroes " ( Gaïdz Minassian , Guerre et terrorisme arméniens , Paris , PUF , 2002 ; http://www.tallarmeniant...om/terror-case-study.htm).
* A monument of Tehleryan , the murderer of Talat Pasha was erected in Yerivan in 2006 ( Milliyet March 17,2006 and Agos March 24 , 2006 ; http://www.tallarmeniant...s/tehlirian-monument.JPG).
* Mourad Topalian , ex-leader of Armenian National Committee of America was sentenced to 36 months in prison for his complicity in bombing the Turkish mission at the United Nations .
In spite of this , he was not labeled a terrorist by Armenian Americans .
1180 Murad Topalian , former president of the Armenian National Committee of America ( ANCA ) was sentenced to 37 months of jail for storing of weapons and explosives , linked to a terrorist group .
In France , Ara Toranian , president of the Coordination Committee of French Armenian Association from 2003 to 2007 , and still currently the most prominent character of Armenian community of France , was the sopkesman of the terrorist group ASALA , from 1976 to 1983 , then of a dissident group , ASALA - RM , from 1983 to its destruction by French police , in 1985 .
I call every human and every official of foreign governments to ask themselves if they ever did their duty to react Armenian terrorism and violence .
And also ask if the world public did its duty to give evidence - based responses to the massacres inflicted upon Turks / Muslims by the Armenians in Anatolia in the 1st World War ( ATAA , Armenian Atrocities and Terrorism , Washington , 1997 , p. 28 , available : http://karabakh-doc.azer.../armyanstvo/arm12eng.htm ) , which started long before the Armenian deportation and to aforementioned Armenian terrorism , so as not to let genocides repeat themselves .
The answers are two big ‘ NO’s .
I call the public opinion to pay attention to the courage of the Armenians to perform new Turkish massacres during their invasion of the Azerbaijani territory in 1992 :
One woman ’s fingers were plucked and two men ’s skins were flayed .
( The Economist March 7 , 1992 , p.48 ) , some were burned , some of the bodies were destroyed ( New Republic Vol 206 , No 14 , April 6 , 1992 , p.11 ) ; more than 1000 Azarbaijani Turks were massacred ( ‘ Faces of Massacre ’ Newsweek , March 16 , 1992 ; ‘ Massacre by Armenians Being Reported ’ .
The New York Times , March 3 , 1992 ) ] .
1149
Here are other examples showing that the Armenians have adopted the language of violence as a life style :
The Armenians committed sabotage upon the house of American historian Prof Stanford J Shaw just because he declared that Armenian genocide did not occur in 1977 http://www.washingtontim.../armenian-crime-amnesia/
http://209.232.239.37/gt...ewIncident.aspx?id=56624).
Turkish prime minister , Assembly several times suggested Armenia to discuss these events together with historians from both sides and even historians from other countries .
Armenia persistently refused .
By making the parliaments pressure to pass genocide resolutions , Armenia aims to bypass historical realities and wants to escape from facing with its own history unlike Turkey .
Therefore , people , countries and journalists who support Armenia in its policy , foster and approve violence which had become Armenian national language , instead of supporting dialogue and peace for the world .
PC : But , when Hrant Dink was murdered , Turkish people , president , all members of goverment , bureaucrats from all levels , journalists sincerely mourned and condemned the murderer .
Millions of Turkish citizens gathered in his funeral ceremony and shouted as ‘ we are all Armenian ’ with tears .
Including the annual Press Freedom Award of Turkish Journalist Association , Hrant Dink was awarded with many prizes , after his death .
Additionally , 60 000 illegal Armenian immigrant workers who are Armenian citizens are working throughout Turkey , at present .
If Turkey and Turks also adopted the language of violence , how could these Armenians go on working in this country ?

Zekiye , I do n't have time , nor does Brad have the space for me to respond to the entire piece you have posted .
Lets just agree to disagree .
But what you have written about the death of Hrant Dink is sickening and immoral .
And you are immoral for posting it .
It is a disgrace .
And so are you .
If we lived in the age of the duel I would challenge you to one .
You are without honor , as is true with so many of your ideological stablemates .
You ply Americans with lies .
First , Hrant Dink was driven almost to despair and certainly to death by nationalists who spout savage racist language , seemingly without noticing it .
You all spew language that Nazis use : Armenians , a a group , are liars , deceivers , falsifiers , traitors , terrorists , cowards and murderers .
This is just what Hitler said of Jews .
It is what people like you also say of Kurds , Greeks and Arabs .
They got what they deserved , but while Americans are listening , we deny that they got anything at all .
Two weeks before his death Dink reported to others that he was summoned to a government office where he was told how easy it would be for the deep state to arrange his death at the hand of a young man if he did not back off calling the Genocide a Genocide .
He received numerous death threats directed to his sons .
See Radikal article on the threats .
The vicious , national and consuming racial hatred of these people , and of people like you , is what killed Dink , let 's not pretend otherwise .
He was prosecuted and persecuted .
Dink was the 1,500,001st Armenian victim of Turkish racial hatred .
Now you try to pretend otherwise , showing that you do not even have the courage of the savage .
You and your fellow fascists seek to profit first by the killing of Dink , and then by pretending to mourn him .
Your ideological kinsmen Kirlikovali , the incoming president of the ATAA wrote on the day of the killing that an Armenian killed him .
He has never retracted .
You say millions throughout Turkey mourned the death .
In truth , the crowds at Taksim and in Istanbul were measured at about 125,000 ; of these at least 2/3 were Kurds , Armenains and other minorities .
It quickly became the fashion after the death for nationalists to wear white skull caps of the type worn by the killer to mock the death ; a popular song came out mocking the death , and all those who said " We are all Hrant , We are all Armenian " were mocked by a popular song saying " I am a Turk , etc . "
After the shooting , many members of the Armenian community received death threats ; vandalism was common , the Patriarch was threatened , and the police looked aside .
You say you mourn Dink .
You lie .
What have you done to protest the conditions which created his death ?
What have you done to protest the Trabzon police who infamously had their pictures taken with the assassin , all smiling , under the Turkish flag , blood red with infamy , to them a celebrated symbol of murder .
Do you stand with the murderers ?
It seems so .
Please have the decency to admit ti , rather than to profess to a westernaudience some concern about a man whose death made youand your 40 million soulk mates smile with delight .

It is tragic that a person from Armenian diaspora above , degrades the Turkish citizens , we , who held a big funeral for Hrant Dink and held the placards on which it was ‘ We are all Armenians ’ were written , claiming that we were all Armenians previously but then became Muslim !
I was one of those who held these placards with my close friends .
Neither I nor my close friends nor friends of my friends were Armenians then or previously .
I was the one whose family had been living in the Central Anatolia since 1400 ’s , as Turkmens ; and whose grandparents perished in World War I .
But we did not hesitate to hold these placards and condemn terrorism .
Because the common point which made us angry and shed tears was not our ethnic identities .
It was only OUR HEARTS which beat without being dependent on nationality , race , sect , hatred and religion .
It was just our HUMAN feelings .
If the Armenians could not take this message , as it seems , they should question their hearts .
They should ask their hearts when they lost to receive such human messages .
While being fed by Turkish hatred ?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUdLgof56Bw

While rewriting Armenian history , depending on hatred to Turks ?
I have to remark that : - Although I knew that the Armenians massacred the Turks and Muslims relentlessly much before deportation http://www.tsk.mil.tr/EN..._Archive_Documents.html;
http://www.karabakh-doc..../armyanstvo/arm12eng.htm), - Although I knew that the present Armenian thesis depends on forgeries like so - called Talat Paşa telegrams ( http://www.ataa.org/reference/andonian-ataov.html, http://www.eraren.org/in...ayinIcerik&SayiNo=15), depended on misinformation like Ambassador Morgenthau ’s reports ( http://www.eraren.org/index.php?Lisan=en&Page=YayinIcerik&SayiNo=18), missionaries ( http://www.tallarmeniantale.com/salt-missionaries.htm) and British state propaganda ( http://www.ttk.org.tr/templates/resimler/File/fulltex) which fostered Armenian mythomania ( Erich Feigl A Myth of Terror , http://www.mns.gov.az/do...A_MYTH_OF_TERROR_LOW.pdf)
http://www.tallarmeniantale.com/gilles.htm
- Although I knew that the Armenians killed 70 people , 39 being innocent Turkish diplomats , and held hundreds of terrorist activities by their terrorist organizations ASALA , JCAG ( Justice Commandos for Armenian Genocide ) and ARA ( Armenian Revolutionary Army ) between 1975 - 1986 and later started to support PKK ,
( http://www.ermenisorunu.gen.tr/english/terrorism/armenian.html)
- Although I knew that these murders were supported by the Armenian folk http://www.ataa.org/refe...IS6_Berkoz_Affidavit.pdf
- Although I knew that these murders were supported by the Armenian government individually ( The then Armenian prime minister A. Margaryan welcomed Armenian criminal of Orly Airport massacre , Karapetyan , a member of ASALA holding a state ceremony , during which he told that the Armenians and Armenian government were grateful to their great hero .
www.prima-news.ru/news/a...les/2001/9/13/15705.html)
I did not hesitate to take part in the parade for Hrant .
Because , I knew that I am , as one of inheritants of the soil I am living on , I owe much to Armenians too , whose hearts did not lose her sensors for human feelings and did not approve Armenian Dashnaks like Armenian Dr Maltizyan and many others .
It is a fact that Armenian Dashnaks of the past are surviving in character of the Armenian diaspora at present .
Here is the dramatic end of Armenian doctor , Dr Maltızyan :
In Van , all Muslim men and youngsters were on their military service and the Muslims who stayed in the city were only women , children and very old people .
In February and March 1915 , Armenians rebelled in several parts of Van .
The hospitals were full of wounded soldiers .
In January 1915 , 120 chidren aged 11 - 13 had had to take weapons and munitions to Iran , in order to support the Turkish army fighting in Iran and became deficient in weapons and munitions , since there were not any available people left .
Under hard winter conditions , 41 children were lost , 39 were frozen and only 40 were rescued the majority requiring urgent intervention and treatment .
Dr Maltızyan , an Orthodox Armenian doctor who was known to serve everybody without any discrimination and a Turkish doctor Dr Refik Bey treated and looked after these children day and night , in a big house which was transformed to an hospital and saved 22 children out of 40 ( February - March 1915 ) .
On April 10 , 1915 , at midnight Dr Maltızyan was called to hospital by an unknown person , for an urgent case .
However , his body was found hung with a rope on a tree in the morning .
On his body a note was attached : ‘ This is the end of people who serve our enemies ’ .
For more information about Van Rebellion of Armenians see : http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/yayinlar/yayin1/5-Celik(87-108).pdf
It is another fact that Armenian Dashnaks assasinated wealthy Armenians who rejected to give money to them , like I. Jamharian ( who rejected to give them 30 000 ruble ) and Baliozian from İzmir , Gerektzian from Erzurum , A. Vartabed , priest of Van ’s Ahdamar Church and his co-priest Mihran .
And prominent Armenians like D. Davit , G.Manoug , B.Capamajian , B.Atamian , S.Keyfjian , M.Aghazarian and H.Arakelian who objected the terrorist activities of Dashnaks were eradicated by the Dashnaks …..
Armenian Papazian , the writer of the book ‘ Patrionism Perverted .
A discussion of the deeds and misdeeds of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation .
The so - called Dashnagtzoutune ’ by K.S. Papazian Boston , Baikar Press , 1934 ’ which is forbidden in Armenia now , said that conscience of all upright Armenians was deeply disturbed by Dashnak ’s relentless murders .
Note that Pierre Nora , president of the association ‘ Liberty for history ’ complained of that history became a slave of politics and currency , which restricted freedom of the historians ( http://www.lph-asso.fr//articles/46.html, .
http://www.lph-asso.fr//tribunes/49.html).
The world opinion should take it seriously that not only the historians , all HUMAN BEINGS AND CLEAN FEELINGS OF ALL HUMANS or HUMANITY in all , are under threats of politics , racism and currency now .
However , as Mustafa Kemal Atatürk stated ‘ It is possible to deceive the ‘ half of the world ’ ‘ continually ’ ; and ‘ all of the world ’ ‘ for a while ’ .
However it is not possible to deceive ‘ all of the world ’ ‘ continually ’ .

A Problem
Let us consider a small problem .
We would like to manage resources using a Haskell program , that are not just memory .
For the sake of argument we will consider GPU resources .
This can be reasonably straight forwardly done by using the IO monad to essentially write an imperative program that manages the resources .
But does n’t this defeat the point of functional programming ?
We ’re losing so many benefits that we normally get , we no longer get to describe only the result of our program , instead we have to describe how to get to it too .
Not only that , but we ’ve lost our wonderful garbage collection system that allows us to easily avoid all of those nasty segfaults we see in non-managed languages .
So , the problem today is , how do we extend the Haskell garbage collector ( preferably without playing with the runtime or compiler ) to be able to manage all these resources .
An attempt
Let ’s consider only one small subset of GPU resources – a shader .
What we would like in our Haskell program is a pure value that represents the shader , which we can call on at a later date .
We ’d like a function that takes our shader code , and produces this pure value , and we ’d like the resources on the GPU to be collected when the value is no longer in scope .
compile :: String -> String ->
Shader compile vertexShdrSrc fragShdrSrc = s where s = doCompile s vertexShdrSrc fragShdrSrc {-# NOINLINE doCompile #-} doCompile :: Shader -> String -> String ->
Shader doCompile s vertexShdrSrc fragShdrSrc = unsafePerformIO $ do {-
Set up our fancy pants shader stuff here -} addFinalizer s {- Remove resources from the GPU here -}
What we hope will happen is that we return our shader – s , with a finalizer attached to it .
When the garbage collector collects s , it will also collect the resources off the GPU .
This all looks rather good , so lets try using it :
myShader :: Shader my Shader = compile " some vertex shader source " " some fragment shader source "
The result of evaluating myShader is a constant use of s , the definition of this constant is looked up , and replaces it , so myShader is now defined as the right hand side of s .
Unfortunately , there ’s now nothing that points at s itself , so it ’s garbage collected , and all our resources removed from the graphics card .
Conclusion
We ’ve tried to find a way of getting automated collection of non-memory resources , but ultimately , not quite got there .
I do n’t see a way forward from this point , and would love to hear other people ’s input on how this sort of management can be done
A leading defence expert has projected that China will attack India by 2012 to divert the attention of its own people from " unprecedented " internal dissent , growing unemployment and financial problems that are threatening the hold of Communists in that country .
" China will launch an attack on India before 2012 .
There are multiple reasons for a desperate Beijing to teach India the final lesson , thereby ensuring Chinese supremacy in Asia in this century , " Bharat Verma , Editor of the Indian Defence Review , has said .
Verma said the recession has " shut the Chinese exports shop " , creating an " unprecedented internal social unrest " which in turn , was severely threatening the grip of the Communists over the society .
Among other reasons for this assessment were rising unemployment , flight of capital worth billions of dollars , depletion of its foreign exchange reserves and growing internal dissent , Verma said in an editorial in the forthcoming issue of the premier defence journal .
In addition to this , " The growing irrelevance of Pakistan , their right hand that operates against India on their behest , is increasing the Chinese nervousness , " he said , adding that US President Barak Obama 's Af - Pak policy was primarily Pak - Af policy that has " intelligently set the thief to catch the thief " .
Verma said Beijing was " already rattled , with its proxy Pakistan now literally embroiled in a civil war , losing its sheen against India . "
" Above all , it is worried over the growing alliance of India with the US and the West , because the alliance has the potential to create a technologically superior counterpoise .
" All these three concerns of Chinese Communists are best addressed by waging a war against pacifist India to achieve multiple strategic objectives , " he said .
While China " covertly allowed " North Korea to test underground nuclear explosion and carry out missile trials , it was also " increasing its naval presence in South China Sea to coerce into submission those opposing its claim on the Sprately Islands , " the defence expert said .
He said it would be " unwise " at this point of time for a recession - hit China to move against the Western interests , including Japan .
" Therefore , the most attractive option is to attack a soft target like India and forcibly occupy its territory in the Northeast , " Verma said .
But India is " least prepared " on ground to face the Chinese threat , he says and asks a series of questions on how will India respond to repulse the Chinese game plan or whether Indian leadership would be able to " take the heat of war " .
" Is Indian military equipped to face the two - front wars by Beijing and Islamabad ?
Is the Indian civil administration geared to meet the internal security challenges that the external actors will sponsor simultaneously through their doctrine of unrestricted warfare ?
" The answers are an unequivocal ' no ' .
Pacifist India is not ready by a long shot either on the internal or the external front , " the defence journal editor says .
In view of the " imminent threat " posed by China , " the quickest way to swing out of pacifism to a state of assertion is by injecting military thinking in the civil administration to build the sinews .
That will enormously increase the deliverables on ground ��� from Lalgarh to Tawang , " he says .
QnA : Has the UPA govt been able to deal with China firmly or have they been bullying India ?
Police are fingerprinting anonymous letters sent to three charity shops and a newsagent , threatening to vandalise their premises if they carry on selling Christmas cards out of season .
One of the Leeds outlets of the mental health campaign Mind has temporarily withdrawn bargain cards left over from last year after its door locks were superglued , costing £ 100 in repairs .
Police were studying CCTV film of a hooded figure hand - delivering one of the notes to an Oxfam branch in the suburb of Headingley .
The messages claim to come from the " Movement for the Containment of Xmas " , purportedly trying to stem the commercial bonanza before Christmas .
The Mind branch was also phoned by a man who claimed to have carried out the attack , saying that it would happen again if cards continued to be sold " far too early " .
But the charities involved said that agreeing to the demand would lose them regular income .
The brief notes , all delivered by hand , say : " This is a very polite but very serious reminder not to display Xmas cards until 1st Nov .
We will put super glue into your locks if you do .
Peace and goodwill . ' "
Oxfam manager Clive Barker said the letter had arrived on Monday evening .
He said : " It is very odd .
Every morning I wonder if I am going to be able to open up , or will the lock be glued up ?
The cards are important for our fundraising .
Like the rest of the high street there are Christmas cards on display as early tasters .
Four shops have been targeted and I just hope that nothing comes of it .
The police say they are treating it very seriously and have taken the letter for fingerprints . "
The Mind shop has taken cards off display , but the third target , the animal charity PDSA , will start selling new stock shortly .
The former Alaska governor is defending her claim about the Democratic health - care proposal .
Palin doubles down on ' death panels '
Former Alaska GOP Gov. Sarah Palin defended her claim that the Democratic health care proposal would create “ death panels ” in a statement Wednesday night slamming President Barack Obama .
“ Yesterday President Obama responded to my statement that Democratic health care proposals would lead to rationed care ; that the sick , the elderly and the disabled would suffer the most under such rationing ; and that under such a system , these ‘ unproductive ’ members of society could face the prospect of government bureaucrats determining whether they deserve health care , ” Palin wrote in a note on her Facebook page .

“ The provision that President Obama refers to is Section 1233 of HR 3200 , entitled ‘ Advance Care Planning Consultation . ’
With all due respect , it ’s misleading for the president to describe this section as an entirely voluntary provision that simply increases the information offered to Medicare recipients , ” she continued .
“ Section 1233 authorizes advanced care planning consultations for senior citizens on Medicare every five years , and more often ‘ if there is a significant change in the health condition of the individual ... or upon admission to a skilled nursing facility , a long - term care facility ... or a hospice program . ’ "
The White House and Democratic lawmakers have blasted Palin in recent days for suggesting that her own son , Trig , would have had to face a bureaucratic panel to get access to health care under the provision in the House health care proposal because he was born with Down syndrome .
“ The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama ’s ‘ death panel ’ so his bureaucrats can decide , based on a subjective judgment of their ‘ level of productivity in society , ’ whether they are worthy of health care .
Such a system is downright evil , ” Palin wrote last week .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs identified Palin on Wednesday as one of the GOP leaders he says is spreading “ wrong ” information about the health care debate .
Additionally , the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is using Palin’s “ death panels ” claim in a fundraising plea to supporters , calling the former governor ’s statement “ disgusting ” and “ outrageous . ”
But Palin seemed undeterred in her latest statement , pointing to columns by The Washington Post ’s Eugene Robinson and others to support her suggestion last week that the Democratic proposal is “ Orwellian . ”
“ President Obama can try to gloss over the effects of government - authorized end - of - life consultations , but the views of one of his top health care advisers are clear enough , ” Palin wrote .
“ It ’s all just more evidence that the Democratic legislative proposals will lead to health care rationing and more evidence that the top - down plans of government bureaucrats will never result in real health care reform . ”

PList is a variation of the convolution monad I described here .
It deals with the " wrong category " aspect so it is a true Haskell monad .
Penalty lists form some kind of dual to the convolution comonad .
It has much in common with this monad .
That monad does n't do anything smart about ordering searches but it does have the neat ability to ' fuse ' different branches of a search so that different ways to arrive at the same place do n't add to the combinatorial explosion .
It 's good for searches where you want to know what the minimum penalty is to get somewhere , but do n't care what the best path actually is .
join
Haskell provides a great way to perform combinatorial searching with backtracking : the list monad .
Do-notation provides a nice DSL that makes it easy to express the trying out of different possibilities .
But the list monad only performs a simple - minded walk through all of the alternatives giving little opportunity to direct that walk .
In particular , it 's not easy to provide heuristics to say things like " try this alternative first but if it starts going badly consider this alternative too " .
This post contains a monad that gives a simple scheme to allow programmers to direct searches in this way .
First the Haskell administrativia ... When using the list monad , a list is interpreted as a list of candidates in a search .
Thefunction for this monad takes a list of lists of candidates and flattens it into a list of candidates .
This is all the list monad really does : you write code that generates new candidates from old , and thefunction applies this code to all of the candidates it knows about and then flattens this back out to a single list of candidates .
Importantly it does this in a lazy way so that you only need look at candidates as they are generated .
This new monad will keep slightly more information : each candidate will have a ' penalty ' value attached to it saying how attractive a candidate it is .
Candidates with score 0 will be tried first , and those with score n will be tried after those with lower scores .
We can represent a collection of candidates and their scores simply as a list of lists .
The first list in the list will have those with score 0 , the second will have those with score 1 and so on .
We 'll call these lists penalty lists and the positions within those lists slots .
Here 's the definiton of the penalty list type :
It 's a functor in a straightforward way :
The rule we 'll adopt is that if you 're trying a combination of two candidates then the penalty associated with the combination is the sum of the penalties of the individual objects .
To implement this we need an alternative version of theoperation .
If we have a penalty list of penalty lists and we have an element in the mth slot in the nth penalty sublist then we want it to end up in the ( m+n ) th slot in the final penalty list .
Within a slot we can just order the elements just like in the original list monad .
Explaining howis implemented would take many words so I hope this picture of the computation of an example will do instead .
I used theclass simply to avoid directly referring to one level of nesting of brackets .
It is intended to be a proper implementation of asatisfying the three monad laws but I have n't proved this and it's possible that it occasionally leaves trailing empty lists around - which have no impact on search results .
We can use this much like the list monad .
First it will search for possibilities with zero penalty .
When these are exhausted it 'll backtrack to the last place where it can start finding possibilities with penalty 1 .
Then it 'll try penalty 2 and so on .
Importantly it manages to do this lazily so that we do n't explore penalty n+1 until we 've finished penalty n.So now we can start using it .
We 'll hunt for Pythagorean triples by simply hunting through all of the triples of integers .
But we 'll try to find solutions where the sum of the integers is as small as possible .
So as list of candidate integers we use .
In other words , the integer n has penalty n - 1 .
Here 's the code :
Of course we would n't really search for Pythagorean triples this way .
This is just an illustration of how to use the code .
But note , crucially , that the equivalent code using the regular list monad would give us back no solutions .
It 'd start with x=1 and y=1 and then go off to infinity finding candidates for z .
So as a side effect the penalty list allows us to tame some infinite searches .
Anyway , that was a simple numerical example .
But this monad can be used with much more complex kinds of search .
In fact it almost serves as a drop - in replacement for the list monad .
This is a really nice example of the way separation of concerns is easy in Haskell .
The task of generating candidates for search can easily be separated from the task of selecting from those candidates , even though the operations are highly interleaved during execution .
So here 's a more complex example : writing a parser that can tolerate errors without running into combinatorial explosion .
The idea is that we associate a penalty with each error .
The penalty will make the parser run on the assumption of no errors until it can no longer parse , and then it'll backtrack on the assumption of one error until that assumption is no longer tenable and so on .
We can liberally sprinkle ' erroneous ' parsings throughout our code confident that these branches will only be taken in the event that an error - free parsing can't be found .
Firstly , here 's a penalty list that we can use to introduce a penalty of just 1 .
If we stick that in the code path then anything following acquires a penalty of 1 .
Now we can write a parser .
We can implement Hutton 's parser in his monad parsers paper with very little modification .
We simply replace the usual list with the penalty list and do away with theoperator to allow it to be a bit more liberal about backtracking .
Here 's the parser type :
We could have parameterised that with the underlying monad so that we could have parsers with a choice of search strategy .
The rest is a lot like in Hutton 's paper : Now for a simple parsing problem .
We 'll parse simple arithmetical expressions a lot like in Hutton 's paper .
But I 'm going to tolerate two kinds of error : 1 .
The shift key does n't always work so occasionally a shifted or unshifted version of a character may appear and2 .
parentheses are occasionally left out by the clumsy user .
Now we can code up a simple grammar for this .
First the mapping between shifted and unshifted characters ( on a Mac US keyboard ) :
A version ofwrapped for the parser monad : Reading keys on the assumption that the shift key may have failed : Optional parentheses :
And the main part of the expression grammar : Match the end of a string :
We can test it out with :
When we run this we get no error - free parsing but we do get 3 readings with one error .
One comes from reading the ' ( ' as 9 , one comes from inserting the missing ' ) ' at the end and one comes from inserting ' ) ' after ' 1 ' .
Note that even for complex expressions we 'll quickly find a 1 - or 2 - error parsing .
For the regular list monad we might never get a parsing because there are an infinite number of ways of inserting parentheses .
Anyway , that was just a toy parsing problem .
But a more complex application comes to my mind .
Some written languages are tricky to parse because their orthography does n't fully capture the phonetics of the original language , because there are few or no indicators of sentence or even word breaks , and because they have numerous optional orthographic and grammatical rules and use a script whose individual characters are occasionally hard to reliably identify .
In such a situation it 's good to have a parser driven by heuristics about what is likely to be intended and the penalty list monad might serve well .
Here 's an example of such a language .
Update : I forgot to add some connections to previous monads I 've talked about :
Also , in response to a comment on #haskell I 've made theexample more complex so it 's easier to generalise from it .
It seems there ’s a bit of contention and kerfuffle about a recent Entrepreneur piece on the most “ startup friendly cities in the US . ”
Why ?
Because Portland — and a number of other “ not seen as startup hub ” towns — made it to the list while traditional metropolitan juggernauts — like Boston , New York , San Francisco , and Seattle — were left by the wayside .
I did n’t think much of it when I mentioned the Entrepreneur article — Portland is one of the best entrepreneurial cities — the other day .
But a post by John Cook on the TechFlash blog got me doing some heavy thinking about the list — and Portland in general .
I read John ’s post last night .
My first thought ?
Was this just a case of sour grapes ?
But after reading through it a couple of times , I do n’t think it is .
Because I agree with him on any number of points .
So I was n’t really going to jump at his good natured baiting — even though Entrepreneur was clearly baiting all of us — because I did n’t take any severe umbrage with anything he said .
At all .
All fair points .
And I did n’t really have anything to add to the conversation .
Then I saw Mike Rogoway ’s awesome response on the Silicon Forest blog , this morning .
He and John have a great , factual discussion going on .
But when it comes right down to it , they ’re still both in heated agreement on the topic .
And suddenly , it dawned on me .
Somehow , as I was reading both pieces , I slipped into thinking about the how the Entrepreneur piece related to the tech scene in Portland .
Probably because I was reading two of the best tech blogs in the Northwest .
I ’m silly like that .
But then it dawned on me : the Entrepreneur piece is about entrepreneurs .
Not tech startups .
And that , my friends , is where I ’m going to make my distinction .
And that ’s why I ’m sure that Portland belongs on the list of most startup friendly cities .
Why ?
Cost of living and way of life aside , it ’s for one simple reason .
Portland belongs on that list because it ’s got one of the most diverse entrepreneurial communities I ’ve ever seen .
And I ’m not even going to tack Portland ’s omnipresent “ per capita ” qualifier on there .
That ’s most entrepreneurial community , period .
And with a full head of steam , I started banging out my post .
But then I stepped back .
Maybe I do n’t know what the hell an entrepreneur is , I thought .
Maybe I do n’t know what the hell I ’m talking about .
Maybe they ’re absolutely right and I do n’t have a horse in this race .
And then , after a few moments of rocking myself in fetal position at that thought , I returned to the keyboard .
I wanted to make sure I actually had the correct understanding of the term “ entrepreneur . ”
I mean , it ’s not Entrepreneur ’s list of “ friendly to tech startups ” or “ successful liquidity events , ” is it ?
And while I hate to pull out the old hackneyed “ definition ” card , I am old and hackneyed , so let ’s take a look , shall we ?
Just so we ’re on the same page .
According to Wikipedia , “ An entrepreneur is a person who has possession of an enterprise , or venture , and assumes significant accountability for the inherent risks and the outcome . ”
Dictionary.com says it ’s “ a person who organizes and manages any enterprise , esp. a business , usually with considerable initiative and risk . ”
And my trusty Mac dictionary widget says it ’s “ a person who organizes and operates a business or businesses , taking greater than normal financial risks in order to do so . ”
Do n’t like those definitions ?
Well , pick any one of these takes on the word “ entrepreneur . ”
Entrepreneurs take a risk to start something up .
And Portland is pretty well chock full of those types .
Tech or otherwise .
And to me , being entrepreneurial and being a business person capable of leading an organization to a liquidity event are often two completely different things .
Ask anybody in Portland , and they ’ll rattle off two or three side projects .
That ’s entrepreneurial spirit .
But — but !— that ’s not business .
And that ’s something with which every entrepreneur struggles :
You might not be the right person to make your idea a successful business .
Heck , you might not even be the right person to turn your side project into a startup .
And if Portland does n’t prove that , I ’m finding it hard to think of a town that would .
But that does n’t make Portland any less of a haven for that entrepreneurial spirit .
Second , I reminded myself , this was a list of companies that are friendly to entrepreneurs .
Cheaper costs of living are friendly to entrepreneurs .
Solid mass transit is friendly to entrepreneurs .
Economic development strategies that look to stimulate the economy are good for entrepreneurs .
Coworking spaces are friendly to entrepreneurs .
You see , this may come as a shock to you — I know it does to me — but there are actually other kinds of entrepreneurs .
Yes , yes , tech is the entrepreneurial darling .
And clearly I love droning on and on about it .
But in actuality , Portland has an amazingly diverse and rich entrepreneurial fabric running through the city .
I mean , c’mon , I said to myself .
It was n’t even a tech company that was profiled in the piece .
The entrepreneurial company representing Portland ?
Wicked Quick , an Portland startup apparel company .
As much as I hate to admit it , being an entrepreneur is about more than hacking some sweet APIs together and getting Sand Hill Road to kick in some development funds .
And it ’s that entrepreneurial diversity that makes Portland entrepreneur friendly .
Some examples ?
Every food cart in Portland from Whiffies to the latest cart opening today is an entrepreneurial venture .
And if Food Carts Portland is any indication , the city is pretty damn friendly to those entrepreneurs .
Every comic artist in Portland — from Dark Horse to those innumerable unsung independents writing books and plots for limited distribution — are entrepreneurial .
Every independent coffee shop and barista that starts boiling water under their own shingle here in town is an entrepreneur .
And if this list of coffee shops does n’t hint at how many of those there are in town
Every coworking space in town — whether it makes it or breaks it — is an entrepreneurial venture to support other entrepreneurs .
That ’s like entrepreneurial friendliness squared .
Portland is a beer town , and every craft brewing and distilling operation is the entrepreneurial spirit of Portland .
Some of those even grow into successful franchises or regular watering holes .
But all of them — even the batch you ’ve got brewing in the garage — is that entrepreneurial spirit .
The same thing goes for every single restaurant in Portland .
I ca n’t think of any single entrepreneurial pursuit that carries with it more of that entrepreneurial risk factor than restaurants .
And Portland ’s got a ton of them .
The one place that Portland has focused — the clean tech and green tech scene — is rapidly becoming our claim to fame .
And that ’s one of the few areas that ’s actually getting the funding and support it deserves .
Sure .
Nike and Adidas passed out of the “ startup ” scene long long ago , but every single apparel company — from rock stars like Keen and Wicked Quick to crowdsourcing Ryz to tumultuous pursuits like Lucy and where are they Nau — is a Portland entrepreneurial story .
And one of the few regions in the world that boasts as much entrepreneurial talent in that regard .
Even Rudi and Adi would be proud .
Every single public relations and marketing communications consultancy — from brilliant small shops like Maxwell PR to corporations like Waggener Edstrom , who just so happens to handle all the PR for that little company over in Redmond of which Seattle is so proud — are examples of Portland entrepreneurs succeeding in this environment and supporting clients all over the world .
And that marketing work has translated into an environment where every single graphic design artist in town is entrepreneur , whether living on their own work or working inside an agency and finding time to pursue side projects .
Perhaps our next major bastion of Portland pride ?
Mobile development where entrepreneurial pursuits like Small Society , Urban Airship , Subatomic , Spotlight , Cloud Four , FreeRange , Avatron and any number of individual entrepreneurial efforts are changing the face of development in town .
And knocking it out of the park .
Of course , I would be completely remiss without mentioning the classic example of Portland entrepreneurship sans profit — open source .
To me , there ’s nothing more entrepreneurial than having the gumption and wherewithal to identify a problem and fix it .
And Portland ’s open source community is all about that .
Not to mention all of the successful projects — and in AboutUs ‘ and Jive ‘s cases , funded projects — based on the use of and development of open source platforms .
And last but not least , Portland is one of the bloggiest towns anywhere .
And each and every blog or podcast a Portlander starts is another example of that entrepreneurial spirit taking root .
And that ’s nothing to say of the burgeoning music , art , and creative writing scenes .
All entrepreneurial pursuits in their own right .
And guess what ?
Practically every one of those pursuits above ?
They ’re supported by other entrepreneurs .
By frequenting establishments .
Or using their code .
Or buying their products to help them with their own startups .
So friendly to startups and entrepreneurs ?
Who knows ?
But there are certainly a ton of people embracing that entrepreneurial spirit — in thousands of different ways .
And there ’s a cooperative community that helps all of that happen .
But see , that rampant diversity will also be one of the reasons why Portland does n’t land on these types of lists without a lot of scoffing .
Because , beyond the whole green and clean tech thing , we ’ve put far too little effort into focusing as being the hub of X. Especially in tech .
And that ’s the real problem here — and the reason calling “ WTF ? ” on the Entrepreneur listing has its place — finding our niche or niches that will help that thriving entrepreneur vibe transition into a successful business community .
So yes , John , and yes , Mike , financial comparisons or IPO comparisons make the list look a little off or the metrics skewed .
But there is something else happening here that is n’t played out in those metrics .
Something I hope John swings by to see and I hope Mike keeps covering .
Something is happening .
Something cultural .
Something about Portland and its residents .
And maybe none of these entrepreneurial startup efforts will amount to a hill of beans .
Or create millionaires .
Or even solve any problems .
But that does n’t make them any less entrepreneurial .
Nor does it make Portland ’s community any less friendly to those entrepreneurs .
There ’s a reason Portland is on that Entrepreneur list .
Portland is the most entrepreneurial town in the world .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- The U.S. government made a 23 % return supporting Goldman Sachs during the global financial crisis , the investment bank said Wednesday as it unwound one of the last taxpayer - funded investments it received last year .
Goldman GS , +1.94 % said it paid $ 1.1 billion to redeem warrants the U.S. government received when it invested in the firm through the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
In June , Goldman repaid a $ 10 billion preferred - stock investment of $ 10 billion from TARP .
During the eight - month term of the investment , the firm noted that it also paid $ 318 million in dividends on those securities .
Including the cost of redeeming the warrants , Goldman said it paid $ 1.418 billion to the government , which works out to an annualized return of 23 % for U.S. taxpayers .
" This return is reflective of the government 's assistance , which benefited the financial system , our firm and our shareholders , " Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement .
" We are grateful for the government efforts . "
A new bailout beneficiary
Since the financial crisis erupted last year , the U.S. government has invested roughly $ 200 billion in more than 621 financial institutions to prevent the U.S. banking system 's collapse .
“ ' It is increasingly apparent that this may have been the best use of taxpayer ' funds , ' from an investment standpoint , in the history of the republic . ' ” — Richard Bove , Rochdale Research
More than 30 banks have repaid over $ 70 billion , but the bailouts have been heavily criticized for supporting some of the institutions that caused the crisis in the first place -- and doing so at taxpayers ' expense .
Goldman 's payments to the government suggest the opposite , banking industry analyst Richard Bove of Rochdale Research argued Wednesday .
" The government is making a great deal of money on its investments , " Bove wrote in a note to clients .
" It is increasingly apparent that this may have been the best use of taxpayer ' funds , ' from an investment standpoint , in the history of the republic . "
" So you will excuse me if the next time I hear about how bailing out the banks hurt the American taxpayer , I step outside to puke , " he added .
' Full and fair '
The $ 1.1 billion that Goldman paid to redeem its government warrants was the value that the Treasury Department put on the securities , Goldman noted .
These warrants could have been valued through a public auction , but Goldman said the Treasury 's assessment of the value of the securities was " full and fair , " given " the extraordinary actions taken by the government to help stabilize the financial system . "
Goldman shares rose 59 cents to $ 160.39 in afternoon action Wednesday .
The stock is up 90 % so far this year .
How America Is Funding Corruption in Pakistan
" When [ Musharraf ] looks me in the eye and says , … ‘ there wo n’t be a Taliban and wo n’t be al Qaeda , ’ I believe him , you know ? "
So said George W. Bush of then Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in September 2006 .
The U.S. president ’s trust had been forged in a deal made five years earlier : Pakistan would train , equip , and deploy its Army and intelligence service in counterterrorism operations , and Washington promised to reimburse its partner with billions of dollars in weapons , supplies , and cold hard cash .
The plan was simple enough , and since 2001 , the United States has lived up to its pledge , pouring as much as $ 12 billion in overt aid and another $ 10 billion in covert aid to Pakistan .
But today , as the Obama administration re-examines the deal , there is devastating evidence that the billions spent in Pakistan have yielded little in return .
For the last eight years , U.S. taxpayers ’ money has funded hardly any bona fide counterterrorism successes , but quite a bit of corruption in the Pakistani Army and intelligence services .
The money has enriched individuals at the expense of the proper functioning of the country ’s institutions .
It has provided habitual kleptocrats with further incentives to skim off the top .
Despite the U.S. goal of encouraging democratization , assistance to Pakistan has actually weakened the country ’s civilian government .
And perhaps worst of all , it has hindered Pakistan ’s ability to fight terrorists .
How could so much money do so much harm ?
The first answer is simply that the Pakistani civilian government , with whom Bush signed his agreement , barely controls the Army and intelligence services — the very institutions meant to receive the bulk of U.S. funds .
Until last year , the closest the Army came to accounting for its work was its annual budget submission : a single , bottom - line dollar figure that the government was constitutionally bound to approve .
Even now , after a much - hailed move toward more oversight , the Army ’s most recent annual budget submission was just two pages .
And Pakistan ’s Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) — a powerful and independent military agency — is no better .
Last year the Interior Ministry requested that it report to the government ; the ISI declined the invitation .
Long before the Bush - Musharraf agreement , money from such unsupervised budgets had enabled the Army to become one of the richest and largest industrial , banking , and landowning bodies in Pakistan .
The military formed its own networks of political patronage , co-opting existing political parties with threats and bribes .
With the injection of the U.S. cash , this already prevalent military corruption was thrust into high gear .
The extra money further discouraged the military and intelligence services from submitting to civilian control — a precondition for the country ’s democratization .
From the U.S. taxpayers ’ point of view , that ’s the least of the bad news .
Pakistan did not use the majority of the funds for the agreed objective of fighting terrorism .
Instead , the money was used in the way it has been for the last six decades : to train and stock the Army for conventional warfare , with India viewed as the main threat .
The Army spent the vast majority of U.S. funds on types of military equipment that are practically useless against terrorists .
It bought an air defense radar system costing $ 200 million , for example , even though the terrorists in the frontier region have no air capability .
The military bought F - 16 fighter jets , aircraft - mounted armaments , and anti-ship defense systems .
And the U.S. Department of Defense signed off on it .
Another chunk of the money fed corruption , as is clear from the fact that money was not often spent on the purposes for which it was intended .
Of the $ 920 million in military support that the United States gave Pakistan in 2008 alone , only $ 300 million reached the Army .
The Washington - based Atlantic Council estimates that " the great majority " ended up in the coffers of the Ministry of Finance .
The rot goes still deeper .
U.S. taxpayers paid $ 1.5 million to repair damage to Navy vehicles that did not see combat ( the terrorists do n’t have navies , either ) .
Another $ 15 million went for bunkers that were never dug ; $ 30 million paid for roads that were never built ; $ 55 million went to maintain helicopters that were not , in fact , maintained ; and $ 80 million per month was paid for soldiers to fight during periods when there was a cease - fire .
Meanwhile , U.S. officials visiting the frontier areas , where militants including the Taliban are most entrenched , found that the paramilitary Pakistani Frontier Corps was poorly equipped , even " standing there in the snow in sandals , " according to one report .
Several soldiers were equipped with World War I - era pith helmets and barely functional Kalashnikov rifles with " just 10 rounds of ammunition apiece . "
In an interview with the New York Times in November 2007 , Musharraf complained that Pakistan ’s helicopters needed more U.S. spare parts and support , despite the United States ’ having given his country $ 8 million worth of helicopter parts over the previous six months .
There ’s plenty of blame to go around for such dreadful mismanagement .
Part of it , of course , goes to Pakistan .
But another chunk falls squarely on U.S. shoulders .
From the start , there were few concrete goals for how the funds should be spent .
Officials who saw the objectives admitted that they often lacked concrete bench marks , sometimes even concrete figures , and were too vague to be effective .
And until 2006 , the U.S. Embassy staff in Pakistan was not required to follow up on how the Pakistani military actually spent U.S. funds .
The problem was compounded when the Pakistani Army insisted that the Federally Administered Tribal Areas — where much of the money was to be spent — were too dangerous to visit , making sustained oversight there impossible .
Finally , the U.S. Department of Defense refused to release detailed figures on Pakistan military aid until 2009 , making public scrutiny impossible .
Whomever you impugn , the bottom line is that the U.S. - Pakistan compact of the last eight years has been a disaster .
It is essential to ensure that the same mistakes do not happen again .
U.S. taxpayers have funded Pakistani corruption and undermined the fight against terrorism and militancy .
And for the sake of both countries , it simply has to stop .
Fine Point Technologies has agreed to buy the German software and systems integration service provider Sonic Telecom .
Sonic has been an authorized reseller of Fine Point ’s device management technologies since 2005 – but also selling VoIP gateway systems and services .
Fine Point says the deal will broaden its reach in European markets and offers it the potential to sell its software solutions to more communications providers .
The NYC - based company will retain Sonic ’s engineering and sales staff who are already knowledgeable in selling and supporting Fine Point ’s products .
Fine Point will also maintain Sonic ’s existing facility in Germany , and rename the entity Fine Point Technologies , Inc .

IronRuby , the Ruby implementation for the CLR , has been steadily improving - and it's now heading for a 1.0 release soon .
The abstract for a talk scheduled for July 23rd 2009 at O'Reilly 's OSCON states it in clear terms :
IronRuby is 1.0 !
Come and see how IronRuby is used in .NET programs , how well it performs , and how conformant it is . [..]
OSCON has an important place in the history of IronRuby , and it is only appropriate that we launch IronRuby 1.0 at OSCON 2009 .
So , how compliant will IronRuby 1.0 be ?
The answers is available online : ironruby .
info shows results for a RubySpec run ( at the time of this writing the result are from 2009 - 05 - 06 ) .
Some more information about what this data means for IronRuby can be seen in Interview with IronRuby team member Jimmy Schementi ( Jimmy 's blog , Jimmy on Twitter ) .
As Jimmy explains , while the overall result is 82.3 % seems low , the result is skewed by some of the results for library support .
Language compliance , ie .
how well IronRuby supports Ruby language features , is quite high .
The interview contains a lot of information , eg. IronRuby is capable of running realworld Rails applications .
Complications , however , can result when these apps are run against SQLServer because their SQL code is written against MySQL .
Other topics include IronRuby 's strategy for running Ruby code ( interpretation vs. compilation - interpretation is used for quick startup , but ultimately code is JITed to MSIL ) , the DLR and more .
In other Ruby VM news , JRuby 1.3.1 was released ( JRuby Download ) .
All JRuby 1.3 users are advised to uprade to 1.3.1 as it fixes a bug introduced in 1.3 , and also a recently discovered DoS in BigDecimal .
MacRuby also continues to improve ( latest status update ) .
Everyone interested in MacRuby or Ruby on the Mac , will find the videos from the recent Ruby on OS X Conference useful .
GemStone 's MagLev Ruby VM is heading towards a broader release sometime in late Q2 or Q3 .
A recent tweet mentions a new improvement :
Uploading MagLev 21782 for Alpha testers .
Contains initial native parser implementation , but it 's not yet isolated into its own environment .
MagLev 's previous approach to parsing Ruby code was to use an instance of MRI that parses the Ruby code and turns it into a ParseTree s-expr .
Finally , Brian Ford was interviewed about RubySpec , the huge set of specs that is crucial for all alternative Ruby implementations .
Gameplay
Furnace Creek is a 3 - Point Attack / Defend map , similar to Gravel Pit .
When both Capture Point A and B have been captured by BLU , Capture Point C unlocks .
Team coordination is required as there are two points to defend and two points to capture at the start of the round .
Environment
Furnace Creek features a custom desert environment designed by Nineaxis and developed by Youme and Snipergen .
Most noticable is the custom sunset sky , with smaller details such as a new set of cacti to catch your eye .
The " spytech " of the map is also custom , a solar - powered laser , a combination of a parabolic solar array , an energy rod , and of course , a laser .
The Plot
The villains at Reliable Excavation Demolition have a new idea on how to demolish their enemies .
It 's the Solar Laser Unbuilding Gun , or S.L.U.G. , a solar powered laser capable of destroying pretty much anything .
Builders League United is determined to stop them .
The S.L.U.G .
The Solar Laser Unbuilding Gun ( or S.L.U.G. ) is a large ray gun mounted on top of a tower at Capture Point C .
It is powered by a field of heliostats behind it that comprise the parabolic solar array .
Power is fed to the laser through the Energy Rod inside the tower .
The S.L.U.G. reaches maximum power at sunset .
Is The Cheesecake Factory Gross ?
A week or so ago , the food writer Michael Ruhlman mocked Kelly Alexander for praising The Cheesecake Factory on NPR .
In response , Alexander laid down a wager : Ruhlman had to go to The Cheesecake Factory , order the miso salmon that so impressed Alexander , and try it .
If Ruhlman could honestly say " it does n't rock , " Alexander would purchase 15 copies of his new book .
Ruhlman lost .
Not only did the miso salmon rock , but so too did the crispy beef .
The spaghetti carbonara and chicken piccata Ruhlman 's party ordered were also pretty good .
And of course they were .
The Cheesecake Factory is n't accidentally popular .
They spend millions each year on food research .
They have access to a tremendous quantity of data on consumer preferences .
They have the money to test new products and experiment with new dishes and refine their flavors .
They have central processing plants where food is par fried and broken down with sugar and salt injections .
People should read David Kessler 's
The End of Overeating to get an idea of the resources that go into creating the flavors for chain dishes .
They 're not screwing around .
Foodies have an unfortunate tendency to alight on a Unified Field Theory of Corporate Food :
It 's bad for the environment and bad for workers and bad for animals and bad for waistlines and , above all that , a fraud , because it also tastes bad .
This would be convenient , if true .
If people were n't actually enjoying what they were eating , then getting them to change their eating habits would be pretty easy .
But it 's not true , of course .
They keep going back to the Cheesecake Factory because , well , they like it .
Which is not to say they 're operating off of perfect information .
The Cheesecake Factory is notoriously tight - lipped about their nutritional information .
Unlike most chains , their Web site does n't offer the data .
But in Washington State , calorie disclosure laws force chains to make that information accessible on request .
One resident scanned in the information and sent it to Calorie Lab .
Which gives us some insight into what 's going on here .
If I had gone to the Cheesecake Factory with the intention of ordering relatively healthfully , it 's pretty likely that the miso salmon would have ended up on my plate .
A heart - healthy fish with a soy - based glaze ?
What could be better ?
A lot , as it turns out .
On first glance , I would have figure the salmon for the lightest entree , followed by the chicken piccata , the carbonara , and the crispy beef .
Not so .
The salmon weighs in at 1,673 calories -- which is to say , a bit more than 75 percent of the food an adult male should eat in a day .
The piccata is a comparably slim 1,385 calories .
The crispy beef is 1,528 calories .
And the carbonara ?
2,191 .
The answer might be that someone looking for a healthful meal should n't go to the Cheesecake Factory .
But insofar as you 're already there , or your family wants to go there , making a good decision is n't a particularly straightforward proposition .
This is why the obesity crisis is such a tough issue : Calories are delicious .
The Cheesecake Factory is n't doing anything wrong , either ethically or culinarily .
Human beings are wired to prefer abundance , salt , fat , sugar , and value .
The Cheesecake Factory is giving people the whole package .
Changing people 's eating habits so that type two diabetes do n't become the new chubby would be easy if the food was actually repulsive or the value was bad or it was all , in some other way , a trick .
But it 's not .
The food is enjoyable .
The value is incredible .
The cost is long - term , and remembering that we might get diabetes down the road is pretty hard when eons of evolutionary wiring are telling us to eat this stuff now now now now it 's right here now now !
People go to the Cheesecake Factory because they like being there , not because they 're being deceived .
The only catch is that they really do n't know how bad the food is for them .
Study after study shows we wildly underestimate caloric load of our foods , and we underestimate by more as the meal becomes larger .
It 's not clear that nutritional information on menus would actually change eating habits .
But it would at least give people a place to start .
Diners know what they like .
They know how much money they 'll have to pay to purchase it .
No reason they should n't also know what it 's going to cost their waistline .

• Redknapp worked with him at Pompey and Southampton • Sunderland have agreed £ 12 m fee for the striker
Harry Redknapp has confirmed he wants to sign Peter Crouch from Portsmouth .
The Tottenham Hotspur manager faces competition from Sunderland and Fulham but hopes his experience of working with the striker at Southampton and Portsmouth will enable him to convince the England international to move to White Hart Lane .
Portsmouth have agreed a £ 12 m fee with Sunderland for Crouch , who has held talks with the Wearside club but is believed to want to play in London .
He is due to make a decision on his future this week after talks with all interested parties .
" It seems Portsmouth want to sell and if that is the case , Peter is a player I 'm definitely interested in , " Redknapp said .
" He has played for me twice before and I know what a good player he is .
" I have not spoken to Peter Storrie [ the executive chairman ] at Pompey and there are other clubs involved but it seems like a bit of a free - for - all .
I 'm looking to make one or two signings and he is someone I would love to bring in . "
If Crouch joins Tottenham he would have the chance to re-form his partnership with Jermain Defoe , which was a success at Portsmouth .
Defoe said : " Peter is a great person to play alongside and it would be fantastic if we can get him . "
Yet somehow , it ’s OK to pay $ 130 million to two people .
Maybe I just do n’t understand the newfangled , fancy - schmancy accounting methods of Wall Street but it strikes me as unthinkable to even ask for exceptions to the bonus limitations when the company is in such a position .
When a business is broke , it ’s broke , right ?
Not unless your people saturate Treasury and play golf with the President .
Does fairness register at all with anyone on Wall Street ?
Or the White House ?
Do they all think that people in the rest of the country find this acceptable ?
Sadly , it does n’t appear as they they care .

Chipkarten - Syndikate und Gesundheitsfilz : Krankhaftes Interessengestrüpp
Vertrauen im 260 - Milliarden - Gesundheitssektor spielt noch immer eine große Rolle .
Durch Schlamperei , Parteienzank und Indiskretion werden die Patienten zunehmend verunsichert .
BERLIN taz | Da flattert mir ein Brief ins Haus : Meine Krankenkasse hätte gern ein biometrisches Gesichtsbild von mir - für die neue , ausschließlich Vorteile bringende elektronische Gesundheitskarte .
Ich könne es gleich über die Website hochladen , steht in dem Papier .
An meiner Redlichkeit , dass ich tatsächlich ein Foto abliefere , das mich selbst zeigt , scheint bei meiner Kasse niemand zu zweifeln .
Ich widerstehe nur mühsam der Versuchung , ein Bild von Karl Lauterbach hochzuladen .
Früher , lange bevor sich die systemrelevanten Börsenhasardeure ihr frisches Zockergeld vom Staat erpressten , warb eine deutsche Bank mal damit , dass Vertrauen der Anfang von allem sei .
Während heute derartige Werbung kaum mehr ein müdes Lächeln bei den potenziellen Opfern hervorzaubern könnte , spielt das Buhlen um Vertrauen im 260 - Milliarden - Gesundheitssektor noch immer eine große Rolle .
Das Gezerre um den Gesundheitsfonds und der Parteienzank jenseits von Sachpolitik hatten den geneigten Patienten zwar einiges an Illusionen geraubt , aber die Galionsfigur des Vertrauensmanagements zwischen Patientenvolk und Krankheitsverwaltern ist von jeher Ministerin Ulla Schmidt , dem hypnotischen rheinischen Singsang sei Dank .
CONSTANZE KURZ Die Autorin ist Sprecherin des Chaos Computer Clubs .
Sie kündigte die Einführung der elektronischen Gesundheitskarte für den 1 .
April an - allerdings für das Jahr 2008 .
Vermutlich war der Termin ähnlich ernst zu nehmen wie der Weltuntergang der Zeugen Jehovas : eigentlich immer gleich um die Ecke .
Das mit der Chipkarte ist terminlich zwar weit hinter dem Plan , war aber kein Aprilscherz : Die macht jetzt Ernst .
Die Parallelen zum Finanzkasino sind bestechend .
Im Gespann mit Chipkartensyndikaten , Gesundheitsfilzokraten und im Interessengestrüpp verirrten Politikerdarstellern ziehen die Krankenkassen den Karren der elektronischen Krankenkarte mit den ihr anvertrauten Patientendaten immer tiefer in den Sumpf .
In der gerade laufenden Testphase des geldfressenden Gesundheitsdatenabenteuers setzte einer der Technikdienstleister nun neue Maßstäbe : Ausgerechnet eine Tochter der Bundesdruckerei mit dem passenden Namen " D - Trust " verschlampte den digitalen Schlüssel , mit dem die Chipkarten gesegnet werden , die jeder Arzt in der Testregion zum Datenabruf braucht .
Viele der Probekarten waren mit einem Schlag mausetot .
Den betroffenen Ärzten ist damit ihr elektronischer Rezeptblock abhandengekommen , und abrechnen können sie auch nicht mehr .
Wäre dies der Echtbetrieb , hätten 140.000 Heilberufler ein richtiges Problem , denn alle ausgegebenen Karten müssten erneuert werden .
Die Bundesdruckerei , erst kürzlich per Rückverstaatlichung aus der Organbank der Privatisierungstaliban errettet , ist bei Bürgerdatenhortung ganz vorne mit dabei .
Biometrischer Reisepass , elektronischer Perso , Krankenkarte , Heilberufsausweise und Patientennummer - alle Zentralerfassungsprojekte in einem Haus .
In dem war übrigens neulich Hausdurchsuchung , wegen Bestechung .
Skyhook now employs a fleet of 500 drivers to feed a database that spans North America , Asia and Europe .
The landscape of signals changes constantly as people and businesses set up and take down wireless networks , so the scanning process never ends .
Each Skyhook car contains a laptop outfitted with antennas and equipment that sends out short blasts of radio waves , called probe requests , to detect nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi networks .
The system calculates the source of the signals based on their strength and the location of the car .
That information is logged in the Skyhook database , which includes more than 100 million wireless networks and 700,000 cellular towers .
Skyhook ’s big break came in August 2007 when Steven P. Jobs , Apple ’s chief executive , requested a meeting with the company .
Mr. Morgan said he initially deleted Mr. Jobs ’s voice mail message , dismissing it as a prank , but soon realized his mistake .
Since then , Apple has sold 37 million iPhones and iPod Touches worldwide , all with Skyhook ’s software on them .
Mr. Morgan declined to detail specifics of Skyhook ’s financial agreement with Apple , other than to say that his company collects a commission for each device sold .
When an iPhone owner starts up an application that involves location  like the restaurant finder Urbanspoon or the forecast service WeatherBug  the phone calculates whether it is likely to get the best and fastest information from its own GPS chip or from Skyhook ’s system .
Skyhook says it can provide a fix on location in seconds , versus up to a minute for GPS , although Skyhook is less useful in areas with few Wi -Fi networks .
Skyhook checks a list of nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers against its database and triangulates the device ’s location within 30 to 60 feet .
The company says it is not connecting to those Wi -Fi networks , just detecting their presence .
( As a backup , the iPhone can also use cell tower information from Google . )
Any new access points and cell towers detected by the iPhone are automatically added to the Skyhook database , making it , in Mr. Morgan ’s words , “ self - healing . ”
This bleach blonde badass bitch has fantastic , but fake , 34D tits .
Christina Chaos has an attitude to match her style .
She ’s got a tight pink snatch , a pierced clit and tattoos in places that would make your mom blush !
And those knee socks …
I would n’t kick her out of the bed .

PERUGIA , Italy ( Reuters ) -
An American university student on trial for the murder of a fellow British student testified on Friday that police had beaten her and suggested to her what she should say under interrogation .
Amanda Knox , 21 , an exchange student from the University of Washington , is on trial along with her Italian boyfriend in connection with the death in November 2007 of Meredith Kercher .
Both women were foreign students at the University of Perugia when Kercher ’s semi-naked body was found in the apartment she shared with Knox .
Prosecutors say she was stabbed in the neck when Knox , her boyfriend Rafaelle Sollecito and a third person tried to involve her in an orgy .
Knox and Sollecito say they are innocent .
“ The declarations ( to police investigators ) were taken against my will , ” she told the court , speaking in English , on the first day she testified since the trial began in January .
“ Everything I said was said in confusion and under pressure and was suggested by the police and the prosecutor , ” she said .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
A third suspect , 21 - year - old Rudy Guede , was sentenced to 30 years in prison late in 2008 for complicity in rape and murder at a separate trial in the case .
Asked if Kercher had been raped before she died , Knox answered “ I do n’t know . ”
“ Then why did you say that to police ? ” a lawyer asked her .
“ Under pressure , I imagined many different things .
Because when I was questioned by police they suggested that she had been ( raped ) , ” Knox said .
“ To make you say this , did they ( the police ) hit you ? ” the lawyer asked her
“ Yes , ” she said .
The trial has attracted wide media attention , particularly in Britain .
The trial is expected to go on for months .
If convicted , Knox could be sentenced to 30 years in prison .

Kids to receive untested shots which include ingredient linked to Gulf War Syndrome
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Friday , July 24 , 2009
Around 12,000 U.S. children will be used as guinea pigs for an experimental swine flu vaccine known to contain the dangerous ingredient squalene , which has been directly linked with cases of Gulf War Syndrome and a host of other debilitating diseases .
According to a report in the Oklahoman , 12,000 children nationwide will partake in “ fast - tracked studies ” to test the side - effects of the untested swine flu vaccine in trials set to begin next month .
“ The trials will test the vaccine ’s effectiveness and whether or not it has negative side effects in patients , ” states the report .
Since less than 100 children in the U.S. die from regular seasonal flu each year , a reasonable estimate would be that around 100 children will die from swine flu over the course of the next year .
So in effect , the authorities will vaccinate millions of children in order to try and prevent 100 deaths .
If the mass vaccination program mirrors the previous swine flu outbreak of 1976 then the vaccine is likely to kill more people than the actual virus .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Furthermore , since the swine flu vaccine includes squalene , a dangerous adjuvant that contributed to Gulf War Syndrome cases , there ’s little doubt that it will lead to debilitating lifelong diseases far more deadly than the swine flu virus itself for thousands of children if a mass vaccination campaign is conducted .
According to Meryl Nass , M.D. , “ A novel feature of the two H1N1 vaccines being developed by companies Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline is the addition of squalene - containing adjuvants to boost immunogenicity and dramatically reduce the amount of viral antigen needed .
This translates to much faster production of desired vaccine quantities . ”
“ Research shows that squalene is the experimental anthrax vaccine ingredient that caused devastating autoimmune diseases and deaths for many Gulf War veterans from the US , UK , and Australia , yet it continues in use today and for new vaccines development in labs , ” writes Stephen Lendman .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
According to award - winning investigative journalist Gary Matsumoto , there ’s a “ close match between the squalene - induced diseases in animals and those observed in humans injected with this oil : rheumatoid arthritis , multiple sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus . ”
“ There are now data in more than two dozen peer - reviewed scientific papers , from ten different laboratories in the US , Europe , Asia and Australia , documenting that squalene - based adjuvants can induce autoimmune diseases in animals … observed in mice , rats , guinea pigs and rabbits .
Sweden ’s Karolinska Institute has demonstrated that squalene alone can induce the animal version of rheumatoid arthritis .
The Polish Academy of Sciences has shown that in animals , squalene alone can produce catastrophic injury to the nervous system and the brain .
The University of Florida Medical School has shown that in animals , squalene alone can induce production of antibodies specifically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus , ” writes Matsumoto .
Micropaleontologist Dr. Viera Scheibner , who conducted research into the adverse effects of adjuvants in vaccines , wrote the following about squalene .
Squalene “ contributed to the cascade of reactions called “ Gulf War syndrome .
( GIs developed ) arthritis , fibromyalgia , lymphadenopathy , rashes , photosensitive rashes , malar rashes , chronic fatigue , chronic headaches , abnormal body hair loss , non-healing skin lesions , aphthous ulcers , dizziness , weakness , memory loss , seizures , mood changes , neuropsychiatric problems , anti-thyroid effects , anaemia , elevated ESR ( erythrocyte sedimentation rate ) , systemic lupus erythematosus , multiple sclerosis , ALS , Raynaud ’s phenomenon , Sjorgren ’s syndrome , chronic diarrhea , night sweats and low - grade fever . ”
Efforts on behalf of authorities to prepare the public for a mass vaccination campaign , which could even be made mandatory if the crisis escalates , have been intensifying in recent weeks .
And yet , as Richard Halvorsen , a Central London GP and medical director of BabyJabs , a children ’s immunisation service , writes in the London Times this week , all indications are that the swine flu vaccine will have the least effect in those most at risk from swine flu – children , the elderly and people with underlying health problems .
In his article , Mass flu vaccination would be madness , Halvorsen writes , “ Is all this really necessary ?
To start with , swine flu is far milder than we first feared , so the case for vaccinating millions of healthy adults against a disease that is no more unpleasant than a bad cold is questionable , ” adding , “ There is no good evidence that the vaccine helps those with chronic health problems or pregnant women .
However , we do know that the immunisation offers no more than a modest benefit in the elderly ; indeed , the effectiveness of the vaccine is known to decrease sharply after 70 years of age . ”
“ We have experience of mass vaccination against swine flu from which lessons should be learnt .
In America in 1976 a vaccine was offered to the whole population to prevent the spread of an epidemic of swine flu .
Millions were rapidly immunised , but the vaccination campaign was stopped after a rise in cases of Guillain - Barré syndrome ( GBS ) among recipients of the vaccine .
GBS is an autoimmune disorder that causes paralysis of the arms or legs or , rarely , the whole body ; the sufferer usually makes a complete recovery , but some suffer permanent paralysis and a few die .
Research later estimated that there was one case of GBS caused by every 100,000 swine flu vaccines given .
If the current vaccine caused a similar rate of cases , then we could expect hundreds of people to get GBS , some of whom will suffer permanent paralysis or die . ”
Given that the vaccine contains an ingredient directly linked with a plethora of horrific diseases , will you take measures to protect your child from a mass vaccination program ?
What if the government decrees a mandatory vaccination program and tries to enforce it at gunpoint , as health authorities have already indicated could happen ?
With increasing public awareness of the dangers of vaccines , allied with the bizarre eugenics policies embraced by people like John Holdren , Obama ’s top science advisor , it seems inevitable that millions will refuse to comply with a mass vaccination program even if the government attempts to implement it by force .

Chinese parents ’ preference for sons has given rise to a brewing social problem .
With the advent of inexpensive ultrasounds , far more boys than girls are born in China – which has in turn given rise to a growing number of rootless , unmarried men .
The “ missing women ” problem may have also contributed to the U.S. housing and credit bubbles , new research suggests .
Through the first half of this decade , America bought far more than it produced , running up an a massive tab with its trading counterparts .
In an effort to explain why this had happened , then - Fed governor Ben Bernanke in 2005 identified a “ global savings glut . ”
Developing countries – China in particular – were saving more .
Those savings were getting put into long - term debt , pushing interest rates lower .
L.A. Lakers fans celebrated their NBA championship victory Sunday night ( June 14 ) by rioting outside the Staples Center in Los Angeles .
Eyewitness reports said that the police officers at the scene were being belted with rocks and bottles .
There are also reports of fans starting fires , although it is n’t clear at this stage whether those fires included buildings or vehicles .
One unconfirmed report says that at least one police vehicle has been set on fire .
Live footage at 9:15 pm local time from a local television station clearly shows rioters attacking signs and shop fronts .
Police control of the area at this time would appear to be limited , with vehicle traffic having to turn away as they approach the rioters .
More when we have it .

It may not be completely over , but we ’re probably going to call it a night for updates .
If there is anything new , we ’ll update as it becomes available .
Yesterday , I wrote about the top reasons your vacation can be spoiled – today ’s news is something that most certainly was not in that lineup .
A Serbian woman is demanding a full refund of her Greek vacation , not because of bed bugs or a noisy room , but because their room was next to a room occupied by 2 girls enjoying themselves on their balcony ( naked ) .
Apparently , these girls were out on their balcony so often , that her husband suddenly had a similar urge to soak up some sun – and just so happened to do so whenever these girls were outside .
Needless to say , this did n’t go down too well with his wife , and the source claims he even hurt his neck from enjoying the view so much .
No word on whether the couple are still together , or whether the woman will actually get her money back .

The voters had declined to finance new jail construction , and so , in 1993 , Arpaio , vowing that no troublemakers would be released on his watch because of overcrowding , procured a consignment of Army - surplus tents and had them set up , surrounding by barbed wire , in an industrial area in southwest Phoenix .
" I put them up next to the dump , the dog pound , the waste - disposal plant , " he told me .
Phoenix is an open - air blast furnace for much of the year .
Temperatures inside the tents hit a hundred and thirty - five degrees .
[ From William Finnegan 's " Sheriff Joe , " in The New Yorker , July 20 , 2009 .
Registry required for online access to full content . ]
The Guadalupe raid did have a chilling effect .
It began the day before a Catholic - church confirmation ceremony — a big deal in Guadalupe — was scheduled to take place in the village plaza , and although the children had prepared for months , a number of them were afraid to come out , and missed their own confirmations .
America 's toughest sheriff is , as ever , unapologetic .
Over lunch in New York , he told me that he does n't mind the effect he has .
" If they 're afraid to go to church , that 's good . "
For the record , pretty much every aspect of the treatment of prisoners in Maricopa County would be prohibited under the Geneva Conventions if they were prisoners of war .
America 's recent record for treatment of prisoners of war is hardly exemplary , but at least people notice .
Other choice aspects of Arpaio 's system : • A neon sign reading VACANCY on a guard tower . •
Chain gangs .
Including the world 's first female chain gangs .
And then juvenile chain gangs . •
Deprivation as a simultaneous means of punishment and cost-cutting .
Luxuries banned by Arpaio include : cigarettes , hot lunches , coffee , salt , and pepper .
Meals were cut to only two a day , and the cost of those meals was reduced to thirty cents per meal .
( He told William Finnegan that it cost more to feed the dogs than the inmates . ) •
Black - and - white striped uniforms , " comically " old - fashioned , combined with pink underwear , pink flip - flops , socks , and pink handcuffs .
It 's worth bearing in mind that this does not apply only to convicted criminals — anyone arrested and awaiting trial is still a part of this system .
More on how easy it is to get arrested later .
So let 's say you 've been arrested in Maricopa County .
You 're half - starved , eating food that 's unlikely even to be fit for the dogs to touch .
You 're wearing clothes intended to humiliate you , living in tents that are dangerously hot , working on a chain gang that 's part labour , part contribution to a theatre of cruelty that rivals the Bloody Code of eighteenth - century Britain for its viciousness , without the Bloody Code 's rarity of application or scope for mercy .
At least it can't get worse , right ?
Wait , no , it totally can .
Because you could well find yourself Tasered and beaten while strapped into a " restraint chair " or held in solitary confinement .
( If you have a strong stomach , check out the " Blood on Arpaio 's Hands " section of arpaio.com , a site dedicated to trying to get him out of office . )
According to Finnegan 's article , Maricopa County was sued nearly 2,200 times between 2004 and 2008 .
In that same period , the county jails of New York , Chicago , Los Angeles and Houstondrew 43 lawsuits .
Maricopa County has paid an estimated $ 43 million in compensation to victims and their families .
The National Commission on Correction Health Care has withdrawn Maricopa County 's accreditation , and a federal judge found that conditions are unconstitutional for pre-trial detainees .
But what of the officers who inflicted violent abuses on helpless prisoners ?
Well , a lot of them have been promoted .
Arpaio has never so much as hinted at regret .
Though this is only a light summary , I suspect you have an impression now of the unconscionably brutal and deliberately , overtly degrading treatment of Maricopa County 's prisoners .
So let 's move on to that whole " police state " thing .
He has instigated raids on the homes of journalists who published stories critical of him .
Citizens attending public meetings have been arrested for " disorderly conduct " — for clapping .
Opposing Arpaio is :
He has four thousand employees , and three thousandmembers .
It 's still 2009 , do n't worry — I know this stuff seems like it should be from 1809 at the latest , but this is all very much now .
And where things get really into the morekind of neo-fascistic horror is Arpaio 's crusade against — and I 'm sure you can guess what the next words in this sentence will be — " illegal immigrants .
"
His deputies regularly raid Latino towns and communities .
He and his officers claim thirty thousand arrests of undocumented immigrants , and proof of residency status must be shown to visit inmates at the prison .
Arpaio , in collusion with the county attorney , has chosen to interpret a state law against human smuggling , intended to target the smugglers ( known as coyotes ) in an impressively creative way , indicting the coyotes ' cargo as co-conspirators in smuggling themselves across the border .
Which makes it a class 4 felony and the suspects ineligible for bond , thereby condemning them to Maricopa 's dangerous and unhealthy prison system .
When Arpaio and his men come to town , anyone with brown skin is stopped and questioned on their immigration status , in what the sheriff 's office calls " crime prevention " sweeps .
Or they come through after midnight — even in towns like Mesa , where the mayor and police chief alike are profoundly opposed to such actions , and in Guadalupe , where the population is almost entirely Native American and Latino , but almost no - one is foreign - born , because it 's an old , well - established town .
The raid there mentioned in Finnegan 's article found only nine undocumented immigrants , so instead the sheriff and his men issued traffic tickets , for charges including " improper use of horn .
" I 'll close my summary with another quotation from .
The article alone contains a lot of things I have left out , including much of the fear he instills in individuals , but this will give you an idea of it : This is the modern America , where children are afraid to go to church , and pre-trial detainees are kept in prison conditions that would qualify as war crimes if used to hold prisoners of war .
But hey , Arpaio 's got a book deal and he 's been on Conan and the Colbert Report , so that makes him an American success story , right ?

The Count of Ghent has a son by the name of Gerard .
On his 13th birthday , his father has to leave on a crusade , but Gerard refuses to go with him to the Holy Land .
He beats his father to death and from that moment of everyone calls him Gerard the Devil ...
He builds a castle with a dark crypt and a Red Tower , where he lives with his wife and son , also named Gerard .
The boy has a dark skin and black hair and that 's why people call him The Moor .
Gerard the Devil dislikes the colour of his son's skin and hair .
So he tortures his first wife to dead in the Red Tower , and his second , and his third , and fourth , and fifth , and sixth wife too ...
Gerard the Moor falls in love with a young girl that had to be the seventh wife of Gerard the Devil .
' Go to the Red Tower , my son , ' says the father .
' I have arranged an overseas honeymoon for you !'
In the Tower there are two sailors waiting to tie up his hands and feet , put him in a bag and throw him in the water .
But the son does n't trust his father and instead of him , it 's Gerard the Devil himself who shows up to pay the murderers .
They mistake the Devil for the Moor and they put him in a bag and throw him in the water .
Gerard the Moor dies at the end of the 13th century and since that moment , every 13th year , a child is born in the Devil 's Castle , as a true son of the Devil .
The castle is cursed , ' cause the ghosts of father and son find no rest and haunt each other forever ...
And also , it was for many years an asylum where dangerous lunatics were imprisoned .
There were many women found in the water near the Red Tower and an old legend says that , before there will be peace in the Devil 's Castle , six times 111 women have to fall or jump or have to be thrown from the Red Tower into the water , hands and feet tied together .
A singer - songwriter was fascinated by these true stories and adopted ' Gerard the Devil ' as his stage name .
Some say he was the reborn Devil .
Some say he made charcoal sketches of the impression on a girl 's face at the moment she reached an orgasm ( and that was the moment when he liked to chop off her head with a chainsaw ) .
The ' newborn ' Gerard the Devil disappeared without leaving a trace ...
Could n't he live with the idea of being a son of the Devil ?
Or did some lunatic with a chainsaw chopped off his head because he or she thought he really was the Devil ?
" This is one of the toughest insurgencies we 've ever fought .
The only thing comparable in modern memory is the Falklands and the Taliban ... is a much tougher enemy .
The number of amputees is now worse than the Falklands despite vast improvements in body armour and medical treatment . "
As the United States celebrates its Independence Day , it 's worth considering just how easily it could have never happened at all .
Here now is a rundown of alternate history stories and essays where the American Revolution turned out very differently .
Advertisement
Compared to the Civil War or World War II , the American Revolution has , for whatever reason , been largely neglected by alternate history writers .
While books like Bring the Jubilee and The Man in the High Castle stand as iconic works that imagine Confederate and Nazi victories respectively , there is no such defining work detailing the particulars of the British maintaining control of their wayward colonies .
Still , there are a number of more obscure short stories and essays ( plus a couple of novels ) that do consider just such a scenario , and they generally take one of the four following forms ...
1. Different historical circumstances prevented the American Revolution completely .
Advertisement
Technically speaking , I could include in this category almost any alternate history where the divergence occurs long before July 4 , 1776 .
For instance , a story about the Roman Empire surviving into the present day would undoubtedly mean European contact with and subsequent colonization of the Americas would have happened far , far differently .
Instead , let 's just focus on stories that explicitly explain how changing history would avert the Revolution .
J.C.D. Clark 's essay " British America : What if there had been no American Revolution ? " argues that increased representation for the colonists , much like the Scottish and Irish parliaments prior to the Act of Union in 1707 , might well have given the Americans a satisfactory level of self - government and made rebellion unnecessary .
The short story " Cops and Robbers " by S.M.
Stirling is set in modern times , but it uses as its setup a world where Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder led Britain to a far more decisive victory in the French and Indian War ( also known as the Seven Years War ) .
This then allowed the British to maintain control over their colonies for a considerably longer period .
Writing just over a hundred years ago , Joseph Edgar Chamberlain imagined a plethora of alternate scenarios in his book The Ifs of History .
He imagined a French colonization of Plymouth Bay that would have allowed the Dutch settlements of New Holland to survive , preventing the colonial unity that made the success of the Revolution possible .
He wondered what might have happened if Columbus had not slightly altered course while crossing the Atlantic in 1492 , which would have led to landfall on what is now Florida , likely shifting Spanish colonial interest towards North America .
He also looked at the possibility of Elizabeth I marrying and giving birth to an heir , which he believed would have prevented the rise of Puritanism and thus likely averted the Revolution .
Not all of the changes he described would have appeared quite so momentous at the time , as he considered the tale of a colonial mother deciding in 1746 whether or not to enlist her son in the British navy .
The mother was Mary Washington , the son was George Washington , and if the decision had been " yes " then the rest would have been a very different history than what we know .

2. Diplomacy prevailed .
This category focuses on situations where the colonies were on the brink of war , but ultimately were pacified thanks to brilliant diplomacy .
Caleb Carr 's essay " William Pitt the Elder and the Avoidance of the American Revolution " argues Pitt could have prevented the American Revolution if he had refused his ennoblement as the Earl of Chatham in 1766 , which would have allowed him to stay in the House of Commons .
Carr feels
Pitt stood the best chance of preventing the various oppressive acts and exorbitant taxes that so angered the colonists , and in doing so might have prevented the rebellion .
Advertisement
In a similar vein , Roger Thompson imagined in his essay what might have happened " If I had been … the Earl of Shelburne in 1762 - 5 . "
The crux of Thompson 's argument holds that , if the Earl of Shelburne had been in charge of the peace negotiations following the Seven Years '
War , he might have allowed France to regain control of Canada , which would have in turn removed the need for much of the taxation of the colonies .
One of the few full - fledged novels to tackle the subject , The Two Georges was cowritten by alternate history grandmaster Harry Turtledove and , for some awesome reason , Jaws actor Richard Dreyfuss .
The titular Georges are , naturally enough , King George III and George Washington , who managed to negotiate a peaceful redress to American grievances that allowed the colonies to remain part of the British Empire .
The theft two centuries later of a painting recording their legendary meeting sets the book 's plot in motion , which takes the detective protagonist from New Liverpool ( or , as we would call it , Los Angeles ) on a winding tour throughout the North American Union all the way to their version of Washington D.C. , the colonial capital Victoria .

3 . The British won the war .
This really should be the easiest kind of alternate American Revolution story to write , considering just how unlikely the colonial victory arguably was .
Beyond the superior military might of the British Empire , there was also the fact that not all Americans supported the cause of independence ( although a majority of them did ) , and even then not all of the patriots were properly trained to fight .
But beyond these general advantages the British had , there were several specific instances where the British could have triumphed and , in the process , likely ended the rebellion .

A major turning point recognized by multiple alternate history authors is the Battle of Saratoga in 1777 .
The month - long series of skirmishes , bookended by two bloody battles , saw the decisive defeat of British General John Burgoyne 's army .
Burgoyne had previously boasted that his troops would be able to split the colonies in half and effectively end the revolt .
He was defeated largely due to the tactical brilliance and bold action of a brilliant young general by the name of Benedict Arnold .
In H. Beam Piper 's " He Walked Around the Horses " , Burgoyne 's victory at Saratoga is credited at the effective end of the American Revolution .
A similar result is seen in Robert Sobel 's For Want of a Nail … ; If Burgoyne Had Won at Saratoga , which takes the form of an alternate history textbook detailing the duel histories of the Confederation of North America and the United States of Mexico .
Speaking of Benedict Arnold , Robert Cowley looked at how Arnold might have acted differently slightly later in his notorious career , as he detailed in his essay " Benedict Arnold Wins the Revolutionary War for Britain . "
Paul Park 's " The Blood of Peter Francisco " takes place in the early 20th century in a world where the British routed the Continental Army at Yorktown in 1781 , which in our history was the battle that signaled the inevitability of American victory .

Thomas Fleming is even more ambitious in his piece " Unlikely Victory : Thirteen Ways the Americans Could have Lost the Revolution " , which examines the entire chain of events that made American success possible and then pulls out thirteen of the weakest links .
This includes how the Patriots expertly turned the Boston Massacre into a rallying cry for anti-British sentiment , how a fortunate fog covered the American retreat from the Battle of Long Island and prevented their capture at the hands of the British , and how George Washington 's charisma was all that stopped the disgruntled Continental Army from marching on Congress to demand their pay , all of which Fleming considers the results if these had played out differently .
Perhaps the most interesting sub - sub - sub - genre in this category concerns the ultimate fate of George Washington .
In 1974 , Robert Wallace Russell wrote and staged the play Washington Shall Hang : A Drama of Lost Revolution , which imagines the general being put on trial for treason .
Roland J. Green 's vignette " Exile 's Greeting " looks at the HMS Bellerophon as it prepares to transport an important political prisoner to the infamous island of St. Helena , which in our history was the final home of the defeated Napoleon Bonaparte .
I suppose my inclusion of that story in this particular paragraph pretty much gives away the big twist as to which mysterious general is being exiled to St. Helena .

4. Something utterly crazy happened .
Let 's be honest here .
( And , by " honest " , I of course mean " borderline jingoistic in a tongue - in - cheek manner . " )
The American Revolution was a historical inevitability and no amount of expert political maneuvering by Pitt the Elder or brilliant strategizing by General Burgoyne could have prevented or defeated it .
So how , exactly , could you plausibly write a story where the Revolution turned out differently ?
With magic and dragons , that 's how !

Orson Scott Card preferred the former option in his Tales of Alvin Maker series , in which almost everybody has a " knack " , or ability to do at least one thing absolutely perfectly , and a few people have particularly powerful knacks , including the title character .
The existence of such powers has greatly altered the course of human history , and what would have been the United States is divided into a colonial New England controlled by the heirs of Oliver Cromwell 's English Republic , a monarchy on the east coast ruled by the exiled House of Stuart , and a much smaller independent America where Native Americans play a far greater role .
Mike Resnick upped the ante considerably in terms of awesomeness when he titled his alternate history book Dragon America : Revolution .
The book is set in a world where the ecology of the Americas is greatly different from that of the Old World , as it is dominated by , well , dragons .
For some reason , the Revolution is close to failure in this universe , which forces George Washington to send Daniel Boone westward in search of the legendary dragons that could be their last hope for victory against the British .

I 'll admit I 'm probably cheating a little bit by including this book , as the American Revolution does ultimately succeed thanks to the dragons , but I have one very simple rule in life - I will never pass up an opportunity to talk about team - ups between George Washington and dragons to defeat the British .
I can't think of anything that better encapsulates the American way .

Insurance.com has come up with a list of the 10 most dangerous things eat behind the wheel .
Seriously .
Topping the list is the one thing we 've all shoved into our faces during the morning commute .
Before we get to that , though , we should explain why Insurance.com thought this was important enough to investigate .
Hagerty Classic
Insurance , the folks who let you cover that ' 57 Chevrolet Bel Air or 1935 Dusenberg SJ in your garage , ran an applicant through the DMV .
It discovered the guy had a restraining order barring him from having food within his reach while driving .
Apparently the guy had been in several accidents while stuffing his maw .
Wait , it gets better ( and by that we mean infuriatingly worse ) .
Insurance.com decided to draw up a list of things you absolutely , positively should not sip , slurp , chomp or chew behind the wheel .
Here from the home office in Cleveland are the " The 10 Most Dangerous Foods to Eat While Driving " .
It should be said this is by no means scientific ; it 's a rundown of things actuaries do n't think you ought to have in your hand ( or mouth ) when driving .
That said , the list is more frightening than the repair bill we got when our Jag needed a transmission rebuild .
1. Coffee .
It 's hot .
It can spill .
That 's bad .
That said , we 're guilty of this .
So are you .
Admit it .
__ 2 . Hot soup__ .
It 's hot .
It can spill .
That 's bad .
__ 3 . Tacos__ .
Very messy .
__ 4 . Chili__ .
It 's hot .
It can spill .
That 's bad .
And it 's very messy .
__ 5 . Hamburgers__ .
Greasy hands and a steering wheel do not mix .
__ 6 . Barbecued food__ .
Um , that should go without saying .
__ 7 . Fried chicken__ .
You think burgers are greasy ?
__ 8 . Jelly or cream - filled donuts__ .
Ever bitten into one and not had it squirt all over the place ?
__ 9 . Soft drinks__ .
Big threat of spillage , says Insurance.com , and unacceptable risk of " fizz up your nose . "
Huh ?
__ 10 . Chocolate__ .
It melts on your fingers , which makes a mess on the steering wheel .
Allow us to make a special shout out here to item number two : Soup .
Soup ?
Are you kidding ?
Who in their right mind thinks it 's OK to eat soup while driving a two - ton projectile ?
And who the hell is trying to spoon chili down their gullet in traffic ?
Good lord , people .
It 's a CAR .
Do not take that call from Joe in accounting , do not try to read that Brad Pitt cover story in Wired and do not try to munch a freakin ' taco .
Just DRIVE .
Soup ?
To quote the great Tom Wolfe , " It 's enough to make the Fool Killer hang his head in shame at the missed opportunities . "

In decades past , the town mullahs decried the use of megaphones during the call to prayer .
Now they have embraced the technology in Pakistan .
In every city the loud blare of the muezzin echoes throughout the streets , although they rarely call out in unison .
For centuries Muslims have bickered over prayer times , and much else .
For the people of Gojra 's Christian Colony , in rural Punjab , the mosque megaphones presented a more worrying proposition .
" These are infidels , killing them is permitted , " screamed one local imam from his mosques as , two weeks ago , a Muslim mob stormed the colony on hearing a rumour , later found to be false , that a Christian had desecrated a copy of the Qur'an .
About a hundred homes were burned to the grown along with nine people , most of whom were burned alive in their dwellings .
Vulnerable minorities are often targeted as a result of petty grievances or property disputes , and Christian Colony residents believe the attack was sponsored by a local businessman keen to take their land .
" There should n't be a double standard .
In our churches and homes ... so many bibles have been burned , " a local priest said .
That principle holds true for those who perished , too .
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan believes the attack was premeditated : " Witnesses said the attackers went about destroying Christians ' houses in a very professional manner and seemed to be trained for carrying out such activities . "
Members of Sipa-e - Sahaba , an outlawed Sunni extremist group that also targets Shias and Sunnis it considers apostate , are thought to be behind the attack .
Heightening this violent drama , Sipa-e - Sahaba 's leader Allama Ali Sher Hyderi was shot dead last week in his home town of Khairpur , northern Sindh , in what appears to be a reprisal killing .
Sipa -e - Sahaba is meant to be banned .
But the Pakistan Ullema Council , a powerful mainstream religious body that is also hostile to Christians , Shias and some Sunni sects , condemned Hyderi 's assassination while religious groups staged protests across the nation .
There have been only muted protests for the Christians of Gojra while many self - confessed champions of the marginalised like Imran Khan have remained silent .
Ever since the forced " Islamisation " of Pakistan under former dictator Zia ul - Haq , fanatical Sunni religious groups have loudly and aggressively pushed an intolerant brand of Islam .
Although they have consistently fared poorly in elections contested by major political parties or not massively rigged in their favour , they are a powerful lobby greatly feared by governments , the public and even the judiciary .
It would be unfair , however , to only blame religious groups for the spreading intolerance .
" Sectarian conflict in Pakistan is the direct consequence of state policies of Islamisation and marginalisation of secular democratic forces , " concludes an International Crisis Group report .
Under Zia , school textbooks were purged of any positive reference to minorities or Muslim traditions considered too pagan .
Students were taught that Pakistan was a global vanguard of Sunni Islam forever threatened by Hindus , Jews and western imperialists .
Pakistan 's penal code was amended to make blasphemy against Islam , including desecration of the Qur'an , a crime under strict penalties including life imprisonment to death .
The Hudood Ordinance left millions of victims of rape exposed to the new crime of adultery while the testimony of non-Muslims was judged to be half the value of a Muslim .
Zia apart , the Pakistan army 's patronage of militancy inspired by chauvinist and xenophobic interpretation of Islam is well known .
The Gojra attack occurred in the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz party heartland .
Even the clerics here pledge allegiance to the Sharif brothers .
Elder sibling Nawaz is the federal opposition leader and , so say the polls , the most popular leader in the country .
Shabaz , the younger Sharif , is Punjab 's chief minister and a noted bureaucrat .
According to one source , federal intelligence agencies had warned the PML - N - controlled Punjab government that a militant group was expected to do an attack on minority communities , but it was ignored .
The Christians of Gojra do n't vote for the PML - N but conservative middle class Muslims do .
For years the party has been a bridge between politicised mainstream religious leaders and the formal political set - up .
That linkage has its origins in Zia 's sweeping Islamisation project .
Amid this sobering tale there are thin slivers of hope .
Most of Gojra 's Christians were given refuge from the mob by their Muslim neighbours .
Perhaps more opportunistically , the ardently secular Muttahida Quami Movement was quick to provide relief and call for the assailants to be punished .
Pressed by the adverse publicity , both the Pakistan and Punjab governments have promised justice to the victims too .
Islamabad says it will hold a judicial inquiry into the incident and push for reforms to the blasphemy laws .
But any significant repeal of these laws will be a daunting task .
" Any government that takes on the project of amending these exploitative laws will have to confront this political Islamist lobby , " noted former federal information minister and leading progressive politician Sherry Rehman .
The Punjab government says it will provide compensation of up to 300,000 to 500,000 rupees , but victims say this is not sufficient recompense for the loss of lives and property .
There were no Pakistan flags fluttering in Gojra on Independence Day , only black ones hoisted on any structure that was lucky enough to survive the attack .
" We 're still waiting for our freedom , if this was our country this would not have happened , " one Gojra resident told a news crew .
Only an active roll - back of Zia 's Islamisation of the state will prevent Pakistan from continued communal disintegration .
Researchers led by Frank Urbaniok of the Canton of Zurich Department of Justice delved into the criminal record of 231 men who were charged with viewing child pornography via a US website .
In the six years before the 2002 police operation , only 1 % were known to have committed a hands - on sex offence .
And only 1 % of the men committed a hands - on sex offence in the six years afterwards .
The study reinforced previous research which found most consumers of Internet child pornography were well - educated and viewed other types of illegal pornography as well , including sexual acts involving animals or violence .
Urbaniok said men who surfed the Web for child pornography were sex offenders , but it should not be automatically assumed that they were a risk for sexually assaulting a child .
“ Our results support the assumption that these consumers , in fact , form a distinct group of sex offenders , ” he said in a press release .
“ Probably , the motivation for consuming child pornography differs from the motivation to physically assault minors .
Furthermore , the recidivism rates of 1 % for hands - on and 4 % for hands - off sex offences were quite low . ”
The study is published by BioMed Central , an online , peer - reviewed journal .
A 2005 paper by Canadian researchers Michael Seto and Angela Eke found that of 201 men charged with child pornography offences , 24 percent had prior offences for sexual contact .
Four percent went on to commit a subsequent sexual offence after being charged or prosecuted .

Washington
GENERAL MOTORS bondholders have until 5 p.m. on Saturday to accept a parsimonious offer to exchange their loans for stock and warrants .
Most likely , enough of the creditors will say no to force G.M. into bankruptcy .
But there is no escaping the long - term damage that has been inflicted on credit markets by the Obama administration ’s attempts to reward the United Auto Workers , one of the president ’s strongest supporters in the last election , while trampling decades of legal precedent regarding owners of corporate debt .
The G.M. debacle is déjà vu all over again .
In the Chrysler bankruptcy arranged by the government in April , bondholders also got short shrift , while the union , which might have received little or nothing in a normal bankruptcy , was awarded 55 percent of the company .
What ’s my interest in this ?
I head a nonprofit group that encourages developing nations to adopt policies that will lead to prosperity  starting with transparency and the rule of law  and hold up America as a model .
Yet in its high - handed dealings with Chrysler and G.M. , the Obama administration reminds me of an irresponsible third - world regime , skirting the law and handing economic prizes to political cronies .
Under the complicated G.M. plan , bondholders  ranging from large institutions to low - income retirees  would receive just 10 percent of the reorganized company , plus warrants that would enable them to get 15 percent more should the company ’s value reach certain levels , in return for their $ 27 billion in loans .
The government , which could end up putting $ 70 billion into G.M. , would initially get 72.5 percent of the company .
If this is not a throwback of straight up racism , then I do n't know what to call it .
More than 60 campers from Northeast Philadelphia were turned away from a private swim club and left to wonder if their race was the reason .
" I heard this lady , she was like , ' Uh , what are all these black kids doing here ? '
She 's like , ' I 'm scared they might do something to my child , ' " said camper Dymire Baylor .
The Creative Steps Day Camp paid more than $ 1900 to The Valley Swim Club .
The Valley Swim Club is a private club that advertises open membership .
But the campers ' first visit to the pool suggested otherwise .
" When the minority children got in the pool all of the Caucasian children immediately exited the pool , " Horace Gibson , parent of a day camp child , wrote in an email .
" The pool attendants came and told the black children that they did not allow minorities in the club and needed the children to leave immediately . "
The next day the club told the camp director that the camp 's membership was being suspended and their money would be refunded .
" I said , ' The parents do n't want the refund .
They want a place for their children to swim , ' " camp director Aetha Wright said .
Campers remain unsure why they 're no longer welcome .
" They just kicked us out .
And we were about to go .
Had our swim things and everything , " said camper Simer Burwell .
read all of it here ...
In this day and age ?
When we think we are advancing racial barriers ?
These small - minded RICH WHITE FOLK had to take it out on minority , inner-city kids ?
Who paid their money and only wanted to swim ?
Those people at that club should be ashamed of themselves and the media should put them on blast , but I doubt if it changes anything .
Prejudice is taught , you are not born with it .
And those folk at that club are on the top of the IGNORANT pole .
Mathematician Jim Propp worries over a concept he ’s been trying , for decades , to digest : Null Salad .
Propp explains :
“ If you have arugula , basil , celery , dandelion , and endive leaves , how many different tossed salads can you make ? ”
That question , or something like it , was asked in a Math Bowl that I participated in back in high school , during my halcyon days as a mathlete .
Actually , “ halcyon days ” are supposed to be calm days , and quiz - show - style math - smackdowns are n’t known for being calm .
It was certainly an un-halcyon moment when my Math Bowl teammates were urgently saying we should buzz in with the answer 32 to that salad question , and I was saying we needed to figure out whether the judges would think that a bowl containing no ingredients at all was a valid salad .
While we were debating the issue , the other team buzzed in with the answer 32 , only to be told “ That is incorrect . ”
Our team immediately buzzed in with the answer 31 , which seemed likely to be the answer the judges were looking for .
We got the points , but I liked the other team ’s answer better .
The idea of an empty salad might seem like a purely mathematical fancy , but half a dozen years later I saw a restaurant menu that offered the null salad , or rather “ Nowt , served with a subtle hint of sod all ” ( for the unbeatable price of 0 pounds and 0 pence ) … .
How low can Ben Stein get ?
Well , we know he ’ll sell himself to sleazy rip - off merchants if the price is right .
But now he ’s penned an anti-Obama column for The American Spectator which is so despicable that it fairly takes one ’s breath away .
Stein calls Obama an “ anti- white ” “ ultra - leftist ” ; he says that the magna cum laude editor of the Harvard Law Review and University of Chicago professor has “ total zero of an academic record ” and a “ complete lack of scholarship ” ; he claims Obama “ has given Iran the go - ahead to have nuclear weapons ” and wants “ active destruction of our interests and our allies and our future ” .
Oh , and Obama “ urgently ” wants to “ take away our freedoms ” , because he “ knows Americans are getting wise and will stop him if he delays at all ” .
This is the kind of stuff which , if it was written by a left - wing commentator about a Republican president , would have Stein screaming about “ treason ” .
It ’s also the kind of thing which should automatically disqualify Stein from writing for the New York Times — as if his creationist propaganda and insane conspiracy - mongering were n’t reason enough .
But I ’ve given up hope at this point .
I do n’t know what Stein did to make himself untouchable at the NYT , but it was surely extremely effective .
What ’s sure is that the Sulzbergers and all other NYT stakeholders should be desperately ashamed at this point that they have anything to do with the man .

ZURICH ( Reuters ) -
The days of secret bank accounts are numbered for U.S. taxpayers and European tax dodgers should also watch out after the United States and Swiss bank UBS AG agreed to settle a tax evasion case .
Details of the deal were not made public after the settlement was initialed Wednesday .
But tax experts expect the settlement to involve the disclosure to U.S. tax authorities of thousands of names of U.S. residents suspected of using secret Swiss accounts to conceal assets , albeit without formally breaching Swiss bank secrecy .
“ It is clear that U.S. citizens that formally believed they could hide money in Switzerland and other offshore centers will now conclude it is not safe , ” said Michael Weinstein , a lawyer at law firm Cole Schotz who is advising UBS clients .
“ The deal is going to force individuals to come forward and reveal those secret accounts voluntarily .
If not , UBS will . ”
UBS has already promised to stop offering offshore accounts to U.S. citizens and is closing down existing undeclared accounts .
Many other Swiss and foreign banks have also already started to kick out U.S. holders of secret accounts or force them to comply , leaving them little room to hide in anticipation of further action by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service .
“ For U.S. taxpayers it is going to be impossible to hide money in Switzerland and it is just a matter of time that this is the case also for Germans and Britons , ” Asher Rubinstein , a partner at law firm Rubinstein & Rubinstein , said .
“ Switzerland will no longer be a tax haven . ”
Tax lawyers say many of UBS ’s competitors are sending letters to U.S. clients asking them to transfer their funds to a U.S. tax - compliant entity .
However , some secret account holders , who range from well - traveled businessmen to Jewish families who had fled hostile countries , could not stomach transferring between 40 and 60 percent of their hidden fortunes to U.S. tax authorities .
“ For every three to four clients that come here , there are one or two who , when we do the numbers , say : I can not write a check that big .
I will take my chances , ” Rubinstein said .
EUROPEAN ACTION ?
UBS Chief Executive Oswald Gruebel said earlier this month he expects the bank ’s tax dispute to prompt action from European governments as well as higher costs for private banks .
“ Other governments will closely watch what is going on there , ” Gruebel told reporters .
“ It is not a very good development for the wealth management industry .
There will be additional costs for compliance , but then , on the other side , one should not help other people to evade taxes . ”
European governments have already been fighting tax dodgers and Germany went as far as to pay for client data stolen at Liechtenstein ’s biggest bank LGT about a year ago .
The affair triggered massive client withdrawals from the tiny banking secrecy stronghold , which has since agreed to be more tax transparent to save its financial industry .
This week , Liechtenstein signed a deal with Britain to push 5,000 investors in Liechtenstein to disclose accounts .
“ It is good that the Swiss government supported the UBS solution , but they have to be aware that there will now also be many similar discussions with other countries , ” said Thomas Borer , a former top Swiss diplomat .
But the devil is in the detail and tax transparency advisers said the UBS settlement could disappoint as it will not likely involve any automatic exchange of information .
Switzerland will do away with its artificial distinction between tax evasion and tax fraud , but will not go as far as totally lifting the veil from its clients ’ accounts .
“ Swiss banks have helped each other to break laws , in the age of globalization , that has to change , ” Raymond Backer , a director at non-profit organization Global Financial Integrity .
“ There is no place for Swiss bank secrecy . ”
Private banks will have to learn to live in a world where bank secrecy is not a competitive advantage , at least when it comes to U.S. and European citizens .
“ Pressure ( on Switzerland ) has become massive and we are in a phase were countries ’ public deficits are very , very high , ” Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Josef Ackermann , a Swiss , told a conference last week when asked about the UBS tax issue .
“ Can we maintain the difference between tax fraud and tax evasion ?
The answer is no . ”

Ideally , users will fill the web form with necessary information and finish their job successfully .
However , people often make mistakes .
This is where web form validation comes into play .
The goal of web form validation is to ensure that the user provided necessary and properly formatted information needed to successfully complete an operation .
In this article we will go beyond the validation itself and explore different validation and error feedback techniques , methods and approaches .
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
Validation methods
User ’s input can be validated on the server and on the client ( web browser ) .
Thus we have server - side and client - side validation .
We ’ll discuss pros and cons of each .
Server - side validation
In the server - side validation , information is being sent to the server and validated using one of server - side languages .
If the validation fails , the response is then sent back to the client , page that contains the web form is refreshed and a feedback is shown .
This method is secure because it will work even if JavaScript is turned off in the browser and it ca n’t be easily bypassed by malicious users .
On the other hand , users will have to fill in the information without getting a response until they submit the form .
This results in a slow response from the server .
The exception is validation using Ajax .
Ajax calls to the server can validate as you type and provide immediate feedback .
Validation in this context refers to validating rules such as username availability .
You can read more about validation with Ajax in this excellent tutorial on jQueryForDesigners .
This diagram shows differences between client - side and server - side validation and other techniques .
Client - side validation
Server - side validation is enough to have a successful and secure form validation .
For better user experience , however , you might consider using client - side validation .
This type of validation is done on the client using script languages such as JavaScript .
By using script languages user ’s input can be validated as they type .
This means a more responsive , visually rich validation .
With client - side validation , form never gets submitted if validation fails .
Validation is being handled in JavaScript methods that you create ( or within frameworks / plugins ) and users get immediate feedback if validation fails .
Main drawback of client - side validation is that it relies on JavaScript .
If users turn JavaScript off , they can easily bypass the validation .
This is why validation should always be implemented on both the client and server .
By combining server - side and client - side methods we can get the best of the two : fast response , more secure validation and better user experience .
Rich , instant validation feedback is done on the client on TypePad
There are several different types of validation you can perform : required fields , correct format and confirmation fields .
Required information
The first and most obvious information that should be validated is required information – information without which operation cannot be completed successfully .
Thus , validation has to ensure that the user provided all the necessary details in the web form and it has to fail if at least one of the fields is not provided .
Required fields should be clearly marked in order to inform users about what information has to be provided up front .
Required fields on Komodo Media blog comment form are marked with " required " help text .
A common way to mark required fields is with an asterisk ( * ) .
However , not all users know the meaning of an asterisk sign .
Beginners or older users are very likely to have only a general idea of what an asterisk might mean .
This is the reason why it is a good practice to either put a note on the top of the form that indicates that all fields marked with an asterisk are required or to use required field markers .
In case that all fields are required there is no need to place asterisks or markers in the form .
A simple message that all fields are required is enough .
Facebook does n't provide information about required fields .
Users get information that all fields are required only after they press the " submit " - button .
Last year , we conducted an survey on Web form design .
According to that survey “ designers tend to remove all unnecessary details and distractions which do n’t help the user to complete the form ” .
More detailed analysis showed a trend of using very few mandatory fields – more than 50 % of forms used at most 5 mandatory fields , while optional fields were often avoided .
This can be useful to you when deciding on required fields .
Correct format
Apart from ensuring that users provide necessary information , validation has to ensure that users provide information in the correct format .
This applies to various cases such as email address , URL , dates , phone numbers and others .
If the information is not in the correct format , users should be informed and correct format should be suggested .
Probably the easiest way to validate the “ correct ” formatting is to use regular expressions .
Please notice that it is often a good idea to not impose a strict input pattern on the users ; it ’s better to actually permit users to enter text in a variety of formats and syntaxes , and make the application interpret it intelligently .
The user just wants to get something done , not think about “ correct ” formats and complex UIs .
Let the user type whatever he needs , and if it ’s reasonable , make the software do the right thing with it .
This design pattern is also often called forgiving format UI design pattern .
Carbonmade sign - up form validates URL format , informs the user about the error and provides ways to correct it .
To learn more about regular expressions be sure to read Essential Guide To Regular Expressions : Tools and Tutorials or if you already know the basics : Crucial Concepts Behind Advanced Regular Expressions .
We ’ll discuss some other format techniques later in the article .
Confirmation fields
When dealing with data that is important to the system , it is a good practice to let the users confirm their input using additional confirmation fields .
This way users can be certain that they provided correct information .
A typical case when confirmation field is used is for passwords , but it can be used in other cases like an email address .
Photobucket sign - up form required users to re-type password they previously entered in order to ensure it has been correctly entered .
A confirmation field should be placed next ( or below ) the target field .
It has to clearly describe the purpose of the field such as “ Confirm your password ” .
If two values do not match , the user should be informed .
As an option , you can use a success indicator if values DO match .
The second part of our survey shows interesting information about confirmation fields .
Email confirmation was mandatory in only 18 % of sites , while password confirmation was mandatory in 72 % of web sites .
Surprisingly , large websites such as Facebook , LinkedIn , Stumbleupon and Twitter do n’t require password confirmation .
Validation feedback
If validation fails , the system should let the users know it by providing a clear and unambiguous message ( usually one or two sentences ) and ways to correct errors .
Since users need to notice an error message immediately , it is a good practice to position it at the top of a web form , before all the other fields .
This will also allow screen readers to easily access the message .
The message should be shown preferably in red since this is the color that people usually associate with errors and it should contain an appropriate icon in order to get more attention .
Icon should be globally recognizable , such as a red circle with white cross .
This will also help people with visual impairments identify the meaning of the message .
In addition to this , users should be informed about which input fields need to be checked .
The Invoice Machine Sign - up form does n't provide error feedback .
Error message is missing and input fields are colored with pastel red that is not easy to spot .
Apart from the error message and a list of invalid fields , the system should clearly mark fields that are invalid .
This can be done in one of the following ways ( or any combination of them ) :
By providing red inline messages or markers next to every invalid field
By changing the background color or border color of invalid fields ( to red )
By changing the color of field labels
By providing error tips ( balloons ) next to each field
If you provide error tips or help , be short and informative .
For example , if date is in an incorrect , format provide users with details on how to format it properly : “ The date should be in the dd - mm - yyyy - format ” .
It is sometimes also a good idea to have these hints as the initial value of your input fields .
Thus , the user will first read the hint inside the input box and when he / she will start typing the data , the hint will disappear .
Validation upon submit
The “ classic ” way to perform validation is when the user submits his data via the “ submit ” - button .
The validation is executed and if any errors are found , feedback is returned and displayed to the user .
This way users will be able to fill the form without any interruptions .
But , that could be a disadvantage as well .
Users will be able to fix the errors only after they try to submit the form and get the response back from the server .
This technique is typical for server - side validation , but can also be done on the client side .
Feedback on Ballpark sign - up form occurs upon submit .
It shows an obvious error message with incorrect fields at the top of the form and marks each incorrect field with a tip .
Real - time validation ( or instant validation )
In contrast to the previous technique , real - time - validation alerts users while they are filling in the form .
That does n’t necessarily mean that the validation is performed on every single key press but rather when a field loses focus .
This way users will get immediate feedback about their input , e.g. if a username is available or if a date is in the correct format .
Obviously , instant validation occurs during typing in an input field or after the input field loses focus .
Usually , it is complemented with a text message , tip or a status icon .
Yahoo registration form implements password strength meter that gives feedback as you type in the letters .
Instant validation should be implemented carefully and in appropriate cases because it might be distracting if overused or misused .
Sign - up form on TypePad not just provides instant validation feedback that informs users of different validation errors – it also indicates successfully entered information .
What to avoid ?
There are two things you should really try to avoid when designing form validation .
First , single error pages are bad practice .
Singe error page means that users are redirected from the Web form they filled to a page that shows some feedback .
In this case , users are forced to browse back in order to fix errors .
When they browse back they will have to memorize the information you provided in the error message .
The same applies to feedback messages in popup windows .
Not only are popups annoying , but once they are closed all the feedback is lost .
An interesting finding in the second part of SM survey is that “ 30 % of the forms displayed only an error - message at the top of the form ( no input fields were highlighted ) ” while “ 29 % had highlighted input fields with corresponding messages next to the input field ( no error - messages were provided at the top of the page ) ” .
Only 25 % used both error - messages and input fields .
Probably the most surprising facts are that 14 % of sites still use JavaScript popup for showing validation feedback , while Ajax validation is present only on 22 % of sites .
This shows big variations in validation feedback .
Better safe than sorry
Apart from the pure validation , there are several techniques that can help users make fewer mistakes .
Although not all of these techniques can be considered validation , they do help by guiding users and preventing them from making mistakes .
Help hints
If a web form requires complex information to be filled in , help hints can significantly help users in the process of filling in the correct information .
By guiding them how to fill particular information , you let them fill the form faster and avoid potential validation errors .
Help hints are usually shown as simple text next to or above the input field .
The design of help hints should differ from the design of form labels .
It is usually shown in smaller , grayed text .
The advantage of help information is that it is always visible to the user even if JavaScript is turned off .
WishListr provides useful help information on the right side of each field .
Help indicators ( tooltips )
In contrast to help hints , tooltips initially hide information and make it visible “ on demand ” .
They are usually triggered by an icon with a question mark .
Help information is shown by hovering over the help icon or clicking on it .
Once the mouse is moved away from the icon , the tooltip disappears .
Help indicators can reduce clutter , especially if help text is too long .
Sign - up form on TicketTrunk contains obvious help indicators that provide help information on hover .
Dynamic tips
Similar to the previous case , dynamic tips are initially not visible to users .
Once the user enters a particular input field , related tip is shown .
This way tips are emphasized and clutter in the form is reduced .
Tips should be shown in such a way that they do n’t cover other information on the form .
They are usually shown next to input fields , but you should always try to place them on the right side of the fields since that is less distracting .
Digg registration form has discrete dynamic tips that show help information related to the field that has the focus .
Masking and reformatting user ’s input
Apart from validating user ’s input and assisting users , web applications can also take part in providing correct data by formatting user ’s input .
This can be done by masking input fields in order to force users to enter information in an appropriate format .
Mask is an expression that controls what users can enter in an input field .
Masking can be implemented easily with one of the following plugins :
Typecast demo page shows different masking options .
In some cases users might fill partially correct information or correct information but in different format .
In those cases web application can provide a mechanism to correct and rewrite the user ’s input .
Some of the possible scenarios when you might consider rewriting user ’s input are :
if , for instance , a user enters URL without “ http : // ” prefix , the system can just add this string to the beginning of URL .
if a user provides data in the dd - mm - yyyy - format , but the required format is yyyy - mm - dd , the system can rewrite the date so it is well - formed
if a user provides credit card number without dashes , the system can add dashes to appropriate positions in the credit card number
Tumblr provides a sort of masking for URL .
These ideas are just some of the cases when this technique can be used .
However , auto - formatting should be used carefully and – if not used properly – can be confusing to users .
Also , not all user ’s input is predictable .
If , for example , user enters “ www.smashingmagazine ” and omits the extension , the system ca n’t assume that the extension is “ .com ” , but should rather raise a validation error .
In this context it ’s again worth mentioning the “ forgiving format ” design pattern .
Instead of restricting user ’s input to a specific format you can allow users to provide various formats and let the system parse it .
In many cases this would require a lot of server processing ; back - end would be responsible for parsing the input , extracting information and converting it to appropriate formats for further processing .
Google Calendar has a very clever implementation of this technique with one - field for adding events .
Users can enter information in various formats ( even use " tomorrow " instead of date ) ; the system parses it and stores it as a new event .
If user provides information that can't be parsed , system assumes that this information is event title and redirects the user to a longer version of the form with filled event name .
This way Google completely omitted validation .
According to our survey .
67 % of sites use help text and tips , 10 % of which use dynamic tips .
Surprisingly , only 26 % of tips are positioned on the right side of the fields , while in other cases tips are positioned above , below and even on the left side of input fields .
Are you human ?
Web form validation would n’t be complete without mentioning Captcha .
Captcha is a significant part of validation as it is responsible for finding out if the user of a system is a human or a bot .
In its simplest form , captcha consists of an image showing text , numbers or an expression and a field that expects content of the image as input .
The earliest captcha generated images with numbers ( e.g. “ 8356 ” ) and that number was expected to be entered by the user .
If correct number was n’t entered ( or not entered at all ) , the form could n’t be submitted .
In fact , today most spam bots are able to recognize the text embedded in a simple captcha-image , so it ’s a good idea to pose some question that only humans could answer correctly , e.g .
“ What color does the Sun have ? ” with correct answer “ yellow ” in all its variations ( “ YELLOW ” , “ yellow ” , “ Yellow ” etc. ) .
You may also want to consider the technique called Honeypot Captcha where the idea is to create hidden form elements and check on the server side that they remain blank .
Another option is to create a form field with a label that says , “ Leave this field blank ” and then is marked as a required field ( thank you , Shawn McCool ) .
Simple captcha requires an answer to a semantic question .
The kind of captcha presented above caused a major problem in accessibility .
Blind , visually impaired or dyslexic users have difficulties or are even impossible to complete the web form with Captchas .
As the Web evolved , so did captchas and today there are implementations that have audio support for users with disabilities .
Captchas can show hardly recognizable words .
Can you easily read the word on the left ?
Still most users hate captchas ( and there is a good reason for hating them ! ) .
Of course , people just do n’t like filling in forms .
If they ca n’t do it fast and effortlessly , there is a high probability that they wo n’t do it at all .
This is where a captcha does n’t help at all : it can take too much time for users to read ( if text is messy ) which happens oft in practice .
Remember , Captcha helps site owners , not their users .
Therefore it ’s always a good idea to avoid using Captchas if you can avoid them .
To read more about Captchas and accessibility , read Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA .
Captcha on Digg registration form has audio support .
If unable to read , users will be able to hear the letters shown in the image .

Conclusion
You saw different methods and techniques that you can use to implement validation in your forms .
Although there are many possibilities , you should carefully plan validation for each project .
Not all techniques provide a solution for everything .
Some of them are very helpful and easy to implement , but some lack usability and simplicity .

That might be enough for you to start .
Rules of thumbs in web form validation design
According to the Swiss Appenzell Daily Bell :
“ A state without a viable and controllable information methodology is eventually a failed state .
There must be believable memes that are subscribed to by the majority of citizens .
When , over time , a nation 's dominant social themes come under increased scrutiny , the result is eventually a splintering of the citizens ' consensus about how they ought to be led and by whom .
A theme that is currently under attack in the Internet age is central banking — and such attacks may eventually lead to a gold or silver standard within the larger Western world .
But that may only be the beginning . ”
News travels fast these days .
No longer word of mouth and subject to the whim of the teller , the printed word brought about a revolution in the way religious leaders were viewed due to the action of one man and his printing press .
Enter the age of the internet with its villains and heroes whose exploits are literally transmitted to those paying attention at the speed of light .
This is truly ' change you can believe in ' .
A State that cannot control its own means of communication both internally and to the mass of citizens is doomed to failure .
Effective communication is the lifeblood of every modern day human enterprise , including government .
Once upon a time , the masses were given the ' official line ' by the town crier and they believed it .
News traveled by literally being yelled out in the streets for all to hear by a paid government mouthpiece .
When Martin Luther visited Vatican City and saw the opulence and splendor surrounding those in power , he was not impressed , he was not intimidated , he was outraged .
The last straw came when he discovered that for a fee , it was possible for a rich man to buy a ' pass ' into heaven .
No more need to heed your biblical teachings , we took care of that .
Just gimme the money !
And so he and his Gutenberg press went to work ..
Fast forward some 500 years .
Anyone can type a few keywords in a browser window and literally thousands ( or even millions ) of web pages are offered in response .
This is truly information at your fingertips .
It 's no longer a search , now we just say ' google ' .
Keeping up with a hot topic is as easy as adding your email to a delivery list .
You can even keep up with your favorite people on Twitter and Facebook – no charge .
No , the problem of government is not in keeping the lines of communication open , it is in controlling those lines and keeping those ' believable memes ' believable in the face of ever increasing scrutiny .
If my government tells me something , I can google it and have hundreds of differing points of view in milliseconds .
What I believe does not have to be what the government tells me anymore , now I have the ability to find out what they 're really up to and get ' the rest of the story ' .
And if I do n't like what I see , I can tell the world literally at the speed of light .
This is more than a splintering of consensus , it is being shattered into 300 million pieces and there 's nothing the government can do to stop or control it .
As it turns out , true freedom is , truly , free !
In 2005 , I was the youngest person elected to the new Afghan parliament .
Women like me , running for office , were held up as an example of how the war in Afghanistan had liberated women .
But this democracy was a facade , and the so - called liberation a big lie .
On behalf of the long - suffering people of my country , I offer my heartfelt condolences to all in the UK who have lost their loved ones on the soil of Afghanistan .
We share the grief of the mothers , fathers , wives , sons and daughters of the fallen .
It is my view that these British casualties , like the many thousands of Afghan civilian dead , are victims of the unjust policies that the Nato countries have pursued under the leadership of the US government .
Almost eight years after the Taliban regime was toppled , our hopes for a truly democratic and independent Afghanistan have been betrayed by the continued domination of fundamentalists and by a brutal occupation that ultimately serves only American strategic interests in the region .
You must understand that the government headed by Hamid Karzai is full of warlords and extremists who are brothers in creed of the Taliban .
Many of these men committed terrible crimes against the Afghan people during the civil war of the 1990s .
For expressing my views I have been expelled from my seat in parliament , and I have survived numerous assassination attempts .
The fact that I was kicked out of office while brutal warlords enjoyed immunity from prosecution for their crimes should tell you all you need to know about the " democracy " backed by Nato troops .
In the constitution it forbids those guilty of war crimes from running for high office .
Yet Karzai has named two notorious warlords , Fahim and Khalili , as his running mates for the upcoming presidential election .
Under the shadow of warlordism , corruption and occupation , this vote will have no legitimacy , and once again it seems the real choice will be made behind closed doors in the White House .
As we say in Afghanistan , " the same donkey with a new saddle " .
So far , Obama has pursued the same policy as Bush in Afghanistan .
Sending more troops and expanding the war into Pakistan will only add fuel to the fire .
Like many other Afghans , I risked my life during the dark years of Taliban rule to teach at underground schools for girls .
Today the situation of women is as bad as ever .
Victims of abuse and rape find no justice because the judiciary is dominated by fundamentalists .
A growing number of women , seeing no way out of the suffering in their lives , have taken to suicide by self - immolation .
This week , US vice - president Joe Biden asserted that " more loss of life [ is ] inevitable " in Afghanistan , and that the ongoing occupation is in the " national interests " of both the US and the UK .
I have a different message to the people of Britain .
I do n't believe it is in your interests to see more young people sent off to war , and to have more of your taxpayers ' money going to fund an occupation that keeps a gang of corrupt warlords and drug lords in power in Kabul .
What 's more , I do n't believe it is inevitable that this bloodshed continues forever .
Some say that if foreign troops leave Afghanistan will descend into civil war .
But what about the civil war and catastrophe of today ?
The longer this occupation continues , the worse the civil war will be .
The Afghan people want peace , and history teaches that we always reject occupation and foreign domination .
We want a helping hand through international solidarity , but we know that values like human rights must be fought for and won by Afghans themselves .
I know there are millions of British people who want to see an end to this conflict as soon as possible .
Together we can raise our voice for peace and justice .
There are a lot of video games out there .
Try as “ family ” - oriented pundits might , they have to deal with the fact that not only is video gaming not going to go away , but it ’s an even bigger venture than the movie industry .
Even worse for them , even the people who did n’t start gaming until it really started to pick up – back in the days of the Nintendo Entertainment System – are now fully - fledged adults who are becoming today ’s doctors , teachers , politicians , and any other job imaginable .
Nowadays , it ’s a more troubling sign to find a young person who does n’t at least play video games once in a while .
Nostalgia is a weird thing .
Our minds tell us that some of the games we grew up with back in those dark days of 2 - D were fantastic , but when you play them now , they simply fall apart .
It ’s not even because they ’re graphically dated : not everyone likes a game with unresponsive controls that ca n’t be customized and a ball - twisting difficulty .
Say what you want about how game companies are dumbing down games to make them more readily accessible – and there is some truth to that argument – but convenient features like free saving and customizable controls are perfectly fine with me .
Obviously , not everyone is going to agree on the best anything of all time , but that ’s okay because my opinion is correct .
From time to time , I like to look at games , both past and present , and decide which ones are ultimately worth playing and which are n’t .
Some very exceptional titles have slipped through the cracks of time while other well - known titles have sucked hard but not received the beatdowns they so richly deserve .
Today , I aim to focus on racing games .
From modern technological marvels like MotorStorm to some of the more humble beginnings in games like Championship Sprint , racing games have come big and small , well - known and obscure , and both awesome and shitty .
The original Wipeout was one of the biggest system - movers for the original PlayStation when that console was in its infancy .
Virtua Racer was a $ 100 project that helped show the future of polygon graphics , but ultimately fell short on fun .
Just about every gamer owns , or at least has played , a Mario Kart title .
However , I ’m here to tell you , once and for all , what the greatest racing game of all time is : a game well ahead of its time ; a game that paved the path that almost every racer ultimately took ; and a game that actually lies to you , attempting to make you believe that the game is just like any other in an attempt to weed out the pussies and whiners from the champions at life .
I ’m talking about none other than this gem :
That ’s right .
Way back in February of 1988 , a company called Rare was busy doing things like “ releasing some of the most awesome games ever made ” instead of their more modern path of “ generally sucking ” .
I do n’t know how many people realized it , but even before my 4th birthday , they had already released a racing game so great that it still destroys its competition .
However , right off the bat , Rare lies to you .
You can take the description of “ 32 tracks of racing thrills ” to mean one of two things :
A . That there are 32 different tracks of racing thrills
B . That there are a total of 32 “ tracks ” , or “ levels ” , of racing thrills
Well , guess what ?
You ’re wrong on either count .
The game features exactly seven different track layouts , and far from 32 tracks , the game actually goes on as long as you have the stones to handle the ever - increasing challenges the game throws at you .
While the hazards and powerups on each track may differ , it does n’t change the fact that there are still exactly seven different track layouts throughout the game .
What the game is honest about , though , is the racing thrills .
It all starts out simply enough : you play from an isometric perspective that is very close to the track , and the game only requires the usage of four buttons in order to race .
Pressing left makes your car turn left ; pressing right makes your car turn right ; holding the B button makes your car accelerate ; and pressing the A button lets you either honk your horn in an attempt to make any women with an R.C. car fetish go moist or , if you ’re packing any heat , it allows you to fire your weapons .
If you were ever wondering what game to thank for the manly addition that is blasting the crap out of other vehicles , you have R.C. Pro-Am to thank .
The game features two collectible weapons : missiles and bombs .
You can only carry one or the other , and their effectiveness is directly related to whether or not the three AI cars are in the correct position : missiles shoot in front of you , while bombs are dropped behind you .
Either one makes cars blow up .
The third power up is a “ roll cage ” power up that everyone can pick up .
It allows cars to not explode when they crash into walls or other hazards , and touching a car without a roll cage causes it to spin out … often resulting in another fateful encounter with the wall .
Fortunately for you , your manly missiles and bombs go right through the roll cage , so use them liberally .
The game also throws a feature at you to lull you into a false sense of security , and that is the fact that so long as you do n’t finish in last place , you will always move on to the next track .
Seeing as there are only four cars total – including yours – that seems to peg your odds as fairly high .
However , the game ramps up the challenge to truly wreck the collective shits of people not awesome enough to handle it .
The blue car is sort of your counter - balance : if you ’re well ahead of the blue car , it ends up being faster than you , but if you ’re well behind the blue car , it ends up being slower than you .
The blue car is usually the ultimatum : if you ’re racing the blue car , it ’s usually for third place .
For those manly enough to get past the blue car , there ’s the green car .
The green car pretty much stays at one constant speed all the time , one that is usually a little slower than your top speed .
This means if you ’re awesome enough to hit the power ups and speed strips – another feature for which you have R.C. Pro-Am to thank – you should be putting the green car in , at best , third place .
That leaves you with one other car to deal with … this little fucker :
I ’d like you to get acquainted with by far the most annoying enemy in any video game ever made : the fucking yellow ( really more like yellowish - orange ) car .
Sure , you thought enemies in Battletoads – another Rare title , it ’s worth noting – were annoying enough , but they do n’t hold a candle to this little guy .
Besides the fact that you will usually battle the yellow car for victory – and you are shooting for victory , since real men see silver and bronze as losing – there ’s the little fact that the yellow car is a cheating bitch .
You see , if you ever destroy any opposing car – the yellow car included – you run the risk of having the yellow car activate his hacking bullshit powers , where he powers up to a speed that is considerably faster than the player can ever go without the aid of a speed strip .
You can temporarily knock him out of this by blowing him up as he tries to pass you , but you run the risk of him doing it again .
You could simply not blow up other cars , but you may very well do it on accident and , if that ’s not enough , all of the cars will eventually speed up to the point where they ’re always faster than you , no matter what , which means that you have to destroy them or else you can never catch them .
In the mean time , you have to deal with this cheating fucker who stands in your way between all the glory , honor and chicks that come with winning , and the “ well , at least you passed ” stifled laughter that comes with finishing anything lower than first .
So there you have it .
Utter simplicity on the track , but so much innovation behind it .
Above all else , there are very few things in life more satisfying than beating the shit out of the vile yellow car :
Forget the future .
The best racing title is old enough to take out to the bars .
Enjoy it or die .

Last Friday a few friends and I decided to ride our bikes down to Monmouth ( about 15 miles west of Salem ) for the start of the Cycle Oregon Weekend event .
When I checked the map to plan the route , I realized this was a perfect opportunity to test out the state of Oregon ’s first fully signed and mapped , official State Scenic Bikeway .
The Scenic Bikeway program was first proposed back in 2004 by ( coincidentally enough ) Cycle Oregon , but the program is just now gaining speed .
In May , the Willamette Valley Scenic Bikeway ( WVSB ) found a permanent online home .
Now , anyone can print detailed maps of the 132 - mile route that goes from Champoeg State Park to Armitage County Park in Eugene .
( Hopefully someday the route will start in Portland .
Federal money to start planning the new French Prarie bike / ped bridge over the Willamette should help . )
On Friday , we picked up the WVSB just south of Champoeg ( the historic Butteville Store makes a great starting off point ) .
With my map in clear view on my handlebar bag , we rolled through the farms and rural roads of the valley , with the snow - capped spire of Mt. Hood keeping watch over us .
Follow these signs .
A highlight of the first section of the route is the miles and miles of hops fields .
Seeing their long vines stretch up and over the interesting cable system used by growers gave us a tangible reminder of Oregon ’s flourishing beer industry .
The roads were pleasant to ride on and we encountered very little motor vehicle traffic .
Most of the route is on heavy farm use land and we shared the road with more than a few tractors and other farm equipment .
As we pedaled south , I wondered why I did n’t see any of the official Scenic Bikeway signs .
Unfortunately , they did n’t show up until we got to Keizer , about 27 miles into the route .
I learned later that Marion County has been slow to put up the signs , but that they should be installed in the next few weeks .
Low traffic made for pleasant riding .
We encountered some kids portaging a huge tube for river floating .
Once we saw the first official sign , it was easy to follow the route , even without a map .
The signs are a bit small , but they are distinct and placed at every turn .
We relied on them to get around and through downtown Salem ( I had forgotten to print the map for that section , so we were riding blind ) .
This part of the route was a bit weird .
The route was well thought - out , except for one spot south of Salem where it directed us onto a sidewalk adjacent to River Road where we pedaled against traffic for about 3 / 4 of a mile .
My only other nitpick is a lack of free , publicly available water .
How about building a few water bottle re-fueling stations ?
Someday , I hope Oregon State Parks realizes their vision for a statewide network of Scenic Bikeways , connecting rural towns and cities with pleasant , well - signed routes that are marketed far and wide .
If the WVSB is any indication , this is a program well worth supporting .

There are 8,000 people on the transplant register
The government says it will ban all private transplants of organs from dead donors in the UK .
The move comes after media reports of overseas patients paying to receive organs donated by British people .
An independent report said the public needed to be confident that scarce donor organs were allocated fairly within the NHS .
Transplant surgeons said the ban would reassure the public that organs will go to those in greatest need .
Elisabeth Buggins , former chairwoman of the Organ Donation Taskforce , carried out an inquiry after allegations in a number of newspapers that organs from NHS donors were being given to patients from countries such as Greece and Italy .
It emerged that more than 700 transplants , mostly liver transplants , had been carried out on non-UK patients over the past decade .
In total , 631 of those transplants used organs from dead donors and , of those , 314 recipients were from outside the EU .
It is not clear how many of those paid privately .
The inquiry found no evidence of wrongdoing in how organs were allocated to these patients , but concluded that in the interests of fairness no one should be able to pay for such operations .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
It also says that rules should be tightened on which EU citizens are entitled to transplants on the NHS .
Under EU law , some patients can receive treatment in other countries , if approved by their healthcare system , which then foots the bill .
But the NHS needs to be more cautious when checking eligibility under these rules and it is likely that there are patients currently receiving treatment who should be refused , Mrs Buggins said .
She also recommended that the NHS works with other countries in the EU to develop their own transplant programmes .
And any reciprocal arrangements with transplant networks in other countries need to be reviewed , she advised .
Surgeons will still be able to carry out private work using organs from living donors , for example with kidney transplants and some liver transplants .
Trust Last year 3,500 transplants were carried out in the UK .
The Department of Health , which covers England , accepted the recommendations and said immediate steps would be taken to ban all private clinical practice involving solid organs donated after death .
Agreement for this still needs to be reached with the administrations in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland but is expected to come into force across the UK in October .
An implementation group will be set up to monitor transplant referrals from overseas , a spokeswoman added .
NHS transplant centres will receive clarification on which patients from abroad are eligible for treatment .
There has been ongoing work to increase public confidence in organ donation and , by March 2013 , the government want to see donor rates rise from the current 800 to 1,400 donors per year .
Elisabeth Buggins said the report aimed to make more organs available for UK residents .
" While I found no evidence of wrongdoing in the way organs are allocated to patients , there is a perception that private payments may unfairly influence access to transplant , so they must be banned .
" Confidence in the transplant system should increase once money is removed from the equation , decisions are transparent and accountability clear ; confidence we know is necessary if the number of organ donors is to rise to match the best in Europe .
Health Minister Ann Keen said they would implement the recommendations to ensure a UK system that is " fair and transparent " .
She added : " The report highlights the complexity of European law in this area and we will take immediate action to provide guidance for the transplant community and reassure the public of the integrity of our transplant programme . "
Lynda Hamlyn , chief executive of NHS Blood and Transplant , said more than 10,000 people currently need a transplant but due to a lack of organs about 1,000 people die every year before they can have one .
" In a situation where there are not enough organs to treat the citizens of the very country donating them , the priority must be to ensure a fair and open system of allocation and treatment and the necessary level of public reassurance that this is the case . "
The British Transplantation Society welcomed the report , saying it would provide " further reassurance " that priority for a transplant was given to those in greatest need .
It added : " We welcome the proposal to clarify the arrangements for the treatment of non-UK patients and would encourage the Health Secretary to pursue this without delay . "

During the recent years yeasts have been causing more and more infections in humans .
One of them can mutate surprisingly quickly by reorganizing its chromosomes .
This enables this yeast to tolerate higher doses of anti-fungal medicine .
This is shown by new research findings from the Lund University in Sweden .
A yeast named Candida glabrata commonly occurs in humans , usually on our skin .
It does little harm there .
But if it enters the blood system , it can be directly life threatening to people with poor immune defense , such as cancer and AIDS patients .
“ It can actually eat you up from the inside , ” says Jure Piškur , professor at the Department of Cell and Organism Biology at the Lund University .
Jure Piškur , together with a team of research colleagues , has studied the underlying reasons that this yeast can cause more and more infections in humans .
The research team has discovered that Candida glabrata can mutate surprisingly rapidly .
Instead of mutations occurring in individual genes , this yeast can mutate by reorganizing their chromosomes and make extra copies of large chromosome pieces .
The consequence of this is that Candida glabrata is becoming more and more resistant to fungicidal medicine .
The present research report shows that a certain mini-chromosome can enable the yeast fungus to survive even if it is treated with nearly ten times the normal dose of the fungicide fluconazole .
” Our research now aims to identify the weak points in Candida glabrata so that we can develop effective medicine , ” says Jure Piškur .
Candida glabrata has become the second most common yeast pathogen in humans .
It primarily causes irritation , in the genitals , for instance .
Jure Piškur stresses that people whose immune defense is normal run very little risk of being affected by the life - threatening form of fungal infection in the blood system .
The most common type of fungus in humans is called Candida albicans and causes commonly occurring infections in women ’s genitals .
This yeast fungus is relatively easy to treat with fungicides .
But more and more often after the treatment Candida albicans is replaced with the more resistant Candida glabrata .

Political philosopher Richard Weaver famously and correctly stated that ideas have consequences .
Take for example ideas about rights versus goods .
Natural law states that people have rights to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
A good is something you work for and earn .
It might be a need , like food , but more goods  seem to be becoming rights  in our culture , and this has troubling consequences .
It might seem harmless enough to decide that people have a right to things like education , employment , housing or healthcare .
But if we look a little further into the consequences , we can see that the workings of the community and economy are thrown wildly off balance when people accept those ideas .
First of all , other people must pay for things like healthcare .
Those people have bills to pay and families to support , just as you do .
If there is a right to healthcare , you must force the providers of those goods , or others , to serve you .
Obviously , if healthcare providers were suddenly considered outright slaves to healthcare consumers , our medical schools would quickly empty .
As the government continues to convince us that healthcare is a right instead of a good , it also very generously agrees to step in as middleman .
Politicians can be very good at making it sound as if healthcare will be free for everybody .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
The administration does n’t want you to think too much about how hospitals will be funded , or how you will somehow get something for nothing in the healthcare arena .
We are asked to just trust the politicians .
Somehow it will all work out .
Universal Healthcare never quite works out the way the people are led to believe before implementing it .
Citizens in countries with nationalized healthcare never would have accepted this system had they known upfront about the rationing of care and the long lines .
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
As bureaucrats take over medicine , costs go up and quality goes down because doctors spend more and more of their time on paperwork and less time helping patients .
As costs skyrocket , as they always do when inefficient bureaucrats take the reins , government will need to confiscate more and more money from an already foundering economy to somehow pay the bills .
As we have seen many times , the more money and power that government has , the more power it will abuse .
The frightening aspect of all this is that cutting costs , which they will inevitably do , could very well mean denying vital services .
And since participation will be mandatory , no legal alternatives will be available .
The government will be paying the bills , forcing doctors and hospitals to dance more and more to the government ’s tune .
Having to subject our health to this bureaucratic insanity and mismanagement is possibly the biggest danger we face .
The great irony is that in turning the good of healthcare into a right , your life and liberty are put in jeopardy .
Instead of further removing healthcare from the market , we should return to a true free market in healthcare , one that empowers individuals , not bureaucrats , with control of healthcare dollars .
My bill HR 1495 the Comprehensive Healthcare Reform
Act provides tax credits and medical savings accounts designed to do just that .

The Best of Ron Paul
In the words of poker player Nat Arem :
Two Plus Two has been SEO braindead for years .
The Two Plus Two Forums are the most trafficked poker forums in the world .
With hundreds of thousands of unique visitors a month , a dedicated ( to the point of obsessive ) crowd of regulars including top industry personalities , and deep stockpiles of poker - related content , no other forum even comes close .*
According to one ranking , Two Plus Two is the 39th most popular forum on the Internet .
A generation of players have cut their teeth on Two Plus Two books , and those books have inspired forum discussions which have inspired yet more books .
Many of the strategic concepts which are second - nature today were first formulated on Two Plus Two .
So when you purchase a recent Two Plus Two book and read Greg Raymer 's glowing endorsement on the backside ...
I can say with full confidence that if it were not for Two Plus Two Publishing and their web site , I would not have the 2004 World Championship bracelet on my wrist .
... you can rest easy knowing it 's not complete B.S. Two Plus
Two really does have some great information , whether in book format or codified in their forums .
Which is why I feel so comfortable saying : if any site deserves to rank for the keyword " poker " that site is Two Plus Two .
When people go to Google and type in " poker " , Two Plus Two should , by rights , appear somewhere on the first page .
Want to know what Two Plus Two 's actual rank is for that particular search ?
# 238
Which is almost funny , considering how richly deserving of search engine quan Two Plus Two actually is .
The most successful poker publishing company in poker ...
The most trafficked discussion forums in poker ...
Home to some of the top poker theorists and players in the world ...
On the Internet for around a decade ...
Thousands of incoming organic links from every poker site in existence ...
And yet ... 238 .
Now it could be argued that there 's no way Two Plus Two could ever compete , SEO - wise , against the well - funded online poker venues who dominate the " poker " and " online poker " keyword arena .
In Online Poker : Too Competitive for White Hat SEO ? , Rand Fishkin explains .
Some of the more established sites ( PartyPoker , FullTiltPoker , Bodog , 888 , etc. ) have hundreds of thousands of backlinks , a good portion of which are fully white - hat .
In addition , they 've got history , good on - page optimization and the depth of experience in the field that would be tough for anyone outside of my panel cohorts to match .
So achieving a Top 10 ranking for those terms takes a lot of time , money , and expertise .
Fine .
Poker SEO is a bloodbath especially on the short tail .
We know this .
Yet there are hundreds of sites with less content than Two Plus Two that rank higher in the SERPs .
Two Plus
Two manages to get schooled , rank - wise , by some truly tangential stuff .
Conjelco 's poker glossary .
Rank # 57 .
Lady Gaga 's Poker Face Lyrics .
Rank .
Rank # 64 .
University of Alaska Geophysical Institute 's Poker Flat Research Range .
Rank # 99 .
The Poker For Dummies book on Amazon .
Rank # 174 .
It performs slightly ... slightly ... better on the long tail , where you can find combinations of words that summon Two Plus Two results :
average player win rates PTBB / 100
online poker AHK macros
absolute poker scandal
But what kind of user searches for those terms ?
A poker player who probably already knows about Two Plus Two , that 's who .
For those ultra-competitive poker keywords on the short tail , Two Plus Two 's performance is abysmal .
You could say that Two Plus Two is the 98 - pound weakling of poker SEO .
Rarely will you find any website more deserving of rank getting so little of it .
Nat Arem ( in the above - linked article ) points out a few reasons why :
" HORRIBLE URL management ... "
" Lack of robots .
txt usage , along with proper nofollow 'ing ... "
" Lack of keywords in URLS ... "
" Not maximizing content ... "
Some improvements have been made along these lines .
But problems still abound :
Terrible on - page SEO .
Clutter .
Poor keyword density .
More clutter .
Failure to promote high - value content ( signal ) over low - value content ( noise ) .
Failure to promote high - value content on the front page .
Lack of coherent , easily - spiderable inner link structure .
Link density is way too high in general ; keyword density too low .
No clear prev/ next or left / right progression in multipage threads ( at the markup level ) .
Two Plus
Two post archiving process breaks permalinks and everything gets archived eventually .
Now I do n't pretend to be an SEO virtuoso , and I 'm not affiliated with Two Plus Two in any way , shape , or form .
My attitude towards SEO has always been try to create good or at least decent or at least halfway unique content and make it basically accessible to search engines .
But what 's appropriate for me is n't appropriate for a high - traffic Internet forum like Two Plus Two .
Two different animals entirely .
So setting the classic SEO aspects aside , let 's surf on over to a Two Plus Two thread and click the venerable View Source button .
Here 's the XHTML markup generated for a page consisting of one question :
at a small stakes game or for any nlhe game
What is the usual standard open live and online ?
6 max and 9max nlhe I hear it is 4 bb+ 1 bb per limper .
Is this correct ?
And one response :
Yes .
You 'll find that all over the NLHE forums here .
It gives you enough fold equity to usually get it heads - up , which will get you into situations you know well ( after a while ) .
That 's 341 characters total .

It may well be the case that Googlebot and other spiders will index up to 500 KB or more of the content on a single page .
But if your markup looks like the above , SEO is the least of your worries .
When the ratio of boilerplate HTML to actual content starts to approach like 100 to 1 or 500 to 1 or worse , as it does on Two Plus Two , SEO is premature .
You still have a half - finished website .
I have no idea how much traffic and money and other Internet goodness Two Plus Two has squandered over the years by failing to produce a search engine - friendly website .
I 'm inclined to say millions of dollars but we 'll never really know .
Whereas forums like StackOverflow and even the reviled ExpertsExchange manage to court search engines with shallower link structures , appropriate keyword densities , optimized presentation of content , and permalinks that stay permanent , Two Plus Two 's approach is more like search engine kryptonite .
And for a site with mountains of rich content operated by the guys who currently own the # 1 Google result for the phrase non-self - weighting , that 's a little ironic . ;-)

The unlawful federal government 's takeover of the financial , banking and insurance industries was just a prelude to the planned complete unconstitutional Marxist takeover of all of America .
Your nearly trillion dollar per month spending habits have bankrupted our country .
You 're running up our taxes and the national debt , saddling future generations with enslaving burdens of taxes and debt that they can never repay .
You 've taken over car manufacturing companies , illegally wiping out the stockholders , bondholders and distributors and awarding the remaining assets to the labor unions or other political cronies of your choice .
You are wasting trillions of our hard earned dollars on foolish and ill advised so - called attempts to stimulate the economy , but are actually being used to reward political cronies , criminal political organizations like ACORN , government employee unions , entrenched government employees , corrupt government officials , etc .
Your administrations , departments , agencies , bureaucracies and congressional offices are fraught with crime , graft , bribery , corruption , waste , ineptitude , incompetence and worse .
Your planned destruction of the oil , gas , coal and energy producing sectors will cripple our economy , raise costs for every product and service manufactured , provided , transported , or delivered in our nation .
Your idiotic socialist policies will increase our taxes , increase our costs at the wholesale and retail levels , bankrupt our businesses small and large , drive up unemployment , drive up foreclosures , drive up personal bankruptcies , cause banks to fail , drive up unemployment and entitlement costs and make it all but impossible for city , state and local governments to provide basic services .
Your incompetent , ill advised and cowardly foreign policies , international agreements to weaken our defense systems while at the same time crippling our heavy manufacturing , raw goods , transportation systems and our economy in general are making our nation a sweet target for our enemies who wish to destroy us .
And now you want to takeover our health care industry .
You want to control our health insurance industry to the point that government has a monopoly .
Drive out all private insurance and private health care providers .
You want government bureaucrats making our personal health care decisions for us .
You want government bureaucrats to make life and death decisions for us , determine who is worthy to receive health care and who should be allowed or even encouraged to die .
Well , sirs .
This is the end of the line .
The free American people will not allow this tyranny to stand !
Vote yea on this bill , sign it , try to enforce it and you are signing a declaration of war on we the people of the United States of America .
Advise you dust off and study the Declaration of Independence dated In Congress , July 4 , 1776 to learn your fate .
Fill your hands you sons of bitches !
Rebellion is brewing !

I truly believe that Obama knows that the more socialism he puts in place during his term , the harder it will be for subsequent presidents to undo .
Cut the military , stop future weapons systems , missile defense , and future administrations wo n’t be able to fight even if they need to .
Socialize healthcare and future administrations wo n’t be able to set it straight .
Take over the banks , continue to screw the economy , so that the rest of the world moves toward another currency as it ’s standard , and we will never be able to return to the US dollar as the safe , reliable standard it has been for years .
Obama does not believe the US is a special nation , and wants to ensure that after his time in office , we will never again be able to be one .

No More Wrong Turns
By Martin Nerurkar
[ How do you navigate complex video game levels easily ?
Designer Nerurkar looks at examples from Fallout through Shadow Of The Colossus to examine the top tools for aiding level navigation for players . ]
With the ever increasing complexity of our games and our game spaces , the need for support has increased as well .
The earliest games often consisted of only one screen .
All the action of the game was immediately visible at a glance -- think Space Invaders or Pac - Man .
These are games of ( almost ) perfect information : you can see all there is to the game .
All pieces are on the board , so to speak .
Nowadays , it 's a lot different .
The ability to display the entirety of the game world on one screen was quickly abandoned in favor of larger environments , through scrolling or leaving one screen and entering the next .
The step to immersive , open worlds in 3D has emphasized this even more .
And that 's before we add the increasing complexity of gameplay on top of that .
Fortunately , there are tools that can be used to alleviate this situation .
Discrete Navigational Tools
First off , I 've separated the navigational tools into two big categories : discrete and immersed .
We 'll start off with discrete navigation tools first .
By " discrete " , I mean that the tools are separate from the environment .
They 're a part of the Graphical User Interface .
This puts them into squarely into the realm of game design .
It also makes them stand out -- that means they are noticeable ( but can also be obnoxious ) .
However , the fact that they 're abstract makes it easy to use them to transmit more than just spatial information ( a position , line , area or volume ) .
For example , the color of a dot on the map might display its health or whether it 's friend or foe .
Speaking of maps , let 's start with the first tool :
The Map
The map is what most of you probably thought of when I wrote navigational tool .
It is the most obvious method and the most unsubtle one .
A map displays the environment in an abstract ( and usually simplified ) way to provide a good overview over the game space .
To that end , it often also contains other information on the game state such as the position and state of units or objects in the spaces .
This makes maps very helpful for games in which the spaces are sprawling and complex and / or where there 's a lot of different information to manage .
For example , in Colossal Cave Adventure , the first adventure game , the player uses text to navigate through a cave maze .
The game features no map , since it's all text , but it is so complex that it practically forces the player to sketch one as he plays .
We 've learned since then , and the general trend to user - friendliness has ever increased over the past 30 - odd years .
A step on that road was Doom .
For the first time there were complex and immersive 3D environments navigated from a free first person perspective .
And since this was not only new to the players but also to the developers , there was little in terms of immersed navigational tools .
To not get lost , players needed a map .
And to spare the player the task of drawing it , the game takes over by drawing the automap for him :
As the player progresses more and more of the game world becomes visible in his map .
This type of map is quite common as it adds to the sense of discovery of the game and shows the players those areas that he has n't explored yet .
Also noteworthy is that unlike many games , the map in Doom is n't static .
Often times , you can activate the map , take a look at the world , and then return to the game to continue playing .
In Doom you can bring up the map by pressing the Tab key .
In this new view you can move around using the normal controls .
The map moves accordingly while the arrow symbolizing your avatar turns .
The controls are a bit awkward and objects or characters ( except the player 's avatar ) are not displayed .
Still you can give the map a try in this Flash version of Doom .
Another more recent example of a map is Far Cry 2 .
In this game 's huge open world Africa , the map is necessary to find your targets .
What sets it apart from other games is the way the map is integrated into the game .
It 's not an overlay ( as in Diablo ) nor is it a separate screen as in Doom .
Instead , your character brings up a map in his hands without you leaving the game and breaking immersion .
Just as with Doom , it allows you to look at your map and still move through the world .
It 's also worth noting that , unlike Doom , the large Far Cry 2 map does not need to be uncovered .
A map of the entire gaming space is available from the beginning .
A point of note : the danger of maps that are fully uncovered is that the player might not know where he 's been already .
In such cases it 's often useful to show the entire map but display unvisited areas differently to give hints as to which places to check out if the player is stuck .
Ultima Underworld : The Stygian Abyss provided the players with the ability to add comments to the map .
This could often be used to mark areas that were already investigated and explored .
In games where discovery is important , uncovering areas of the map can be fulfilling .
The player first has to find out about the environment , and sometimes finding pieces of the map can even be a reward in itself .
For example , in Metroid Prime 3 : Corruptio n , the levels are peppered with secret rooms .
In this game the player can unlock all the rooms of the current level on his map which makes it a lot easier to find these rooms .
Here the map becomes part of the reward system .
A negative point of note about this map , though , is that it is in 3D , which makes it a bit hard to use .
It 's still quite good compared to other attempts at 3D mapping though .
For example , the map in Splinter Cell : Chaos Theory is in 3D , and it 's anything but easy to use .
Using 3D makes it much harder to quickly understand the complex space -- which partially defeats the purpose of the thing in the first place .
Of course , video games can also create impossible spaces that are very difficult to map in a way that is easily understood : Corridors that return the player to the starting position , even though they are a straight line , or doors that lead the player to different places each time they 're opened .
In these cases , a map is usually not much of a help , especially as these designs are often meant to intentionally confuse the player .
The Marker
The next type of tool is what I 've dubbed " markers " .
A marker highlights a certain position or area in the world through a discrete interface element .
Kind of like " augmented reality " .
Note that this element can be a 2D graphic or 3D model .
Also some markers are also only visible when the associated object or place is visible , while others can be seen even through walls and other obstacles .
Markers are very useful to lead the player to a certain position in the world -- even if it is in motion .
Because of they are often used to identify important areas of interest , like the positions of teammates or enemies to make it easy to reinforce , engage or evade .
Or they draw attention to objectives or other places of potential interaction .
For example , the exclamation mark icons over the quest givers in World of Warcraft are what I would call a marker .
They make it easy for the player to navigate to important places where he can interact with the game .
Another example of Markers would be Left 4 Dead , where icons are used to highlight critical resources ( ammo , weapons or " peels " ) and places of interaction ( crescendo moment triggers ) .
L4D also highlights the locations of your fellow teammates with a halo around their forms , with the color displaying their current state .
And last but not least , when a teammate can be brought back into action , a silhouette shows where the team has to go to free him or her .
Another well done use of this can be found in Unreal Tournament 3 .
Here , players new to a team - based multiplayer map can activate animated help arrows which show the way to the enemy flag .
This is a good way to quickly teach new players the maps .
This idea of marking the path rather than the target is also used in the help system of other games such as Army of Two and Dead Space .
An unconventional example for a marker are the red objects in Mirror 's Edge .
These change color to highlight the obstacles the player can interact with .
This is straddling the line between immersed and discrete tools , since we 're talking about objects that are a part of the world .
However since these change color as the player approaches , they are definitely interface and not a part of the world itself .
Apart from those examples I also want to highlight -- pun not intended -- another game 's use of Markers : Anno : Create a New World for Wii .
In Anno , the game sometimes places position and / or area markers to point to certain positions .
This is used to show the player where to build his first house or where to steer his ship in order to advance the story .
However , the top - down view in Anno can only display markers when they 're on the screen .
If you do n't look at the destination you have to steer your ship to , then you wo n't see the marker , which does n't help much if the player has to find the spot in the first place .
And that 's where the next discrete tool comes in .
The Compass
Unlike the marker , which marks a certain spot , the compass is part of the interface and points towards a place in the environment .
When you move , the marker stays with the world ; the compass moves with you .
The marker displays the target 's absolute position while the compass shows its position relative to you .
Continuing the example of Anno from above , the compass is a big arrow which points to the currently active marker .
This arrow , however , is only visible when the original marker is not on the screen .
As the player approaches the marker , the compass arrow fades out .
This is n't the only instance where marker and compass are closely intertwined .
Quite a few games use a marker for important objects .
However , you want the player to be aware of their existence and location -- even when they are n't on the screen .
This is where the compass comes in .
A quite classical example of a compass would be Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare .
It features a pretty simplistic compass which displays the cardinal points as well as the direction of the next objective .
The compass changes as the player turns , so if the objective lies in the center , then it 's straight ahead of the player .
Another compass - only system is the teammate locator in Gears of War .
Here , if a teammate goes down , a circle pops up on the player 's HUD .
The circle shows in which direction the wounded buddy is , relative to the player 's position .
Yet another compass style , although one that 's more indirect , is the Jewel Detector of Far Cry 2 .
This gadget does n't use a direct arrow to point to the hidden jewel suitcases .
Instead , it features a green light that starts to flash when the player gets close to one of these cases , increasing in frequency as the distance decreases .
Additionally , the light stays green if the player is looking directly at the position of these cases .
This roundabout way of doing things helps make the search for jewel cases a lot more fun , as you actually have to go look for them and try to triangulate their position .
Notably , the detector is not sensible to differences in altitude : I 've found myself standing in an empty room wondering where the treasure is , while the jewel case sat on the roof .
Of course , a lot of first person shooters also use a compass system to point a player under fire towards his attacker .
And finally the last example is another odd one :
The sword beam from Shadow of the Colossus .
It is also noteworthy because the game manages to include a helpful interface without breaking immersion , and while reinforcing the exploration and discovery themes of the game .
Immersed Navigation Tools
As mentioned before , immersed navigation tools are a part of the game environment .
Unlike discrete tools which are general interfaces used throughout the game , immersed tools have specific applications in the individual environments .
These tools also do n't stand out as much as discrete ones and generally are n't perceived as a part of the interface .
This is because they are built out of the components ( geometry , textures , lights , characters ... ) that are also used to build the environment itself , which makes them the responsibility of the level designer .
It also means that most of them wo n't be consciously used by the player .
Instead , they serve as subtle instruments by which to guide the player but with this unobtrusiveness comes the danger that some players may just overlook them .
The fact that they 're an immersed part of the level also makes them a lot harder to classify .
This is why I 'm grouping them based on their purpose .
I 'll explain each purpose and then give a few examples on how to achieve the desired effect with different components .
Attract
When using this tool , the aim is to attract the player 's attention to a certain location .
This is often used in linear level designs with complicated rooms to make it clear where the player has to move in order to continue .
It can also be used in less linear levels to highlight important areas of interaction -- such as places that the player will revisit often .
Essentially , the idea behind this is to make this target area look more important and thus interesting to the player , so that he moves closer .
This can be done quite subtly , so that the player is unconsciously pulled towards where you want him to be .
Of course it can also be done using more blatant means which will most likely cause the player to respond more consciously .
As you can imagine , there 's quite a number of ways to go about this , so I 'll try and list a couple examples below .
Contrast
If we want to attract the player , we first want to catch his eye .
Here , painting techniques help us a lot .
After all , painting has been manipulating and steering the human eye for millennia .
What 's true for paintings is true for levels : Visual contrast is a good method to catch a player 's eye .
The higher the contrast , the more likely the area is to be noticed .
For example , light coming into a dark room from a doorway will attract the player 's eye and that makes him a lot more likely to approach the doorway .
In general , light works really well as a method to highlight areas and paths .
There 's a reason that a lot of Disney theme park rides use light to mark their exits :
So the visitors instinctively head toward the light and thus avoid congestion .
Believe me , it works ; while working on the PSP version of G - Force I had to run through a level to get to a certain point in the game to test something .
To get there I had to go past a T - section in a vent shaft area .
And even though I was familiar with the level I always took the wrong turn there .
Why ?
Because I was playing without thinking consciously , and that route was lighted better .
And as soon as we had that changed I did n't end up going the wrong way .
To further expand on how important this is , there 's also what 's called the " squint test " : you squint and look at a screenshot of your game .
The brightest area is where people 's eyes will most likely be drawn .
There 's even a squint mode feature in the Unreal Engine 3 editor that blurs your viewport to simulate such a test .
Of course , apart from light , you can also use other methods to create a contrast .
You could use a unique shape that stands out to attract the player 's attention .
One arched doorway next to four rectangular ones will look a lot more important .
You can also use color to create a contrast .
A red door in an otherwise white room is going to catch the player 's eye much more than a grey one will .
Composition
Similar to how the technique of contrast is informed from painting techniques , this method is too .
Here , objects in the environment subtly point towards where the player has to go .
The lines of the objects are oriented so that if the eye follows them it will reach the intended target .
This works especially well if these lines cross the intended boundaries directly .
For example , a plank lying over a chasm will give the player the hint that jumping over said chasm is the way to continue .
Weenies
" Weenie " is a term taken from the Disney theme park designers .
It refers to a large structure in the distance that 's clearly visible to the theme park visitor .
What these weenies do is give reference points for navigation within the park as whole .
Additionally , they also look interesting and important so that the visitor wants to come closer and check them out .
The same principle can be applied to level design .
A good example of this in use is in the game Mirror 's Edge .
Here , the player learns that he has to follow the red objects to get to his goal .
And in one map there 's a large red radio tower visible in the background .
The shape is already unique as most other buildings are skyscrapers but add to this the color red which both stands out and already has some navigational meaning and this Weenie is sure to draw the player in .
Motion
Motion is an excellent way to attract attention .
Based on how our human eyes and brain work , animation and movement easily catch someone 's eye .
This increases the effectiveness of a visual component tenfold , as compared to static clues .
Whether it 's sparks , moving doors or flickering lights -- they all work equally well .
However , using motion also means that player interest is a lot more conscious than with unmoving elements .
This also includes scripted events such as a crane breaking down , or a door being blasted off its hinges .
These events will grab the player 's attention and surely make him want to investigate .
Cutscene
Short cutscenes can also be an excellent tool to focus a players ' attention on a certain area .
For example when entering a big room , the camera shows the contents of the room and ends up focusing on the closed door at the other side .
This clearly tells the player that this door is important and probably the way to leave this room .
Of course , this interrupts gameplay briefly -- but a cutscene can communicate complex routes quite clearly .
Characters
Adding characters to a level can help the player navigate .
For example , in a shooter , the player will be used to attacking his targets and then moving past them .
If he 's suddenly being attacked from a balcony in a house , then this will focus his attention on that area .
He might wonder how to reach this position to get a better vantage point , or to grab whatever items his enemies will drop .
Whatever the case , the player now knows that there 's something up there which makes him likely to investigate .
Additionally if the game features some sort of hit - direction compass then the player also gets the direction of his attackers as a clue .
This makes this work even if the player 's not looking at them directly when hit .
Another way to use characters is to use friendly units to show the way .
If your allies are moving along the planned path and through a doorway , the player will take notice of that route and probably follow them -- though only if he notices them leave .
For this reason it might make sense to have one character leave through the doorway , and another one take up a position next to it .
That way , even if the player misses the initial character leaving he can still spot the second one and come to the conclusion that the doorway is important .
Be careful with this though , as you do n't want to make the player feel like he 's only following his allies and not exploring himself .
Also , you of course need a robust AI that does n't get stuck or make other mistakes .
Pickups
Just as with characters , pickups ( aka power - ups ) will draw the players ' attention .
One reason is that pickups are most often highlighted to be clearly visible : Maybe they even rotate or pulsate .
Either way , they often stand out visually .
Add to this the fact that most players will want to pick them up and you 've got a perfect tool to attract players to a location or to pull them along a route .
This can also be used well in multiplayer maps where there usually are lots of items around .
In G - Force , we 've used this technique to help the player find the way to continue .
The environment of many levels requires the player to frequently ascend and descend , however the camera cannot be used to look up or down in regular gameplay .
Because of this , the tops of shelves or tables might not immediately seem like destinations .
However , if he sees a pickup rotating on the table , the player is much more likely to investigate .
The rotating pickups make the route visible even at the sides of the screen .
Identify
This method is used to help the player with his ability to orient himself within the environment .
It does so by distinguishing different areas from one another .
This helps the player identify them and thus gives him a sense of position in the overall level .
This only really makes sense in non-linear worlds such as hub - levels , multiplayer arenas or large open worlds .
Landmarks
Landmarks are immediately visible features of the environment .
While within the area the landmark is often in view .
This way it can give identity to a location .
In smaller maps it could be a statue or maybe a large red truck .
In bigger maps it could be a prominent bridge or a skyscraper .
As you can imagine , landmarks and the weenies mentioned above can be one and the same object -- to both attract the player to a location and help him identify it .
Style
Unlike the landmark , where there 's one dominating feature , using style means that the difference permeates an entire area .
It could be a different architectural style , indoor vs. outdoor or plainly and simply a different color through textures , light or post processing effects .
It does n't matter , as long as the different areas are distinct enough for the player to easily distinguish and remember .
A downside is though that you still have to teach the player the relative position of the different locations .
It 's not really evident to a player standing in a back alley that the little pirate village is right next to the dark woods .
Guide
The guide method is building actual guides into the map itself .
These guides clearly lead the player along to where he wants to be .
This also makes them quite obvious since players need to consciously see and use them .
Examples would be signs or colored lines throughout the level .
In some cases there are even maps of the level displayed as textures on the wall .
Of course this kind of tool only really makes sense in non-linear environments where there are multiple different places of importance to reach .
Especially if the places are complex or there 's lots of different ways to get from one to the other .
In linear levels there 's little need for this .
Signs
Valve 's Team Fortress 2 is an obvious example for guide signs .
The game features complex multiplayer maps that sometimes even change during gameplay .
To help the players learn and cope there 's a lot of signage throughout the levels .
These signs are clearly visible and generally make it easy for the player to figure out which route to take to get to a certain area .
They also fit in well with the visual style and theme without seeming out of place , even though they are clearly huge .
Lines
Portal , another Valve game , is a good example of lines .
Even though the individual areas are n't too big , the interplay of the different interactive elements can be complex at times .
To help here the game visualizes logical connections , such as between a button and a door , by using glowing lines .
These are a great help when navigating the environment .
They also have the added bonus that they transmit a lot of other information as well , something that 's generally hard to do with immersed navigational tools .
These lines also display the states of the different interactive objects ( button pressed , energy on ... ) and their links ( button A opens door B ) .
Lines are also used to great effect in the apple orchard level of the horror game Condemned : Criminal Origins .
Playing an FBI investigator , the player has to use his equipment to follow clues such as blood trails .
This technique is used throughout the game , but since almost all the levels up to this point are linear , it is of little importance .
In this second - to - last map , however , the player is in an old farmhouse .
Here he can freely explore the house , but to make sense of it he has to use his special lamp to light up the four different trails of scrawled writing .
Following each of them to their conclusion is required before the player can continue the game .
This works really well as the player is unable to fight back while using the light and ends up easily distracted following the writing as it crawls up walls and continues along the ceiling .
The 2008 Prince of Persia video game also makes great use of lines , albeit a very subtle one .
In this game , the player 's wild acrobatics include walking along walls or climbing up columns .
This variety of movements makes it harder to decide what to do when .
To help with this the game features scratches and other damage to display the different paths .
If there are scratches along a wall then that means that to continue the player has to perform a wall - run .
This is a subtle method that works well with the setting but has the problem that once there are different routes the player is n't sure which one to follow .
Conclusion
Okay .
So that 's all the tools and methods I can think of .
I hope that you 've enjoyed the read and that it got your gears spinning .
However , to give you something to really work with I want to close the article with some tips on when and how to best use the presented tools and methods .
The first step to using them is already done : now that you 've read the article and are now definitely aware of their existence can begin to consciously use them to solve your design problems .
This does n't mean that you 'll always have to throw so much information at your player that he feels like he has no other choice but to follow your instructions .
An important part of all these tools is that they make it easier for the player to make meaningful decisions .
They do not remove his ability to decide .
This is why methods such as sealing off all doors after the player has passed through them to only allow him to move forward are not listed above .
Also keep in mind that less is often , as they say , more .
In some instances it can be desirable to not give any navigation hints .
For example , the madness maze that can be found in Max Payne is such a case .
Here the player is supposed to have a hard time finding the right path .
All the walls look alike and so the player will wander around aimlessly .
This can be annoying but since the area in the example is quite short it 's not so frustrating as to become a problem .
However if you decide to provide some help to the player , how do you go about it ?
Below I 'll have a couple of notes and tips for you .
There 's some repetition of important information mentioned above but there 's also some new points in there as well .
I 've chosen to use a bullet point format to make it easy to get an overview .
So that said , let 's get started :
Discrete Navigation Tools
Discrete Tools are the general rules of the game used in many environments
They are a part of the game 's Graphical User Interface
Discrete Tools are designed by the Game ( or Interface ) Designer
They can communicate more information than just spacial data ( position , line , area , volume )
They can easily adapt to moving or changing targets
Discrete tools are used consciously by the player
Are often very obvious and hard to overlook
The information displayed through them seems very important
Discrete Tools can be optional , players can adjust or deactivate them
Too much information and options can easily confuse the player
What are the properties of Maps and when and how do you use those ?
Maps provide an abstract view of the game space as an overview
They are best used in games with non-linear maps , complex spaces where tactical use is important or levels with lots of units
Games where you want the player to focus on the game itself should not use maps
Simplify the display as much as possible while still making it easy for players to quickly understand where each place is
3D maps are often too complicated to use quickly and easily
Static maps are good for games where you only want to communicate information since they are less complicated
Complex games where there are lots of resources and units to manage do benefit from an interactive map
Separate screens provide you with more screen real estate to use for the map but this breaks the regular game flow
If during your game the player often needs to sneak a quick glance at the map it's better to display it embedded in the GUI
A map on a separate screen hides the regular view and often needs to pause the game , especially if its static .
This breaks game flow
A live map does n't interrupt gameplay but in stressful situations it becomes difficult to both pay attention to the game and the map
If your game features a strong element of discovery then the uncovering of the map helps support this
If the game is less about uncovering the map but rather about how to use the environment then it makes sense to make it all visible
Unlocking parts of the map can be a great bonus if this information grants the player an advantage such as showing a hidden route
This can even be used with already fully unlocked maps by displaying previously secret information like a secret area with powerups
This is especially helpful for environments where the player has a lot of different routes that he can take and side paths he can uncover
This is only really needed if the map is areas of the map are visible without the player having visited them , maybe because they were visible from the start or because they were unlocked as a bonus
The right degree of abstraction is criticalMaps can be static ( no interaction with the game itself ) or interactive ( allowing interaction , often while the game still runs )
Maps can be a separate screen or an element of the regular game interfaceMaps can be a paused or live , that means being displayed and updated while the game runsAreas on the map must first be uncovered by visiting them .
Alternatively the entire map is visible from the beginning Areas on the map can be uncovered as a bonus , maybe through collecting items or fulfilling side - questsMaps can mark areas already visited by the player
What are the properties of Markers and when and how do you use those ?
They are best used in games where the player needs to be aware of the precise location of different important targets and their states
They make more sense in non-linear maps but can also be used in linear environments
This makes it easy to understand what the marker refers to once the target area or object is visible
When the target is not in view , the marker is also hidden forcing the player to look around .
Here Markers can be well complimented by compasses
Marking the target only when it's on screen makes it easy to understand what to do within the visible area but provides no navigational help otherwise .
This makes sense for very localized interactivity that would otherwise not be entirely obvious
Always showing a marker is useful for when the target is of relevance regardless of position
Markers highlight a target or target area by using a graphical interface elementMarkers are visible in the regular game view , directly marking the target
They can be displayed only when the object is visible or all the time
Markers can also be shown / hidden based on the player 's distance to the target to achieve a compromise
They can easily communicate additional information about the target area
Because of this markers are very useful to highlight targets of varying types and different states
This means that the players will make conscious use of Markers
Too many elements however can distract the player or clutter the screen .
Fading out Markers when they would obstruct ( near the center of the screen perhaps ) could help mitigate this .
Markers are " in the face " of the player which makes them look quite important
What are the properties of compasses and when and how do you use those ?
They are best used in games where the player needs to be aware of rough direction towards important targets
They are mostly used in non-linear maps but can also be used in linear environments , especially if the target is in motion
It can sometimes be difficult to understand what the compass is pointing to , especially if the target area or object is n't otherwise marked .
Here Markers can be used to clarify
This slightly unclear information can be an essential game element by making the player actively search for the target and explore the area
Because of this markers are very useful to highlight targets of varying types and different states
When they 're in the middle of the screen players are consciously aware of them
Like with Markers , too much can clutter the screen .
Fading out the compass when not needed can help lessen the negative impact
Compasses point the player toward a target by means of the graphical user interfaceCompasses only give a rough direction towards the targetCompasses can communicate additional information about the target areaCompasses can look quite important , especially if they 're in or near the center of the screen
So that 's all about the discrete tools , now on to the immersed methods , their properties and a few pointers on how to use them .
Immersed Navigation Tools
They are a part of the environment
They use elements of the Level Design toolkit and are the responsibility of the Level Designer
Immersed Tools have a stronger effect when they are linked with gameplay elements
Consequent use of gameplay related hints is necessary to work properly
Small changes can often be enough to properly lead the player on but note that the amount and scale of hints is relative to the size of the space they are in
Immersed Methods are different based on the specific application in a certain level
What are the properties of Attract Methods and when and how do you use those ?
Use these if your players always turn left and end up in a dead end while you want them to go right
They are only really useful if there 's specific routes you want to highlight , regardless whether the level is linear or not
These methods are used to attract the player to a certain location to subtly steer him through the level
What are the properties of Identify Methods and when and how do you use those ?
Identify your areas if your players get lost in the level and do n't have a clue where they are
These only really make sense if you have open levels where the player can freely navigate or if you 've got a lot of back and forth movement
To help with this , the game can teach the space to the player so he will develop a mental model of the different areas
Alternatively Maps and Guide can help as well .
They are especially useful if they can easily be visually linked to the target ( by style or color for example )
Identify methods are used to distinguish different areas so the player knows his relative position within the levelAwareness of the different areas still does not make the player understand their spatial relation .
What are the properties of Guide Methods and when and how do you use those ?
If your players never know how to get to the place they want to visit
This is only really relevant if the player has a choice of routes to take , that means non-linear levels
Guides are used consciously by the player
These methods are used to provide guides so the player can chose which way to go to reach his intended target

I , for one , am thrilled that Dr. Dean is outside the White House , agitating for real healthcare reform .
He 's much more effective out here than on the inside , being back - stabbed by Rahm :
Howard Dean has emerged as President Barack Obama ’s chief antagonist from the left on healthcare reform , raising questions over whether Obama made a mistake by snubbing Dean for a position in his administration .
Dean ’s strong advocacy for creating a broad government - run health insurance program , known as the public option , has become a headache for Obama while at the same time giving liberals a powerful spokesman with national credibility .
Dean , who once declared himself a representative of the “ Democratic wing of the Democratic Party , ” has been traveling the nation this summer offering his own views on Obama ’s healthcare proposal .
His uncompromising stance is reminiscent of his 2004 presidential campaign that took many Democrats by surprise , and has begun to symbolize a rift between the president and those activists who played a major role in electing him .
Oh , yeah .
Yoo hoo , over here !
Remember us ?
“ Howard Dean has been the bully pulpit for the grass roots , expressing what the majority of Americans across the country are feeling but using his profile to make it newsworthy , ” said Adam Green , co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee ( PCCC ) , a liberal activist group that supports the public option .
“ It might have been a blessing in disguise that Howard Dean was not brought into the admin because it has allowed him to be bully pulpit for the overwhelming majority of American people who support the public option . ”
Soon after Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a television interview that the public option is “ not the essential element ” of healthcare reform , Dean took a strong opposing stance .
“ You can't really do health reform without it , " Dean said of the public option in a television interview Monday , calling a major government role “ the entirety of healthcare reform . ”
His comment spearheaded a week of liberal criticism of the administration ’s mixed messages on healthcare reform .
( Obama insisted on Thursday that his position on the public option has not changed and described it as “ a good idea ” but “ not the only aspect . ” )
His potential to torpedo the administration ’s signature domestic proposal is somewhat ironic given Obama ’s efforts to enlist potential adversaries in his administration rather than face their wrath .
Dean was once considered a candidate for secretary of Health and Human Services .
Obama passed him over while appointing former rivals and potential adversaries to Cabinet posts .
He named his primary rival Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of State and asked Sen. Judd Gregg ( R - N.H. ) , a longtime critic of Democratic fiscal policy , to serve as secretary of Commerce .
Dean ’s friends and former advisers privately blamed White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel for the snub , recalling the bitter feud between the two over how to spend party funds when Dean was Democratic National Committee chairman and Emanuel headed the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
Yeah , but Dean would have been a reminder every single day that it was his strategy that won back Congress for the Dems , not Rahm's - and that Rahm 's candidates are the ones blocking healthcare reform .
And well , you know how sensitive Rahm is .
Ten years ago , I was sent from Britain by a global Islamist group to recruit in Pakistan .
Stepping off the plane in Lahore , I slowly breathed in the scene around me .
With minarets and azans almost like background props and mood music , the Muslims I saw in every direction whetted my appetite for revolution .
We were going to radicalise the country and foment a military coup against the democratically elected " client " ruler , Nawaz Sharif .
I was 21 years old .
I was part of a vanguard to set up a Pakistani branch of Hizb ut Tahrir ( HT ) , so that their future caliphate could go nuclear .
Nothing was going to get in my way .
Nothing did .
Ten years on ( during which I spent five years as a prisoner of conscience in Egypt ) , I recently returned .
I had left HT and recanted Islamism .
I was back , determined to reverse some of the Islamist fever I had helped instil .
Whereas in 1999 Pakistanis thought my wife and I were Arabs due to her " Egyptian " headscarf , now rumours were rife about acid attacks on women walking the streets uncovered .
I was older , wiser and smarter .
This time , the revolution would be against Islamist hegemony .
I was on a four - week , nationwide university tour to speak against Islamism and to urge students towards pluralistic , democratic values .
Contrary to western mythology , Islamist radicals are found among the educated , the elite and the socially mobile .
Yes , a minority of Pakistani madrasas provide an ample supply of jihadists , but the ideologues are smart and modern .
Bin Laden , Zawahiri or , indeed , the many pseudo - intellectuals of HT are highly educated and socially mobile .
Many madrasas are simply antiquated religious schools belonging to the conservative but apolitical Barelvis , Pakistan 's majority religious denomination .
Jihadists despise this faction .
Nine days ago , a jihadist blew himself up in a Pakistani mosque , murdering the leader of the Barelvis , Dr Sarfraz Naeemi .
The poor are simply used as jihadist cannon fodder .
Thus it was that we began in Karachi and worked our way around the country .
We ventured deep into the deserts of interior Sindh and then across into the turbulent outback of Quetta , Balochistan , where the Taliban and al - Qaida fighters are said to be headquartered .
From there , we crossed into the Punjab , ascended into Kashmir and then finally up to Islamabad .
In our flak jackets , with a security detail in tow , we addressed thousands of students .
In Quetta , armed separatist students threatened to shoot anyone coming to the talk .
Their gripe was with the Pakistani government from which they wanted independence .
Like so many things in Pakistan , our role in this was eventually settled over a cup of " chai " .
My first real taste of the diversity that is Pakistan came here .
I met popular revolutionaries who despised Islamists , yet wanted to secede , in some cases by violence , from Pakistan and " Punjabi hegemony " .
They began their speeches in the name of Allah , but ended with : " Death to Pakistan . "
They blamed the " Punjabi " government squarely for the ills of jihadism .
Destroying Pakistan was not exactly on my agenda .
Pakistan and its problems are not monolithic and are not all related to Islamism .
Corruption , ethnic and economic factors and a lack of leadership all play out differently in each province .
I found the people of Sindh to be hugely sympathetic to our message .
Conversely , the people of Mirpur , in " free " Kashmir , from where more than 90 % of British Pakistanis come , and where sterling is a currency of choice , were hostile to the west .
It was in Punjab where I found most of the denial culture .
The west was to blame for everything , including sending me as an agent to set up HT in Pakistan and then as an agent trying to push back HT .
You see , the trouble with conspiracy theories is that they were invented by the infidel west to stop Muslims thinking .
In Lahore , I was attacked by a British member of HT .
He , like many others , had left the UK to recruit vulnerable Pakistani students .
He was also a teacher at a private university .
After this attack , we started receiving death threats .
Our security advised us to cancel the rest of the tour .
We chose to carry on .
It is true that Pakistan has exported its fair share of Jamaat - e - Islami Islamists and pro-Taliban jihadists to British shores .
Many Pakistanis are in denial about the role their country has played in the growth of Islamism and jihadism .
When we pushed them , however , most acknowledged the rise of the " religious right " .
Denial is never a good thing when trying to solve a problem .
Here in the UK , after the release without charge of the 12 Pakistani student terrorism suspects , we could do with a dose of truth serum too .
During the rise of British Islamism in the 1990s , HT was exported to Pakistan from Britain by the likes of me .
In London , in 2000 , I met Sandhurst - trained Pakistani officers who had been recruited from here and were being sent back to Pakistan to instigate a military coup .
The man who physically attacked me was a British citizen who joined HT in the UK .
British members of HT also played crucial roles in exporting their group to Indonesia , Malaysia , Kenya , Mauritius , India , Egypt and Denmark , among others .
I know because in each case I know the people who did it .
Only when the people and governments of Britain and Pakistan take responsibility for the rot on their doorsteps can we start moving seriously towards solutions for the problem of extremism .
Our tour was partly to initiate such a thought process .
By showing people that one does not have to be against Islam to be against Islamism , we hope to resolve the moral dilemma that many face .
Military means can only ever be a stop - gap .
As the near Taliban takeover in the northern regions of Pakistan showed , if civil society cannot segregate the masses from Islamists , then American drone attacks will be the least of our worries .

At a State Department townhall conducted by Secretary Clinton , a staffer asked why Internet Explorer is mandated , even though Firefox is security - approved for the " entire intelligence community . "
The answer ?
A whole lot of bullshit , especially the insane citing of " expense . "
Internet Explorer is n't mandated in every governmental department , and Firefox has been vetted and cleared as just as secure as IE ( duh ) , so it 's a legitimate question :
Why not use the faster , safer , more customizable and more reliable browser ?
Clinton has no idea why Firefox is barred , which is totally fine with us — we really are happy she 's spending her time on other things .
Advertisement
But Undersecretary Patrick Kennedy chimes in that it's " an expense question , " at which point he is promptly and rightfully shouted down that Firefox is free , for god 's sake .
He goes into a lot of nonsense about " patches " and how even things that are free are n't really free , which sounds to us like a lame attempt to explain away his first answer — he probably did n't know Firefox was free when he cited expense in the first place .
If Firefox has already been implemented in other sectors of government , it stands to reason that it could be adopted by the State Department fairly easily and quickly , and with minimal expense .
The rest of both his and Secretary Clinton 's answer is mostly impenetrable , metaphor - laden government - speak about cutting costs that , sorry guys , is n't going to make us forget that you just claimed a free and vastly superior program , one that 's already in wide use in other sectors of government , is too expensive to implement .

Pat Kennedy , you 're officially on my bad side .

MALANA , HIMACHAL PRADESH , India —
Half a dozen men , all in their 20s , began to stir as the first rays of sunlight broke over the snow - capped Himalayan peaks and warmed the interior of their guest house .
They had been smoking hashish and drinking whiskey until the early morning hours .
Within the first hour of daylight , they lit up and began smoking again .
They would not stir from their spots until sleep overtook them , a cycle they had established over the past couple of weeks .
This is the vacation many drug tourists experience in Malana , an ancient village of 1,600 known internationally for its " Malana Cream , " coveted as some of the best hashish in the world .
Most villagers can speak just enough English to facilitate a hashish sale .
“ Do you want charas [ hashish ] ? ” one man asked a visitor .
“ No charas , no thank you . ”
“ Charas ?
Malana Cream ?
You want . ”
“ No , thank you . ”
He looked confused .
The mostly illiterate residents of Malana make their living from cultivating cannabis , or " charas , " and have almost no other industry .
Decades of mafia domination and a desire for quick cash has reduced a village with a rich history spanning thousands of years to little more than a drug production facility .
This is something O.P. Sharma would like to change .
Sharma , once a farmer , then a narcotics officer , and now a freelancing anti-drugs activist , seeks not merely to eradicate cannabis from the area , but to provide the villagers with alternative cash crops as well .
“ For the last three decades or more these people have been cultivating cannabis almost exclusively , ” he said .
“ These people have never grown anything which is legal . ”
News of the extent of Himachal Pradesh 's drug cultivation broke in 2006 when Iram Mirza , a young journalist with CNN 's local affiliate , went on an undercover reporting trip through the region .
She found that thousands upon thousands of acres of unclaimed forest land in the mountains were being used for cannabis cultivation .
European and Israeli drug mafias pulled all of the strings .
Similarly , a recent tour of the mountains and ridges surrounding Malana revealed scores of terraced fields full of cannabis .
“ The cops come and raid with 100 , 200 , 300 men with swords , cutting down charas wherever they see it , but it 's only once in a blue moon , and they never find the good plants , ” said a drug user named Sumit ( who asked that his real name not be used for fear of arrest ) .
Despite the fact that the hashish they cultivate ultimately becomes some of the most prized in the world , people in Malana live in squalor .
Raw sewage flows across paths in the middle of town .
Health and education facilities are poor .
Many villagers suffer from eye and skin infections .
Drug use begins at a very young age .
One reason for the village 's lack of infrastructure is that the villagers receive only a tiny portion of the returns from their crops .
Buy a tola , or 10 grams , of the best hashish in Malana , and you 'll pay $ 30 .
But once that same hashish makes its way to Delhi , the price increases threefold , while the rate in Goa is 10 times the original sale price .
“ In Amsterdam , it 's like a vintage car , ” Sumit said .
“ Dealers can name their price . ”
In this system , the transporters and dealers , not the cultivators , make most of the money .
Sharma hopes his plan will show the Malana villagers it is possible to make a decent living growing something other than cannabis .
For the first step of the plan , Sharma secured a $ 3,900 grant from Sai Engineering Foundation Shimla to purchase almost 6,000 pounds of sweet peas and beans , which he gave to 225 of Malana 's villagers to be planted .
Sharma figures a husband and wife farming team in Malana can make about $ 935 per year growing beans and sweet peas , versus what he estimates as a $ 1,000 - per - year return on cannabis cultivation .
He hopes the fact that his alternative crops are legal will persuade villagers to turn to them .
It wo n't be easy .
Mirza is betting 60:40 odds — against Sharma .
“ It 's a herculean task , ” she said .
“ You see , cannabis is such an intrinsic part of their culture .
It 's just growing out there ; you can't control it .
I saw fields — entire mountains covered with it — 3,000 acres of land under cultivation .
Why would an average farmer go for an alternative crop ? ”
Only this summer 's harvest will reveal the project 's success .

Within 24 hours of the footage first airing on Channel Nine , T - shirts emblazoned with " chk chk boom " , the phrase which Ms Werbeloff used to describe the gunshot , were being sold on a US website .
There were also drink bottles with the slogan and a rap - music remix of her video .
But Ms Werbeloff has been forced to admit her " eyewitness " account was bogus .
As she prepared to tell all on Nine 's A Current Affair , detectives told The Sun-Herald last night Ms Werbeloff 's account of the shooting of Justin Kallu , 27 , the so - called " skinny wog " , was made up .
" We have interviewed her and she has not witnessed the shooting , " said acting Kings Cross Police crime manager , Detective Inspector Matt McQueen .
" She has admitted to making it all up and has not witnessed the shooting . "
After the phenomenon went global , Ms Werbeloff joined forces with a publicist , who would not respond to questions from The Sun -Herald yesterday .
But not everyone has jumped on the bandwagon , with more than 750 people signing up to a hate site on Facebook .
Inspector McQueen would not say what motivated Ms Werbeloff to go on camera and claim to be a witness .
Police said they have ruled out laying any public mischief charges against her .
Media blogs last week reported that Ms Werbeloff had been working for The Projects , the management agency co-owned by her PR agent , Adam Abrams .
Mr Abrams denied Ms Werbeloff worked for the agency , but said she had done an exclusive deal with Nine and would not be speaking to other media .
" Clare wo n't be commenting [ until ]
Monday night on A Current Affair as she wants to tell the story once in full , " he said .
A source said Ms Werbeloff 's older sister had been " embarrassed " by her sibling 's new - found fame , and that Clare was fearful of retribution from the gang members who she mocked .
( Adds market reaction , quote )
NEW YORK , July 29 ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Treasury sold $ 39 billion in five - year debt on Wednesday in an auction that drew poor demand , raising worries over the cost of financing the government ’s burgeoning budget deficit .
Demand overall was below average , measured by the bid - to - cover ratio of 1.92 , the weakest in almost a year .
In a further sign of weakness , yields at the auction were well above expectations , known as a “ tail ” by market participants .
A key proxy for foreign interest , the indirect bidder category , was slightly above the average of auctions over the past year at 36.6 percent but far below the most recent sale .
“ It was just a horrendous result , ” William O’Donnell , head of U.S. Treasury strategy at RBS Securities in Greenwich Connecticut , said about the auction .
“ It was the weakest bid - to - cover since September 2008 , and by my numbers it was the biggest tail since February 1993 .
It was just a very , very weak result . ”
The tail indicates that dealers drove an unexpectedly hard bargain to raise yields , and lower prices , to buy the bonds , which spooked the bond market .
Five - year notes US5YT=RR fell further , last trading down 10 /32 , with the yield rising to a four week high around 2.66 percent .
Benchmark 10 - year notes US10YT=RR surrendered their gains for the day and dropped into negative territory after the sale .
They were last trading down 3/32 , yielding 3.71 percent versus 3.69 percent at Tuesday 's close .
The five - year sale is part of this week ’s record $ 115 billion in coupon securities being auctioned .
With the government set to issue $ 2 trillion in new bonds this year to finance economic and financial rescues , investors have been watching for any signs of waning demand for U.S. debt , particularly among foreigners .
Treasury auctions have come under particularly close scrutiny since investors began to question the longevity of the United States ’ prized AAA credit rating back in May .

It was just the sort of good news the British military in Helmand needed .
Soldiers engaged in Operation Panther 's Claw , the huge assault against insurgent strongholds last week , had discovered a record - breaking haul of more than 1.3 tonnes of poppy seeds , destined to become part of the opium crop that generates $ 400 m ( £ 243 m ) a year for the Taliban .
Ministry of Defence officials more used to dealing with negative stories about the British operation in southern Afghanistan swung into action to extract the maximum benefit from this unexpected PR coup .
A press release hailed the success of the offensive , and armoured vehicles were hastily laid on to allow the media , including the Guardian , to visit the site where the seizure was made , an abandoned market and petrol station that was still coming under sustained enemy fire when the reporters arrived .
Major Rupert
Whitelegge , the commander of the company in charge of the area , tugged at one of the enormously heavy white sacks .
" They are definitely poppy seeds , " he said emphatically .
Except they were n't .
Analysis of a sample carried out by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation in Kabul for the Guardian has revealed that the soldiers had captured nothing more than a giant pile of mung beans , a staple pulse eaten in curries across Afghanistan .
Embarrassed British officials have now admitted that their triumph has turned sour and have promised to return the legal crop to its rightful owner .
Dr Samuel Kugbei , the chief FAO technical adviser in the Afghan capital , said : " We have been waiting all day to see these dangerous materials brought from Helmand and now we see that they are just mung beans ! "
The pulses also fooled Colonel General Khodaidad , Afghanistan 's minister of counter - narcotics , even though the spherical black beans , about the size of small ball bearings , looked nothing like poppy seeds .
When shown the mung beans by the Guardian , he said they were a strain of " super poppy " .
The beans were introduced into Afghanistan about 10 years ago and have been embraced by farmers as a way of growing a second crop during the year .
They are also delicious with rice , Kugbei noted .
If indeed the sacks did contain 1.3 tonnes of mung beans , then they would have a street value of $ 1,300 – not much , but a major blow to any farmer if the British had followed procedures and destroyed the beans .

A team of British engineers has broken the longest - standing world land speed record in California .
The steam car , Inspiration , recorded an average speed of 139.843mph ( 225.06 km/h ) at Edwards air base , in the Mojave Desert , smashing the 1906 record .
For the Federation International Automobile record , the Hampshire - based team had to finish two runs in opposite directions , less than an hour apart .
American Fred Marriot held the record set in 1906 of 127mph ( 204 km / h ) .
The car really did handle beautifully
Charles Burnett III , driver
The 25 - foot - long , three - tonne " kettle " was driven by its main financier Charles Burnett III from Lymington , Hampshire .
It reaching a peak speed of 136.103 mph ( 219.04 km /h ) on the first run and 151.085 mph ( 243.15 km /h ) on the second .
The record was smashed at 0819 local time ( 1619 BST ) .
Speaking from California , Mr Burnett said : " I would n't like to leave it this close again , it was the last but one day we had to do this .
" It was absolutely fantastic I enjoyed every moment of it .
The car really did handle beautifully .
" It is a privilege to be involved with such a talented crew , what we have achieved today is a true testament to British engineering , good teamwork and perseverance . "
The British team smashed the world record set in 1906
The team only had until Wednesday to attempt the record before they were due to return home .
Its first attempt was dashed when the car 's turbine became stuck on Wednesday , 19 August .
The car will be brought back to England and will end up at the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu , Hampshire .
It is made from a mixture of lightweight carbon - fibre composite and aluminium wrapped around a steel space frame chassis and fitted with 12 boilers containing nearly two miles of tubing .
There ’s that awkward moment in your software development life when you realize that most of the people in your company are n’t programmers .
Scanning your address book reveals Marketing , Sales , Accounting , Human Resources , and yes , the “ business people ” with their Masters of Business Administration ( MBAs ) .
I ’ve always been curious about what MBAs really do .
In my weaker moments , I ’ve even thought that the only reason people got an MBA was to demand a higher salary or to “ move up the corporate ladder ” into some management job .
What did these MBA ninjas actually learn in school ?
Would having an MBA help me better understand how I affected my company ’s bottom line ?
Although I had the curiosity , I never acted on it .
This changed when another programmer recommended that I read The Ten - Day MBA by Steven Silbiger .
Sure , I knew that no one would anoint me with a real MBA at the end of the book any more than watching MIT lectures online would make me an MIT grad .
Besides , going to a nice MBA school is more about being around other motivated people and professors .
The real value in having an MBA is in applying the concepts , not the concepts themselves .
Disclaimers aside , I was determined to read the book and take notes on what a programmer should know about an MBA .
Day 1 - Marketing
Every developer painfully learns that technology does n’t win on its own .
At best , it just gives you a shot at marketing .
Marketing is proof that software does n’t sell itself , no matter how good it is .
A software company might have a Marketing Requirements Document ( MRD ) that outlines what the next version will contain .
This usually is the result of a standard marketing analysis that the book outlined :
Consumer Analysis -
Who are they ?
What do they want ?
How many different segments of people do you have ?
Is the buyer of your product different than the user ?
( The book gives the example that women buy the majority of men ’s socks and underwear , thus it ’s good to market appropriately ) .
Market Analysis -
How big is your target market ?
Is it new ?
Is it growing ?
Where is the product in the life cycle ?
Competitive Analysis - How do your Strengths , Weaknesses , Opportunities , and Threats ( SWOTs ) compare to your competition ?
Distribution Analysis -
What “ channels ” does your company use to reach your customer ?
Who are the intermediate players ( e.g. the Apple Store , Amazon.com , etc ) ?
What cuts do they take ?
What are their motivations ?
Plan the Marketing Mix -
How will you differentiate your products ?
How will you place it , promote it , and price it ?
Determine the Economics -
How long will it take before you break even ?
What are your fixed costs vs. margin costs ?
( Thankfully software has a low marginal cost ) Revise - Tweak and repeat as needed .
One big marketing theme is to “ own a word in the consumer ’s mind ” :
If you establish one benefit in the consumer ’s mind , the consumer may attribute other positives as well to your product .
FedEx means “ overnight delivery . ”
Only one company can own a word and it is tough to change it once it ’s established …
The easiest way to own a word is to be first .
Consumers tend to stick with products that work for them .
Kleenex cleans runny noses .
p.26
This explains why your family still uses MapQuest despite your repeated attempts to show them how much better Google Maps is .
It ’s also helpful if your product name matches what it does .
“ Drano ” is easier to remember than a “ Web 2.0 ” name like Qoop .
I was surprised to learn that the popular online advertising term Cost per Thousand ( CPM ) , is a relatively old term that has long existed in print media .
In general , the more targeted a group is , the higher the CPM is .
This explains why a programming ad on Stack Overflow can probably fetch a better CPM than the same ad on a site like Pandora , even though programmers use both .
Marketing people typically have their reasons for doing things that frustrate us .
For example , if your software will take a long time to get through a distribution channel or marketing foresees a long customer buying process , they might begin to “ market ” your code long before a beta is available with the belief that it ’ll hopefully be read by the time the customer is ready to buy .
Sometimes marketing has to make an extreme choice .
When GTE faced rebuilding its tarnished brand in the 1990 ’s , it was probably a clever marketing person who suggested that they give up on fixing their brand name and re-brand themselves as Verizon .
Despite all the good advice , I was disappointed by the book ’s lack of coverage of the Apple / BMW style of “ marketing ” the engineering department can do by creating a remarkable product .
Creating a product that allows users to quickly jump over the “ suck threshold ” is just one example where a programmer can make a tremendous “ marketing ” contribution .
Day 2 - Ethics
Ethics seems easy to understand : “ Do to others as you would have them do to you . ”
The hard part is realizing how the “ others ” are affected by your actions .
Others include customers , executives , shareholders , suppliers , employees ( and their families ) , the government , the planet , and the “ future generations . ”
Unfortunately , when simplicity is lost , Sarbanes - Oxley Acts are found .
Day 3 - Accounting
In theory , accounting is simple .
Just answer these questions about your entity / business :
What does a company own ?
How much does a company owe others ?
How well did a company ’s operations perform ?
How does the company get the cash to fund itself ?
- p.72
If you get nothing else out of accounting , know how to read a balance sheet .
Although Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer dropped out of Stanford ’s MBA program to become employee # 24 , he knew balance sheets were important :
In 1980 , I came in to “ be a business person ” whatever that meant .
Did n’t know much .
Frankly all I ’d ever really done is interview for jobs and market brownie mix .
I was n’t exactly well credentialed .
I ’d taken the first year at Stanford Business School so I can read a balance sheet – that was pretty important .
We did n’t have that much money back then so there was n’t much to read .
But anyway those lessons were important .
Balance sheets are simple to follow :
As the name implies , the balance sheet is a “ balance ” sheet .
The fundamental equation that rules over accounting balance is :
Assets ( A ) = Liabilities ( L ) + Owners ’ Equity ( OE )
What you own ( assets ) equals the total of what you borrowed ( liabilities ) and what you have invested ( equity ) to pay for it .
This equation or “ identity ” explains everything that happens in the accounting records of a company over time .
Remember it ! - p.83
For example , your work computer is a company asset ( which explains the “ asset ” tag on it ) .
Your company created an equal liability to pay for it .
When your company started , the founders gave up some of their money to increase the new company ’s cash assets ( left side ) in exchange for stock in the company ( right side ) .
For example , we can read Google ’s balance sheet for the first quarter of 2009 and see :
Assets = $ 33.51 Billion Liabilities = $ 3.66 Billion Owner Equity = $ 29.85 Billion ( which includes $ 14.98 Billion in “ retained earnings ” that Google is keeping for growth rather than giving it back to the owners of its 315.75 million shares )
Sure enough , everything “ balances ” :
From basic data , we can derive a bunch of helpful ratios to see how healthy Google is :
Liquidity / Current Ratio = ( Current Assets / Current Liabilities ) = 33.51 / 3.66 = 9.14 ( Greater than 1 means there ’s room to pay for liabilities ) Financial Leverage = ( Total Liabilities + Owners ’ Equity ) / OE = ( 3.66 + 29.85 ) / 29.85 = 1.12 ( Greater than 2 indicates a company is using a lot of debt to operate ) Return on Equity = ( Net Income / Owners ’ Equity ) = 1.42 / 29.85 = 4.77 % ( Which indicates how efficiently the company is using shareholder equity ) … and many more …
Day 4 - Organizational Behavior
The whole purpose of Organizational Behavior ( OB ) is to get you to think before you act around people .
You want to motivate people ?
OB has an equation for that :
Motivation = Expectation of Work will lead to Performance * Expectation Performance will lead to Reward * Value of Reward .
Feel free to tweak the variables as you see fit .
You can Manage by Objective ( MBO ) where you set goals and then get out of the way or you can Manage by Walking Around ( MBWA ) where you play a more active role in day - to - day execution .
The best choice depends on your environment and culture .
You might need to mix the two .
Remember that we humans are delicate creatures with our own wants and desires .
Be careful .
Day 5 - Quantitative Analysis
Quantitative Analysis ( QA ) explains why Excel has so many functions that I ’d never heard of .
A core idea is that “ a dollar today is worth more than a dollar received in the future . ” ( p.173 ) .
Imagine that someone promises to pay you a dollar in a year if you give them money now .
What is that worth to you today ?
Obviously , it matters on how much you trust them to pay you back .
The more you trust them , the more you ’re willing to give them now .
Similarly , the less you trust them , the more you might “ discount ” that dollar in the future because they ’re tying up money that could be used for better investments .
This is called the “ discount ” or “ hurdle ” rate .
Having a 10 % discount rate means that the dollar in the future has a net present value of $ 0.91 today :
$ 1 * ( 1 + 10 % ) - 1 = $ 0.91
This simple idea has lots of consequences .
For example , let ’s oversimplify things and say that you can spend $ 2,000 today to buy and maintain a server that will last for 3 years or you can lock in a price with Amazon for that same server for $ 800 a year for the same 3 years .
A naïve person would just see that $ 2000 is less than $ 2400 , but a QA person that assigns a 10 % discount rate would see :
… and come to the conclusion that it ’s about $ 10 cheaper , in today ’s dollars , to have Amazon maintain the server .
You can also do the inverse calculation .
Assume you ’re Amazon and that server costs you $ 1800 today and you can get someone to pay you $ 800 a year for it for 3 years .
What is your internal rate of return for this investment ?
Here we see an internal rate of return of about 16 % on the server .
We could also use the time value of money to include valuing users .
Early adopters of eBay and Twitter were worth more per user than late adopters because the early ones were more likely to tell their friends who had n’t used the service and thus attract more new people .
Day 6 - Finance
Finance blends time , money , and risk .
To start , a business needs a structure that gives it some capital .
Popular options include :
Sole Proprietorships -
An individual or a married couple .
You are effectively your business .
All earnings are treated as personal income and taxed appropriately .
You take in all the profits but also have unlimited liability .
You ca n’t divide the company up .
It ’s simple , but the downside is that it makes it hard to raise money .
Partnerships - Involves more people than a proprietorship .
Several people come together and can be general partners ( each having unlimited liability ) or limited partners ( liable up to the investment ) .
As a partner , you pay taxes on your percentage of the business ’s income on your personal taxes .
Corporations - Effectively you give birth to a new legal entity that is distinct from the shareholders .
Most large companies are “ C Corporations ” and have a double taxation issue where the corporation ’s income is taxed and the dividends it issues to shareholders are taxed as well .
If you have a smaller company with fewer than 100 shareholders , you may qualify for “ S Corporation ” status .
S Corporations usually do n’t pay income tax and instead rely on shareholders to pay the associated tax on their percentage of the income .
This tends to give S Corporations the legal liability benefit of corporation status and the single taxation benefit of partnerships .
Corporations issue stock to raise money .
Stock entitles the holder to a residual claim on earnings and assets after other debt obligations have been met .
One obvious question is “ what ’s a good stock price ? ”
This has a lot of factors , such as a company ’s growth potential and the company ’s earnings .
Popular metrics include a company ’s ratio of its stock price divided by its earnings ( P/E ratio ) .
Higher P/E ratios tend to indicate that shareholders have higher expectations the company will grow and eventually make more money in the future .
Some examples :
Company P/E Ratio Google 31.47 Microsoft 13.98 Amazon.com 54.98
After you raised some capital , you should carefully think how you ’ll spend it .
There are many ways to do this .
The Payback Period Method has you calculate how long it ’ll take to recover your investment .
The shorter the payback period , the less risky the investment is .
For example , adding RAM is so cheap that the productivity boost has a short payback period .
In contrast , completely rewriting a huge codebase might have put your company out of business before you get your money back .
Another approach is to use the Net Present Value Method to see how much the investment will return over its lifetime in terms of today ’s dollars .
Once you determine the discount factor to reflect the risk , you only consider investments that have a positive Net Present Value .
Day 7 - Operations
Operations is about making stuff .
Popular operations guys include Frederick Taylor from the late 1800 ’s who is famous for breaking up tasks into small pieces and walking around factories with a stopwatch to find the “ one right way ” of doing them .
Elton Mayo ’s bold claim was that caring about your employees mattered .
You could even make terrible working conditions if the employees were otherwise treated well and felt important .
Although some MBAs might use some programming techniques like optimizing flow - charts to improve operations , it ’s more likely to see factory techniques used when managing programmers .
Oversimplifying things , software development is a factory that turns capital into code .
To this end , you ’ll often see popular manufacturing processes like Toyota ’s Kanban method of using visual cards to control workflow making their way into our world as “ new ” or “ agile ” software methodologies .
Day 8 - Economics
Economics is the magic that allows me to write software in exchange for steak burritos .
As Adam Smith realized , society as a whole becomes “ wealthier ” when we seek division of labor to specialize and do something well rather than trying to do everything ourselves poorly .
At a micro level , economics is a simple matter of supply equals demand .
When you look at the larger / macro economies , more complicated equations pop up like this one :
This equation shows that it ’s important that money is moving around ( e.g. is n’t hidden under your mattress ) and that prices are stable or have reasonable growth .
One of the best things about the economics of software is that it has really low marginal costs ( e.g. the cost to copy it ) .
With processors , bandwidth , and storage all roughly following Moore ’s Law exponential curves , the capacity is doubling every 18 - 24 months which implies that the cost for a fixed amount is falling by half over the same period .
As Chris Anderson points out in his book Free , it can sometimes makes sense to round these increasingly lower marginal costs down to zero and make money in different ways such as advertising or selling complements .
It ’s hard to find other industries that have as many economic freedoms as software .
Day 9 - Strategy
Strategy should be simple : have a remarkable product that people want .
Bad things happen if you do n’t do this .
It ’s especially helpful if you have a cash cow you can milk for lots of money to fund new initiatives .
For example , Google makes so much money from ads that it can have this strategy :
Revenue = Amount of Web Pages Viewed
Google ’s strategy of getting you to view lots of pages ( which conveniently have Google ads on them ) explains a lot of what it does .
From wanting to speed up the web , to making a free phone OS , to creating a ton of free services to keep you hooked on the web .
Google really does n’t care what you do so long as you enjoy it and take in the targeted ads .
The book tended to focus on more traditional forms of strategy such as “ cost leadership ” , “ differentiation ” , and “ focus on the customer ” as well as applying lessons from the famous prisoner ’s dilemma .
I acknowledge that these are important as well , but I think that at its core , strategy can be simple .
Day 10 - Minicourses
The book ended with “ minicourses ” in areas relevant to business such as :
Property ( real estate , patents , copyright , etc )
Leadership ( e.g. schools want to create ‘ leaders ’ because they ’ll be better future donors ) .
Although those were interesting , the section I enjoyed the most was on business law .
In our jobs , we often bump into legal matters .
We face End User License Agreements ( EULAs ) and Non-Disclosure Agreements ( NDAs ) that we rarely read and often do n’t fully understand .
It was interesting to see any proper contract requires the following four conditions to be valid :
Capacity of Parties - Parties must have legal authorization and be mentally capable to enter into the agreement .
Mutual Agreement ( Assent ) or Meeting of the Minds - There must be a valid offer and an acceptance .
Consideration Given - Value must be given for the promise to be enforceable .
Legality -
You ca n’t enforce a contract dealing with illegal goods or actions .
When bad things happen , it can sometimes escalate to a “ legal action ” which has a standard procedure involving steps you sometimes hear in the news :
Jurisdiction -
For a court to hear a case , it must have “ jurisdiction ” to hear the case and power to bind the parties the decision .
Pleadings -
The paperwork to start the trial process .
The plaintiff ( p ) files a complaint asserting that the defendant (? ) has done something wrong and requests a punishment or remedy .
Discovery - Lawyers gather witnesses and evidence before a trial .
Each side is allowed to see the evidence held by the other side .
Pretrial Conference -
The lawyers and judge try to focus the case on the most important issues .
This is also good time for out - of - court settlements if possible .
Trial -
Occurs before the court .
The jury decides the factual disputes .
The case can be thrown out by the judge with a “ summary judgment ” if it has no merit .
Jury Instruction by the Judge and the Verdict -
The judge instructs the jury about the relevant law involved and the jury makes its decision about the facts and penalty within its authority .
Posttrial Motions - Options include asking for a retrial if an error of law or procedure occurred ( e.g. jury misconduct ) .
Appeal - Each party in a lawsuit is entitled to one appeal at an appellate court where they can file a written brief with arguments for a new trial .
Secure or Enforce the Judgment - Send the person to jail and / or collect money .
While the short overview was intriguing , it enforced my belief that it ’s important to have an attorney or a lawyer when it comes to the legal matters .
At the very least , they usually have malpractice insurance if things go really bad .
Conclusion
The Ten Day MBA helped me move from being unconsciously incompetent about business administration to becoming consciously incompetent in just a few days .
I think that alone made it worth the time .
I do n’t have aspirations to get a real MBA , but I now have more respect for those that do .
And now , back to programming …

CANBERRA ( Reuters ) - Rescuers were trying on Monday to save dozens of pilot whales after almost 200 beached themselves on an island near Australia ’s southern state of Tasmania , with many already dead .
Rescuers said only 54 of the 194 pilot whales who stranded themselves on King Island , between Tasmania and the Australian mainland , late Sunday were still alive .
But wildlife authorities were confident that those who had survived the beaching could be saved .
Seven dolphins also beached themselves .
“ It ’s amazing , some will some die straight away , some will survive for days .
These are fairly robust animals , pilot whales , we experienced that in the past , ” Chris Arthur , from Tasmania ’s Parks and Wildlife Service , told Australian state radio .
“ While they ’re alive there is a chance , ” he said .
The latest mass beaching takes the number of whales stranded in Tasmania ’s northwest over the past three months to more than 400 , and follows the deaths of 48 sperm whales in January .
Mass strandings of whales occur periodically in Australia and New Zealand for reasons that are not entirely understood .
Theories include disturbance of echo- location , possibly by interference from sound produced by human activities at sea .

Arthur said more than 150 local people were helping parks officials in trying to refloat the surviving whales from a flat stretch of sand at Naracoopa beach and shepherd them back to sea , where a large number of whales were still milling in a pod .
“ Families , children , mums and dads , grandparents all here helping out doing their bit under the guidance of a local parks ranger , ” King Island Council General Manager Andrew Wardlaw told local radio .
Weather bureau officials said the rescue effort could be complicated by strong winds expected to bring rougher sea conditions .
Pilot whales are among the smaller whales , typically up to about 5 meters ( 16 feet ) in length and dark with a grey underbelly .
Your arteries are the rivers within you that continually transport essential nutrients and oxygen from your heart to the rest of your body .
A big part of staying healthy and keeping your arteries clean is your diet .
After all , as they say , you are what you eat — it makes sense that your health reflects what you put into your body .
If you eat a lot of processed foods laden with saturated fats , chemicals , and toxins , all that gunk is going to cling to and clog up your arteries over time — increasing your risk of a serious heart - related problem , such as a heart attack or devastating stroke .
It ’s been reported over and over that eating a diet full of fresh fruits and vegetables ( preferably organic ) can really help prevent heart disease and other life - threatening ailments .
It also helps scrub away built - up clogging plaque in our arteries .
There ’s power in knowing that we have the choice to eat and consume healing , healthy foods that can help keep us healthy and strong .
Below is a list of some very special foods that are particularly effective in keeping arteries clean .
Garlic
Eat garlic and eat it regularly — at least a clove a day .
Raw or cooked , garlic adds a wonderful flavouring to all kinds of recipes , from soups and casseroles to salad dressing and roasted vegetables .
Dating back to ancient times , garlic has a long history of use in treating all kinds of heart - related diseases and hypertension .
Studies have shown that high doses of garlic ( 2,400 mg of deoderized garlic per day ) significantly lowers both diastolic and systolic blood pressure .
Also , studies have shown that eating it regularly can reduce harmful cholesterol by 10 percent or more and may prevent blood clots from forming .
Eating one to four cloves a day is estimated to provide 4,000 mcg of allicin , one of garlic ’s most beneficial compounds .
If you prefer to take a garlic supplement instead of eating raw garlic because of the strong smell , look for one with the active ingredient “ alliin , ” because this substance is relatively odorless until it is converted into allicin in the body .
Grapes
Red seedless grapes are a good source of lutein — a carotenoid that ’s been shown to help reduce early atherosclerosis .
Recent studies have shown that lutein also helps prevent thickening of the carotid artery in the neck , an indication of atherolscrosis .
It also lowers inflammation of LDL cholesterol in artery walls .
Concord Grape Juice
Juice made from whole Concord grapes is a powerful artery - clearing wonder — both grape - skin and grape - seed extract together have excellent heart health properties .
They contain :
Quercetin , an antioxidant that prevents LDL cholesterol from sticking to the walls of arteries
Resveratrol , which removes inflammation and blood clots
Procyanidins , which helps keep blood vessels clear
You may have heard of red wine 's relaxing effect on the arteries .
A new study indicates that Concord grape juice stimulates arterial relaxation in a similar manner — in fact , it even induced a prolonged relaxation effect ( up to six hours ) that has not yet been reported with red wine .
Dr. Valérie Schini - Kerth and a team of researchers of the Université Louis Pasteur de Strasbourg , France , found that Concord grape juice stimulated the production of nitric oxide in endothelial cells , providing a vasorelaxation effect .
It is known that nitric oxide is important in the body ’s natural system for maintaining healthy , flexible blood vessels and supporting healthy blood pressure .
Cherries
This small but potent fruit contains over 17 compounds that help clear clogged arteries of plaque even better than vitamin supplements .
These compounds are found in the anthocyanins that give cherries their red colour .
Cherries hold more antioxident power than well - known vitamin C and E supplements .
What 's more , because cherries are whole food , they contain fiber and it is easier to absorb all of their wonderful nutrients .
Strawberries
Perfect to toss into your breakfast cereal , strawberries are also loaded with antioxidants , including vitamin C and E , ellagic acid , assorted carotenoids , and anthocyanins .
They can cut cholesterol levels by 10 percent .
Try to buy organic strawberries as non-organic strawberries tend to be heavily sprayed with pesticides .
Apples and Grapefruit
Both of these fruits contain pectin , a soluble fiber that lowers cholesterol .
It has been shown in animal studies that pectin will slow down the progression of atherosclerosis and the clogging of arteries .
Apples are a rich source of “ quercetin , ” including potassium and magnesium — minerals that keep your blood pressure under control .
A French study found that eating two apples a day can help prevent and reverse “ hardening ” of the arteries .
The red delicious and granny smith varieties are also rich in procyanidins .
Sweet Potatoes
Full of cholesterol - lowering fiber , potassium , beta carotene , folate , and vitamin C , sweet potatoes help to lower your blood pressure and keep your arteries clear .
Green Tea
Drinking just one cup a day will give great antioxident protection .
The flavonoids in green tea are known as “ polyphenols , " powerful antioxidants .
Green tea also contains procyanidins , which prevents blood clots from forming and promotes healthy endothelium — the tissues that line your blood vessels and heart .
Hawthorn Tea
Hawthorn berry extract can calm palpitations , help restore blood vessel elasticity , ease fluid build - up and stop fatty degeneration in the heart , help dilate coronary arteries , and reduce blood pressure .
Hawthorne can be used by those already on cardiac medication and may help you decrease your dosage .
To make a tea from them , buy a bag of organically grown berries at a natural food store and steep them in hot water .
Hawthorn has not been shown to have any adverse side effects .
Olive Oil
Research has shown that not all fats are created equal .
Olive oil , a monounsaturated fat , is on the list of “ good ” oils ( other good sources of monounsaturated fats include avocados and nuts ) .
Studies have shown that particles of LDL ( bad ) cholesterol that contain monounsaturated fats are less likely to become oxidized .
This is important because only oxidized cholesterol is able to stick to your artery walls and form plaques .
Using a “ cold - pressed ” organic olive oil as your main source of oil may cut your risk of coronary heart disease almost in half .
Of course , remember — no matter how " healthy " the fat , it is still fattening .
So go easy and do not eat to much .
A good strategy is to avoid the bad fats , such as the cookies , ice cream , red meats , salt - laden cheese and butter , and to replace them with the healthier unsaturated fats .
While we 're on the subject of oils , a tip :
Do n't use canola oil — unless it is organic , the overwhelming odds are that it is made from genetically modified canola .
Salmon
Again , not all fats are alike .
Omega - 6 and omega - 3 are both fatty acids ; while the former has inflammatory effects , the latter fights inflammation .
Most people eat diets overloaded with omega - 6 , which is found in vegetable oils like soybean or corn oil .
However , fish , especially fatty fish like salmon , herring , and tuna , are some of the best sources of omega - 3 fatty acid nutrients .
The American Heart Association recommends including two fatty - fish meals a week in your diet .
Wild salmon , in addition to tasting great , is really rich in omega - 3 , which makes the blood less likely to clot within your arteries , thus preventing cholesterol from becoming damaged or oxidized .
( Farmed salmon is not recommended because it is full of toxins and far less omega - 3s ) .
A nice combination for dinner is to include salmon and spinach — which will give you plenty of omega - 3 , vitamin C , and vitamin A , all very good for your arteries .
Note :
It ’s recommended to limit your consumption of tuna and halibut , as deep - water fish are known to have more toxins — salmon is definitely better .
Spinach
We 've already mentioned spinach .
Why is it so good for you ?
It 's chock full of vitamins C and A .
Both of these vitamins help prevent cholesterol from becoming “ oxidized , ” which in turn prevents clogging plaque from building up in your arteries .
Swiss Chard
This alternate leafy green is an excellent source of vitamin E , another antioxidant that helps prevent free radicals from oxidizing cholesterol .
Eating a diet rich in vitamin E has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of developing clogged arteries .
Tomatoes
Tomatoes are rich in carotenoid lycopene , an antioxidant that can nearly halve your risk of atherosclerosis .
Tomato juice , soup , and ketchup ( low - sodium choices ) give you a more concentrated form of the antioxidant than fresh tomatoes .
Also , antioxidant - rich tomatoes may make LDL cholesterol much less susceptible to becoming oxidized — a first step in the formation of artery - clogging plaque formation .
Garbanzo Beans
All beans contain both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber , two important parts of your diet that help remove cholesterol - containing bile rom your body .
However , garbanzo beans are one of the best on the fiber front .
They are also known to help prevent heart disease .
Happy Eating !
So , those are a few foods that are particularly cleansing — there are also several effective herbs that are easy to add to your diet .
Happy eating folks !
I wish you all great heart health !
Most sincerely ,
Weaver

Dutch DJ Tiësto in DJ Hero game
Famous Dutch DJ
Tiësto will be heard in the new console game DJ Hero this year according to an interview published dj MixMag magazine .
The involvement of DJ Tiësto to this version of Guitar Hero has long been the subject of speculation , but has now been confirmed by DJ Tiësto himself .
Dj Tiësto will lends his music to the game DJ Hero , a successor to the popular Guitar Hero .
DJ Tiësto himself will not be seen but only you will be able to play his music .
DJ Jazzy Jeff and DJ Shadow will be virtual present in the game via motion capture .
DJ Hero , comes with ‘ turntables ’ to mimic mixing and scratching of familiar songs .
The principle is similar to the immensely popular Guitar Hero game , but this time with a new controller and new music genres .
The game allows users to be an internationally renowned DJ with a plastic turntable such as DJ Shadow and Jazzy Jeff .
The Dutch band Within Temptation previously lent their music to Guitar Hero .
This led to them a significant boost in popularity .
Seventy years ago this month , The Wizard of Oz opened and began a career in which it has been seen by more people than any other movie .
But it has one other great distinction : no Hollywood film has been more dogged by rumour , legend and myth .
To mark the anniversary of the world 's most famous movie , we set out to see what , if any , substance is in these claims .
To do so , we interviewed all but one of the surviving members of the cast , each of them actors who played Munchkins .
The result is 2009 's version of what really happened on the Yellow Brick Road .
The Munchkins were unruly orgiasts and drunks :
It has been confidently asserted down the decades that the Munchkin actors turned their Culver City hotel into a 24 - hour bacchanal .
The legend seems to have begun with producer Mervyn LeRoy 's statement , soon after the movie wrapped : " They had sex orgies in the hotel , and we had to have police on just about every floor . "
Many years later , Judy Garland chipped in with : " They were little drunks .
They got smashed every night and the police had to pick them up in butterfly nets . "
And Hollywood raconteurs such as David Niven added their own embellishments .
There were tales of one German so drunk he fell inside a toilet bowl ( a physical impossibility , even for someone 3ft tall ) ; and stories of pie-eyed midgets having to be rescued from the hotel roof by firefighters using the overworked butterfly nets ( unlikely , given that these are designed to support the weight of little more than a couple of red admirals ) .
Irvine Welsh wrote a play based on such tales a few years ago .
But Margaret Pellegrini , now 85 , who as a girl of 15 was one of the Munchkins , says : " There were a lot of them who liked to go out and have a few drinks , but nothing got out of hand .
Everyone was having a good time and enjoying themselves .
There was no rowdiness or anything like that , and those stories are very upsetting . "
Jerry Maren , now 89 , who sang in the Lollipop Guild that welcomed Dorothy to Oz , said : " There were a couple of kids from Germany who liked to drink beer .
They drank beer morning , noon and night , and got in a little trouble .
They wanted to meet the girls , but they were the only ones . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
One of the cast committed suicide : A certain kind of film buff will insist that , in the background of the scene where Dorothy meets the Tin Man , a Munchkin can be seen hanging himself from a prop tree .
Quite apartfrom the unlikelihood of the studio leaving such a shot in the final print , there is no record of any such death .
The figure , in fact , seems to be that of a large tame bird , used to give the woods some life .
But one Oz veteran did take her own life .
Many years after the film was made , in April 1962 , Clara Blandick , who played Aunt Em , became depressed at her increasing blindness and infirmity .
She changed into a royal blue dressing gown , arranged her press cuttings around her , and took an overdose of sleeping pills .
She was 81 .
The Munchkins were paid less than the dog : True .
They got $ 50 a week , and Terry , a four - year - old Cairn terrier who played Toto , got $ 125 a week , or rather her trainer did .
But Margaret Pellegrini insisted
Oz was a wonderful experience .
" My father worked in a hotel and earned about $ 5 a week .
I got paid $ 50 a week .
It took eight weeks to make the Munchkinland scenes , after which I stayed in Hollywood for a month to sightsee . "
Jerry Maren adds : " I 'd never met any little people .
I was the only small person in my family .
Making the film was the greatest fun I ever had in my life . "
The Wicked Witch was not very wicked in real life : Margaret Hamilton , the actress behind the green make - up , was a former kindergarten teacher whose lifelong interest in schooling led to her later serving on the Beverly Hills Board of Education .
But children found her frightening in the witch role , and she was ever after at pains to point out it was only a film and not how she really was .
Billie Burke , who played the Good Witch , was no teenager : True .
These days , the part of Glinda , the beautiful witch , would be played by some fresh - faced young actress .
MGM instead went for Burke , who , at 54 , was strikingly attractive .
Born in Washington DC , she had made her name on the English stage , and was married at one time to the manager of Morecambe pier .
After moving to the States , she married the great Broadway impresario Flo Ziegfeld , whose widow she was when Oz was made .
The studio originally wanted Shirley Temple for the lead :
Indeed they did , but either her singing was n't up to snuff , or there were contract complications with her own studio ( 20th Century Fox ) – the stories vary .
It does n't end there .
Lancashire warbler Gracie Fields was considered for Glinda , the good witch ; and Gale Sondergaard would have been the wicked witch but wanted to play the part as a vamp and refused to wear the ugly make - up .
The Munchkins were all dubbed : Untrue .
A lot of the singing and some voice parts were dubbed by professionals , but not all .
Meinhardt Raabe , now 92 , played the coroner .
He told us from Florida : " They auditioned several of the Munchkins for the part of the coroner , but most of them mumbled .
Because I had a background in public speaking , I could enunciate clearly , so they picked me .
I was the only one they could understand . "
Judy Garland was a bitch : The Munchkins insisted she was considerate at all times .
Jerry Maren said : " We met Judy Garland , and she was an angel .
She was a movie star and I 'd figured she'd be a pain in the neck .
But she was glad to meet us and we were glad to meet her . "
Margaret Pellegrini said the star was " so sweet and kind " .
" During our breaks , I would sit on the Yellow Brick Road and talk to Judy .
She was so excited to be with so many little people . "
Other Munchkin actors agreed ; none had a bad word to say about her .
At the end of shooting , Garland , then 16 , presented all 124 Munchkin actors with a signed photo and box of chocolates .
A studio top - dog wanted to drop ' Somewhere Over the Rainbow ' : Apparently true .
Louis B
Mayer reportedly thought the song slowed the film down too much .
Wiser heads prevailed .
The Munchkins found work after the film hard to come by : Well , there are a limited number of roles in Hollywood for actors under four feet .
But many went on to good careers , and most we spoke to led happy lives .
Margaret Pellegrini joined a couple of midget shows .
" I worked with them until I got married in 1943 and then raised a family . "
In 1985 , her life of going to Oz conventions started .
" Every year , The Wizard of Oz just gets bigger and bigger .
At the time , I thought it was just a film and I was making money .
Now I think back and realise how great it was .
I 've had a wonderful life . "
Jerry Maren said : " I was going to leave , but they said , Mr Maren , we have another movie for you – Tiny Troubles – and you 're the star of it .
They took a week to do that – they were pretty fast in those days , and I was going to go home , and they said I was needed for the Marx Brothers '
At the Circus . "
He stayed in the business .
" I did stunts – that 's where the real money was , so I made a lot of money . "
He still attends Garland and Oz festivals .
" It 's given me a good life , and I 've enjoyed every minute of it . "
Ruth Duccini , now 91 , was in several other movies before marrying .
Meinhardt Raabe , one of the few graduate Munchkins , has an MBA and worked in the meat trade until retirement .
He was also a qualified pilot .
And Karl Slover , who had four parts in the film – Munchkin , trumpeter , soldier and one of the " sleepy heads " – is now 90 .
He still attends
Oz events : " My friends and I never gave it a thought that the movie was going to last . "
And the missing Munchkin ?
She is Olga Nardone , who , at 3ft 4in , was the tiniest of all .
She is said to be a recluse , living in Boston .

Remote Desktop is a free tool which makes life of administrators easier and without it almost impossible .
With all its advantages , this tool has one flaw : by default settings Remote Desktop support is not enabled , and it is necessary to click in ONLY one field on the remote computer in order for us to be granted remote access to the computer .
Problem is exactly in word only , since it can be a problem if the computer is on the remote location , it is weekend , and we have no one who can help us .
Of course , there is solution for this .
All we need to do is to open Registry on local computer and select menu File , and option Connect Network Registry .
After this , in a newly opened window we write in the name of the computer we want to connect to .
It is important to mention that when we want to do this , we must have administrator privileges on the remote computer , e.g. we must be logged in as domain administrators on local computer .
When we are connected to the remote computer we need to find a key “ HKLM \ SYSTEM \ CurrentControlSet \ Control \ Terminal Server ” and the value of key “ fDenyTSConnection ” change from 1 to 0 .
After that , we close Registry Editor and restart the remote computer .
That you can do with following command shutdown -m \\computer1 -r .

For an increasing number of young people in the US there is more to skateboarding than stunts and jumps - it is also about spreading the word of Jesus .
It is estimated that there are now at least 300 skate ministries across America and more than 90 countries around the world have joined organisations like Christian Skaters .
While the skate parks do not attract the sort of massive crowds seen at Christian Rock concerts they are becoming a popular way of teaching young Americans about religion .
The BBC went to Ramp 48 in Fort Lauderdale , Florida to see what skateboarding for Jesus is all about .
Ontario's new high - security drivers ' licences jeopardize the privacy of motorists who use them to cross the U.S. border , warns Information and Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian .
Electronic signals from the licence cards – which use a radio frequency identification chip that transmits a number identifying the licence holder to border guards – could be picked up by unauthorized parties and users ' whereabouts " covertly surveyed , " she said in her annual report released yesterday .
Cavoukian is calling on Transportation Minister Jim Bradley to have the chips in the cards modified with on - off switches so that they can be turned off when drivers are not presenting them to border guards .
Bradley said the cards come in a protective sleeve that stops the signal and noted the manufacturer of the chips is not yet able to produce them with on - off switches , so Cavoukian 's wish can not be met " at the present time . "
The new licences are voluntary and will be required identification for crossing the U.S. border by land or sea starting June 1 , unless travellers have a passport or Nexus card .
In her report , Cavoukian noted the protective sleeve only works when the new licence card is placed in it , and that cardholders may find themselves using it at locations , such as stores , other than the border , increasing privacy risks .
" Most of the time , the EDL ( enhanced driver 's licence ) will function as a driver 's licence when driving within Ontario – and pulled in and out of one 's wallet countless times ... , " she warned .
" The reality is that most drivers will abandon the use of the protective sleeve , which does not fit easily into the slots found in most wallets . "
With an on - off switch on the cards , holders could turn the switch on only when they got to the border , Cavoukian added .
The province is now accepting applications for the new enhanced - security licences .
They cost $ 40 on top of the regular driver 's licence fee of $ 75 .
Abousfian Abdelrazik says he went to Sudan in 2003 to visit his ailing mother
A Canadian court has ordered the Ottawa government to allow the return of an al - Qaeda suspect , who has spent the last six years in Sudan .
Abousfian Abdelrazik , who has dual Canadian - Sudanese citizenship , was arrested in Sudan after going there on a visit in 2003 .
Canada has been refusing to issue him with an emergency passport so he can leave , and he has been in the lobby of the Canadian embassy for a year .
He denies any links to terrorism .
A Canadian federal judge in Ottawa has now ruled that the Canadian government has failed to justify its decision not to help Mr Abdelrazik .
He said the government should issue him with an emergency passport and arrange to fly him from Sudan to Canada within 30 days .
Mr Abdelrazik says he was beaten and tortured while in a Sudanese prison after Canadian agents allegedly recommended his arrest on suspicion of terrorism .
He has not been charged with any crimes , and Canadian intelligence officials have since acknowledged there is no information linking him to any crime .
OnStar to release new technology to remotely stop stolen cars
OnStar , the company that developed the Stolen Vehicle Slowdown , a technology that allows police to remotely slow down a vehicle that they suspect have been stolen , has developed yet another technological weapon to add to their arsenal against automobile theft .
Dubbed “ Remote Ignition Block “ , the technology is designed to prevent a car from starting through its ignition once an automobile has been reported and authenticated as stolen .
Remote Ignition Block operates via GPS , allowing OnStar to locate the automobile in question and remotely , in every sense of the phrase , shut it down .
Of course , the automobile has to be turned off first before this actually has any effect , and there ’s always the offshoot that carnappers only stand to use the cars only once , but at least the stolen cars will be unresponsive , posing no threat to other bystanders and will relatively be easier to track down and retrieve .
OnStar plans to wheel out this new feature in two million cars on its launch .

HELP Committee Vote Lines Up With Big Pharma Interests
Emily Calhoun | July 29 , 2009
July 29 , 2009 - On June 25 , during the Senate Committee on Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions ( HELP ) markup session of the health care reform bill , Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) offered an amendment that would improve consumer access to imported prescription drugs .
Specifically , this amendment would :
Remove the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) limitations on prescription drugs that have been imported from outside the United States ;
Require that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) verify that imported prescription drugs are safe ;
Ban manufacturers from engaging in actions that reduce the availability of qualifying imported prescription drugs ; and
Specify provisions for Internet purchases of prescription drugs .
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America ( PhRMA ) is opposed to drug importation legislation , citing safety concerns , and is on record opposing a similar bill introduced earlier this year .
The Senate HELP Committee did not pass this amendment : 12 Senators voted NO on the McCain amendment and 10 Senators voted YES .
As a result , the version of the health care bill that was reported out of the committee on July 15 did not include this provision .
MAPLight.org 's analysis of campaign contributions data reveals that Senators who voted with pharmaceutical manufacturing interests on this committee amendment received almost three times as much money from that industry than those who voted for the amendment .
From January 2003 through May 2009 , the 12 Senators voting NO on the McCain amendment received an average of $ 115,116 from the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry ; the 10 Senators voting YES received on average $ 41,975 .
These figures exclude contributions to presidential campaigns .
Methodology
Campaign contributions data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics ( CRP ) .
The text of the McCain Amendment ( Amendment # 4 ) and the recorded votes have not officially been released , but video footage of the markup session and roll call vote is publicly available on the Senate HELP Committee website : http://help.senate.gov/Hearings/2009_06_17_E/2009_06_17_E.html.
The parents of a Dutch teenager could be stripped of their parental rights after they chose to support their thirteen year old daughter 's plans to sail around the world alone .
Laura Dekker wants to break a world record for the youngest solo sailing mission , currently held by a 17 - year - old American .
But that would mean facing the prospect of extreme danger as well as a two - year leave of school , something she plans to overcome by remote learning through internet and email .
The girl 's parents , who are both keen sailors , originally supported her plans .
But Dutch child protection agencies intervened to suspend parental custody after her parents applied to take her out of school for two years .

The case , being heard in a civil court in Utrecht , is dividing opinion across the Netherlands .
The journey was originally planned for 1 September , but is now highly unlikely to meet that schedule as the family await the outcome of the case , expected this week .
Outside the courtroom , the case has led to a growing rift between the parents and social welfare officers .
" By travelling solo for two years , this teenager 's basic needs would not be met , " said Richard Bakker , a spokesman for the youth protection services .
" Yet the father continues to insist that his daughter will depart on 1 September .
That is worrying which is why we have asked to the court to intervene . "
But Dick Dekker , Laura 's father who earlier this year applied unsuccessfully for his daughter to be exempt from obligatory schooling , remains undeterred .
" We realise that it is a dangerous undertaking , " he told a local newspaper .
" But a court which knows nothing about Laura will decide .
We would not let our child do something of which she was not in complete control . "
In a recent written report to parliament , the Dutch education deputy minister Marja van Bijsterveldt - Vliegenthart said the voyage " would not be in the interests of the child " .
Laura has recently said : " My parents always knew it was a dream of mine to do this .
I want to do it while I 'm still young so that I can break the record .
Since I was 10 I had this idea I could do a tour of the world .
I simply want to discover the world and have a taste of freedom . "
The poor economy is taking a toll even on the dead , with an increasing number of bodies in Los Angeles County going unclaimed by families who cannot afford to bury or cremate their loved ones .
At the county coroner ’s office -- which handles homicides and other suspicious deaths -- 36 % more cremations were done at taxpayers ’ expense in the last fiscal year over the previous year , from 525 to 712 .
The county morgue , which is responsible for the indigent and others who go unclaimed , saw a 25 % increase in cremations in the first half of this year over the same period a year ago , rising to 680 from 545 .
The demands on the county crematorium have been so high that earlier this year , officials there stopped accepting bodies from the coroner .
The coroner ’s office since has contracted with two private crematories for $ 135,000 to handle the overflow .

“ It ’s a pretty dramatic increase , ” said Lt. David Smith , a coroner ’s investigator .
“ The families just tell us flat - out they do n’t have the money to do a funeral . ”
Once the county cremates an unclaimed body -- typically about a month after death -- next of kin can pay the coroner $ 352 to receive the ashes .
The fee for claiming ashes from the morgue is $ 466 .
Christopher Agosta ’s ashes are among those waiting .
Last month , the coroner called his sister , Tarnya Baker , 41 , of Amesbury , Mass. , to notify her that Agosta , 43 , of West Hollywood , had shot himself in the head .
Although Baker was her brother ’s next of kin , they had not spoken since he left Massachusetts for California 15 years ago .
Only after he died did she learn that he was in debt .
He shot himself as sheriff ’s officials attempted to evict him .
He left a note giving his possessions to the local AIDS clinic .

Baker said she wants to claim his ashes , but she and her husband have two children and a struggling glass - glazing business .
During the last two years , they have had to lay off their two employees .
“ I know that I ca n’t afford to handle all this , ” Baker said .
“ I ca n’t afford to fly out there and ask questions . ”
Coroners and funeral directors around the country say they are seeing the same trend as cash - strapped families cope with funeral costs .
Just claiming a body from the L.A. County coroner costs $ 200 .
Once a body is claimed , private cremations usually run close to $ 1,000 , Smith said .
Funeral homes charge an average of $ 7,300 to transport and bury a body in a simple grave , according to the National Funeral Home Directors Assn .
“ No one is immune from this , ” said Bob Achermann , executive director of the California Funeral Directors Assn. in Sacramento .
“ The economic malaise we ’re in is affecting everybody . ”

Coroner ’s investigators see the emotional and financial fallout up close .
“ You go to the house where the person who died was the only breadwinner , a traffic accident , and there ’s the wife and you see children , ” Smith said .
“ Especially with a younger family , it blows them out of the water . ”
Smith said that in his dozen years at the coroner ’s office , he cannot remember seeing such a high number of families unable to afford the cost of claiming a body .
If families ask , coroner ’s staff will refer them to several funeral homes , including 70 - year - old Allen English & Estrada Funeral Services in Bell Gardens , which offers cremations through its Cremation Society of Los Angeles .
The society ’s director assistant , Joseph Harvey , said cremations have increased about 15 % since the economic downturn last year .
His office cremates about 400 bodies a year and charges about $ 700 .

Harvey said the funeral industry is trying to do a better job of marketing itself in this economy .
He said the casket manufacturers he deals with have stopped selling some expensive models as demand wanes .
“ Families are making different choices based on the economy , choosing different caskets or urns or holding shorter services , ” said Jessica Koth , a spokeswoman for the National Funeral Home Directors Assn .
“ They ’re cutting back on floral memorials .
If they have a funeral procession , they ’re not having the family limousine . ”
Alfredo Xochipa , 27 , said he shopped around for a lower - cost casket after his 21 - year - old brother , Pedro , , was shot to death at a party in Los Angeles on July 4 .
Xochipa , who works for the county ’s Department of Public Social Services , found a metal casket at a warehouse store in Boyle Heights for $ 1,300 , about $ 1,000 less than retail .
Because his brother was a crime victim , Xochipa said , the coroner ’s office waived its $ 200 fee .
A week after his brother was killed , the family held a funeral and buried Pedro at Resurrection Cemetery in Montebello .

But even after receiving $ 7,500 from a state crime victims fund to defray costs , his family still owed more than $ 4,000 .
“ He had a lot of friends , and we have a lot of family , so that helped us out , we got a lot of donations , ” Xochipa said .
“ But there was still money that my dad had to request as a loan from friends . ”
Xochipa said his father , a truck driver , has not had luck finding work to pay off the funeral debt .
The family has applied for assistance from the Catholic Archdiocese .
Smith said he has seen many families go to great lengths to claim their loved ones ’ remains , despite financial setbacks .

“ We ’ve had families try to have car washes and other little fundraising events .
. . .
They try to do right , ” he said .
For the dead left to the county , officials attempt to recover cremation costs from the estates .
But the county does not require relatives to prove they are too poor to pay .
Smith said his office , with a staff of four , cannot investigate .
The morgue is similarly strapped .
If records later show a family could have paid to claim a body , by law the county can recover the cost .
Other counties investigate families ’ ability to pay .
San Mateo County Coroner Robert Foucrault , first vice president of the California State Coroners ’ Assn. , said his office recently began requiring applicants for county - funded cremations to submit a three - page application listing bank accounts , property or other assets .
“ We figure that will be a deterrent , ” Foucrault said .
“ We have found people that take advantage of the system .
They do have the funds to pay but feel because they have been estranged from somebody , they should n’t have to be responsible for the burial . ”

In some cases , family members say they have been delayed by Los Angeles County ’s next - of - kin policy , which requires that the closest living relative be given time to claim the remains .
Mark Hooper , 49 , of Lancaster , died in December of complications from hepatitis C. After his body went unclaimed , he was cremated at county expense .
At the time of his death , the carpet contractor was unemployed , ill , in debt and living near his parents in Lancaster .
His 22 - year - old daughter , Angelica Hooper , who lives in the San Diego area , said she intends to allow her grandparents to claim the ashes .
She also said she ’s been busy with work .

“ I have to keep my mind on other things , ” she said .
“ Just him passing was a lot to deal with . ”
Carol Hooper , 70 , a retired aircraft mechanic , said last week that her son struggled with addiction and had trouble holding down jobs .
But , she said , he was also a kind , giving person who made many friends growing up in Redondo Beach .
If her granddaughter does not claim the ashes , she will .
“ We ’re not rich ; we ’re retired , ” Hooper said .
“ But we ’ll make it for him . ”
In Massachusetts , Christopher Agosta ’s sister said she , too , is determined to do the right thing .

“ He is my brother , ” Tarnya Baker said .
“ He died alone .
I ’m bringing him home . ”
She has two years to claim his remains .
If she does n’t , Agosta ’s ashes will be buried with those of hundreds of others in a pauper ’s grave .

Call it an announcement of an announcement , if you will -- not quite as detailed as we'd like , but it 's one small morsel of information on the long road to the US ' second Android handset .
Perhaps in response to the Wall Street Journal 's suggestion that T - Mobile would be releasing details on its next Android phone next week , a company spokesperson has said just that : " Next week , T - Mobile will share more details about its next Android - powered phone , the follow - on device to the T - Mobile G1 with Google . "
No mention is made of what that phone will be , but the odds - on favorite has to be the myTouch 3G , seeing how it 's already launched in the form of the Google Ion -- it just needs a T - Mobile logo , some packaging , maybe a gently tweaked firmware , and it 's ready to rock .
It ’s looking increasingly likely that the whole iPod range will have some kind of camera inside .
Apple just upgraded the camera in the top - of - the - line iPod , the iPhone , which shows a commitment to picture - taking with its handhelds ( either that or Apple was just embarrassed that the original iPhone camera was so bad ) .
The iPod Touch is an obvious candidate for a cam , and reports now say that the company has ordered so many cheap ( $ 10 ) camera units that even the mass - market Nano could be able to snap pictures .
If Apple puts a camera in every iPod ( the dying Classic and the tiny Shuffle excepted ) , will it kill the compact camera industry ?
The answer might actually be yes .
First , think about how Apple does business with the iPod .
It is never the first , and often the products are feature - poor compared to the competition , but it is always dominant .
IPod means MP3 player .
Soon , phone will mean iPhone ( at $ 99 a pop , who in their right mind will buy a different phone and an iPod together ? ) .
With this kind of market saturation , Apple has the power to change whole product sectors .
We already said that the iPhone ’s new autofocus still and video camera is good enough for most people .
By simply dropping a cheap new part into every iPod sold , Apple could wipe out the small digicam almost entirely .
There will , between cellphones and iPods , almost no reason to buy a standalone camera unless you are an enthusiastic amateur , or a pro .
If you think this is sensationalism , take a look at compact camera sales figures .
They are dropping .
The only growth sector is DSLRs which are seeing strong sales despite These Troubled Times® .
This is partly because DSLRs are now so cheap , but also because , for many , the camera they have already , the camera came free with their cellphone , is good enough .
And remember , cellphones are often tortuously bad to use even for making phonecalls , let alone taking pictures .
And getting those pictures off the camera an onto a computer or the web ?
How does bamboo under the fingernails sound ?
The point is that Apple can put an easy to use — no , fun to use — camera in the pocket of everyone under 40 , a camera that is effectively free and will automatically sync all pictures back to the mothership via iTunes every time it is charged .
Now .
Imagine you are in the compact digicam market .
Should you be worried ?

You know the cool feeling on your feet every time you open the refrigerator door ?
If you did n’t know , that ’s the feeling of all your cold air falling out on the ground .
Cold air is heavy and naturally sinks down , which makes the design of most refrigerators suboptimal for conserving that cold air when opened .
Though convenient , this means that your refrigerator will be using a lot more energy than is necessary .
Well , what can you do about it ?
In Japan there are refrigerators with pull out drawers that help eliminate some of the problem , but importing a massive Japanese appliance is n’t likely to happen for most of us .
Luckily , there is a DIY solution that involves converting a deep freeze into an incredibly efficient refrigerator chest .
You can check out the DIY PDF here , but in summary , what the creator , Tom Chalko , did was get a chest freezer and modify the temperature control so that it held foods at the normal temperature a standing refrigerator would .
In the end , Tom had a fridge with a slightly non-traditional organization of foods , but one that only used about 100 watt hours of power a day , compared to most refrigerators , which use between 1 and 2 kilowatt hours per day .
If you ’re interested , be sure to check out the PDF for some more specifics .
Tom also put together a web page , and aparts list to make duplicating his efforts quite easy .

What was eating the earliest Europeans ?
Their rivals , apparently .
Human remains up to 800,000 years old have been found in an archaeological cave site in northern Spain .
They reveal that early Europeans killed and ate their adversaries , and took a special liking to the flesh of children and adolescents .
The abundant food and water available in the area indicate that the cannibalistic practice was not one of necessity .
AFP tells us :
A study of the remains revealed that they turned to cannibalism to feed themselves and not as part of a ritual , that they ate their rivals after killing them , mostly children and adolescents .
" It is the first well - documented case of cannibalism in the history of humanity , which does not mean that it is the oldest , " said [ project co-director Jose Maria Bermudez de Castro ] .
The remains discovered in the caves " appeared scattered , broken , fragmented , mixed with other animals such as horses , deer , rhinoceroses , all kinds of animals caught in hunting " and eaten by humans , he said .
" This gives us an idea of cannibalism as a type [ of ] gastronomy , and not as a ritual " .... [ Archaeologists ] found water and food in abundance , could hunt wild boar , horses , [ and ] deer , " which means that they did not practice cannibalism through a lack of food .
They killed their rivals and used the meat , " he said .
" We have also discovered two levels that contain cannibalised remains , which means that it was not a one - off thing , but continued through time , " he said .
" Another interesting aspect ... is that most of the 11 individuals that we have identified " as victims " were children or adolescents . "
NEW YORK , July 13 ( UPI ) -- New York Police Department officials said the city is spending nearly $ 1 million to purchase and maintain typewriters for the police force .
City officials signed a $ 982,269 contract last year with New Jersey typewriter manufacturer Swintec for the purchase of manual and electric typewriters during the next three years and last month the city inked a $ 99,570 deal with New York 's Afax Business Machines for maintenance on the typing machines , the New York Post reported Monday .

NYPD sources said the vast majority of the typewriters are for use by police .
Most of the city 's arrest forms have been computerized , but property and evidence vouchers printed on carbon - paper forms still require the use of typewriters .
" It just does n't make sense that we can't enter these ( vouchers ) on computer , " a police officer told the newspaper .
Dr. Edith Linn , a retired New York police officer and professor of criminal justice at the city 's Berkeley College , said many of the 500 police officers she interviewed for a study told her the outdated equipment makes them less likely to perform arrests for minor offenses .
An NYPD representative told the Post officials are working on software that would eliminate the need for the typewriters .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A proposal from a long - time congressional foe of the Federal Reserve that could give lawmakers sway over monetary policy has won the support of a majority in the House of Representatives , alarming officials at the U.S. central bank .
The Federal Reserve Transparency
Act of 2009 , put forward by Republican Representative Ron Paul of Texas , now has 250 co-sponsors in the House .
It will get air - time on Thursday during a congressional hearing on Fed independence that will feature testimony from the Fed ’s No. 2 official , Donald Kohn .
Public anger over the trillion dollars the Fed has put into play to battle the financial crisis and bail out investment bank Bear Stearns and insurer American International Group has created a backlash and calls for more accountability .
A proposal from President Barack Obama to put the Fed in charge of monitoring risks to the entire financial system has intensified the scrutiny .
Paul has tapped into this anger and put forward a 2 - 1 / 2 page bill that would explicitly repeal a provision of law that prohibits the Government Accountability Office , a government watchdog agency , from auditing monetary policy decisions .
Fed officials see this as a dangerous intrusion on their independence that could hinder their ability to make the best long - term decisions for the economy .
Paul , however , thinks Congress needs more control .
“ Why should they be independent ?
Independence to them means secrecy , do whatever they want , spend billions of dollars , bail out their friends , ” Paul told Reuters Television .
Paul ’s bill , which is co-sponsored by 78 Democrats , would also expose Fed transactions with foreign central banks ,
Fed emergency lending operations and discussions between Fed officials to scrutiny by the GAO , which can offer policy suggestions to lawmakers .
To become law , the bill would need to win support from the House Democratic leadership , who have yet to show an appetite to move the bill .
It would then have to pass the Senate , where support would likely be scarcer .
But analysts say Congress is unusually sensitive to the public mood in the wake of the crisis and say the bill must be taken seriously .
“ This is the most populist Congress that we ’ve seen in decades and legislation like this can quickly gain momentum if it is ignored , ” said Jaret Seiberg , a financial services policy analyst at the Washington Research Group .
Citing the recent congressional clamor over executive compensation and new rules on credit cards , he said Democratic leaders may be wary of blocking legislation they feel is picking up popular support .
“ This Congress has shown that when the electorate is upset it will act extraordinarily quickly ...
This should not have any legs at all , and the fact that it does shows how populist this Congress has become , ” Seiberg said .
The Fed , for its part , is taking Paul very seriously .
“ My concern about the legislation is that if the GAO is auditing not only the operational aspects of our programs and the details of the programs , but is making judgments about our policy decisions , that would effectively be a takeover of monetary policy by the Congress , ” Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said during congressional testimony on June 25 .
That would be “ a repudiation of the independence of the Federal Reserve , which would be highly disruptive to the stability of the financial system , the dollar and our national economic situation , ” he warned .
Co-sponsors of Paul ’s bill say the intention is not to clip the Fed ’s wings , but simply to let a little daylight into a very secretive institution .
“ It is important for them to remain independent .
But I still believe that these are taxpayer dollars , and the more light that is shined on expenditures and cost analysis is something that the taxpayer is entitled to , ” said Representative Shelley Capito , a Republican from West Virginia .
An effort in the Senate to attach a matching bill to other legislation was thwarted on procedural grounds .
But analysts say the bill could be offered up as a possible Republican amendment to any finance bill until midterm elections in November 2010 in the hope of persuading a few more Democrats to give it their backing .
“ There ’s a trade - off between their business as a central banker and their need for stability in the financial system and also their accountability and transparency , ” said Senator Jack Reed , a Rhode Island Democrat who is a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee .
“ That ’s going to have to be worked out .
I do n’t think there ’s yet a complete conclusion as to how that ’s done , ” he told Reuters .

Rubygems provides two things for the Ruby community .
A remote repository / packaging format and installer A runtime dependency manager
The key to good rubygems practice is to treat these two elements of Rubygems as separate from each other .
Someone might use the Rubygems packaging format and the Rubygems distribution but not want to use the Rubygems runtime .
And why should they ?
The Rubygems runtime is mainly responsible for setting up the appropriate load - paths , and if you are able to get the load paths set up correctly , why should you care about Rubygems at all ?
In other words , you should write your libraries so that their only requirement is being in the load path .
Users might then use Rubygems to get your library in the load path , or they might check it out of git and add it themselves .
It sounds pretty straight - forward but there are a few common pitfalls :
Using gem inside your gems
It 's reasonably common to see code like this inside of a gem :
gem " extlib " , " >= 1.0.8 " require " extlib "
This should be entirely unnecessary .
While using Kernel.gem in an application makes perfect sense , gems themselves should use their gem specification to provide dependent versions .
When used with Rubygems , Rubygems will automatically add the appropriate dependencies to the load path .
When not using Rubygems , the users can add the dependencies themselves .
Keep in mind that whether or not you use Rubygems , you can use require and it will do the right thing .
If the file is in the load path ( because you put it there or because Rubygems put it there ) , it will just work .
If it 's not in the loadpath , Rubygems will look for a matching gem to add to the load path ( by overriding require ) .
Rescuing from Gem:: LoadError
This idiom is also reasonably common :
begin gem " my_gem " , " >= 1.0.6 " require " my_gem " rescue Gem : : LoadError # handle the error somehow end
The right solution here is to avoid the gem call , as I said above , and rescue from plain LoadError .
The Rubygems runtime sometimes raises Gem:: LoadError , but that inherits from regular LoadError , so you 're free to rescue from that and catch cases with and without the rubygems runtime .
Conclusion
Declare you gem version dependencies in your gem specification and use simple requires in your library .
If you need to catch the case where the dependency could not be found , rescue from LoadError .
And that 's all there is to it .
Your library will work fine with or without the Rubygems runtime :)

I was n’t sure this column would pan out .
But with my savings and salary shrinking , it seemed worth a try .
Heck , how hard could it be ?
I ’d seen “ The Treasure of the Sierra Madre , ” the 1948 classic starring Humphrey Bogart and directed by John Huston .
( “ Badges ? ... I do n’t have to show you any stinkin’ badges ! ” )
That movie was the best meditation on prospecting for gold , and falling prey to greed , ever done  until the Bernie Madoff story .
Besides , with the American dream wobbling and the Golden State ’s luster dimmed , it seemed fitting to return to the Mother Lode of the Sierra Nevada foothills where the dream of audaciously striking it rich overnight was born 160 years ago , a Gold Rush that stimulated the world economy .
The 49ers  who Mark Twain described as “ a wild , free , disorderly , grotesque society ” of “ unspeakably happy ” men  stopped in San Francisco , two - and - a - half hours west of here , to buy supplies , such as bullets , salt meat and Levis .
( And to buy shady ladies , or “ soiled doves , ” as they were known , but we wo n’t get into that . )
My San Francisco supplies were more modern : pre-torn jeans , a skim latte , a G.P.S. , a cellphone and a laptop to get updates on the price of gold .
With the dollar diminished and financial institutions in the doghouse , a hard nugget suddenly seems a safer bet than an ephemeral derivative .
( Gold is trading at about $ 880 an ounce . )
News reports are heralding a neo -Gold Rush from Modesto to the Mojave Desert , a revival in prospectors at California ’s streambeds , spurred by the sputtering national economy , the state ’s 10.5 percent unemployment rate leaving many with free time and the weighty price of gold .

Understanding how to pair wine with a particular meal can feel like a daunting task for most people .
A good wine expert will tell you there are no " hard and fast " rules , but more simply , suggested guidelines to build on .
As you become more comfortable with wine and food , you will learn the old adage of ' white with white , red with red ' may not always prove to be the best pairing .
Many people ask how to learn the basics of wine pairing and Food & Wine Magazine did an excellent job of simplifying it in a 2007 article , " 7 Rules for Perfect Pairing . "
1. Serve a dry rosé with hors d'oeuvres
The combination of a lighter , more acidic white wine and the fruitiness of a red wine can be found in a good rosé , which makes it an excellent starting point for most appetizers .
2. Serve an unoaked white with anything you can squeeze a lemon or lime on
Typically , Chardonnay is an oaked white wine ( meaning it was aged in oak barrels versus stainless steel fermentation tanks ) .
Wine aged in stainless steel tanks typically are more acidic and have a vibrant citrus flavor .
The acidity and citrus in those wines , such as a Sauvignon Blanc , can enhance flavors in a meal by providing that lemon or lime juice flavor you might expect from something like a grilled salmon .
3 . Try low - alcohol wines with spicy foods
In my experience , this is where people tend to make the biggest mistakes .
Serving high alcohol or rich tannic red wines with spicy foods can completely ruin the experience of a good meal ( and a great bottle of wine ) .
F&W Magazine explains that alcohol accentuates the oils that make spicy food hot .
So , if you are serving something spicy , like Thai food , look for lower alcohol wines with a touch of sweetness .
The bit of sweetness found in wines , like an off - dry Rieseling , will do wonders in countering the spicy flavors of the meal as well .
4 . Match rich red meats with tannic reds
Here is where your favorite Cabernet Sauvignon belongs .
The tannic qualities in reds are what gives the wine its structure and the ability to stand up to the rich red meats .
F&W suggests a Cab or Syrah when serving foods like braised duck legs or pan-seared sausages .
5 . With lighter meats , pair the wine with the sauce
This is probably the most important one ( for me , at least ) .
I 've found that the sauce is where you really throw the old " rules " out the window and take a careful look at what you are serving .
Take three different methods of preparing the same dish and find three completely different recommendations for wine pairings .
The example F&W uses is pork chops cooked in a delicate white wine sauce versus a zesty red wine sauce .
The sauce on the pork chops would be the determining factor as to what wine would pair best with the meal , not the pork itself .
6 . Choose earthy wines with earthy foods
The earthiness in reds such as a good Pinot Noir or a Nebbiolo are best served with foods that have earthy qualities , such as wild mushrooms or bison steaks .
The earthiness in these wines is really accentuated when served with foods that possess similiar qualities .
7 . For desserts , go with a lighter wine
While I readily admit to enjoying the last of a particular Cabernet Sauvignon with some chocolate , it is best to have lighter wines with dessert .
Dessert wines are very sweet , so be careful as to not overwhelm the dessert .
A good rule of thumb is to serve a wine that is a touch lighter and less sweet than the dessert .
Moscatos and Madeiras are two popular dessert wine choices that pair well with most desserts .
Wine pairing is not always an exact science and you will find that practical experience is key .
Sometimes , I have found it beneficial to start with a wine that I like and then find a recipe that works well with that wine .
It helps me understand how the particular characteristics of that wine work with the food I am serving .
And when in doubt , I always turn to various wine pairing tools to help ensure I am not way off base , as there is nothing worse than wasting a good bottle of vino !

Syracuse Common Councilor Michael Heagerty needed 335 valid signatures on his petitions to run for re-election on the Democratic Party line , a generally routine task for any incumbent .
He was mortified to find Wednesday that he ended up one signature short .
And that he forgot to sign his own petition .
The city Democratic Committee had named Heagerty its designee in the 1st District and wanted to see his name in the Democratic line Nov. 3 .
Instead , district voters will find that spot blank .
On Wednesday evening , a reporter broke the news to Heagerty that he did n't sign .
" I did n't sign my own petition ?
You 've got to be kidding me , " he said .
The one - term incumbent will still be elsewhere on the ballot .
He has the Working Families Party designation and will be listed at least on that line in the general election .
He also will seek an independent party line by gathering at least 346 fresh signatures of registered voters in his district by Aug. 18 , he said .
Heagerty , the owner of Eastwood 's Palace Theatre and a pioneer developer in Armory Square , won the seat in 2007 after Republican incumbent Jeff DeFrancisco decided not to seek re-election .
Heagerty said he had about 20 volunteers helping him gather signatures of registered Democrats in the 1st District leading up to the July 16 deadline .
But some of the helpers inadvertently ventured across district boundaries and took signatures from people who do not live in the district .
Heagerty 's Republican opponent Matt Rayo challenged Heagerty 's petitions , and the county Board of Elections found 64 of Heagerty 's 398 signatures to be invalid - one too many to give Heagerty the Democratic line .
" In my 35 years experience , I can't remember anything being this close at the council or legislature level , " said Democratic Election Commissioner Ed Ryan .
Heagerty said he 's kicking himself for not gathering more valid signatures .
" We got almost 400 , and we figured we were good , " he said .
The incumbent said he believes voters will look down the ballot a few extra rows to find his name on Election Day .
" They 're going to find me , they 're going to know I 'm running , " Heagerty said .
In Syracuse , the Working Families Party line has always been a secondary line for candidates , said Rick Oppedisano , chairman of the local party chapter .
" If he were to run on our line alone and win , it would give us a little more validity as a party , " Oppedisano said .
" It would show that we have some clout . "
Rayo , a recent graduate of the state University College of Environmental Science and Forestry , has the Republican , Conservative and Independence party lines .
We live in epoch - making times .
I mean this literally , rather than as a tool to dramatise the global economic crisis or latest political scandal .
An epoch describes a geological time period .
The end of the last glaciation , some 11,000 years ago , saw the transition from the cool Pleistocene to the warmer Holocene .
This relatively stable epoch saw humans turn to agriculture and our population rise considerably .
Now geologists , ecologists and climate scientists , myself included , are reporting we have entered a new and much less stable geological epoch : the Anthropocene .
Just as changes to the Earth 's orbit , volcanic eruptions and asteroid impacts in the distant past have set the world on radically new courses , humanity itself has now become a collective force of nature , with far - reaching consequences .
But what does this startling discovery – that humanity has become a globally significant geophysical force – mean for society , solving environmental problems , and perhaps more profoundly , how we see ourselves ?
People have always had an impact on the environment .
The difference now is that rather than influencing only local environments in limited ways , humanity is having planet - wide impacts on the Earth 's workings .
The best known global change is the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide and resulting climatic changes .
Some of the CO 2 in the atmosphere dissolves into the oceans , making them more acid , which is degrading marine ecosystems .
To put this in context , the oceans are more acidic today that they have been for at least 800 millenia .
The atmospheric CO2 increase has also boosted plant growth in some places , changing the world 's forests and grasslands .
In short , the global cycling of carbon has been significantly altered .
The impacts of human activity on the other great global chemical cycles are similarly profound .
To increase crop yields , more nitrogen is added to ecosystems through fertiliser use , than is added by all natural processes combined .
But fertiliser run -off leads to ' dead - zones ' of low - oxygen water that currently affect 245,000 sq km of the world 's ocean .
Furthermore , scientists estimate that each year humans move more rock , sediment and soil than all natural processes , that at least three times as much fresh water is held in reservoirs than in rivers , and at least a third of all land has been appropriated for human use .
The heavy hand of humanity reaches into the living world too .
Each year , we extract 7 m tonnes of bushmeat from tropical forests , 95 m tonnes of fish from the oceans , and raze 80,000 sq km of forest .
The result : we are at the leading edge of the sixth mass extinction in Earth 's history .
Extinction rates today are at least 100 times higher than ' background ' rates .
Previous extinctions , such as that which wiped out the dinosaurs 65 m years ago , are joined by a human - induced loss of life .
Many of these trends look set to continue or accelerate , with potentially dire consequences .
Recent events may provide a taste of what 's to come : in 2007 and 2008 food protests erupted across three continents , in part because of the switch of some land from food to biofuel production .
In the same period , about 1 % of humanity had their homes damaged or destroyed by extreme weather events .
Interlinked feedback loops amongst political , economic and environmental spheres could lead to grave problems without foresight and planning .
The big question in the Anthropocene is : can we learn to manage our own global life - support system and avoid crossing dangerous thresholds ?
The answer so far , if progress in 14 years of UN climate change talks is a measure , is probably no .
But perhaps there are grounds for cautious optimism .
The word " Anthropocene " , coined by Nobel prize winner Paul Crutzen , has greatly assisted researchers in understanding how the Earth and human society function together .
Perhaps pushing the concept into wider usage would enable politicians , business leaders , social movements and NGO's to similarly benefit from thinking along integrated , quantitative and evidence - based lines .
Of course , scientific knowledge itself cannot set goals for society .
Choosing how to manage our life support system is within the realm of politics .
Scientists can identify the likely ( and unlikely ) outcomes of choices we face .
For instance , humanity 's impact on the environment has been greatest over the last 50 years .
In this time human numbers have doubled and the global economy increased more than fifteen - fold .
Our socio-economic system and the fossil fuels that power it lie at the heart of understanding how humans have become a force of nature , and therefore how to alter our future impacts .
Big ideas from science are often discomfiting .
The Anthropocene is no exception .
There is a temptation to see humanity as " bad " for despoiling the environment , or to deny the evidence through fear of acknowledging the need for profound changes .
I see it as an update on how we view our place in the universe .
First , Copernicus discovered that the Earth revolves around the sun , and humanity is not at the centre of the universe .
Then , Darwin established that we are not even at the heart of life on Earth .
Now Crutzen has reversed this trend by naming a new human - dominated geological epoch . .
The future direction of the only place in the universe where we know life exists is in our hands .
Suddenly , after almost 500 years , humanity is centre stage again .
Let 's not blow it .

Portland , Ore .
This often - drizzly city may be the most skateboard - friendly town in America .
In Portland , skateboarding has been woven into parks and streets in the same manner as cycling or soccer .
Skateboarding is illegal in downtowns across the country .
Portland ’s downtown is marked with “ skate routes ” ...
Harry Patch :
Never spoke about the war until he turned a 100 years old
Born 17 June 1898
A rude awakening
I had a brother who was a regular soldier .
He was in Africa when the war broke out .
He was a sergeant major in the Royal Engineers , who fought and was wounded at Mons .
And they kept him in England after that , as an instructor .
He never went back and he used to tell me what the trenches were like .
I did n’t want to go .
I knew what I was going to .
A lot of people did n’t and when they got to France they had a rude awakening .
The trenches were about six feet deep , about three feet wide - mud , water , a duckboard if you were lucky .
You slept on the firing step , if you could , shells bursting all around you .
Filthy .
Infected by lice
From the time I went to France - the second week in June 1917 - until I left 23rd December 1917 , injured by shellfire , I never had a bath .
I never had any clean clothes .
And when we got to Rouen on the way home they took every stitch of clothing off us : vest , shirt , pants , everything and they burnt it all .
It was the only way to get rid of the lice .
For each lousy louse , he had his own particular bite , and his own itch and he ’d drive you mad .
We used to turn our vests inside out to get a little relief .
And you ’d go down all the seams , if you dared show a light , with a candle , and burn them out .
And those little devils who ’d laid their eggs in the seam , you ’d turn your vest inside out and tomorrow you ’d be just as lousy as you were today .
And that was the trenches .
Fighting for their lives
You dare n’t show above otherwise a sniper would have you .
You used to look between the fire and apertures and all you could see was a couple of stray dogs out there , fighting over a biscuit that they ’d found .
They were fighting for their lives .
And the thought came to me – well , there they are , two animals out there fighting over dog biscuit , the same as we get to live .
They were fighting for their lives .
I said , ‘ We are two civilised nations - British and German - and what were we doing ?
We were in a lousy , dirty trench fighting for our lives ?
For what ?
For eighteen pence a flipping day . ’
Life in the trenches
You got tots of rum .
There were many a man who did n’t like rum , did n’t drink it .
It used to warm you up .
Life in the trenches , well … can you imagine now , going out from this room along the corridor and there is a trench dug across the lawn .
Six feet deep and three feet wide .
There is water and mud in the bottom .
You sit on a trench at the side to sleep , do n’t matter whether it is wet , fine , hot or cold .
Four days you are there and you got to stick it .
That was the conditions .
If any man tells you he went into the front line and he was n’t scared – he ’s a liar .
You were scared from the moment you got there .
You never knew .
I mean , in the trench you were all right .
If you kept down , a sniper could n’t get you .
But you never knew if the artillery had a shell that burst above you and you caught the shrapnel .
That was it .
Shell shock
You were in that trench .
That was your front line .
You had to keep an eye on the German front line .
You dare n’t leave .
No .
I suppose if you left , and some of them did , they were shot as cowards .
That is another thing with shell shock – I never saw anyone with it , never experienced it – but it seemed you stood at the bottom of the ladder and you just could not move .
Shellshock took all the nervous power out of you .
An officer would come down and very often shoot them as a coward .
That man was no more a coward than you or I .
He just could not move .
That ’s shell shock .
Towards the end of war they recognised it as an illness .
The early part of the war – they did n’t .
If you were there you were shot .
And that was it .
And there ’s a good many men who were shot for cowardice and they are asking now … that verdict be taken away .
They were not cowards .
Sleep in the trenches
Rats as big as cats .
Anything they could gnaw , they would - to live .
If you did n’t watch it , they ’d gnaw your shoe laces .
Anything leather , they would nibble that .
As you went to sleep , you would cover your face with a blanket and you could hear the damn things run over you .
As you to sat on the firing step , you could have a doze .
Not much more .
Half - past seven in the morning , stand - to and you ’d have an inspection .
Last thing at night , you ’d have an inspection .
You had to sleep in between .
No Man ’s Land
Probably you ’d hear something in No Man ’s Land .
It might have been a working party .
You reported it .
The officer would have a look through his field glasses .
If it was any good and it was n’t British , give them a burst .
Number
One would give them a shot or two out of the Lewis gun , and after firing that Lewis gun from one aperture , we would always move down the trench .
This was because , if it was spotted by a German observer there , the range was sent back to their artillery .
Staying put was an invitation for half a dozen rockets .
If you stayed where you were , you chanced it .
Going ‘ over the top ’
Never forget it .
We crawled , could n’t stand up - a sniper would have you .
I came across a Cornishman , he must have been from ‘ A ’ or ‘ B ’ companies who were the assault companies when we went over .
‘ C ’ and ‘ D’ , we were support .
I came across a Cornishman , he was ripped from his shoulder to his waist – shrapnel .
Now a bullet wound is clean , shrapnel will tear you all to pieces .
He was laying there in a pool of blood .
As we got to him , he said , ‘ Shoot me . ’
He was beyond all human aid .
Before we would pull out the revolver to shoot him , he died .
I was with him in the last seconds of his life .
hen he went from this life , to whatever is beyond .
Now what I saw in the way of sights at Passchendaele and at Pilkem - the wounded lying about asking you for help - we did n’t have the knowledge , the equipment or the time to spend with them .
I lost all my faith in the Church of England .
And when that fellah died , he just said one word : ‘ Mother . ’
It was n’t a cry of despair .
It was a cry or surprise and joy .
I think - although I was n’t allowed to see her - I am sure his mother was in the next world to welcome him .
And he knew it .
I was just allowed to see that much and no more .
And from that day until today - and now I ’m nearly 106 years old - I shall always remember that cry and I shall always remember that death is not the end .
You ’ve got a memory .
You ’ve got a brain about the size of a tea cup .
I ’ve got a memory that goes back for 80 or 90 years and I think that memory goes on with you when you die .
And that ’s my opinion .
Death is not the end .
Shooting to kill
I never knew Bob [ Harry ’s friend and gunner ] to use that [ Lewis ] gun to kill .
If he used that gun at all , it was about two feet off the ground and he would wound them in the legs .
He would n’t kill them if he could help it .
[ A German soldier ] came to me with a rifle and a fixed bayonet .
He had no ammunition , otherwise he could have shot us .
He came towards us .
I had to bring him down .
First of all , I shot him in the right shoulder .
He dropped the rifle and the bayonet .
He came on .
His idea , I suppose , was to kick the gun if he could into the mud , so making it useless .
But anyway , he came on and for our own safety , I had to bring him down .
I could n’t kill him .
He was a man I did n’t know .
I did n’t know his language .
I could n’t talk to him .
I shot him above the ankle , above the knee .
He said something to me in German .
God knows what it was .
But for him the war was over .
He would be picked up by a stretcher bearer .
He would have his wounds treated .
He would be put into a prisoner - of - war camp .
At the end of the war , he would go back to his family .
Now , six weeks after that , a fellow countryman of his pulled the lever of the gun that fired the rocket that killed my three mates , and wounded me .
If I had met that German soldier after my three mates had been killed , I ’d have no trouble at all in killing him .
Losing friends
The night we caught it , we were in the front line and we were going back .
We had taken the German front line , the German support line and we were coming back from the German support through the German old front line .
We had to cross what was the old No Man ’s Land .
It was crossing there that a rocket burst amongst us .
It killed my three mates , it wounded me .
We were on open ground .
September 22nd , half - past ten at night .
That ’s when I lost them .
That ’s my Remembrance Day .
Armistice Day , you remember the thousands of others who died .
For what ?
For nothing .
And today you would never get another trench warfare .
Never .
Today , you got the internal combustion engine , the one like you drive your car and improvement on that .
It ’s entitled a man to fly , and today a trench is no good .
He simply goes down the trench with his machine gun - that ’s it .
You ’ll never get another trench war .
Being wounded
You did n’t know you were hit .
You never heard the bullet or the shell that hit you .
All I can remember was a flash , I went down , blew me down .
I suppose I had enough sense , I saw the blood , I had a field dressing on .
I must have passed out .
How long I lay there I do n’t know .
Next thing I found I was in a dressing station .
The field bandage had gone , the wound had been cleaned and a clean bandage on it .
Around about it was a disinfectant of some sort , to keep the blinking lice away from the blood .
I lay there all the next day and the doctor came to me .
‘ You can see the shrapnel – it must have been a ricochet . ’
It was just buried in .
He said to me , ‘ Would you like me to take that out ? ’
I said , ‘ How long will you be ? ’
He said , ‘ Before you answer yes .
With no anaesthetic in the camp at all , we ’d used it on all the people more seriously wounded than you are . ’
He said , ‘ If I take that shrapnel out it will be as you are now . ’
Pain from it was terrific .
I said , ‘ Alright carry on . ’
Four fellahs held me down , one on each arm , one on each leg , and I can feel the cut of that scalpel now as he went through and pulled it out .
The doctor came to me some hours later .
He said , ‘ You want this shrapnel as a souvenir ? ’
I said , ‘ Throw it away , ’ and I never saw it again .
I met his son , who was also a doctor , at Buckingham Palace eighty years later .
He told me that if the shrapnel was a quarter inch deeper , it would have cut a main artery and that was it .
Going home
The fellah in the next bed said to me , ‘ If he writes anything in that book on the table , a green book , you ’re for Blighty . ’
Well I did n’t believe him , and then some hours later somebody came in , they called my name , my number .
I was out on the Red Cross truck down to Rouen …
And there we had a bath , got rid of the lice , they burnt our clothing .
We could see the hospital ship .
We were out on the hospital ship , but never sailed that night .
There was a rumour of a submarine in the Channel .
We sailed the next night and came to Southampton .
I think if I had gone to the field dressing main station , I do n’t think I ever would [ have sailed ] .
It was the fact that it was the advanced dressing station and they wanted the beds .
Get rid of him .
Mutiny
‘ E’ company were about a thousand strong .
We had an officer we did n’t like .
He used to take us out route marches .
We did n’t like it .
That afternoon he wanted the ‘ E ’ company on parade for bayonet practice .
The war had been over for months .
The sergeant major opened the door .
Somebody threw a boot at him .
He went back , reported it .
The officer came and they told him flat that they were n’t going out on parade .
Well , he went back to the company office and about thirty of the men followed him and they asked for him .
He came out , he pulled his revolver out and he clicked the hammer back .
Nobody said anything .
We had all been on the range .
I was on fatigue that morning so I was n’t on parade .
Nobody said anything .
They all went back to their huts and they rounded up what ammunition they could and went back and they asked for the officer again .
He was a captain , risen from the ranks .
He came out and he clicked the hammer back on his revolver .
He said , ‘ The first man who says he is not going on parade , I ’ll shoot him . ’
No sooner had he said that , when thirty bolts went back and somebody shouted , ‘ Now shoot you bugger if you like . ’
He threw the revolver down , disappeared .
We were all run up for a mutiny .
We had a brigadier come over from the mainland to hear the officer ’s side of it .
Then he said , ‘ I want to hear the men . ’
Twenty or thirty of the men went behind a screen and they told him .
They said , ‘ We do n’t want bayonet practice .
We ’ve had the real bloody thing .
Some of us are wounded by bayonets . ’
The outcome was that there were no parades except just to clear the camp , just fatigues .
The officer was moved to a different command .
We never saw him again .
It ’s a damn good job we did n’t .
The price of war
It was n’t worth it .
No war is worth it .
No war is worth the loss of a couple of lives let alone thousands .
T’is n’t worth it … the First World War , if you boil it down , what was it ?
Nothing but a family row .
That ’s what caused it .
The Second World War – Hitler wanted to govern Europe , nothing to it .
I would have taken the Kaiser , his son , Hitler and the people on his side … and bloody shot them .
Out the way and saved millions of lives .
T’is n’t worth it .
Breaking the silence
Opposite my bedroom there is a window and there is a light over the top .
Now [ when the staff go into that room ] they put the light on .
If I was half asleep – the light coming on was the flash of a bomb .
That flash brought it all back .
For eighty years I ’ve never watched a war film , I never spoke of it , not to my wife .
For six years , I ’ve been here [ in the nursing home ] .
Six years it ’s been nothing but World War One .
As I say , World War One is history , it is n’t news .
Forget it .
Picture this .
Housing complex .
The units are basically small cottages , made for two room - mates , with a common area and attached kitchen , a small storage closet in the common area containing water pipes leading to Suite A's bathroom .
The two private areas of the suite contained a private bedroom , a sliding glass patio door , and a private bathroom .
Sounds idyllic .
My roomie , Jed , liked to throw parties .
He liked tarantulas , too , and kept six .
For the sake of saving my effort in recounting this story , here is a basic rundown of the chaos :
This run-through of incidents is going to be kind of terse , because I 'm working off of a check list I made a while ago .
During our stay together , my roomie :
He brought his motorcycle into our common room because he was " afraid it would be stolen . "
This was fine , but then he started it and let it idle for 15 minutes without opening any windows , causing all of our stuff to smell like motor exhaust .
After his girlfriend left him , he went berserk in his private bathroom with a sledgehammer or a geologist 's hammer and smashed all of his bathroom fixtures .
I 'm not sure of this but I believe that just before she left him she fucked some guy with pubic lice in my bed during a party .
His toilet was inoperative at this point , so he used mine for a time , until I refused him access .
Later I would find out that he shat in garbage bags and kept them in the common room closet for weeks .
More on this later .
He set fire to our carpet with alcohol during a party .
He pissed in the fridge .
He shat in the fridge .
He shat in the crisper drawer .
He shat on the oven top , and instead of cleaning it up , turned on the burner , reasoning that carbon is easier to clean than feces .
He left a dead cat he found somewhere in our oven for a week and forgot about it .
I discovered it later .
He owned 6 tarantulas , and would let one run around free - range .
He assured me he had " tamed it . "
I assured him he was a stupid fuckhead .
He never showered .
He sold drugs from his room .
He smoked pot with his friends in the common area .
He spilled bong water on two of my text books .
He and his friends did cocaine off of the television set in the common area .
He had a party to which he invited too many people , and they spilled into my room .
Strangers had sex in my room at that party .
In my bed .
One of them had pubic lice .
Someone took a dump in my closet .
Someone left a used condom in my slipper .
I discovered all of these things after it was too late .
Morning after said party , my mother knocked on the front door , and a stranger from that party answered and immediately threw up on her legs .
Crackheads would regularly come by our apartment at all hours of the night trying to buy drugs because of his illicit activities .
Whenever I answered the door and indicated that there was no crack to be had , they would sometimes get , desperate , belligerent and violent , and refuse to leave .
He put food products containing milk , meat and cheese on the heating unit and turned it on for three hours to see what would happen .
I could 've told him what would happen if he asked me .
He got angry at some video game he and his friends were playing in the common area , so he busted into my room while I was sleeping , and punched me in the face and stomach .
A few days later he put a tarantula in my bed sheets while I was sleeping .
Thankfully I was n't bitten , but I was freaked out and still sometimes jump out of bed in the middle of the night for no reason and attack my sheets .
He shat in a lot of our fixtures .
He would put his shit in baggies and leave them in strange places .
I was thankful for when he used a baggie .
A few words of advice for potential room - mates : A light fixture is not a toilet .
A heating vent is not a toilet .
The sink is not a toilet .
The oven is not a toilet .
That is all .
The feces he left around falls into three categories :
A ) Experiments he conducted .
The stove top feces thing was an experiment he conducted after his toilet was broken , and I refused him access to mine , and his neighbors got sick of letting him use theirs .
I think he was trying to find some new way of getting rid of his shit .
Either that or he thought it would be funny to make me clean shit off of his stove top and then got curious about what would happen if he turned on the burner .
He really liked playing with heating elements and fire .
It was fucking stupid .
The dead cat in the oven , I think , falls into this category as well .
B ) Feces in the refrigerator , shit in the closet , vomit on the TV , etc .
I lump this into the " OOPS I SHAT ON YOUR CARPET DURING A PARTY " category .
C ) Shit inside baggies in various places :
After I stopped letting him use my bathroom he got angry and I think this started off as his way of " proving " to me that I should let him use my bathroom .
After a while of this I think it started to take on a life of his own , and he started stashing his feces due to some mental illness .
This is purely speculative
I was pissed at this point .
He refused to clean or take care of all of the messes listed above , so I ended up cleaning them , but keeping an hourly log and catalogue of what work I did and worked out a bill , which I sent to him .
I was tired of cleaning feces out of our refrigerator , finding turds in our crisper drawer , shit on the stovetop , vomit on the carpet , vomit in our potted plants , vomit on the grille of our television set , urine on the carpet , urine on the kitchen floor seeping behind the refrigerator , dead animals in our oven and freezer units , and bags of feces hidden in our light fixtures .
Have you ever had to move your refrigerator out of its little nook to get behind it to clean urine mixed with whatever the fuck lurks behind a refrigerator in the first place ?
After sending him the cleaning bill and getting a refusal of payment , I took some of his stuff , dumped it in a storage unit across town , and held it until he paid me back .
He stole some of my stuff in retaliation , but I called the cops and repossessed my belongings .
He was unable to articulate to the cops that I had some of his shit in this exchange , so I ended up basically getting my shit back while he had to be put in their car to cool off .
Upon retrospect , I think maybe he became mentally ill after losing his girlfriend , and not being able to part with his feces was part of his illness .
This is purely speculative .
He was n't poor .
He was from a wealthy family .
They do n't come into the picture , though .
I kind of messed up the timeline for this stuff , so here 's a quick run through before I continue the story .
TIME A : Tons of parties , vomit being cleaned up by me , tarantula , punching , etc .
I start withholding rent at this point , and am subtracting $ 200 a month from the rent for cleaning costs .
TIME B : His girlfriend leaves him .
His friends stop hanging out with him .
He smashes his bathroom .
He uses mine for a time , is denied access , uses neighbor 's for a time , is denied access , and is angry at me for refusing him access to my bathroom .
I fixed his faucets so they would n't leak all over the place and sent him a bill .
He gets really pouty and angry and does the famous shit on the stovetop .
He does experiments with various places to piss and poop , eventually settling on leaving it in baggies around the house .
When I tell him this is unacceptable , he responds with a demand to use my bathroom , which I refuse .
Around this time , while cleaning the stove top , I find the cat in the oven .
It has a collar on it so I put it in a box and return it to the owners , not explaining where I found it , and advising them not to look in the box .
I do n't know how that turned out , and I did n't give them my name .
I hope it got hit by a car and was n't killed by Jed .
TIME C : Jed starts trying to get at me by playing his subwoofer really loud at odd hours , and demanding to use the bathroom .
I get back at him by packing away all of his stuff , ( including the audio equipment ) and storing it in a friend 's storage unit across town .
I think that he started to really go truly crazy at this point .
I come home finding him taking things out of my room and putting them into his truck .
I restrain him and call the police .
By this point he is beyond all rationality and is completely flipping out , so he is put in the cop car for a while and the officer helps me unload my things from his truck .
For some bizarre reason the officer does not arrest him , but after " talking to him " lets him go .
I think my calm temperament made the officer not realize he was violent and that is why I was restraining him .
( My motto in life : " So it goes . " )
TIME D : I dub this time the sealing .
I really do n't mind cleaning up poop and piss , I used to be assistant manager of an apartment complex , but it is taking too much time to clean .
I buy a range - top , and seal things off after writing a surrender letter to Jed , declaring that he has evicted me from the common area .
Shortly after I come up with my Home Alone security system , withhold rent except for a nominal $ 50 a month , and go on with life as if I did not have a crazy room - mate sealed away in the other end of the apartment .
Time left on lease at this point : 2 months .
Edit : Time D is when he shits in the bushes and is arrested for the night .
TIME E : The black time .
I am not sure what exactly went on in the apartment during these two or three weeks .
This is around the time finals are going on , so I really do n't care .
Water starts leaking from the wall , so I re-enter the common area to see what is up .
This description really deserves its own post , and will clog the time - line up , so I 'll elaborate later .
I fix the water leak , which he had been covering up with newspapers , and promptly exit .
Once he finds out I was in his area he flips out and makes a lot of noise over there , but I do not investigate .
Remainder :
There is one further , final re-entry by myself , with a flashlight .
I could n't get in with my key because the door was messed up , and his sliding door was blocked with a mattress , so I kicked down the door and entered .
After a quick walk - through I call the fire department , the landlord , the police , and an ambulance .
This is full of drama and will be detailed in its own post .
The Sealing .
I eventually got so pissed off at the condition of the rest of the apartment that I could only deal with it by sealing it off , and ignoring it .
Essentially there is a blank period of about a month where I absolutely ignored anything from the common area , which is why it got so bad .
This is where the sealing begins .
Put a date mark right here , because this is where shit gets crazy .
I had had enough .
I bought a minifridge , a plug - in stovetop , two padlocked footlockers , a wooden bar , duct tape , a remote - control car , and an external padlock .
My private area had two entrances ...
Here , I best sum up my little fortress in this post I made in another thread :
Ok , if you 've ever owned a sliding door , you know that you can secure it from being opened by putting a wooden dowel in the treads while the door is closed .
This is great , except it can't be opened from the outside .
So what I did , was I attached a string to the dowel , and lead the string up to the top of the door , through a little loop - nail , and back down to a remote controlled car .
By moving the car with a remote control from outside the apartment , I could cause the string to be tugged , raising the dowel , and granting me access to the interior of the apartment .
I 'm almost more proud of the wire trick , because I gain endless pleasure from that fucker spending hours and hours trying to yank on this stupid dummy wire I put out there for him in order to get inside and mess with my shit .
Actually , upon reflection , I really want to share how I kept my room - mate out of my private area .
It was dubbed the " Home Alone " security system .
I had two potential entrances to my private area , a sliding glass patio door and a regular door to the common area .
I secured the common door with a padlock on the outside which was really just for show .
The inside was barricaded .
At the bottom I had a rolled up towel , and I sealed the rest of it with tape to avoid smell or other chemical assaults from the common area .
I packed against the door with my king - sized bed , which was in turn secured from being dislodged by a bookshelf full of weights and books .
Even if he got through the padlock , he would not have been able to open the door without busting it in two .
The top half of the door was unsecured ; I was worried he might break the door and gain access , so when I seized his stuff I had it put in public storage across town .
Now the sliding glass door is where the home alone shit comes in .
It had a lock , but it was nonfunctional and only accessible from the inside .
So in order to secure the door while I was away , I got a remote controlled car , attached it to a string which was secured by a fisheye screw at the top of the door , and tied to a security bar which would drop into the tread of the sliding door , preventing it from being opened .
So when I came home , I would whip out my little remote control , make the RC car run off and lift the bar , then gain access to the apartment .
To prevent this system from being discovered , I papered the inside of the sliding door with butcher paper , and I ran a wire outside of the door in an obvious manner , so that the roomie would think that this wire somehow , if tugged correctly , would undo the lock .
To my knowledge , all of his attempts to get inside my apartment were by messing with this wire , which was attached to the handle of an antique coffee grinder and a paint can .
If you tugged it , you 'd get a weird uneven resistance as the handle crank turned and the paint can danced , which added to the illusion that this wire was some secret way of ingress .
I was a little worried about the batteries dying in the remote .
Apparently it worked out though , because it could sit for long periods of time without draining the battery .
I tested it and it lasted a weekend with no problem , not even slight sluggishness .
I think it went into sleep mode or something .
I had a crazy backup system whereby the car was n't required to even lift the bar , but instead just nudge a little thing that would roll down a ramp , knocking the bar out of place , just in case it was running too low on power to lift the bar , but I never had to use it because the batteries lasted .
They even lasted for a week while I was away on break .
I heard this account from the neighbors , because it occurred while I was away , but apparently he had lost his front door key , had some kind of intestinal problem , and had to take a shit really bad .
All of the neighbors he knew he had already hit up for toilet access and been refused by this point .
So he 's swearing like crazy and yanking at this wire , and bashing against the door in a frenzied desperation when the neighbors call the cops , reporting a B&E .
When the cops show up he 's taking a shit in the bushes just outside my window .
I fucking hate him so much .
I think he went crazy and lost all his friends at some point , because around the time I barricaded , I stopped hearing parties .
In fact , I stopped hearing anything from the common area of the apartment , except for the occasional formless moans and thumping .
I do n't know precisely what went on in there , because I mentally washed my hands of the whole area .
I did , however , start smelling odors .
I taped up my door .
I know it was n't smart to do things like this , but I was just fucking sick of dealing with his shit .
I did n't call the landlord or anything , despite the fact that I knew he was destroying things over there .
After cleaning so much of his shit up , I just wanted the universal god of justice to see what a wreck the place would become without my presence .
Forgive me for being a little spotty in my descriptions after this point .
What I do know of what transpired over there I can only reconstruct from forensic evidence , what precisely was destroyed , what common friends have told me in their accounts , and two forays over into the waste zone over the next two months .
I essentially did n't even see the front door of our apartment during this time .
Actually , Jed was much smaller than me , and emaciated .
In retrospect I could have taken him , easily .
That 's just not how I do things .
I do not break the law .
Ever .
I absolutely must have a clean , orderly house , which is why I went around cleaning shit up , regardless of who did it .
I am not some cowardly little bitch , in fact , I think Jed was afraid of me , which is why he did passive aggressive shit like shitting in light fixtures .
I generally do n't try to solve disputes by shouting or anything , I just quietly give notice of the unacceptable condition , document it , and clean it up .
Somewhere back at my parent 's house I have a box full of typed , dated , signed letters to Jed stating the date , time , and extent of a mess I had to clean up , and a notice that such behavior is not acceptable , and that unless he stopped , I would move out and make him responsible for rent .
Those letters helped me eventually recover back rent from him for the equivalent value of the common area he exclusively occupied during my stay there .
I was crazy busy with schoolwork and my job , so I basically just shut the whole situation out of my mind for a while .
After some time , I came to the realization that this guy might start a fire and get us both killed , which is really the beginning of the end .
The thing that ended the insanity was his discovery that
A ) He had access to the fuse box
and
B ) He could trip the fuse to my room with some metal and a hallway plug
and
C ) He was too stupid to manually flip the fuse switch and just turn off my power , so he had to go the fire hazard route .
I think he might have been afraid of touching the fuse box for fear of being electrocuted .
But I 'll detail the downfall of this shit later .
For those of you wondering why I did n't call the landlord .
I was kind of in denial .
I just figured that whatever happened over there was Jed 's business .
I think I was on a sublease under him at the time , so I was n't too worried about damage to the apartment .
I withheld rent from him during this time too .
His family was paying rent for the whole unit , and I would reimburse him directly .
I deducted cleaning costs and other things from the rent I paid him .
I think he was too embarrassed or crazy to call me on it , or have his lawyer financial guru daddy get me busted .
Quick fact :
His father was on the cover of Forbes magazine like 8 years ago .
Have you ever had something go wrong , and , knowing it was someone else ’s responsibility , just did n't intervene out of sheer curiosity about how it fucking bad it would get ?
I did n't turn him in for that reason too .
I just ... wanted to see how bad it would get .
I was stupid , mad , curious , and really did n't have any responsibility for damage to the unit , knowing his family would cover the costs .
Edit :
So , basically , I did n't kick his ass for two reasons : A ) I am always law abiding to a fault , and B ) The setup I made was really very convenient for me , and made it so I never even had any contact with the guy .
It was basically rent - free ...
I paid $ 50 a month in rent after all of the deductions for unsanitary conditions and ouster from the common area I made ( and documented ... and got to keep after the courts got done looking at it ... ) , and I was exiting and entering from an opposite end of the house .
Basically , I only really knew what Jed was up to during this period from forensic evidence in the apartment and the accounts of friends , neighbors , and the police .
From my perspective , imagine this :
You are strapped for cash .
Someone offers you a studio apartment , with minifridge and bathroom for $ 50 a month , and after you move out , you 're given a few thousand dollars just for living there .
The only catch is that there 's a closet you can't open , and you have to tape around the edges , and the lock to get in is a remote controlled car rig .
Sounds like a good deal to me .
Jed could n't make much noise to bother me after I confiscated his music equipment .
All of the people talking about going ape shit sound like the nut balls to me .
I 'm very easy going , and I came out of this ahead .
I 'll get to the remuneration later .
Also it was very satisfying to have this asshole 's shit in a locker across town and know that he desperately wanted to fuck with my shit but could n't , and could n't prove I ganked his stuff .
He would flip the fuck out in rage from this .
I think that might have contributed to his degeneration into madness .
The Black Time :
I 'm very preoccupied with work and school at this point .
Since my point of entry on the house is opposite from the front door , the only real contact I have with Jed at this point is what I can hear from him through the walls , and whatever odor seeps under the door past my homeland security setup .
This is pretty tolerable as a condition , definitely worth the $ 50 a month I was paying for it , but I was starting to get worried .
I was worried about Jed 's tarantulas getting into the ventilation system , so I sealed that off with plastic wrap and duct tape .
Then I started worrying about fire .
Jed liked to play with heating elements and flames , and he was an alcoholic , so I was worried that with the sealed off vent I would n't know if the house were on fire .
At around 3 pm , I was studying , when I noticed that my feet were getting wet .
Upon inspection , the carpet next to the wall was wet .
I went around to the front of the house and found that the door was ajar .
I went back to my apartment and picked up a plumber 's wrench and a flashlight to see what was wrong .
I 'm not exactly the best at descriptions , as you can probably tell from the poor quality of writing in this thread , but here 's the best I can do .
I 'll try to portray these things from my perspective at the time , and not reveal what they eventually turned out to be .
I unlocked the front door of the apartment and pushed it open , after confirming that Jed 's truck was gone .
The lights in the place were out and the shades were drawn .
The light shone inside and revealed that there were strange particulates hanging in the air .
Not quite smoke .
I would almost say that the odor was so thick in the apartment that it could be seen with the naked eye .
Upon reflection , I imagine that what I was seeing were mold spores .
As the arc of light from the bright outside swept across the room , a few things were revealed in sequence :
First off , the common area was absolutely covered in free student newspapers .
There were obviously things underneath because the newspapers bulged , and I could even identify an easy chair covered in newspapers in the corner .
The kitchen was crammed with garbage .
I could identify two large bulky garbage bags in the corner of the common room .
Investigating them further , I discovered that they were covered in some kind of glistening brown muck .
The whole place smelled absolutely rank .
I swept my light across the place a few times , just to make sure Jed was n't there lying in wait with a knife or something , and I proceeded into the apartment , leaving the door open .
I took some vic 's vaporub from my pocket and dabbed some just under my nose .
The garbage bags had been hastily pulled out of the common room closet , the one which contains pipes leading to Jed 's bathroom .
I shined a light into the closet and a rat or mouse or something ran very quickly under the newspapers in the common room .
I looked and saw that there were several dents in a pipe in the common closet , and it was otherwise soaked .
Finding no immediate source for the water , I proceeded into the hallway area towards Jed 's room .
I was a little uneasy , because the whole place was filled with debris .
The common furniture that came with the apartment was lodged in the strangest places .
Like the hallway to Jed 's room had the common couch in it , upturned .
I climbed over that after making sure Jed was n't under it .
I was a little more nervous because my egress had been essentially blocked by this couch , and walked past the debris .
It looked like he was salvaging equipment and building materials from local construction yards .
I could identify in the hallway , piping materials , a toilet lid , cinderblocks , scrap wood , and a box of pilfered nails .
Jed 's large sledge hammer ( or geologists hammer , I do n't know which ) was lodged in the door of his room .
I pushed it open and the damn thing fell out , giving me a fright .
Anyway , I proceeded into his room , which was strangely clean .
There was nothing in there , but the floor was absolutely soaked .
I realized what happened ; he realized there was water everywhere and threw all of his shit outside of the room into the hallway , and leaned his mattress against the sliding door ( where it remained , to my knowledge , for like two weeks .
I have no idea where he was sleeping . ) .
The leak was coming from his bathroom , so I went in with my wrench ready to clock the shit out of my crazy room mate if he should jump out at me .
I saw the familiar smashed bathroom fixtures , and I was very thankful for the vic 's vaporub , but the stench stung my eyes still .
There was a bathtub covered in newspapers .
I prodded it with my wrench and the newspapers gave way , like they were on top of jello or something soft and organic .
I prodded it harder and what I can only describe as fecal fluid seeped from the sides of the newspaper .
I think he was taking shits in the bathtub and covering it with newspapers , like some kind of foul lasagna .
The leak was coming from under his sink , which he had dislodged through some violence .
I could see the remains of a cinderblock on the pipe , so I think he might have been hitting the pipe with a cinderblock .
I turned off the water to the sink , stopping the leak , and decided that it would be best if I left before he returned .
On my way out , I climbed into the kitchen area and opened the fridge , just out of curiosity .
There was a ball - like , organic mass in the middle , with tendrils of mold growing out of it .
It was roughly the size of a human head with a large dent in it .
Not desiring to get toxic mold in my nostrils , I closed the fridge and surveyed the common closet again .
The walls of the closet were covered in a black shiny material which glistened .
Upon closer inspection , it was mold .
I did n't know that mold looked like that .
I prodded the newspapers a little bit , but remembering the rat , and not wanting to get bitten , I left the apartment , closing the door behind me .
I was not only afraid of Jed popping out with a knife , I was also afraid of those tarantulas .
They were like a big unknown X - factor in the apartment .
Normally I 'm not very frightened of just god awful messes or rats , but if you throw giant tarantulas into the mix it really drives me up a wall .
Especially in terrain like that .
I was imagining setting my hand down on a part of the couch right as I was climbing over it and setting it right down on top of one of those hairy bastards .
They could move , too .
The fact that there were newspapers all around for them to hide under did n't help .
And I imagined they had plenty to eat while in that apartment , and possibly gave birth to a jillion other little tarantulas .
I got a towel and did my best to dry out the carpet .
I left my sliding glass door open to help air the place out .
I printed out a notice to Jed that I had entered and fixed his sink , and placed it under the door .
I later heard Jed come home , and he obviously discovered I had been in there , because he started freaking out , swearing , and throwing things around .
I heard the couch in the hallway get rammed into my door .
He threw a tantrum for another five minutes , and then I heard the front of the apartment door slam .
I heard him approach my sliding glass door , swearing , and I can only imagine that after seeing it open , he decided not to come any further .
Like I said , the guy was afraid of me .
He left in his truck a few minutes later , to return in ten minutes .
I heard strange moaning and stumbling around in the apartment after that .
I think he was moving furniture or something .
I heard breaking glass a few times , but after that , silence .
The Kidnapping .
Let 's get this over with .
So as I said , I am a pretty easy going person and I could tolerate this situation pretty endlessly .
But as I hinted earlier , Jed eventually made this situation unlivable .
Here 's how it goes down :
I 've long been using a cell phone since Jed pretty much has control of our apartment phone , and whenever anyone calls he 'll answer with crazy talk .
To my knowledge , he still has access to the store room in Longs Drugs , from which he has been stealing crates full of random stuff .
Anyway , lately , Jed was more active than usual .
I hear a lot of heavy stuff getting dragged around , and crashing , and lots of moaning , hollering , and other psychotic outbursts .
One evening I hear Jed making a hell of a lot of noise , then silence .
Then I hear the front door slam , and his truck goes off .
A while later , he comes back , I hear more slamming into things , and a bunch of really high pitched loud vocalizations , kind of like whales mating .
I get a call on my cell phone .
This is basically how it goes .
* ring * * pickup *
Jed : SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSATAN !
Me : Hi Jed .
You 're nuts .
Jed : I HAVE SARAH ( Jed 's ex girlfriend )
Me : Really .
Jed : LISTEN .
I immediately hear a high pitched shrieking from the other end of the apartment , and banging and stumbling around .
Sarah is a water polo champ .
I think if he somehow got her into the apartment , he would have to hit her in the head with his big geologists hammer , because there 's no way he would be able to wrestle her inside conscious .
At any rate , I bet at the time that he had n't grabbed Sarah , and the high pitched screaming was really that crazy motherfucker .
I 've been getting all kinds of crazy phone calls from Jed lately , so I call bluff :
Me : That sounds like you Jed .
Jed : COME AND SEE .
Me : I need to study .
Bye Jed . * click *
This is a very normal response from me , because by this point Jed has been calling me and saying all kinds of crazy shit .
Basically , if I can hear him through the wall , I completely disregard anything he might say on the phone .
He 's called me once and begged for help because he 's stranded on the NASCAR race track in the middle of a race and I can clearly hear him through the wall .
So I have a very trained automated response to Jed 's calls : " Hi Jed .
You 're crazy .
That 's nice .
I need to study .
Bye Jed . "
At this point , I smell smoke .
This is very disconcerting , because as I said earlier , I have been living in fear of the whole place going up in flames .
I stand up from my desk , and at that very moment , the power goes out , and I hear Jed laughing like crazy through the wall .
I hear what sounds like something banging against the pipes in his bathroom , and some other , deeper noises , which I have n't heard before .
The noises have a sort of deep bass resonance , like a big drum , as if a bull or some other large creature were banging around over there .
Jed 's a small guy , and I did n't think him capable of moving shit around heavy enough to make that kind of noise with that degree of frequency .
Since I smelled smoke and the power was out , I grab my gigantic wrench , smear some vic's on my nose , put on my leather jacket , put on a motorcycle helmet I confiscated from Jed , and prepare myself for battle , maglight in hand .
I am really psyched up at this point .
I know a lot of you will be saying that I was stupid for operating like this , but I reasoned with myself that I had better go over there just in case he HAD captured some poor girl and was , I dunno , by the noise of it , bludgeoning her to death with a tuba .
I headed around to Jed 's car and looked inside .
I saw he had rope and there was blood inside the cabin .
I tried the door , it was locked .
I smashed the window with a wrench and went inside the cabin .
Behind the seat were some bloody rags .
Ohhhh shit .
At this point I decide I had better get the fuck in there and stop whatever he was up to .
I felt really guilty at this point for letting it get this far .
I decided that if I were to go in there and die , I would 've earned it for letting him get that crazy for that long .
I trucked it over to the door , set my wrench on the ground , and fumbled for my keys .
I unlocked the door but it would n't give .
The door was moist .
I did n't quite understand that .
I pushed and pushed but it hardly moved an inch .
So I started stomping at the door as hard as I could .
Eventually I heard something slide and shift and collapse on the other side of the door , and I gave it another kick .
My foot actually made a hole and went through the door , and I fell over .
I started freaking out because I was worried Jed would stab my boot or something , so I struggled and hurt my ankle .
I also broke my foot from the kicking .
Eventually I calmed and got my foot out of the door , and body checked the door .
It came flying off the hinges , and came completely to pieces .
Ok , so I bashed the door in , and I went flying into the apartment , head first into a wall that is right in front of the doorway .
The couch had been barricaded against the door , and my kicking caused it to tip over .
It was still partially blocking the door .
I immediately started struggling wildly once I was on the floor , flailing my wrench and maglight everywhere in case something was about to jump on me .
I immediately exited the apartment , grabbed a metal patio chair , and hurled it into the blackened apartment in case anyone was in there .
The motorcycle helmet was making it really hard to hear any kind of ambush , and it was covered in grease and filth from the couch , so I ditched it , and proceeded inside .
It was night time out so I did n't get the benefit of a good light source from outside , and my maglight had grease on it .
I saw a glow coming from the corner .
I tried to smell if there was smoke coming from a particular direction , but the Vic 's vaporub made it difficult .
I swung my light around the room and found it full of trash like it was before .
There was no way I could ascertain whether Jed was hiding under something .
I did note that some of the newspapers were covered in what looked like splotches of blood .
From my forensics training I could gather from the splotches that whatever shed them was moving at a high rate of speed through the apartment .
I bounded over the couch into the apartment , landing on my broken foot , and falling on my face , in a lot of pain .
I remembered the tarantulas and freaked out again , scrambling to my feet and stumbling over towards the source of light .
I discovered that Jed had stolen a large floodlight from Longs drugs , which was in the corner , smoldering the carpet .
I grabbed that and quickly shone it all over the place .
Suddenly I saw that there was a guy about 6 feet tall wearing a beige suit about two feet away from me , so I flipped the fuck out and tackled it .
It turned out to be a cardboard standup of Captain Kirk Jed got somehow .
I picked up my wrench again and limped onward .
The apartment was completely silent by this point .
All I could hear was some kind of dull tubal thumping from inside the place , that same dull bass noise I heard earlier .
Remembering my crack training at counterstrike , instead of going further in , I limped over to the kitchen area and flung shit around to make sure that nobody was hiding under the newspapers .
I could see that he had gotten a lot more crap since the last time I was here .
There were mason jars of urine in the kitchen , along with gallon jugs of the stuff .
There were a lot of things he had obviously stolen from longs drugs .
There was a crate of sour patch kids all over the place .
On one wall was a poster of homer Simpson naked drinking beer , and a bunch of knives had been stabbed into it .
I was too angered and pumped up to be frightened .
I opened the refrigerator and stomped the shelves apart while I was at it , just to be sure he was n't hiding in there .
I had a huge floodlight but it could n't illuminate everything all the time , especially with the dank murk of mold spores and the smoke , so I ended up trying to shine it everywhere at once as I proceeded .
The common closet was closed , so I kicked that in and swung my wrench into the dark area within .
I hit something soft so I kept pounding at it , but it was n't human .
It was a trash bag full of something soft and yielding .
I gave it a kick and moved on .
I ripped the doorway off of the hall closet and swung my wrench inside , but I only hit a few canned goods in there .
I could hear high pitched shrieks coming from the interior of his room .
His hallway was pretty fucking well blocked with shit , so I started grabbing things and chucking them into the common room .
He had a gigantic stuffed Pluto doll , about as big as a gorilla , which I chucked .
Among the other things I hurled was a futon I recognized as salvaged from the end of our block , some patio furniture , a bag full of McDonalds playpen balls , and something which was big , black , disgusting , soft , covered in growth , which I cannot , even to this day , identify .
This is embarrassing , but I forgot to mention .
As I was hurling stuff , I had my wrench in my hand still , and so I hit myself in the face with it .
It required some stitches , and , since I had hit the trash bag full of feces with the wrench , it got infected .
So to tally it up , we have one broken foot , one twisted ankle , one gouged and splintered shin , and one bleedingassed face .
I crawled through the remaining debris with the wrench in front of me .
So I am crawling through the hole I 've made in the blockaded hallway .
I finally realize why he has been making so much noise .
The fucker has made some kind of evil fortress .
If my room is the fortress of light , his is the fortress of evil .
And feces .
I crawl through the hole and pop out in his room .
My strategy when playing doom 3 , when I knew something bad was about to happen in a room I dropped into , was to run around like crazy in the dark and fling grenades .
Well , instead of doing the slick commando thing and dropping into a crouch and assessing the situation , I popped out of that hallway barricade with my wrench and flashlight , and ran like crazy into the pitch black room , swinging around at anything and everything .
I connected with some stuff but nothing human .
My foot failed me and I fell over and crawled like mad to a corner .
I dove for my flashlight , picked it up , and assessed the room .
This place was full of fucking hostess products .
The guy must have stolen at least two crates worth of the damn things .
They were still in their wrapping .
Twinkies , hostess cupcakes , all kinds of stuff .
There was nobody in the room , but there was blood all over the place .
I could hear that strange bass resonance from inside the bathroom .
There was actually a light coming from there , it was rosy red , coming from a crack in the bathroom door .
... the very air in Jed 's room was absolutely thick with mold and smoke , which I could n't smell from the vix , but it still stung my eyes anyway .
He had smeared all kinds of crazy gibberish on the walls with what looked like red lipstick , and the walls themselves were absolutely covered in growth .
The barricades in the hallway must 've been there for a while , because they essentially kept a lot of moisture in the air in Jed 's back section .
Also , I forgot to mention this as well , but as I was running like a sissy through Jed 's room , I knocked into his mattress which he had leaned against the side door a few weeks prior ( my estimate ) .
The mattress was completely soaked and very heavy , and the instant it hit me I thought I had fallen into an insidious trap or something , so I further injured myself by trying to struggle out from underneath it .
Jed was making these freaky noises the moment I burst into his room , but the echo chamber effect of the bathroom and ventilation system , and the strange nature of the noises , made it difficult to determine where the hell they were coming from .
Also , there were tons of boxes of hostess cupcakes and other similar products .
The carpets in his room were really rank .
The previous water leak had made them dank with mold , and I can only imagine what the high fecal content of the air did .
It was difficult to breathe , and nearly impossible to see , which really added to my panic .
It was almost like I had been buried alive .
The scrawlings on the wall , though I did n't really get to see them in much detail because I was far more concerned with other things at the time , were just ... creepy .
The vibrations made me think for a second or two that he had tunneled under the apartment and I 'd have to go into some kind of underground basement he 'd made .
Edit : Scrawlings on the wall from what I saw consisted of nonsense Latin words , tons of triangles within triangles within triangles trailing all over the place , and a few goat Satan faces made of triangles .
I got to my feet and regained my composure .
I stomped over the hostess cupcakes and other misc crap he had lying on the ground .
I would limp every time I remembered I had a hurt foot , but really , by this time , I did n't give a shit about the pain .
I heard the shrieking from inside the bathroom , like some kind of high pitched wailing , and the strange bass resonance .
I kicked open the bathroom door and screamed at the top of my lungs ,
" YOU FUCKING FUCK SHIT "
I was n't in the right mind to come up with awesome catch phrases , so let 's pretend I screamed something bannable like , " The juice is loose ! "
I stomped into the bathroom and was immediately PHYSICALLY STRUCK by the most powerful odor I have ever , ever encountered .
My nose was pretty vixed up , but somehow , my eyeballs felt like they could smell the odor .
I swung my wrench before I really looked to see what was going on and totaled what was left of the sink .
In the corner of the bath tub I saw Jed writhing around with a golden metallic object in the shit lasagna .
He was freaking out and screaming .
The other thing I noticed was the fire .
In the remains of the toilet tank was a bunch of flaming papers , right next to a can of paint thinner .
I figured that Jeb threw in the thinner thinking it would burst into flames , but he neglected to uncap the thing .
So I grabbed the can of paint thinner and in one swift motion clocked Jeb in the head with it .
He started freaking out even more , and at this point I could see that the object he was writhing with in the tub was a saxophone .
He seemed to be bleeding all over his head but it was hard to tell because of the shit smeared everywhere , coming out onto the floor .
The light bulb was covered in either nail polish or blood .
I backed out of the room and grabbed a jug of urine , and threw it at the fire .
Remembering I should probably uncap the jug before using it to extinguish flames , I grabbed another one and actually poured it out .
By this time Jeb was trying to get out of the bath tub , so I stomped at him with my boot , closed the bathroom door , and jammed the fuck out of there after one final check for any hostages in the bedroom .
Then I got the fuck out of there , rammed the exterior door with a patio table , and called the cops , the fire department , an ambulance , and , after getting back into my place and looking up the number , the landlord .
There .
Done .
Oh , and aftermath , there was some court action for back rent , but all said and done they could n't prove I was withholding rent because I paid Jed with cash on the barrel head , and I ended up actually getting paid money to stay there in the long run .
I still have Jed 's things to this day and to my knowledge he is in a nut barn or something .
And for those curious , the shrill whale - like noises were actually his insane vocalizations .
If you do n't know , it 's very hard to be that crazy and actually make a sound on a saxophone .
No , I do n't know where he got the sax .
There are two versions to where the blood came from , the official version and how I think it happened .
The official version was that he had a psychotic breakdown and cut himself and that 's why the blood was in the truck .
My opinion on it was that he wanted me inside the apartment and burning to death , so he invented the kidnapping story , planted the blood , and attempted to blow me up with garbage and paint thinner .
I do n't know why he had the sax .
It was fun trashing an apartment with full legality though .
Just to clarify , the shriek noises were his psychotic wailing , not the sax , which was full of shit and inoperable .
The strange base noises were his movements in the shit lasagna tub , amplified by the fact that it is a gigantic shitty cheap plastic tub and next to my wall .
Oh , and now that the story is over , I can spoil this .
There were never tarantulas actually running around in the apartment .
They were all in their cages and quite dead by the time the showdown occurred .
I wish I had known that , because I might not have been so berserk frenzied at the time of re-entry .
It was so bad when I went into the bathroom that it went like this : I opened the door , and got physically HIT IN THE FACE with the smell , my eyes ceased to function , blinded by the odor .
I protected my face with one hand and swung my wrench madly with the other before getting into a crouch and being able to finally see .
I have nightmares about this experience , but , strangely enough , I have more nightmares about spiders in my bed than storming the evil castle of count von feces .
Edit : Also , I was pretty panicked , which is why I threw the first jug of urine without opening it .
Once upon a time I had a pretty bad roommate and as I posted about the things she did , I somehow came across a story about the worst roommate ever .
I do n't remember where I got it from , but I do know I had to fix it and put it all together ( it was in bits and pieces ) before I posted it in my journal .
It is LONG , but let me tell you , it sure helps to read it when you 're pissed at your roommate .
Now I am going to put this under a cut because it is so damn long , but I encourage you to read it all the way through .
This is the one thing I have come across that made me actually HAPPY to be roommates with Wendy .
It kept me going to know that there is worse out there .
So very very worse ...
It 's really important to understand that insurers are not to be trusted , especially now that we know they 've been defrauding us all along .
Former CIGNA communications chief Wendell Potter ( watch the complete video here ) testified before the Commerce Committee yesterday and summed it up :
Do n't trust the insurance companies .
Health insurers have forced consumers to pay billions of dollars in medical bills that the insurers themselves should have paid , according to a report released today by the staff of the Senate Commerce Committee .
The report was part of a multi-pronged assault on the credibility of private insurers by Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Rockefeller IV ( D - W.Va . ) .
It came at a time when Rockefeller , President Obama and others are seeking to offer a public alternative to private health plans as part of broad health reform legislation .
Health insurers are doing everything they can to block the public option .
At a committee hearing today , three health care specialists testified that insurers go to great lengths to avoid responsibility for sick people , use deliberately incomprehensible documents to mislead consumers about their benefits , and sell " junk " policies that fail to cover needed care .
Rockefeller said he was exploring " why consumers get such a raw deal from their insurance companies . "
The star witness at the hearing was a former public relations executive for major health insurers whose testimony boiled down to this :
Do n't trust the insurers .
" The industry and its backers are using fear tactics , as they did in 1994 , to tar a transparent and accountable -- publicly accountable -- health care option , " said Wendell Potter , who until early last year was vice president for corporate communications at the big insurer CIGNA .
Potter said he worries " that the industry 's charm offensive , which is the most visible part of duplicitous and well - financed PR and lobbying campaigns , may well shape reform in a way that benefits Wall Street far more than average Americans . "
Insurers make paperwork confusing because " they realize that people will just simply give up and not pursue it " if they think they have been shortchanged , Potter said .
Sen . Mike Johanns ( R - Neb . ) questioned the government 's ability make matters clearer , saying federal regulation of mortgage disclosures have made the documents borrowers encounter in real estate transactions " hopelessly complicated . "
Asked to address the hearing testimony , Robert Zirkelbach , a spokesman for the industry group America 's Health Insurance Plans , said insurers have proposed " overhauling the market rules and enacting new consumer protections so nobody is left out , simplifying health care choices for individuals and small businesses , and reforming the delivery system to improve the quality and affordability of health care coverage . "
The report released today alleged that insurers have systematically underpaid for so - called out - of - network care .
The issue had been brought to light previously in litigation , committee hearings , and other investigations , including a probe by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo .
But as politicians and interests groups clash over the current effort to overhaul the nation 's health care system , it took on new relevance .
Cuomo described it last year as " a scheme by health insurers to defraud consumers by manipulating reimbursement rates . "
Many Americans pay higher premiums for the freedom to go outside an insurer 's network of doctors and hospitals .
When they do , insurers typically pay a percentage of what they call the " usual and customary " rates for the services .
How insurers determine the usual rates had long been opaque to consumers and difficult if not impossible for them to challenge .
As it turns out , insurers typically used numbers from Ingenix Inc. , which was a wholly owned subsidiary of the big insurer UnitedHealth Group .
Ingenix had an incentive to produce benchmarks that low - balled usual and customary rates and shifted costs from insurers to their customers , the report said .
Ingenix got all of its data from the same insurers that bought its benchmark information , the report said .
Insurers that contributed data to Ingenix often " scrubbed " their data to remove high charges , and Ingenix further manipulated the numbers , removing valid high charges from its calculations , the report said .
Cuomo found that insurers under - reimbursed New York consumers by up to 28 percent , the report said .
A dozen insurers have reached settlements agreeing to change their practices ; UnitedHealth agreed to the largest payment , $ 50 million , which will help a nonprofit organization set up a new database to replace Ingenix .
In March testimony to Rockefeller 's committee , UnitedHealth chief executive Stephen J. Hemsley said UnitedHealth stands by " the integrity of the Ingenix data . "
Ingenix performed an important function , Hemsley said , because paying whatever doctors charge " is simply not economically tenable . "

ACCRA ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama told Africans on Saturday that Western aid must be matched by good governance and urged them to take greater responsibility for stamping out war , corruption and disease plaguing the continent .
Obama delivered the message on his first visit to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office in January as the first black U.S. president .
He chose stable , democratic Ghana because he believes it can serve as a model for the rest of Africa .
Fresh from a G8 summit where leaders agreed to spend $ 20 billion to improve food security in poor countries , Obama spoke of a “ new moment of promise ” but stressed that Africans must also take a leading role in sorting out their many problems .
“ Development depends upon good governance , ” Obama said in a speech to Ghana ’s parliament .
“ That is the ingredient which has been missing in far too many places , for far too long .
That is the change that can unlock Africa ’s potential .
And that is a responsibility that can only be met by Africans . ”
In an address that offered the most detailed view of his Africa policy , Obama took aim at corruption and rights abuses on the continent , warning that growth and development would be held back until such problems were tackled .
He said America would not impose any system of government , but would increase help for those behaving responsibly .
“ The future of Africa is in the hands of Africans , ” Obama told a crowd of several thousand , including dancers and drummers , seeing him off after the visit of less than 24 hours .
Addressing the young people of Africa , Obama said : “ You have the power to hold your leaders accountable and to build institutions that serve the people . ”
The visit has enormous resonance for Africa because of Obama ’s roots as the son of Kenyan immigrant .
He laced his speech with tales of his background and the struggles of his forebears in the face of poverty and colonial rule .
“ ENCOURAGEMENT ”
“ It will give encouragement to those fighting corruption and for democracy , ” said African affairs commentator Joel Kibazo .
“ He said it in a way that perhaps other presidents could not because he started by outlining his own connections , ” said Kibazo , while noting Obama was less specific on promoting good governance than with a $ 63 billion health spending pledge .
MPs chanted “ yes , we can ” before Obama started and the president ended his address with that phrase -- his old campaign slogan .
The crowd ’s response was much warmer than the cordial but mostly chilly reception in Moscow earlier in the week .

“ Obama ’s visit was a defining moment for Africa , ” said Mohamed ibn Chambas , who heads regional bloc ECOWAS .
The language and cadence of Obama ’s speech was a mix of church sermon , campaign rally and university lecture .
“ This encourages us also to sustain the gains that we have made in our democratic process , ” said Ghanaian President John Atta Mills , elected in a transparent election that contrasted with stereotypes of chaos , coups and corruption in Africa .

Reforms in the cocoa and gold producing country , set to begin pumping oil next year , helped bring unprecedented investment and growth before the global financial crisis .
Ghanaians , many dressed in Obama t- shirts , packed into the streets of Accra in hope of glimpsing the president .
They clustered around television sets in homes , bars and backyards to follow his words .
“ The message he gave was covering the ways in we should change our lifestyles .
I believe when we do that we will prosper , ” said engineer Joseph Aboagye .
“ We need to change . ”
But expectations were anchored in reality .
“ I am not under any illusion that he ’s coming to solve our problems in one go , ” said Janet Ashiboe , 42 , a market trader .
Obama made a trip by helicopter to Cape Coast Castle , a former depot of the transatlantic slave trade and a reminder of one of the darkest chapters in African and American history .
“ As painful as it is , I think that it helps to teach all of us that we have to do what we can to fight against the kinds of evils that sadly still exist in our world , not just on this continent but in every corner of the globe , ” a somber - looking Obama told reporters at the white - washed fort .
Although Obama ’s ancestors were from Kenya , his wife Michelle is descended from slaves shipped from Africa .
Obama , his wife and their two daughters left Accra to return to Washington .
Writer John Green makes a compelling case for reforming the way that publishers calculate advances and royalties , lowering the former and raising the latter .
Doing this would — he argues — create a less blockbuster - focused , less risky venture that would be good for authors and publishers .
The agent is really high on The Unicornians .
She thinks it 's the next Twilight .
So she submits it to several editors at once .
Editor 1 comes back offering $ 300,000 for three books .
Editor 2 offers $ 30,000 for three books but with a significantly better hardcover royalty .
( Say , 20 % instead of 10 % . )
Putting aside the ( very important ) questions of which editor would be a better fit and which publisher is doing a better job with Unicornian - esque books , I would argue that the author of The Unicornians is always better off signing with Editor 2 .
Let 's say that The Unicornians is not a tremendous success .
The first book in the trilogy sells 8,000 copies in hardcover ; the second two sell 6,000 * .
With Editor 1 , the author gets her $ 300,000^^ , but The Unicornians comes up $ 240,000 short^^^ of earning out .
With Editor 2 , the author only makes $ 80,000 on the series , but $ 50,000 of that is royalty , and the publisher has also made a ( modest ) profit .
The publisher will likely ask the author for another series , perhaps something focused in on the werewolf dude …
Okay , so now let 's say The Unicornians IS successful .
Let 's say the first book sells 250,000 copies in hardcover ** , because they make a movie , and teens squeal about how hot the unicornian boy 's horn looks .
The second and third books also sell 250,000 .***
With Editor 1's deal , the author earns back her advance and makes $ 1.2 million , for a total of 1.5 million dollars .
With Editor 2's deal , the author earns out and makes $ 2.7 million in royalties , for a total of $ 3 million .****
Think your cellphone display packs a lot of pixels into a small space ?
Pssh .
Kopin Corporation has just announced the smallest VGA color - filter liquid crystal display , checking in with a 600 x 480 resolution and a 0.27 - inch ( diagonal ) size .
The feat was accomplished by shrinking the color dots to 2.9 x 8.7 µm from 3.75 x 11.25 µm , and according to the company , it 's a huge step in reaching its goal of creating a " 2,048 x 2,048 - resolution display in a size smaller than a typical postage stamp . "
Already , the firm has stated that it can concoct SVGA ( 800 x 600 ) displays at 0.34 - inches , XGA ( 1,024 x 768 ) displays at 0.44 - inches and and SXGA ( 1,280 x 1,024 ) displays at 0.56 - inch using the same color dot size , which will apparently be used in digicams , camcorders and possibly even handsets .

I first heard Steven Wright ’s I Have a Pony when I was in high school .
It was a little more than 10 years after the classic comedy album ’s 1985 release , but it was as if the jokes existed in this bizarre vacuum of hilarity — you could drop Wright ’s dispassionately delivered one - liners into a time capsule , bury it for a thousand years , dig it up , and people would still laugh at them .
Paste :
It ’s been over two decades now since I Have a Pony firstOn June 2 , Warner Bros. reissued I Have a Pony in a deluxe CD / DVD anniversary edition .
Paste recently caught up with the comedy legend , who currently sits at # 23 on Comedy Central ’s list of the 100 Greatest Standups of All Time , nestled right between Robert Klein and Redd Foxx .
Paste :
It ’s been over two decades now since I Have a Pony first came out .
I was wondering if over the years you ’ve ever figured out what exactly you ’re supposed to add to powdered water ?
Steven Wright : [ laughs ]
No , I never figured it out .
Paste :
When I interviewed George Carlin a couple years ago , we talked a lot about how , on stage , he used exaggerated anger as a device .
You ’re really infamous as this master of deadpan , but I ’ve always been curious , how does the real Steven Wright differ from the character that you ’re doing in your act ?
Wright :
My act is an exaggeration of a part of me .
I ’m much more expressive off stage .
But you know , you can hear by my voice right now — it ’s the same .
I was always just concentrating so hard on doing the material that I had a straight face , ’ cause I was taking the thing seriously , so that became my style .
So I guess I ’m a little bit more expressive in real life .
Paste :
Who were some of your favorite comedians , who were people who inspired and influenced you , and what was it about them that inspired you ?
Wright : Definitely Carlin was one of them .
One of the reasons I wanted to be a comedian — I liked how he talked about all the little everyday things in life that people do n’t usually talk about .
And Woody Allen had a double comedy album .
I listened to a radio show in Boston when I was a kid — every Sunday night they played two comedy albums .
That ’s where I heard Woody Allen ’s album .
And I liked him the best , the way he structured jokes and just the way he told stories .
So those two guys definitely influenced me .
Paste :
When did you decide that you wanted to be a comedian , and when did you start working toward that ?
Was it when you were younger , or in college ?
Wright :
It was about when I was 14 or 15 , and I thought that that ’s what I would like to do , but I did n’t do it until after I got out of college .
There was a [ new ] comedy club that opened up in Boston , and I thought , “ Well , I gotta go down and try to do this ’ cause it ’s been in my mind for nine years .
I was 23 .
So I wanted to try it and have it either work or not work , but at least I wanted to try doing it .
Paste :
What was that first try like ?
How did it go ?
What are your memories of that ?
Wright :
Well , I had written about three minutes of material .
I went to see a show , just to see the comedians , and they were really funny .
Then two weeks later I decided to go back for the open-mic night .
And I was really , really nervous , ’ cause I did n’t want to really talk in front of a group of people .
But I wanted to do the stand - up so I forced myself to do it .
It was very nerve - wracking .
And they laughed at about half of it , which was pretty good actually , but I was disappointed ’ cause I thought they should have laughed at all of it , but that was just ’ cause I was so naive .
And I kept going back to the open-mic night ’ til they put me on regular nights .
Paste :
Your voice is something that people love so much about you , and it ’s such a huge part of what you do , but when you were younger , was it ever something you had to deal with — was it ever something that kids would mess with you about ?
Wright :
No , never , ever .
I never even thought of myself as deadpan until someone wrote an article about me about a year after I was doing comedy .
There was a paper called the Boston Phoenix , and someone wrote a description of what I was doing and that ’s where I first saw “ deadpan . ”
But no , kids were n’t teasing me about it , no .
Paste :
How do you feel about that description — deadpan ?
Wright : I remember thinking , “ Wow , am I a deadpan ? ” I remember thinking that — ’ cause you know when you ’re yourself , you ’re just inside yourself ; you ’re not seeing yourself from the outside , and I remember stopping and thinking , “ Wow , am I really deadpan ?
I guess I am .
I guess so . ”
It was news to me .
Paste : Before you were actually doing comedy , what was it about being a comedian that appealed to you ?
Wright :
It was something about , like , seeing the guys on Johnny Carson , seeing Johnny Carson come out and do the monologue , and then seeing the comedians he had on .
It was just something I was drawn to — these guys , doing this alone thing , and making these people laugh .
I just thought it was kind of a cool thing .
I ’m not even sure how to explain it really , I just thought — I saw Carlin and Robert Klein and David Brenner , and I thought , “ Man , I wish I could be one of those guys . ”
But I ’m not exactly sure why .
I just thought it was an interesting thing to do .
Paste :
Tell me about your early days that led up to your breakthrough performance on Carson .
What was it like ?
Were you playing a lot of small comedy clubs , kind of working up your material ?
Wright :
There was two clubs in Boston , the Comedy Connection and the Ding Ho Comedy Club in Cambridge , and I started doing regular nights .
I would do maybe three or four shows a week , and then during the early ’ 80s , comedy was exploding — you could do a set at one club , then go to the next club and do a set , then go back to the first club and do another set .
So I was doing lots of time on stage ’ cause there was so much comedy around , and you learn it by doing it .
I mean , I had no money at all .
I remember taking the subway — I ’d have to go around my apartment to get enough change to go on the subway to get to where the show was .
And then they ’d pay you under the table — first it was like eight bucks then it was like 20 bucks and it started going up from there .
But I was doing that , at that level , for about three years before the TV happened .
Paste :
Were you working other jobs at that point ?
Wright :
No , I started in July of ’ 79 , and I was painting the college that I went to , painting the rooms , and then I worked as a cashier in the MIT Coop , the store at MIT .
And then when I was doing comedy about six months , I was making enough money to pay the rent — the rent was like a - hundred - and - fifty dollars a month — I quit working in the day , so then I was just doing comedy at night .
Paste : Your appearance on Carson — how important do you think that was to launching your career ?
Wright :
Oh , absolutely , it was the catalyst of the whole thing .
I mean I was playing little clubs in Boston , and Peter Lassally from The Tonight Show came to Boston to look at colleges for his kids — they were graduating soon .
And he read an article about the Ding Ho Comedy Club , it was an article in the L.A .
Times about it ’ cause it was such a weird place — comedy and Chinese food — and so he went to see this comedy club to see the comedians , and two or three weeks later I was on The Tonight Show and my whole life changed , my career and my life changed from just that first appearance .
Paste :
Was it difficult to get a handle on things because it happened so fast that you went from just kind of a local guy to like this big national comedian ?
Wright :
Um , it went fast , but it was n’t hard to handle actually .
I mean , I went on The Tonight Show on a Friday night , and then the next Thursday I went on again , and then I came back to Massachusetts to continue working in the clubs , and then a couple of months later I moved to L.A .
And then I was doing Letterman and Saturday Night Live .
It was fast , but it was n’t hard to handle .
Paste :
What ’s the writing process like for you — is it something where you sit down , you work at it , or is it as simple as walking down the street and having a strange thought or a funny thought ?
Wright : Yeah , it ’s the second one , definitely .
Just from hanging out , doing whatever I ’m doing .
From the minute everyone wakes up to when you go to sleep , there ’s little fragments of information that you encounter on a daily basis , and some of it just jumps out as jokes to me .
Paste :
Do they come pretty regularly , or is it just kind of sporadic ?
Wright :
It , it comes sporadic now .
They used to come lots , in like groups of them , but now it ’s sporadic .
Paste : On June 2 , Warner Bros. is putting out the deluxe anniversary reissue of I Have A Pony .
Looking back after almost 25 years , how do you feel about that album , and the material , and what do you remember about that period in your life ?
Wright :
Well , it came out in ’ 85 , and I did an HBO special at the same time , and it moved me from clubs into theaters when those two things came out .
I ’m gonna go on Letterman on June 5 , and I ’m gonna do material from that album , so I was listening to it a few weeks ago to figure out which material to do , and I really liked it .
I was surprised — I did n’t know how I thought of all those things .
To tell you the truth , I was kind of like , “ Man , where did I come up with that stuff ? ”
It was so twisted and weird and interesting , and I was seeing it almost like a fan would see it , ’ cause I had n’t listened to the album in a long time .
But it was definitely a good time in my life when that album came out , and I ’m happy that it ’s coming out again so that younger people who maybe never heard of it can get into it .
Reach a whole other generation .
Paste :
That album was nominated for a Grammy — did that matter much to you ?
Do you care much about things like that ?
Wright : Yeah , I feel really proud that it was nominated for a Grammy .
I think that ’s great — I still kind of ca n’t believe it .
The Grammys were up at this level .
You know , it ’s just cool to think you can be nominated .
I did another album that came out two years ago …
Paste : I Still Have A Pony ?
Wright : Yeah , that was nominated , too .
And , yeah , I liked that they were both nominated .
Paste :
If there ’s ever been a criticism about your work , over the years , there have been some people who have complained about how long it takes you to write new material .
When you hear stuff like that , how do you take that kind of criticism , and what do you think you would say to those people if you had a conversation about it ?
Wright :
It does take so long , ’ cause for every five jokes I only think of one or two that is good enough to stay in my act .
But I do n’t think about , I do n’t think about the people complaining about that — I have enough things to worry about in my life .
And , you know , the jokes are gonna come when they come , and I ca n’t help it ; I ca n’t do anything about it .
’ Cause I do n’t even sit down to try to write the new — it would be too forced .
So I just have to wait for it to happen .
Paste :
It ’s not like making sausage .
Wright : Yeah , yeah .
It ’s not like an assembly line in my house .
Paste : [ laughs ]
Actually , that ’s an interesting idea .
I ’m trying to imagine the assembly line that would be in your house to make jokes .
Wright : [ laughs ]
Yeah , that ’s funny .
Paste :
So what have you been up to lately ?
I know you did the follow - up to I Have A Pony — I Still Have A Pony — two years ago .
Have you been working on anything lately ?
Any new material or tours planned , or any film projects ?
Wright : I ’ve just been doing live shows here and there , but I ’ve cut back a little bit on them .
I did a few a couple weeks ago in three cities , and now I ’m gonna do another five or six cities , so since that album came out I ’ve been on and off the road .
I have n’t been working on another project ; I ’ve just been doing live stuff .
I was out in California , I went on the Craig Ferguson show about six times in eight weeks , but I ’m not working on a film or anything right now .
Paste : I ’ve got one last question for you .
You ’re a big Red Sox fan — what do you think is up with Big Papi ’s ( David Ortiz ’s ) bat this season and what ’s he gotta do to fix it ?
Wright : So discouraging .
I feel bad for him ’ cause he seems like a nice guy , and he must be tortured .
I do n’t know what to think of it — I ’m kind of scared to think that maybe he ’s not gonna come back .
He has one home run , right ?
And I do n’t know , I feel bad for him .
You can see when he walks back to the dugout after he flies out or strikes out , you can see he ’s disturbed by it .
But , yeah , I hope he snaps out of it .
I feel bad for him .
[ Ed. — looks like Wright might be getting his wish .
Since this interview , Ortiz is in the midst of a seven - game hitting streak .
In fact , he hit a home run the night this story was published . ]
( CNN ) -- Search crews have recovered the bodies of the flight captain and a steward from the Air France flight that crashed off the coast of Brazil .
A Brazilian diver floats on wreckage of Flight 447 earlier this month .
The search for more debris continues .
The two flight members are among the victims that have been identified , Air France said in a statement Thursday .
About a dozen victims have been identified among roughly 50 bodies recovered from the crash of Flight 447 , which killed 228 people on June 1 , authorities in Brazil said this week .
Crews continue to search for bodies , wreckage and flight - data recorders that apparently rest deep on the ocean floor .
Data from the recorders may be crucial in helping investigators determine what caused the plane to crash .
Watch more wreckage recovered from crash »
Autopsies conducted on some of the 50 bodies found so far show they suffered broken bones , including arms , legs and hips , Brazilian authorities have told French investigators , according to Paul - Louis Arslanian , head of the French accident investigation board .
Such injuries suggest that the plane broke apart in midair , experts have said .
Asked about that theory , Air France Chief Executive Pierre - Henri Gourgeon told France 's RTL radio this week that he would not go that far .
" What I know is that the investigators would like to know the causes of death , " Gourgeon said .
" That knowledge of causes of death will better clarify what exactly happened .
Were the victims killed before the impact , or during impact ? "
Searchers have found dozens of pieces of debris in the water and think they know the general location of the wreck , but Arslanian said this week that there is a chance the entire aircraft may never be found .
Air France plans to pay relatives of the victims an initial compensation equivalent to about $ 24,500 , or 17,500 euros , for each victim , Gourgeon has said .
The airliner said this week that it has been in touch with about 1,800 relatives of the people who died when the Airbus A330 crashed , but that it has been difficult tracing the relatives of all 228 victims .
" The modern world is different and we often have only a cell phone , and as you can imagine , this cell phone is unfortunately in the aircraft , " Gourgeon said .
" So we probably ( will put in ) more hours to access all the relatives . "
The company is also providing families with counseling , he said .
The were 32 different nationalities present on Flight 447 .

Sun announced this week the availability of VirtualBox 3 , the latest version of its open source virtualization solution .
The new version introduces experimental 3D graphics support and the ability to expose multiple CPUs to guest operating systems .
VirtualBox was originally developed by InnoTek , which was acquired by Sun last year .
InnoTek launched an open source edition of VirtualBox in 2007 , releasing most of the program 's code under the GPL .
Alongside the open source version , the company has continued to sell a commercial version that has additional features , such as a built - in RDP server and full USB support .
VirtualBox is cross-platform compatible and is available for Linux , Windows , and Mac OS X .
The software has matured quickly and is beginning to outpace its rival VMware Workstation in many ways .
VirtualBox is becoming especially popular on the Linux platform because its open source licensing makes it easy for Linux distributors to package and deploy — and it generally performs better than Linux 's kernel - based Virtual Machine ( KVM ) , the native virtualization solution of the Linux kernel .
It also has an excellent user - friendly configuration and VM management interface .
VirtualBox provides relatively good integration between the guest environment and host environment .
It can do clipboard and folder sharing and can dynamically adjust the guest environment display resolution as the guest window is being resized .
One of its most advanced capabilities is a " seamless " mode which allows users to break the windows out of a guest environment and mix them with the windows of the host environment , similar to the Unity feature of VMware Fusion .
VMware still offers a few advantages , such as better support for snapshots .
One of the key differentiators of VMware was its support for virtualized SMP , but this feature was finally introduced in the latest version of VirtualBox .
In VirtualBox 3 , you can expose up to 32 CPUs or CPU cores to a guest environment ( this requires chips that support Intel 's VT -x extension or AMD - V ) .
The VirtualBox developers have gradually been adding support for accelerated 3D graphics .
VirtualBox 3 has relatively solid support for OpenGL on Windows and Linux guests .
It also has gained experimental support for Direct3D 8 and 9 on Windows .
These advancements could make VirtualBox a viable solution for 3D gaming .
I 've been testing VirtualBox 's 3D graphics support with Linux guests since the 2.2.4 release in May .
The Compiz compositing window manager will now work out of the box in Ubuntu guest environments , complete with wobbly windows and 3D cube action .
In addition to support for SMP and 3D graphics , VirtualBox 3 also resolves a host of bugs , including fixes for suspend / resume on Solaris hosts , fixes for PAE on Mac OS X , and fixes for shared X11 clipboards in Linux guests .
VirtualBox is currently my preferred desktop virtualization solution .
I made the jump from VMware Server last year after losing patience with VMware 's lousy Linux support .
I use VirtualBox nearly every day for distro testing and software development , and it has made virtualization an integral part of my workflow .
For a complete overview of bugfixes and other improvements in VirtualBox 3.0 , see the official changelog .
An EU survey on employment shows that Irish people 's job situation has been particularly badly affected by the economic and financial crisis .
Ireland ranks among the highest in the EU for experiencing job losses and two thirds believe the worst of the crisis is yet to come .
The survey shows that unemployment is a big worry across the EU .
41 % of Irish respondents expressed concern that their partner or spouse would lose their job , against an EU average of 38 % .
In Ireland , 52 % of those surveyed feared their children would lose their job .
The EU figure was 47 % .
The figures were lower for those afraid of losing their own job - 32 % in the EU , 33 % in Ireland .
In Ireland , 16 % of respondents to the survey say they have personally lost their job as a result of the crisis .
The crisis has resulted in job losses for a family member or friend of 49 % of respondents .
This compares to an EU average of 9 % and 36 % respectively .
The worst affected countries are Latvia , Lithuania and Spain where the economic crisis has been particularly severe .
Irish people are also more likely than their European counterparts to feel that we have not yet reached the peak of the crisis .
66 % of Irish people fear the worst is yet to come , compared with an EU average of 61 % .
People in Sweden , Denmark , Spain and Italy were the most optimistic .
Asked about measures to help people to get into the labour market or to stay there longer , Irish people cited the main factors as increasing childcare facilities ( 85 % ) , increasing care facilities for the elderly ( 81 % ) and supporting those who want to start up their own businesses ( 86 % ) .
Half of Irish people said that , if laid off , they would look for the same kind of job in the same location .
16 % would apply for the same job in another location , below the EU average of 19 % .
Only 3 % of respondents said they would look for a completely different kind of job in a new location .
MOBILE , Ala . --
The Mobile police officers who tried to book a deaf and mentally disabled man into jail after using a Taser and pepper spray on him will report to internal affairs today , department officials said .
Pending the preliminary findings , they will either return to normal duty the same day or be placed on administrative duty .
Deputy Chief James Barber said that internal affairs investigators were still gathering evidence in the case , including how many officers and supervisors reported to the scene , and when .
Preliminary results of the findings should be made public today , Barber said , adding that no official judgment on the officers ' actions had been reached as of Tuesday evening .
The case against 37 - year - old Antonio Love was thrown out by a city magistrate who refused to sign off on the arrest warrant .
Of crucial importance to Mobile 's investigation are what the officers knew and when they knew it , Barber said , because officers are judged according to the facts as they knew them at the time , not the facts as they were discovered in hindsight .
According to previous police accounts of the incident , the officers did not know Love was deaf or mentally disabled until after they forcibly removed him from the restroom at the Dollar General on Azalea Road on Friday .
Officers sprayed a chemical irritant into the bathroom , broke the door down and used a Taser in the process of taking Love into custody .
It 's not clear that Love , whose family has described him as having the mental capacity of a 10 - year - old , understood what was happening .
In a handwritten account of the incident , Love repeatedly said he did n't understand what was happening to him or why police were arresting him .
For Love 's account of the incident click here .
Love has said that he had gone to the restroom because he was sick to his stomach and did n't think he was there for more than 30 minutes before police arrived .
Police said the Dollar General 's manager called them because a man , later identified as Love , had been in the restroom for an hour .
They forced their way in when Love did not open the door .
Police have said they discovered Love was deaf after looking in his wallet .
They later attempted to book him on resisting arrest , disorderly conduct and failure to obey a police officer .
Barbara Muhammad , a magistrate , refused to sign off on the charges , effectively dismissing the Police Department 's case .
Muhammad declined comment Tuesday .
J.M. " Pete " Pedersen , who oversees the operations of municipal court , said he could n't comment on Muhammad 's decision specifically , but that her decision was in line with her duties .
" Officers are very educated on what the law is , " he said .
" Most will have a good judgment on what the parameters are to bring a valid complaint . "
Though Love is hearing impaired and mentally disabled , he has led a very independent life in some respects , his family said .

As the graphic shows , the March rate for the United States was higher than the rates of 11 of the 15 .
The exceptions were Portugal , which has the same rate , and Spain , Ireland and France .
Eight of the 15 European countries have rates that are lower than three years ago .
How did that happen during a worldwide recession ?
First , it appears that the safety nets in many Western European economies made it easier for people to keep their jobs as the economy declined .
In Germany , programs allow companies to get government help in paying workers , for example , keeping them employed .
If the recession becomes severe enough and long enough , of course , it could turn out those programs do not so much avoid the pain as defer it .
Another factor may be the lack of an economic boom in many European countries , which has left them less vulnerable to recession - related cutbacks .
There is , and always has been , a large variation in economic performance among Western European countries .
Even though workers generally have the right to move between countries in the European Union , doing so presents language and cultural hurdles for many .
In the United States , there has been more movement of workers from depressed areas to places where the employment outlook is brighter .
But the housing crisis appears to be hampering such movement because some workers own homes that are worth far less than the amount they owe on their mortgages .
Among the 15 European Union countries , the national unemployment rates range from 2.8 percent in the Netherlands to 17.4 percent in Spain .
That is a wider spread than the ones among American states , where the rates range from 4.2 percent in North Dakota to 12.6 percent in Michigan .
Spain and Ireland , two of the highest unemployment countries in Western Europe , suffered housing booms and busts that were comparable to the cycle in the United States .
Unemployment is also particularly high now in the Baltic states , Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , which ran up large trade deficits during the good times and are suffering now that it is much harder for them to borrow money .

Follow the Crop System Puts Biofuel Refinery in the Fields
A new biofuel production system , dubbed “ Follow the Crop ” , aims to reduce the costs of production and increase the income of small to medium growers by bringing the biorefinery right into the fields .
The new system would open the biofuels market to smallholders , who could put marginal lands into biofuel crops without committing to large scale planting .
“ We ’re taking the biomass conversion process out of the biorefinery and taking it to the field . ” – Bob Kozak , Atlantic Biomass President
The biotech biofuel company in Frederick , MD , Atlantic Biomass , introduced their “ Follow - the Crop ” biofuel production system at US Representative Roscoe Bartlett ’s GO - Green Energy Conference on June 29th , saying that it would overcome the “ Transportation Conundrum ” of biofuels created by the high cost of transporting bulky , low density biomass from farm to biorefinery .
“ Follow - the - Crop will transform the advanced biofuels industry into one coherent
system rather than remaining a collection of uncoordinated , geographically constrained small industrial facilities .
By changing the feedstock of biofuel refineries from individual specialized crops into common commodities , the entire biofuel industry can then respond to real market forces . ”
The production system centers around Atlantic Biomass ’ proprietary enzyme process , and is based on the portable ethanol production system that Encore Biofuels is currently engineering , using retrofitted shipping containers with internal environmental controls .
The modules will convert low - density , low value biomass into high density biofuel intermediates , which can then be shipped to large scale biorefineries for chemical or thermochemical conversion into finished biofuels .
According to Atlantic Biomass Conversions , “ with
a sustainable cost - efficient biomass production system based on “ Follow - the - Crop , ” biofuel prices can be fairly set ”
Atlantic Biomass is dedicated to making biofuel production both profitable and environmentally sustainable , and has been working on a project to convert low - value sugar beet pulp into feedstocks for JP - 8 jetfuel for the U.S. military .

We 'd heard just under a month ago that Apple was mulling the possibility of adding matte display options to more than just its flagship 17 - inch MacBook Pro , and lo and behold , it seems the anti-glare revolution has begun .
Starting now ( like , right now ) , those in the market for a new unibody 15 - inch MacBook Pro can order one directly from Apple with an anti-glare widescreen display , packing 1,440 x 900 pixels and a LED backlight .
Sadly , the privilege will run you an extra $ 50 over the traditionalglossy panel , and it will replace that svelte borderless look present on glossy MBPs with a silver frame bezel ( check here to see just what we mean ) .

You might notice that there 's something subtly different about the new look of Firefox - the popular virtual memory stress test tool that 's cunningly disguised as a web browser .
With an icy blast from the Arctic , the British Isles - or something that used to look quite like them - have disappeared beneath sheets of glaciers .
This is the Mac icon , as seen from space :
Get your thermals on
The answer for the change lies in a splendid Strategy Boutique document prepared for the Firefox 3.5 icon designer - the original illustrator Jon Hicks having decamped to Opera .
The new render was produced by Anthony Piraino from Iconfactory .
What was behind the move ?
" I think fur texture is an important thing to have since the two best ways I see to freshen the icon ( without losing the essence of it ) are dimension and texture .
I guess what I had in mind was less overall pseudo realistic fur texture and more selective enhancement , " graphic designer Stephen Horlander told Softpedia : " It ’s hard to verbalize so I worked up what I had in mind .
Basically select patches of sharp , long , subtle ( maybe too subtle ? ) fur .
Some on the tufts on his face , some around the arm area , some on the upper and lower half of where his body curves . "
Yes , yes .
But what about the glaciers ?
Apparently that 's a result of the directive to make the planet more " glossy " .
So there you have it - planet in peril from runaway albedo effect .
Of course this being Friday , it 's merely the flimsiest excuse to bring you one of the great icon design competitions of all time , created for a Firefox fork called Ice Weasel , and now called GNU IceCat - which is Firefox without the proprietary software gubbins .
But the reasons for this breakaway need not concern us here .
The competition produced some of the greatest icons never to be seen .

When Bill Gates went into retirement , we threw him a week - long celebration and wished him well on his journey through philanthropy at his foundation .
The comings and goings of Steve Jobs have been less ceremonious .
He ’s been sick and Apple ’s tried to down play that and his importance to the company so the company , his life ’s work , can go on after he retires .
And having to do it without much fanfare so the company does n’t seem too reliant on him .
Look : Last Monday the first press release came out in months with a Steve quote in it , and he was seen on campus .
But no one at Cupertino is making a big deal of it .
Here ’s the thing :
None of us really want to believe that he ’s not important .
It ’s total bullshit to think that , if you look at his life and where his work fits in history .
I mean , this is the co-founder of Apple getting sick , and slowly leaving behind his 30 year legacy in computing to the next generation .
That deserves more respect , as it did in the case of Gates stepping down .
Not many news pieces were written in this context .
As I was doing some background reporting , digging up pieces I hoped would give stronger context to the current events , I realized there was n’t a good reference for all the little stories collected from the Valley and beyond about Steve Jobs ’ life .
The best information comes from books and quotes in magazine articles here and there , not the web .
And so , it was hard to find a frame of reference online that would give better context to all that was happening today .
So I started collecting a lot of it here , and found it enjoyable to document this notable life , rather than tear it down one hospital or liver transplant rumor at a time .
In some ways , it dissolved away some of the guilt I felt about writing about tracking someone ’s health as if it were merely a piece of news .
And so I kept going , until it was a somewhat presentable record of what we know about Jobs .
From what I ’ve seen , it ’s the most complete online .
Before we go , I ’d like to eschew the custom of linking to sources at the end and place them here because all these books are pretty amazing and worth checking out if you have the inclination .
The three notables are Owen Linzmayer ’s Apple Confidential 2.0 which has exactly levels of detail in regard to dates , times , etc , although less on Jobs personal life .
And VC and former Time Valley reporter Michael Moritz ’s out of print The Little Kingdom , which is out of print and I paid handsomely for on ebay .
Lastly , Andy Hertzfeld , one of the creators of the Mac , created Revolution in the Valley ( also available in website form at folklore.org ) , a telling of maybe 100 personal anecdotes from the development of the Mac .
It will make you think you were there .
I ’m not done with the pile below , but I ’ll keep updating this timeline as more bits come up .

1955
Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24th , 1955 .
He was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs , where they lived on 45th avenue in San Francisco .
His father was of “ imposing demeanor ” and before he was a repo man , he was an engine room machinist in the Coast guard .
He ’d tinker with cars and sell them for a profit .
Steve was a hyperactive child .
Somewhere in his childhood , he ingested a bottle of ant poison and had to be brought to the emergency room .

Of being adopted , Steve would later say , “ I think it ’s a natural curiosity for people to want to understand where certain traits come from . ”
“ But mostly , I ’m an environmentalist .
I think the way you are raised , your values , and most of your worldview come from the experiences you had growing up . ”
1963
Steve said this about his early school years , with a hint of pride : “ You should have seen us in third grade . ”
“ We basically destroyed the teacher . ”

1965
Even at 10 , Steve ’s attraction to electronics was becoming obvious to his parents .
At one point in his childhood he got a bad shock when jamming a bobby pin into a wall socket .
Paul moved with the family to Palo Alto , to handle the greater number of car repossessions that went with the greater of number of loans in the fast growing area known as Silicon Valley .

Steve goes on a spiritual trip to India with his friend Dan Kottke , and paid for Dan ’s ticket .
Upon wandering into a religious gathering , Jobs was taken away to the top of this mountain where the guru shaved his head .
In India , Steve experimented with LSD .
Dan shaved his head later , too , because he had lice .
Steve left for California and gave Dan the rest of his money to continue his journey in India .
Back at Atari , Nolan Bushnell asked Jobs to work on a special project that would eventually become the game Break - Out .
He made a deal to pay Jobs a certain amount if the machine had less than 40 chips .
Woz , who was an expert at such things , helped Jobs complete the design in 48 hours , and Jobs got the bonus .
The design was too complex to be manufactured .
In 1985 , Woz found out that his friend and partner had shorted him on that bonus , and is rumored to have been so hurt that he cried .
When he was confronted at that time , Jobs is said to have repeated that he did n’t remember that happening .
If Woz had found out earlier , he may have never joined up with Jobs to create Apple .

In the Homebrew Computer Club , Woz was showing off two printed circuit boards that were built to drive output to a TV .
Jobs continued working at Atari while Woz continued at HP .

Woz and Jobs start Apple .
It was n’t a thrilling name , but it was functional , and it reminded Jobs of the time he spent on an apple farm in Oregon .
On April 1st , they signed papers for equal ownership .
To raise capital , Woz sold his HP 65 electronic calculator for $ 520 and Jobs sold his red-and - white VW bus for $ 1500 — only half of which was ever paid , because the engine blew out soon after the sale .
Their first order was for 50 Apple I computers , and Jobs made the sale barefoot .
He confused the order and delivered circuitboards instead of finished machines with cases , and so had to take partial payment .
By the end of the year , they shipped 150 computers .

Woz and Jobs decided the Apple II would load their OS from the circuit board , instead of needing to be loaded manually .
It would also have a fanless power supply , something that needed to be designed from scratch using a switching model instead of a linear source .

Apple Computer becomes a corporation when Mike Markkula and Jobs and Woz sign papers at Mike ’s house , on January 3rd .
Mike Scott becomes Apple ’s president , and offends Jobs in two ways :
First he awards
Woz the position of being Employee # 1 because his design was instrumental in the company ’s founding .
Jobs would later insert himself as Employee # 0 .
Later , he informs Jobs his body odor is stinking up the office .

Jobs begins leaving his mark on Apple ’s design by hiring Intel ’s ad agency , Regis McKenna , to redesign the logo to the rainbow - filled Apple , which would be easily recognizable when small , although expensive to reproduce with its many colors .
The bite out of its side was a play on the word “ byte ” and kept it from being confused with a tomato .
The Apple II premieres at the West Coast Computer Faire on April 17th as the world ’s sleekest personal computer , in its plastic case .
Woz developed the machine with only 62 chips and Jobs insisted they be neatly placed on the board .
It has expansion slots but no visible screws ( all were on the bottom ) .

He starts working on the Lisa project , rumored to be named after his then estranged daughter .
They reversed engineered an acronym , “ Local Integrated Software Architecture ” , and a joke at the time insisted it stood for “ Let ’s Invent Some Acronym . ”
The computer would have a UI based on the windowed and mouse driven interfaces inspired by tech at Xerox PARC .
At one of the meetings at PARC , where they showed Jobs the tech , he reportedly jumped around the room excited saying , “ Why are n’t you doing anything with this ?
This is the greatest thing !
This is revolutionary ! ”
He also said , to Rolling Stone magazine , “ I do n’t think rational people could argue that every computer would n’t work this way someday . ”

Jobs is worth $ 217 million by the end of the first day of trading .
Jobs ’ friend and India travel partner Dan Kottke , received no stock at all , despite being employee # 11 .
It is rumored that Jobs denied him stock because he felt betrayed that Kottke offered Chris - Ann a shoulder to cry on after her split with Jobs .
Other early employees received little or no stock .
Woz , on the other hand , offered stock to many who Apple did not provide for , giving away 1/3 worth of his shares under his Wozplan .

Booted from the Lisa team by management that disagreed with his tactics and doubted his leadership abilities beyond his vision , Jobs gets involved with the Jef Raskin ’s Macintosh project , named after the McIntosh apple , with a typo .
It was designed to be a $ 1000 appliance computer that would turn on and just work .
Eventually , Jobs would take the project away from Raskin .
At one meeting , Jobs threw a telephone book on the table and insisted it be no longer than that , and vertical standing .
He commissioned frogdesign and Hartmut Esslinger to come up with the design language for the Mac , called Snow White .
Unlike Woz ’s Apple II , it had no expansion cards .
While much of Apple was becoming more straight laced , some credit Burrell Smith , a wildly creative tech who ’s talent was being wasted in the service department , for creating a brilliant digital board that the rest of the team could build around .
It was also notable , because unlike the Lisa project and others that were usually named after females ( wives , girlfriends , daughters ) the Mac was purposely named by Raskin to buck the sexist trend .
( The project was originally called Annie . )
Before much of this , in 1979 , Jobs asked Raskin to come up with the specs before the price .
And Raskin wrote a list of outrageous features meant to mock the idea .
The list would , years later , describe most of the machine , vindicating Jobs ’ method .

The Mac team defines the “ reality distortion field ” as different from how we describe it today :
An engineer would mention an idea to Jobs , who would call it stupid , and weeks later he ’d bring it up as his own , knowingly or not .
Jobs describes the case design of the Mac needing to be more like a Porsche than a VW .
( He drove a Porsche 928 at the time . )
He spoke design - ese and said this when judging a prototype coming from the car conversation : “ It ’s way too boxy , it ’s got to be more curvaceous .
The radius of the first chamfer [ a beveled edge connecting two surfaces , says Wikipedia ] needs to be bigger , and I do n’t like the size of the bezel .
But it ’s a start . ”

Jobs gives Bill Gates a demo of the Macintosh , and Gates agrees to develop software for it .
Bill Gates and Steve Jobs disagree on the future of the computer , Gates believing in its business utility and Jobs believing in its benefit to common people .
In the dramatized movie , Pirates of Silicon Valley , Gates uses this demo to kickstart Windows development , behind Jobs ’ back .
Apple engineers were to avoid showing Gates the Lisa , though , and were very secretive about what they demoed .
Jobs cuts off Andy Hertzfeld , engineer and presenter , by shouting “ Shut Up ! ” when he thought Andy was getting too close to revealing a secret .

When the first IBM PC came out , Apple took out a cocky ad in the Wall Street Journal led with the text “ Welcome IBM .
Seriously . ”
Jobs was quoted as saying that if IBM were to win , there would be a sort of “ computer dark ages for about 20 years ” .
Steve also said , “ We ’re going to out - market IBM .
We ’ve got our shit together . ” 20 years later , the heirs of the IBM PC , running Microsoft ’s Windows , would have over 90 % market share .

Jobs makes Bill Gates and Microsoft promise to never work on any business software that would use a mouse unless it was for Apple .
The fact that they did not exclude them from developing a competing operating system would allow Gates to develop Windows alongside the Mac software Microsoft was developing .
The Mac team ’s building had a security system that would arm itself at 5:30 PM , far too early for programmers who tended to come back to work after dinner .
It went off every day , or at least plenty of times .
Finally , Steve yelled for someone to destroy it .
Andy Hertzfeld drove a screwdriver into the alarm and when a security guard showed up and yelled at them , Jobs took responsibility for the destruction .
Obviously , he did n’t get in trouble .

Early in the year , a Time magazine cover story written by Michael Moritz ( today a venture capitalist who was on the board of Google ) began to reveal the darker side of Jobs to the public .
It had quotes by Woz claiming he did n’t design much tech in the Apple II , and lots of snipes by anonymous sources .
Jobs cancelled his new year ’s plans and thought about the article .
People could tell when Steve was in the office , because he parked in the handicapped spot out front in his blue Mercedes .
People think he did it because he was a dick , but David Bunnell has been quoted as saying it was because disgruntled Lisa or Apple II employees would come by and scratch it with their keys .

“ It ’s better to be a pirate than to join the Navy , ” said Steve .
The Mac project stole more and more technology from the Lisa project , especially after Burrell Smith figured out how to get the same processor as the Lisa , the Moto 68000 , into the Mac .
Jobs refused to make the two machines code compatible , however .
The final Lisa product would be released years later for $ 10 K , 5 times the original project ’s cost .
It would tank , competing with IBM ’s $ 3 K machine .

Mona , brings
Jobs to a book party for her new novel , Anywhere But Here , revealing their relationship as siblings to those who attended the party .

His interactions with her , and upon learning how similar they were , impacted Steve Jobs .

Steve did change , though .
One example is of the unusual pay scheme at NeXT .
Up till the early ‘ 90s , there were only two tiers of pay , $ 50 K and $ 75 K , based on how early you started in the company .
Pay day came once a month and the check was for the upcoming 4 weeks .
Seniors who joined with NeXT were given 2 % in company stock .
The even handedness stood in stark contrast with the chaotic pay and reward schemes found early at Apple .
At a dinner with important representatives from universities , the major target buyers of NeXT machines , the staff neglected to prepare a vegetarian dish for Jobs .

On October 5th , Steve Jobs pas sed away , peacefully , surrounded by his family .
( CNN ) --
Five years from now , there 's an excellent chance you wo n't have the same health insurance you have ( or do n't have ) right now .
That 's because members of Congress are gearing up to reform the U.S. health care system , and unlike in 1993 when then - first lady Hillary Clinton tried her hand at changing the medical system , this time the important players -- doctors , insurance companies , pharmaceutical manufacturers -- seem to be on board .
You heard a lot about health care reform this week , and you 'll be hearing even more in the months to come .
It 's an incredibly confusing , complex issue , so in this week 's Empowered Patient , we break it down for you with 10 frequently asked questions about health care reform .
Overhauling health care is key to U.S. economic stability , President Obama tells doctors Monday .
1 . Why is health care reform such a hot issue right now ?
Fewer and fewer Americans have health insurance , and therefore cannot afford good medical care .
Nearly 46 million Americans have no insurance , and 25 million more are underinsured .
One major reason for this crisis is that many employers have stopped offering insurance to employees because of the high cost .
In the United States , total health care spending was $ 2.4 trillion in 2007 -- or $ 7,900 per person -- according to an analysis published in the journal Health Affairs .
The United States spends 52 percent more per person than the next most costly nation , Norway , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation .
There 's little debate that health care reform is necessary -- President Obama , Republican and Democratic members of Congress , the American Medical Association and America 's Health Insurance Plans , which represents the insurance industry , all have agreed the system needs to be changed , although they disagree on how to do it .
2 . So let 's start with Obama .
What are his plans for revamping the system ?
A central point of the president 's plan is to create a government - sponsored health insurance program that would be an option for all Americans , similar to how Medicare is now an option for Americans over age 65 .
He has also said he'd " like to see " prohibitions against insurers discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions , and incentives for people to use preventive services and wellness plans .
Obama outlined this plan last week at a town hall meeting in Green Bay , Wisconsin , and on his Web site .
3 . How does the president plan to pay for this ?
Obama said he 's already identified " hundreds of billions of dollars " worth of savings in the federal budget that could help finance health care reform , such as rooting out waste , fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid .
He 's also proposed reducing tax deductions for high - income Americans .
4 . What do the Republicans think of Obama 's plan ?
In particular , they do n't like the idea of having a government - sponsored health insurance program for all Americans .
They fear employers would opt for the government - run insurance over private insurance because the government option would most likely be less expensive , but Republicans say it would also be lower quality .
For information , see House Minority Leader John Boehner 's Web site .
5 . Since they do n't like Obama 's ideas , how would Republicans like to reform health care ?
Republicans think Obama 's plan is costly and will make health insurance more expensive , not less .
In a plan outlined this week , House Republicans proposed individual tax breaks for buying health insurance and " pools " of states and small business to get lower - cost health care plans .
They also proposed increasing incentives for people to build health savings accounts , allowing dependent children to stay on parents ' policies until age 25 and encouraging employers to reward employees for improved health .
6 . I 'm happy with the insurance I receive from my employer .
What would health care reform mean for me ?
If you receive high - quality health insurance from your employer , Obama said , his plan wo n't change that , and you can still keep your insurance and your doctors .
Republicans , however , said that if Obama gets his way , there 's a good chance your employer will stop buying the private insurance you have now and instead opt for the less - expensive government plan .
7 . I have a pre-existing condition and can't get health insurance .
Will health care reform help me ?
You have a terrible problem and you 're in good company .
Millions of people who do n't get insurance through their employer try to get insurance on their own and are turned down because they have a pre-existing condition .
Obama said at the Green Bay town hall meeting that under his reforms , no insurance plan " would be able to deny coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions , " but he did n't explain how he would force insurance companies to insure people with pre-existing health problems .
Similarly , Boehner wrote on his blog that " quality health coverage must exist for every American , regardless of pre-existing health conditions , " but did not explain how he would pay to insure people with pre-existing conditions .
8 . How do doctors feel about health care reform ?
The American Medical Association said while it believes in health care reform , " the AMA does not believe that creating a public health insurance option ... is the best way to expand health insurance coverage . "
The AMA has told members of Congress that doctors fear a new government - sponsored health insurance program would reimburse them at Medicare rates .
" Medicare reimbursement rates have not kept pace with the cost of practice , " AMA President Dr. Nancy Nielsen told CNN earlier this week .
" Our Medicare rates are back at 2001 rates , and the reality is , that 's not where our rent is , that 's not where the electricity is .
The system for paying doctors is a broken system , and everybody acknowledges it . "
Other doctors ' groups , however , support the idea .
The American Academy of Family Physicians , the National Physicians Alliance and other groups put out a statement of support this week for Obama 's plan .
" Having the choice of a public health insurance plan will help make health care more affordable for patients , foster greater competition in the insurance market and guarantee that quality , affordable coverage will be there for our patients no matter what happens , " they wrote in a joint statement ..
9. Obama has mentioned high health care costs in McAllen , Texas , several times .
What 's up with that ?
According to research conducted at the Dartmouth Institute , the average per person health costs for McAllen are sky - high compared with costs in other cities .
In McAllen , the average Medicare beneficiary spends $ 15,758 per year , while the average Medicare patient in LaCrosse , Wisconsin , spends $ 6,412 per year .
Another comparison :
The cost in Miami , Florida , is $ 18,170 , compared with $ 7,478 in Portland , Oregon .
Dartmouth researchers believe doctors in high - priced cities tend to refer to specialists more and are more likely to put patients in the hospital rather than handling their problems on an outpatient basis .
10 .
How do health care costs in the U.S. compare with costs in other countries ?
In the United States , every person spends on average $ 6,714 for health care .
That 's significantly higher than in the United Kingdom , where $ 2,760 per person is spent ; or in France , where the cost is $ 3,449 per person ; or in Canada , where medical costs are $ 3,678 per person , according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .
While some would argue that medical care is better in the United States than in these other countries , others would say the opposite is true .
For example , the United States ranks 50th in life expectancy , and 180th infant mortality ( meaning 179 countries have higher infant mortality rates such as Angola and Turkey and 43 countries have lower infant mortality rates such as France and Sweden ) according to the CIA World Factbook .

A note from Cynthia McKinney circulating on the e-mail lists :
The Viva Palestina convoy , led by George Galloway , is about to leave Gaza after having been permitted to enter for a period of 24 hours after waiting 11 days in Cairo for permission to enter Gaza .
That in and of itself is a major story when expanded to include the inability of Gazans to exit The Strip–even if only to enter another part of their country , the West Bank or to move about freely in the fictional “ Palestinian State . ”
I say fictional because it continues to dwindle even while peace talks are underway .
Fictional , because Palestinian elections deemed by international observers to be free and fair , do n’t count if the US - and Israel - approved party loses , and the winners get to sit for years in an Israeli jail .
Fictional , because they use Israel ’s currency here , the shekel , and the international roaming on our US cell phones indicates calls are from Israel .
Gaza is beautiful .
Gaza is full of life , despite Israel ’s Operation Cast Lead .
And now , I have seen , Gaza has been bombed to smithereens .
I think I ’ve mastered my video camera enough to share some images with you .
I ’ll post them on the sites below when I return .
In the meantime , my fellow Americans and citizens of the world , we have a lot to do to put right all the wrong things done in our name .
Much love to all of you who helped me , guided me , prayed for me , to make this successful entry into Gaza happen .
Viva Palestina !!
Free Gaza !!

What I then told McNamara about his vitally important locks elicited this response : “ I am shocked , absolutely shocked and outraged .
Who the hell authorized that ? ”
What he had just learned from me was that the locks had been installed , but everyone knew the combination .
The Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) in Omaha quietly decided to set the “ locks ” to all zeros in order to circumvent this safeguard .
During the early to mid-1970s , during my stint as a Minuteman launch officer , they still had not been changed .
Our launch checklist in fact instructed us , the firing crew , to double - check the locking panel in our underground launch bunker to ensure that no digits other than zero had been inadvertently dialed into the panel .
SAC remained far less concerned about unauthorized launches than about the potential of these safeguards to interfere with the implementation of wartime launch orders .
And so the “ secret unlock code ” during the height of the nuclear crises of the Cold War remained constant at 00000000 .
Ursula von der Leyen behauptet , Indien sei das Mekka der Kinderpornographie im Internet ein Land , in dem Kinderpornographie gefahrlos verbreitet werden könne .
Dabei ist diese dort nicht nur illegal : auf den einschlägigen Sperrlisten steht nur eine einzige Webseite aus Indien – aber hunderte aus Deutschland und tausende aus den USA .
In letzter Zeit hat Familienministerin Ursula von der Leyen immer wieder Indien als Kinderporno - Schurkenstaat bezeichnet .
Zuletzt im MDR bei Radio Sputnik :
Dies ist eine glatte Lüge .
Zum einen ist Kinderpornographie in Indien schon lange illegal , da Pornographie illegal ist .
Außerdem ist in Indien seit Anfang des Jahres auch explizit Kinderpornographie illegal , schon alleine das anschauen :
The newly passed Information Technology Bill is set to make it
illegal to not only create and transmit child pornography in any
electronic form , but even to browse it .
The punishment for a first offence of publishing , creating , exchanging , downloading or browsing any electronic depiction of children in " obscene or indecent or sexually explicit manner " can attract five years in jail .

Gaining the awareness , the attention , and ultimately the trust of a community online is a challenge many people are working to accomplish .
Whether for your own personal interests or for a business - related use , we look to build relationships using these tools so that we can have conversations with the right people .
But where should you start ?
What comprises a good methodology for using the platform ?
What ’s the proper etiquette .
Here are some starter moves to consider when building a presence framework for business communications purposes .
This ran pretty long .
Let ’s call it part 1 of 2 .
Listening First
It ’s easier if you grow bigger ears .
Use listening tools to find where people might be talking about you ( by inputting search terms your prospective community might use in discussions that are pertinent to your interests .
Start a spreadsheet or simple database to note where these conversations are happening , and to record info on who is out there in the space .
Check out Alltop and Google Blogsearch to find existing blogs on the topic .
Subscribe .
Get ready to start commenting there .
Keep your listening station running all the time .
Tune it all the time .
Work hard at knowing where people are talking about you , your competitors , those topics that interest you .
This is one of the most important parts of the platform .
Passports
In my post , Using Outposts in Your Social Media Strategy , I talk about home bases , outposts , and passports .
A home base is the eventual site where you hope people come to interact the most with you .
Outposts are places of presence that you maintain for interaction and promotion purposes .
Passports are profiles to use on various social sites , meaning that it ’s important to have an account / profile there , but you might not necessarily have to participate as a full - fledged community member .
Here are some recommended sites for passports .
Some of these might be outposts for you , but that ’s up to you .
wordpress.com – a blogging platform
flickr.com – a photo sharing site
gmail.com – for all Google Accounts
yahoo.com – for all Yahoo Accounts ( including flickr above )
digg.com – a social news / recommendation site
stumbleupon.com – a social recommendation site
disqus.com – a commenting platform
delicious.com – a social bookmarking platform
blip.tv – a video hosting platform ( see also viddler.com and vimeo.com )
twitter.com – a powerful social network ( see more in outposts below )
facebook.com – a social network ( see more in outposts below )
youtube.com – a video sharing site ( see more in outposts below )
openid.org – a universal account ( very useful )
brightkite.com – a location - based service ( not 100 % necessary , but recommended )
yelp.com – especially pertinent to small and / or local businesses
Having these accounts means you can communicate faster should a conversation pertinent to your interests start on any of those sites .
From here , we ’ll look into outpost sites that have worked well for me .
Outposts
Outposts refer to those social sites where you might consider maintaining an online presence , but where your participation will be split between interacting with people there , and guiding them gently to your home base ( whatever site you intend your online interactions to focus around ) .
Here are a few recommendations .
The truth is , you ’ll also need to have done your listening homework to find the more focus - specific sites that are n’t as general as these .
twitter.com – this site is my single most successful point of presence as an outpost .
I devote a full 60 or 70 percent of my efforts here , as they pay off repeatedly .
Twitter is a great place to build loosely - joined relationships , and to find pertinent conversations using the Twitter Search Tool .
facebook.com – if you ’re willing to mix life and work , facebook offers a rapidly growing user base ( over 700,000 a day at this writing ) , and many ways to interact .
I have mixed effect on Facebook , but they do offer many sharing and promotional tools that spread my online presence and then redouble .
With recent improvements to business pages and fan pages , Facebook seems to have even more new features on the horizon that will help .
youtube.com – with over 13 billion videos served a month , ignoring the presence point of youtube as a potential place to build community is no longer prudent .
Video is n’t everyone ’s cup of tea , but it might be of value to create at least a few video assets to start the conversation .
linkedin.com – this is n’t an online resume ; it ’s a living business connections network .
I admit to using the service somewhat differently than officially recommended .
I ’m a promiscuous linker ( meaning I do n’t necessarily restrict my connections to people I know well ; I save that for recommendations , as I wo n’t recommend someone I ca n’t vouch for ) .
Many people find great success devoting some time to the Q&A section .
If you ’re not necessarily into business networking , you could also check out Yahoo !
Answers .
Beyond this , you might check out sites like Ning.com to find like - minded communities .
Do n’t forget also Yahoo !
Groups and Google Groups .
Forums are alive and well , too .
By searching and listening , you ’ll get a better sense of where people are spending time .
That ’s where you should focus your preliminary efforts , no matter my recommendations above .
Home Base
Home base is where you focus the most of your presence time .
Depending on who you are ( or who your client might be ) should determine how you build this site .
I rarely find a case where blogging software is n’t the best choice for your home base .
Here ’s what I mean with regards to home base .
In my case , [ chrisbrogan.com ] is my home base .
The goals of this base are fourfold :
Equip you to be successful with business relationship management ( social media and marketing , mostly ) .
Share my perspective such that it might appeal to you professionally , either as a speaker or as a business associate through my agency .
Point you to other projects , products , and people who I think are noteworthy .
Experiment with business communications and media so I can better equip organizations for success .
Those are my goals .
Knowing the goals of your home base will dictate how and what to include on the site .
For instance , if I were representing film actor Ryan Reynolds , I ’d build a site with these goals :
Connect people with Ryan ’s personality and off - camera , behind - the - scenes world for community relationship management .
Display Ryan ’s body of work ( YouTube ) and his photo stream ( Flickr ) for lead generation .
Provide Ryan a platform to talk about non-film - related interests ( maybe BlogTalkRadio and / or Ustream.tv for weekly chats ) .
Ryan ’s not a writer .
I ’d skew the site towards video and audio connectivity , which also provides a more human connection .
Maybe he ’s secretly an essayist .
If so , I ’d give that the stage .
My main point here is that we ca n’t build a home base to be generic .
It has to fit the personality and needs of the person or organization we ’re crafting it for .
Summing Up the Platform
We ’ve built a 3 part platform plus a listening station .
We have a home base , outposts , and some passport accounts , should we need them .
The listening station is up and running so that you can be aware of the larger conversation around you , and you ’ve got a reasonable platform put together .
In my next post , Make Presence Management Work For You , we ’ll talk about what to do with all this , and how to accomplish some simple business relationship management objectives .
Any questions on what ’s listed above ?
Does this help ?
How are you doing it differently ?
Located 7000 light - years away , towards the constellation of Serpens ( the Snake ) , the Eagle Nebula is a dazzling stellar nursery , a region of gas and dust where young stars are currently being formed and where a cluster of massive , hot stars , NGC 6611 , has just been born .
The powerful light and strong winds from these massive new arrivals are shaping light - year long pillars , seen in the image partly silhouetted against the bright background of the nebula .
The nebula itself has a shape vaguely reminiscent of an eagle , with the central pillars being the “ talons ” .
The star cluster was discovered by the Swiss astronomer , Jean Philippe Loys de Chéseaux , in 1745 – 46 .
It was independently rediscovered about twenty years later by the French comet hunter , Charles Messier , who included it as number 16 in his famous catalogue , and remarked that the stars were surrounded by a faint glow .
The Eagle Nebula achieved iconic status in 1995 , when its central pillars were depicted in a famous image obtained with the NASA / ESA Hubble Space Telescope .
In 2001 , ESO ’s Very Large Telescope ( VLT ) captured another breathtaking image of the nebula ( ESO Press Photo 37/01 ) , in the near - infrared , giving astronomers a penetrating view through the obscuring dust , and clearly showing stars being formed in the pillars .
The newly released image , obtained with the Wide - Field Imager camera attached to the MPG / ESO 2.2 - metre telescope at La Silla , Chile , covers an area on the sky as large as the full Moon , and is about 15 times more extensive than the previous VLT image , and more than 200 times more extensive than the iconic Hubble visible - light image .
The whole region around the pillars can now be seen in exquisite detail .
The “ Pillars of Creation ” are in the middle of the image , with the cluster of young stars , NGC 6611 , lying above and to the right .
The “ Spire ” — another pillar captured by Hubble — is at the centre left of the image .
Finger - like features protrude from the vast cloud wall of cold gas and dust , not unlike stalagmites rising from the floor of a cave .
Inside the pillars , the gas is dense enough to collapse under its own weight , forming young stars .
These light - year long columns of gas and dust are being simultaneously sculpted , illuminated and destroyed by the intense ultraviolet light from massive stars in NGC 6611 , the adjacent young stellar cluster .
Within a few million years — a mere blink of the universal eye — they will be gone forever .
For those who are using Ubuntu Jaunty , you will notice that there is a change in the way the system notifies you to upgrade software .
In the past , an icon will appear on the system tray whenever there is new update available .
In Ubuntu Jaunty , instead of showing the icon , the update manager will now pop up the window as and when it detects new update .
While this is a good way to grab the user attention and get them to upgrade to the latest software version promptly , it can be pretty annoying for many , especially when you are in the midst of your work .
To make it worst , if you close it without updating , it will keep on popping up in regular interval until you have upgraded your system .
Luckily , you can turn off this pop up feature easily and switch back to the old icon - appear - at - system - tray mode .
Open up a terminal , type
gconf-editor
This will load up the gconf editor window
Navigate to Apps -> Update Notifier .
On the right , unchecked the auto_launch box .
Close the window .
That ’s it .
To recover the auto launch pop up function , simply repeat the above step , but place a check in the auto_launch box .
Alternative method ( via the terminal )
If you are just plain lazy , here ’s a much easier step .
In your terminal , type the following command :

One of the suggested objectives in Gabor Szabo's Measurable objectives for the Perl ecosystem is " Increase the number of Perl book sales " .
I like most of the objectives in Gabor 's post , but I must caution against taking the numbers presented too seriously .
At best , they 're incomplete .
At worse , they 're completely misleading .
Gabor refers to State of the Computer Book Market - Mid-Year 2009 , written by Mike Hendrickson .
Mike 's company publishes similar analyses a few times a year , based on sales data from Nielsen Bookscan .
( For more on the culture of Bookscan rankings in the publishing world , see Why writers never reveal how many books their buddies have sold . )
This data sounds wonderful and the pretty graphs and charts give you the impression that you 're getting useful information .
Yet this is only a picture of the market .
As Mike writes later in the piece :
Many publishers report that more than 50 % of their revenue is achieved as direct sales , and those numbers do not get reported into Bookscan .
Sales at traditional college bookstores are typically not reported into Bookscan as well .
Again this is US Retail Sales data recorded at the point of sale to a consumer .
These numbers reflect less than half of revenue .
Throw out half of sales by dollar and hope that the results are stochastic .
Yet there 's a deeper flaw behind these numbers .
How Book Sales Work
If you plot the sales curve of multiple books , you 'll notice that they tend to follow the ubiquitous power law .
A book sells as many copies in its first three months as it will the rest of the first year .
A book sells half as many copies in the second year as it did in the first .
This model is so accurate that the publishing industry calls titles " frontlist " titles if they 're in their first year of publishing and " backlist " titles if they 're not .
While a few titles have strong backlist sales , they 're rare .
They 're the Bibles and Harry Potters and How to Win Friends and Influence Peoples .
The publishing industry 's san greal is to find a new strong backlist bestseller .
They tend to exhibit strong frontlist behavior as well .
The retailer 's point of view is different .
Limited shelf space means that new books still in their three - six - twelve month short snout sales levels often get priority over older books in the long tail sales levels .
If you 're going to see 3000 copies of a book in the first three months and 1000 copies in the next three years , stock up early .
This is especially true in technical book publishing , where I have trouble giving away Python 2.3 and Oracle 7 and Red Hat Linux 6 books .
Publishing dates are expiration dates : best by a year after the copyright date .
Why does this matter ?
It 's a simple matter of economics : people wo n't buy books you do n't publish .
The Freshness Factor
2005 was a good year for Perl book sales .
Why ?
Four strong Perl books came out in 2005 .
The Perl book sales numbers for that year reflected the short snout of Perl book sales .
Four years later , is PBP selling as many copies ?
Is the Perl Testing book ?
Is HOP ?
Is APP 2e ?
Those are rhetorical questions .
You already know the answer .
You can even answer that question for the Camel 3e .
A book published in 2000 may still be useful nine years later , but Camel 3e predates almost every part of the Perl Renaissance .
Besides that , the 250k or 300 k units already sold have reached a fair amount of the Perl 5 programming market .
Compare that with the Ruby book market in 2006 , where you could n't leave an editorial board meeting without an assignment to publish a new Ruby or Rails book .
Initial sales numbers looked great ; the growth in that market segment was huge !
Did any Ruby book sell 250 k copies , though ?
That number 's missing from the year - by - year analysis .
Look at this year 's numbers .
Objective - C is huge !
It 's 1999 all over again !
Except that , yet again , the comparison is to an emerging market segment without analysis of historical trends .
The Missing Data
The biggest piece of data obviously missing from these State of the Computer Book Market entries is historical context .
Six months or a year of appositional data comparing different market segment maturities is misleading , at beast .
Should you go learn Objective - C just because Bookscan reported more Objective - C titles sold than SQL ?
No -- but to be fair , Mike does n't suggest this directly .
Other missing data is more subtle , and perhaps more meaningful .
Where 's the breakdown of frontlist / backlist for these sales figures ?
More than nine out of ten books follow the power law I described earlier .
If the Objective - C books have all come out in the past year , they 're in their short snout period .
Of course they 're selling more units now than books in the long tail period .
How many total units does the market represent ?
If the number of books sold in 2009 is half the number sold in 2008 , it 's difficult to compare the performance of books against each other year - over - year .
There are too many other factors to consider .
( You can still get interesting information , but you can't compare technologies against each other in meaningful appositive ways . )
How many books are in each category ?
Title efficiency ( average number of unit sales per title and standard deviation ) can tell other interesting stories .
Is one language category hit driven ( iPhone Programming , Ruby on Rails ) ?
Are there niche subjects intended as modest sales targets and not bestsellers ?
Is every book a moderate success , with no breakout quintessential must - have tome ?
Is there a gold rush of publishing with 40 new titles produced in a year and each of them selling a dismal 1000 copies apiece ?
How many new books are in a market segment this year compared to last year ?
This is the biggest question that matters to Perl books , especially with regard to Gabor 's suggestion .
Again , this should be obvious : no one can buy Camel 4e right now .
A Completely Hypothetical Fictional Example I Made Up Completely From Whole Cloth
If that did n't convince you , consider a short fable about oyster farming .
Suppose you own a publishing company .
Suppose you discover a new topic area : oyster farming .
No one 's published on this topic before , but hundreds of thousands of people are doing it .
There 's a lot of institutional knowledge , but there 's a ripe opportunity for documenting best practices and nuanced techniques -- especially given that you have found the person who invented modern oyster farming and convinced him to write a book about it .
You publish the book .
It takes off .
Its short snout is wide .
( My metaphor is awkward . )
You 've discovered a new market segment ; you 've invented a new market segment .
Life is grand .
You branch out .
You publish More Oyster Farming and Learn to Farm Oysters and Pteriidae , Reefs , Bivalves , and Mollusks .
You even write a cookbook for Oysters .
Then a catastrophic triploid spawning accident removes the long - beloved MSX resistance in most commercial oyster farms , ruining the market for a year -- maybe longer -- and in a panic you cancel all of your upcoming frontlist titles .
A few other publishers publish one - or two - off titles in the market segment .
They sell a few copies .
You had a corner on the market though .
You were the publishing world 's China of oyster farming .
Over the next four years , you look at your sales numbers and congratulate yourself for getting out of the oyster farming publishing market segment when you did , because no one 's buying oyster farming books anymore .
After all , publishing one frontlist title per year is obviously a sign you take the oyster farming market seriously and want to see it continue .
The issues have confronted the archbishop with deep divisions not simply between liberals and conservatives in the United States but also across the broader church with its many followers in Africa , Britain and elsewhere .
Four conservative dioceses in the United States and many individual Episcopal churches have broken away from the national denomination to forge alliances with conservative Anglican groups such as the Anglican Church of Nigeria .
Archbishop Williams said : “ There is at least the possibility of a twofold ecclesial reality in view in the middle distance : that is , a ‘ covenanted ’ Anglican global body , fully sharing certain aspects of a vision of how the Church should be and behave , able to take part as a body in ecumenical and interfaith dialogue ; and , related to this body , but in less formal ways with fewer formal expectations , there may be associated local churches in various kinds of mutual partnership and solidarity with one another and with ‘ covenanted ’ provinces . ”
The archbishop has promoted the idea of covenant  described by some analysts as a kind of good - behavior guide for churches  to overcome the rift .
“ This has been called a ‘ two - tier ’ model , or , more disparagingly , a first - and second - class structure , ” the archbishop ’s message said .
“ But perhaps we are faced with the possibility rather of a ‘ two - track ’ model , two ways of witnessing to the Anglican heritage , one of which had decided that local autonomy had to be the prevailing value and so had in good faith declined a covenantal structure . ”
The message continued : “ It helps to be clear about these possible futures , however much we think them less than ideal , and to speak about them not in apocalyptic terms of schism and excommunication but plainly as what they are  two styles of being Anglican , whose mutual relation will certainly need working out but which would not exclude cooperation in mission and service of the kind now shared in the Communion . ”
The archbishop ’s message drew mixed responses from liberals and conservatives in the United States , The Associated Press reported .
The Rev. Susan Russell , president of an Episcopal gay advocacy group , said it was disappointing that Archbishop Williams had debated the inclusion of gays and lesbians from “ solely a political or rights - based ” perspective rather than a theological perspective .
But , she said , “ what the archbishop is really stating is the reality : that the structures that have served the Anglican Communion historically need some work .
The 21st century is different than the 16th century . ”
Canon Kendall Harmon , a conservative , said the archbishop ’s message was “ going to increase the chaos in the province of the American church and in the Anglican Communion , ” The A.P. reported .

Only when I entered Princeton did I start to have doubts about the system that got me there .
Some took the form of doubts about myself .
My impressive performance on the SATs ( whose supposed biases I was blind to , perhaps because I was a middle - class Caucasian and they operated in my favor ) did n’t seem to count for much now that I found myself having to absorb volumes upon volumes of information rather than get the right answers on multiple - choice tests .
Yes , I had a large vocabulary , and yes , I knew how to deploy it to good effect in classroom discussions and during professors ’ office hours , but suddenly my prowess felt slightly fraudulent .
Called upon to read whole books , many of them old , obscure and difficult , I discovered that I lacked stamina and insight .
The little word puzzles I cut my teeth on were irrelevant to the daunting task of digesting Chaucer and Milton .
My solution ?
I did n’t have one .
Like countless college students before and since , I relied for my scholastic survival on a combination of verbal bluster , teacher - pleasing good manners and handy study aids .
While I dished out the high - level baloney that my aptocratic mind excelled at , I looked around at the students who did n’t resemble me in terms of skin color and background and wondered how they were staying afloat at all .
As a child of the rural Midwest , I felt decidedly out of place at Princeton among the debonair Eastern prep-school graduates who still , in the early 1980s ( just a decade or so after the campus went co-ed ) seemed to embody its privileged heritage , so I could scarcely imagine the alienation of these other yet more marginalized students .
And while I happened to know that some of them gained admission on special terms meant to make up for their social disadvantages , I did n’t resent them for this .
Not at all .
Because I came from a geographic region that Princeton had n’t favored in the past , but which it was now intent on drawing from , I was also a sort of affirmative - action student .
What ’s more , the poorer and browner of my classmates — particularly the women — seemed to study twice as hard as I did , clocking endless hours in the library and forgoing weekend parties for late - night cram sessions .
Maybe their SAT scores were lower than mine , but they ranked higher than I did on the effort scale .
And on the bravery scale too .

A system of advancement by aptitude , by statistical measurements of mental acuity , does n’t concern itself with determination and courage , but if the world were truly fair , it would .
This was one of the things I learned at Princeton , along with the lesson that multiple - choice tests do n’t predict a student ’s grasp of Shakespeare .
To judge by her statements about her college days and by her ruling on the use of a vocational examination used to promote firefighters , Sotomayor is also skeptical about one - size - fits - all testing .
That ’s probably natural , given her experience as an aptocrat who needed help , made the most of it when it was offered and may soon succeed to a position that could allow her to see that others receive it .
But what does the American public think ?
According to a recent New York Times / CBS
News poll , 67 percent of Democrats support affirmative action , while 60 percent of Republicans oppose it .
These numbers reflect an old philosophical split over the nature of social justice .
Does it consist of devising enlightened rules and applying them equally to everyone or does it entail sometimes modifying those rules when it appears that they treat some of us a bit more equally than others ?
This argument could go on forever ( and has ) , but there ’s a way out of it , I think , which even my most exacting Princeton professors might not find entirely idiotic .
The premise of this solution is that all systems that seek to rank human beings according to “ merit ” — an inherently complex idea — will inevitably fall short of fully accounting for what merit consists of in the real world .
As such , these systems , like our Constitution , should be subject to amendment from time to time , since no definition of merit lasts forever .
I scanned the Microsoft ad below from a recent QBS catalogue .
I am still struggling to understand the underlying message .
Use Team System and Microsoft will get its tentacles around you ?
I do n’t know which is more unlikely , the basketball playing Cthonians or the athletic and good looking development team .
The leader of the Comanchero bikie gang has been refused bail on a murder charge after a brawl at Sydney Airport .
Mick Hawi is one of a number of Comancheros charged over the fatal brawl that led to the death of Hells Angels associate Anthony Zervas .
In the same court , the brother of Anthony Zervas , Peter , was granted bail for his alleged involvement in the brawl that led to the death of his younger brother .
Mick Hawi is the only Comanchero charged with murder ; the others are charged with riot and affray .
Hawi appeared in prison greens via video link in Central Local Court today and bail was formally refused until the matter returns to court next week .
Zervas
Hells Angels member Peter Zervas is charged with riot and affray , along with other Hells Angels members .
Zervas 's lawyer told Central Local Court that Peter and Anthony Zervas were victims and that Peter was seriously injured in a drive - by shooting not long after the fatal brawl .
The Crown argued that Peter Zervas has been well enough to go about his business and has not been wearing a brace he said he needs when he was arrested .
In granting him bail with strict reporting conditions , a magistrate said there is some evidence of self defence , that Peter Zervas suffers depression and that he saw his brother killed .

Doug Short has produced a new market chart .
This one aligns the four big bear markets from the bottom of their first major collapse ... and then charts their recoveries off the lows .
Bulls and bears alike will be glad to know ... we just beat the rally at the end of 1929 !
That is to say :
Our recovery off the bottom has just surpassed the violent rally from the end of 1929 to the spring of 1930 -- the one that convinced everyone in that era that the crash was done and it was off to the races again .
Notably , that rally lasted almost exactly as long as the one we 've just had : 5 months .
Then it failed .
Two years later , the market finally bottomed down almost 90 % from the peak ( and 70 % or so from the interim peak ) .
Keeping our fingers crossed ...

A former public schoolboy planned a suicide bombing after being radicalised by extremist preachers on the internet .
Andrew ' Isa ' Ibrahim , 20 , was arrested just ' a matter of hours or days ' before he was about to strike at Bristol 's biggest shopping centre .
The son of Christian church - going parents converted to Islam after falling under the spell of radicals such as Abu Hamza , Omar Bakri Mohammed and the 7/7 bombers , in speeches recorded on the internet .
He had also become a regular hard - drug user , after first experimenting with cannabis at 12 .
From student to radical : Would - be suicide bomber Andrew ' Isa ' Ibrahim pictured first from his MySpace profile , then on his arrest in April 2008 Yesterday he was convicted at Winchester Crown Court of making an explosive with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury , and preparation of terrorist acts , and sentenced to at least ten years in jail .
His father Nassif - an Egyptian - born consultant pathologist - mother Victoria , and brother Peter were in court every day and have regularly visited him while he was in prison .
Mrs Ibrahim fled the court in tears as the sentence was passed .
More ... Captured on camera :
The moment suicide bomber blew himself up in luxury Indonesian hotel killing eight
The Jihad fanatic peddling a message of hate to 11 - year - old Londoners ( funded by the taxpayer ) Mr Justice Butterfield said : ' You were , in my judgment , a lonely and angry young person at the time of these events , with a craving for attention .
' Ibrahim made explosives and a suicide vest in his flat and carried out extensive surveillance at Broadmead shopping centre in Bristol , where he planned to cause the maximum damage by using nails and ball bearings in his bomb .
He bought the main components for the suicide bomb from high street shops , including branches of Boots .
CCTV footage shows Isa Ibrahim buying hydrogen peroxide in BootsDeadly : A collection of ball bearings , nails and screws found in Ibrahim 's flatIbrahim was only caught after members of the Al - Baseera mosque in Bristol saw injuries he suffered while testing the explosive and , concerned about his extreme views and what he may be planning , told police that a white Muslim convert was acting suspiciously .
It is believed to be the first time that the Muslim community has played a central role in bringing a potential terrorist bomber to justice .
When they entered his flat in April last year , police found between 125- 245 grammes of the unstable explosive Hexamethylene Triperoxide Diamine , also known as HMTD , in a Family Circle biscuit tin in Ibrahim 's fridge .
He had also made an electrical circuit capable of detonating the explosive at short range and a half - made suicide vest , and filmed himself testing the explosives on the floor of his flat .
Ibrahim made the HMTD , the same substance used in the July 7 attacks , and suicide vest entirely through instructions from the internet .
There was also a large amount of radical literature in the flat and when he was arrested the book Milestones by Sayyid Kutb was in his rucksack .
The book advocated jihad and radical Islam .
Distraught : Ibrahim 's mother Victoria , father Nassif and brother Peter outside court last week .
They have sat through every day of his trial
The jury of four women and eight men spent six days deliberating before finding him guilty of making an explosive substance with intent by a majority of 11 to one and the preparation of terrorist acts by a majority of ten to two .
Ibrahim , from Westbury - on - Trym , Bristol , had denied both charges but pleaded guilty to a third charge of making an explosive substance .
He told the jury he just wanted to set the explosives off and film it for the YouTube website to fill a void in his life because he was lonely and the lost sheep of his family .
Mr Justice Butterfield told Ibrahim that , even though he had not made a detonation device or completed the suicide vest , his preparations for an attack were ' advanced ' .
He added : ' You are a dangerous young man , well capable of acting on the views you held in the spring of 2008 .
' Raid :
One of two homemade suicide vests found in Ibrahim 's bedroom Flanked by four prison officers , Ibrahim showed no emotion as the jury delivered its majority verdict .
After the verdict the Crown Prosecution Service Counter Terrorism lawyer Moira Macmillan said : ' The device that Ibrahim was making was viable and he had taken steps to make it even more destructive by acquiring ball bearings and airgun pellets .
' He had identified a target .
Had he carried out the attack he had been preparing , serious civilian casualties would have been inevitable .' More details emerged yesterday of his journey from public schoolboy to potential suicide bomber .
Brought up in a £ 1 million gated mansion in the leafy Bristol suburb of Frenchay , Andrew Ibrahim seemed set for a prosperous life like his elder brother , Peter , 27 , who went to Oxford University and is now an IT software engineer .
But his unruly behaviour , and developing drug habit began to take their toll .
Ibrahim was first expelled from £ 19,065 - a- year Colston 's School for smacking girls on the bottom .
He was then thrown out of the £ 9,885 - a- year Queen Elizabeth Hospital school in Bristol aged 12 for smoking cannabis .
He moved to writer Auberon Waugh 's former school - the £ 24,141 - a- year strict Roman Catholic Downside School in Bath as a boarder , but was expelled for drinking alcohol in the dorm and going missing .
He ended up at the then £ 7,500 - a- year Bristol Cathedral School , where he passed nine GCSEs with good grades .
By now Ibrahim , who converted to Islam at 16 , was using harder drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine .
His parents found him a rented flat in Bristol , but he let another drug addict move in , and the pair sold the property 's entire contents .
During this period Ibrahim received three warnings from the police - two for shoplifting in autumn 2006 , and one for possession of heroin in May 2006 .
When the lease on the flat ran out Ibrahim declared himself homeless and became a Big Issue seller outside Broadmead Shopping Centre .
He moved into a hostel a month later .
Shortly after moving to the hostel , in 2007 , he began wearing traditional Islamic dress and changed his name from Andrew to Isa by deed - poll .
Still using drugs , Ibrahim returned to full - time education and started studying for A - Levels at the City of Bristol College , where a visiting lecturer reported him to the college after Ibrahim asked her what kind of biological weapons could be used to kill people .
His parents were still trying to help their son by buying him food and clothes , while his father would drive him to mosques in the city in an attempt to support his decision to convert to Islam .
Reconnaissance : CCTV footage of Ibrahim at Broadmead shopping centre in Bristol where prosecutors said he was plotting to blow himself upBut Christmas 2007 was a turning point for Ibrahim .
Investigating officer Detective Superintendent Nigel Rock , deputy head of CID at Avon and Somerset police , said : ' He might have had an argument with his Mum and Dad , there seems to be a watershed where he had dabbled and had a look at things on the internet , to where it suddenly rises sharply after Christmas .
' Ibrahim moved into his one - bedroom council flat in Westbury - on - Trym and started searching the internet for information on bomb - making .
He watched videos made by suicide bombers repeatedly , which he had downloaded to his mobile phone , and made his vest and the HMTD .
The night before his arrest last year Ibrahim had gone to his father 's house to get ball bearings to use as shrapnel .
When police entered his flat , they found the vest hanging on the back of his bedroom door .
Last night Det Spt Rock said : ' He had all he needed , all he had to do was put it together .
'
It could have been a matter of hours , it could have been a matter of days , but it was going to happen soon .
' He added : ' We cannot underestimate the significance the internet had on motivating and instructing Ibrahim in the last few months before his arrest .
' The internet had a massive influence on Ibrahim .
He had been an educated and intelligent teenager , but was radicalised by preachers on the internet such aRead more : www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1200380/Revealed-How-public

Even large male lions are wary of people
Lions in Cameroon are having their kills stolen from under their noses by hungry villagers .
Incidences of such kleptoparasitism , the stealing of food from another , usually occur between top predators such as lion , hyena and cheetah .
But people are increasingly getting in on the act , conservationists say .
They suspect the practice may be much more common than thought , and are concerned that it could threaten the dwindling numbers of lions in Cameroon .
An account of one particular incident where local villagers were caught stealing meat from a lion kill has been published in the African Journal of Ecology .
On the morning of the 28 March 2006 , biologist Marjolein Schoe of Leiden University in The Netherlands and colleagues were tracking a male lion fitted with a radio collar in Benoue National Park , in the Northern Province of Cameroon .
This may have a serious impact on a lion population which is already under serious stress by human encroachment
Lion expert Hans de Iongh
They found him and a collared female lion both feeding on a newly killed Western hartebeest antelope .
As Schoe 's vehicle approached , both lions fled into nearby thicket where they remained hidden until the researchers left .
Around 5 pm that afternoon , the researchers returned to the site of the kill .
As they arrived , they encountered several local villagers , who also ran away and hid in the bush .
All the remaining meat on the hartebeest carcass had been stripped away by knife , leaving only the head , feet and a few remains .
Leaves also littered the carcass , suggesting that the whoever had cut away the meat had used leaves to package it .
Near to the hartebeest also lay a wooden pole , further evidence that people had been scavenging from the kill .
Remains of a Western hartbeest killed by lion , found on the morning of 28 March , 2006 " Marjolein Schoe was involved in fieldwork and she actually made this field observation .
She was surprised and angry actually that people had chased off the lions , " says colleague Hans de Iongh of Leiden University , who is also a member of the World Conservation Union 's Cat Specialist Group and the African Lion Working Group .
" Although this observation did not fit in the main objective of the [ original ] study , we decided to publish it , since such events are rarely observed . "
Large predators , such as lions , spotted hyenas , African wild dogs and cheetahs routinely steal fresh kills from one another , a behaviour known as kleptoparasitism .
But de Iongh says he has come across another incidence in Cameroon 's Waza National Park where people chased away lions from a newly killed roan antelope , before taking the meat .
Further research by de Iongh , Schoe and colleague Barbara Croes also suggests that the practise of stealing lion kills may be more prevalent than thought .
" From interviews with Bororo herdsmen , we have learned that it is a common habit among this tribe to chase away lions from fresh kills , with sticks or with fire , " says de Iongh .
Other lion researchers across Africa have also provided de Iongh 's team with anecdotal reports of people stealing meat from lion kills .
" This suggests that it may be more common practice than we think , " says de Iongh .
The same kill , later the same day .
Leaves left on the floor ( denoted by arrows ) show where meat was wrapped and removed People are stealing the meat to get an easy source of protein , say the researchers , as lions may be wary enough of people to be easily scared off their kills .
But the researchers fear that stealing the lions ' food may have a detrimental impact on the big cats .
" We believe that the impact of this kind of behaviour might be significant on lion populations , since lions have to spent an enormous energy effort to capture the same amount of prey , if their prey gets stolen , " says de Iongh .
" This may have a serious impact on a lion population which is already under serious stress by human encroachment and may eventually contribute to more rapid extinction . "
In Waza National Park , for example , the population of lions is thought to have declined from 50 to 60 animals in the 1990s to between 12 and 20 in 2008 , when the last survey was conducted .
Considering that an estimated six lions are killed each year by livestock owners and poachers , de Iongh and his colleagues fear that lions in the park are on the verge of going extinct .

Kane Kramer , an inventor by trade , came up with a gadget and music distribution service almost eerily similar to the iPod - iTunes relationship that predates it by three decades .
The guy predicted details down to DRM and flash memory 's dominance .
Advertisement
Kramer 's device , the IXI , was flash - based , even though flash memory in 1979 only could have held about three minutes of audio , and featured a screen , four - way controls , and was about the size of a cigarette pack .
Even weirder , he envisioned the creation and sale of digital music and foresaw all the good and bad that would come from this :
No overhead , no inventory , but a great push for independent artists , with the risk of piracy looming large .
He predicted DRM , though he did n't go into many specifics , and in his one concession to the time , guessed that music would be bought on coin - operated machines placed in high - traffic areas .
It 's creepy , really .
Last year , Apple even brought him in to testify on their behalf — they were n't at risk of being sued themselves , since his patent had expired .
Pretty amazing , considering there was n't even internet at the time ( he used telephone lines instead ) .
Check out our article on the case in which Apple used his testimony for more info .

Gizmodo ' 79 is a week - long celebration of gadgets and geekdom 30 years ago , as the analog age gave way to the digital , and most of our favorite toys were just being born .
A number of US states are considering laws to allow same - sex marriage Gay marriage is to be permitted in the US state of Maine after a bill was passed by both houses of the state 's legislature and signed by the governor .
Maine will be the fifth US state to allow gay marriage , after Connecticut , Massachusetts , Iowa and Vermont .
A number of other states , including New Hampshire and New York , are also due to consider proposals to legalise it .
Earlier this week , Washington DC 's city council passed a law to recognise gay marriages performed in other states .
' Careful decision '
The issue is a controversial topic in the US , and many states have passed bills and constitutional amendments banning gay marriage .
GAY MARRIAGE IN THE US States that allow gay marriage : Massachusetts , Connecticut , Iowa , Vermont , Maine States where legislation to permit gay marriage is being considered : New Hampshire , New York , New Jersey States that allow civil unions / domestic partnerships : New Hampshire , New Jersey , California* , Hawaii , Oregon , Washington States that recognise out - of - state gay marriages : New Mexico , New York , Rhode Island States where neither gay marriage nor any alternatives are permitted : Alabama , Alaska , Arizona , Arkansas , Colorado , Delaware , Florida , Georgia , Idaho , Illinois , Indiana , Kansas , Kentucky , Louisiana , Maryland , Michigan , Minnesota , Mississippi , Missouri , Montana , Nebraska , Nevada , North Carolina , North Dakota , Ohio , Oklahoma , Oregon , Pennsylvania , South Carolina , South Dakota , Tennessee , Texas , Utah , Virginia , West Virginia , Wisconsin , Wyoming
* Gay marriages conducted in California between 17 June and 4 November remain valid , according to the state 's attorney general But in the north - eastern US , momentum has begun to favour supporters of gay marriage .
Maine 's lower house approved the gay marriage bill by 89 votes to 57 , and the state senate voted 21 - 13 in favour .
Maine 's governor , Democrat John Baldacci , had previously been opposed to gay marriage , but changed his mind when faced with the bill .
" I have come to believe that this is a question of fairness and of equal protection under the law , and that a civil union is not equal to civil marriage , " he said in a statement .
New Hampshire 's governor is set to face a similar decision shortly .
Both houses of the state 's legislature have approved a bill granting gay couples the right to marry .
In California , a similar bill was passed in 2005 , but was blocked by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Last year , California voters backed a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage in a referendum , although the constitutionality of the vote is still being fought over in court .

It is no secret that a bearish Head & Shoulders pattern on the S&P 500 Index appears to have formed on daily bar charts .
A good deal of attention has been paid to the development of this formation earlier last week by a number of broadcast business sources .
Bearish technical divergences , a loss of bullish momentum and a decline in trading volume have accompanied this set - up , as it should be .
Interestingly , the target or “ objective ” of this near - term pattern suggests that a pullback to the 818 level is now likely .
This is an interesting observation since the targeted level of the bearish Head & Shoulders pattern coincides roughly with an expected correction that may well result in the formation of the “ right shoulder ” of a larger , more important bullish reverse Head & Shoulders pattern on weekly charts .
Another thing worthy of note is that this larger bullish pattern is remarkably similar is size and scope of one that developed between 2002 and 2003 following the shock of 9/11 .
If is assessment is accurate , volume levels should begin to increase considerably as the 818 area is approached .
Volatility levels should also rise briskly as the distribution of shares takes place .
If these technical features along with basing price activity are present when the pullback occurs , there would be a good case to be made for a brighter second half on 2009 regarding the S&P 500 Index .
Failure of a reversal of this kind to develop , however , would become a worry which could bolster a more bearish scenario for stocks in the quarters ahead .

AI研究の草分けで 「 人工知能の父」とも呼ばれるマービン・ミンスキー( Marvin Minsky ) 氏が、6月22日、早稲田大学理工学キャンパスにて学生向けに講演した。日本語での演題は「常識をもつロボットの実現に向けて
――常識・思考・感情・自己とは何か――」。
ミンスキー氏は1956年に行なわれたいわゆる「ダートマス会議」の発起人の一人で、MIT人工知能研究所の設立者の一人でもある。司会を務めた早稲田大学理工学術院長の橋本周司氏は「人工知能というものに対して数学的なバックグラウンドを与え。学問として確立した」人物としてミンスキー氏を紹介した。
ミンスキー氏の著作としては『心の社会( The Society of Mind , 1985 ) 』( 安西祐一 郎 訳/産業図書 ) が有名だ。そして間もなく共立出版から『The Emotion Machine : Commonsense Thinking , Artificial Intelligence , and the Future of the Human Mind』を翻訳した、『ミンスキー博士の脳の探検 －常識・感情・自己とは－』( 竹林洋一 訳)が刊行される。大雑把にいうと『心の社会』は、ミンスキー氏が「エージェント」と呼ぶ思考の最小機能単位による複雑なインタラクションがエージェントの「社会」を構成し、それが心を生み出すという内容だった。『脳の探検』では「エージェント」は「思考素(原著でのresource/resourcesの訳)」と呼ばれている。また問題に対処する為の思考の経路を意味する「思考路( Way (s ) of thinkの訳 )
」という言葉がキーワードとして登場する。今回、来日したミンスキー氏は香川県高松市で行なわれた「2009年度人工知能学会全国大会」ほか、各地で本書の内容に関連した話を講演してまわったという。ごく簡単ではあるが「AIの父」の講演を、本の内容を交えてレポートする。
ミンスキー氏はまず日本の数学者や心理学者たちの名前を挙げて感謝を述べることから始めた。人工知能は1960年代～70年代に大いに研究され素晴らしい成果をあげたが、1980年～85年くらいにはほとんど止まってしまったというイメージを持っているという。多くの研究者は当初、基本原理のようなものを人工知能に探そうとしたが、物理学と違ってそれはうまくいかなかった。それはミンスキー氏によれば、数百数千の異なるコンピュータから脳が構成されているからだという。要素一つ一つは簡単なプロセスを実行する。それらがグループを作って活性化したり、他を抑制する、それが脳の働きの基本だという。
我々は学校で多くの課目を学ぶが、多くの生徒はテストに最適化してしまう、とミンスキー氏は嘆いた。学校では「考えること」そのものについては教えない。それは「考える」ということがどういうことなのか、まだ明らかではないからだ。だが、コンピュータサイエンスの知識を使い自分自身の心を一種の機械として捉えることを教えることで、「考えることについて考える」ことを教えられるという。コンピュータサイエンスは重要だがコンピュータそのものが重要なわけではない、とミンスキー氏は強調した。それは解けない方程式があっても、コンピュータを使うことで何が起こるかを見る事ができるからだ。それがコンピュータがなく数学しかなかった時代との違いだとミンスキー氏はいわゆる「3体問題」など力学の問題を例に出して説明した。
ミンスキー氏は 「心」は少なくとも6層からなると考えている。いわゆる本能的な反応を最下層とし、その上に学習、熟考、内省といったレイヤーがあり、最上層が「自意識に関する感情」のレイヤーだ。なおミンスキー氏は、心に階層があると考えたジークムント・フロイトを非常にすぐれた心理学者だと考えており、この階層はフロイトの考えとも合致するという。
そして問題に応じてさまざまな 「 思考路 ( Way (s ) of think 」
をセレクター( 本では「選択家 」 ) で切り替えることで心は機能しているのだと述べた。脳のなかで数百のサブプログラムが走っていて、それが切り替えられていくことで、心の状態が次々に変わっていくようなイメージであるようだ。基本は「if→do」ルールなのだが、階層を上がるとより複雑になり、さまざまな状況に応じて、さまざまな思考素をセレクターが選択する。この構造が心のどのレベルにもあるのだという。
ではどうすれば思考路を作ってロボットに搭載できるのか。脳科学はまだ時空間解像度が低く、視覚をのぞいて、どのように機能単位が繋がっているのかよく分かってない。だからどのようにさまざまなレベルでスイッチしていくのかもよく分かってないのが現状だ。ただミンスキー氏はこれまでの人工知能研究や、多くのロボット関連のプロジェクトを辛辣に批判しつつも、「常識」を持ち、役に立つ機械知能を実現することそのものの可能性については、今もかなり楽観的に捉えているようだ。
講演は質疑応答含めておおよそ1時間半程度。実際にはこのほか真面目な話だけではなく、映画「2001年宇宙の旅」のためにスタンリー・キューブリックに示したロボットのスケッチの話や、政府そのほかに対するジョークや軽口がポンポン飛び出していたのだが、そこは実際に講演を聴いた方だけの楽しみということで割愛する。ミンスキー氏は1927年生まれなので80歳を超えているのだが、非常に元気そうで、ときおりニッと笑いながら両手で大きなジェスチャーをして聴衆に語りかける様子が印象的だった。
昔に比べると「人工知能」という言葉が持っていた輝きは薄れているように見える。だが人工知能の研究成果そのものは身近なところに活かされている。だがいっぽうで、真に知的な機械はまだ登場していないし、そのような大きな目標を掲げるプロジェクトそのものも聞かなくなりつつある。ロボットのボディのメカトロニクスや制御技術はこれからも順当に進歩し続けるだろうが、人工知能の問題はどうも最後まで残りそうだ。ミンスキー氏の講演を聴いた学生たちの中から、遠大だが真に大きな革新をもたらすこの研究に、果敢に挑もうとする人たちが多く出ることを期待する。

Everybody is showing their hands .
And the World Series of Poker does n't start for another three weeks .
Yesterday , Congressman Barney Frank ( D. Mass . ) unveiled a bill called the " Internet Gambling Regulation , Consumer Protection , and Enforcement Act . "
What 's that mouthful of jargon mean ?
Simply , the congressman wants online gambling , not including sports , to be legal , regulated and taxed .
" I think this has a good chance to pass because there are a lot people playing these games .
They 're not always politically motivated , but they feel like something 's been taken away from them , " says Frank , who is chairman of the House 's Financial Services Committee .
This has been a pet project of Frank 's since 2006 , when Congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gaming Enforcement Act , which banned websites offering games such as poker from making payouts to people playing in the United States .
The bill was controversial from the start , and not because it dealt with a hot button topic like gambling .
Republicans attached it to a port security bill Congress had no choice but to pass .
That angered a lot of pols , who felt conservatives were wrongly asserting their moral authority .
" I believe in personal freedom , " says Frank .
" And my major issue with the bill was that it interfered with that .
The federal government should n't be telling adults how to spend their money in the privacy of their homes . "
Since then he 's been fighting to take the teeth out of the UIGEA , with little success .
Back in 2007 he proposed a similar pro-gambling bill that failed to go anywhere .
This time , the path to passage wo n't be any easier .
The day before Frank announced his legislation , I spoke with Ryan Patmintra , the mouthpiece for Arizona Senator John Kyl , who sponsored the UIGEA and is now the Republican whip in the Senate , responsible for getting his colleagues in line on big issues .
Patmintra told me , " Senator Kyl will vigorously oppose any efforts to repeal or water down the provisions of UIGEA . "
That does n't mean Frank 's bill is DOA .
Unlike 2007 , his agenda is being pushed by a million - man army in the Poker Players Alliance , a poker advocacy group whose membership has skyrocketed from 100,000 pre-UIGEA to 1.2 million today .
The Democratic congressman 's biggest backer is New York 's former Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato , who is now chairman of the PPA and itching to take on his former friends in Congress .
" There 's hypocrisy with this whole thing , " says D'Amato .
" On one hand they say they want less government , on the other they push a bill that goes into someone 's house and says they can't do something .
More presidents played poker than any other game ; we 're not talking about pornography . "
The problem is n't that the UIGEA made playing poker online illegal .
It did n't .
It just made it much harder for online poker companies to do business .
But it did change the public 's perception of the game ; from an American pastime taught by fathers or learned in suburban basements to something suddenly more illicit like , well , porn .
" It 's created this false impression that online poker is illegal , " says Howard Lederer , one of the game 's most decorated players .
" But it 's not a game of chance -- it 's a contest of skill and wits and guile .
And the game was booming .
And then it just stopped . "
" It 's created this false impression that online poker is illegal . " - Howard Lederer Getty Images
While the pros care about the little people -- really they do -- they 're just as concerned with how the UIGEA has impacted America 's reign in a sport perfected by cowboys in Wild West Saloons .
" I feel like we are losing our dominance , " says Lederer .
" It is exploding in Europe and ten years from now , who knows ? "
I discussed the topic with 2004 WSOP champ Greg Raymer on Tuesday .
" We have n't had much growth in the numbers of new American players since it passed , " said Raymer .
" The growth has come from other markets overseas . "
Raymer and Lederer make interesting points .
Last year the main event final left Denmark 's Peter Eastgate and Russia 's Ivan Demidov holding the final two chip stacks .
It was the first finals between two foreign born players .
Before last year , appearances by non-Americans were spotty : 2007 's second place finisher , Tuan Lam , was born in Vietnam and raised in Canada .
Does Canada even count as a foreign country ?
In 2001 , Juan Carlos Mortensen of Spain took home the big money .
" This is our game , this is like jazz , " says Lederer .
" And the rest of the world is figuring out how to beat us . "
Other countries ' attitudes towards online gaming -- and the money they make by regulating it -- are at the heart of the debate in the states .
It 's legal in Great Britain and Italy .
And two months ago France proposed new laws that would , according to the country 's Budget Minister , adapt to " Internet reality " and allow online gambling .
That reality is worth about $ 7 billion a year in illegal wagers in France .
In the United States , according to a recent study by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers , $ 5 billion a year is left on the table by policing , rather than taxing , Internet Gaming .
Not exactly chump change .

Update ( 20th July 1100UT )
Glenn Orton from JPL has imaged this site using the NASA Infrared Telescope on Hawaii and confirms that it is an impact site and not a localised weather event .
I started this imaging session on Jupiter at approximately 11 pm local time ( 1300UTC ) .
The weather prediction was not promising , clear skies but a strong jetstream overhead according to the Bureau of Met .
The temperature was also unusually high for this time of year ( winter ) , also a bad sign .
The scope in use was my new 14.5 " newtonian , in use now for a few weeks and so far returning excellent images .
I was pleasantly surprised to find reasonable imaging conditions and so I decided to continue recording data until maybe 1 am local time .
By about midnight ( 12:10 am ) the seeing had deteriorated and I was ready to quit .
Indeed I had hovered the mouse over the exit button on my capture application ( Coriander for Linux ) and then changed my mind and decided instead to simply take a break for 30 minutes and then check back to see if the conditions had improved .
It was a very near thing .
When I came back to the scope at about 12:40 am I noticed a dark spot rotating into view in Jupiters south polar region started to get curious .
When first seen close to the limb ( and in poor conditions ) it was only a vaguely dark spot , I thouht likely to be just a normal dark polar storm .
However as it rotated further into view , and the conditions improved I suddenly realised that it was n't just dark , it was black in all channels , meaning it was truly a black spot .
My next thought was that it must be either a dark moon ( like Callisto ) or a moon shadow , but it was in the wrong place and the wrong size .
Also I 'd noticed it was moving too slow to be a moon or shadow .
As far as I could see it was rotating in sync with a nearby white oval storm that I was very familiar with - this could only mean that the back feature was at the cloud level and not a projected shadow from a moon .
I started to get excited .
It took another 15 minutes to really believe that I was seeing something new - I 'd imaged that exact region only 2 days earlier and checking back to that image showed no sign of any anomalous black spot .
Now I was caught between a rock and a hard place - I wanted to keep imaging but also I was aware of the importance of alerting others to this possible new event .
Could it actually be an impact mark on Jupiter ?
I had no real idea , and the odds on that happening were so small as to be laughable , but I was really struggling to see any other possibility given the location of the mark .
If it really was an impact mark then I had to start telling people , and quickly .
In the end I imaged for another 30 minutes only because the conditions were slowly improving and each capture was giving a slightly better image than the last .
Eventually I stopped imaging and went up to the house to start emailing people , with this image above processed as quick and dirty as possible just to have something to show .
More images will come along from me and many other people in the next few days .
* NOTE *
Priority is being given to processing and uploading images as fast as possible , so the image quality is no necessarily as good as it might be .
When time permits these images will be replaced by higher quality versions .

Here 's an image in good seeing taken from my observatory on July 24 , the impact region has started to spread noticeably .
Also see the Hubble Image taken shortly before this .
In this image we can see the impact debris being spread by Jupiters jetstream winds .
The debris field is also starting to break up into discrete clumps .
Some dark material can be seen caught in a local vortex and being pulled around into a circle .
PHOTO GALLERY / ROBERT PATTINSON ON SET OF " REMEMBER ME " / CLICK HERE
Not surprisingly , it took an Irishman to notice that Robert Pattinson is a little frayed since filming began on “ Remember Me ” in New York City .
Irish actor Pierce Brosnan , who plays Pattinson ’s father in the film , says diehard RPatz fans have been swarming the “ Twilight ” star since he ’s arrived .
One mob of fans sent Pattinson flying across the street and the British actor ended up getting hit by a cab .
As a result , the superstar is avoiding his female fans to the point where security is advising him not to wave or even look at the crowds .
And Pattinson is said to be “ dying ” to return to his home of London where everyone “ is a little cooler about the fame thing . ”
The RPatz contingent is now arguing on blogs and fan sites over whose fault it is for scaring their idol .
Some say it ’s aggressive New Yorkers driving Pattinson away , while others blame imports from surrounding cities and even the Midwest ( ! )
No matter who the culprits are , as an Irish - American fan of Pattinson ’s who ’s also a New Yorker , I feel I should offer up the star some advice .
Let ’s face it : ignoring the fans is n’t doing it for ya , Rob .
These girls are as hungry for their RPatz sightings as ever .
Advice for Pattinson to help keep the New York crazies at bay :
1 . Get some look alikes .
Pull a Speidi ( a.k.a. the paparazzi - obsessed couple Heidi and Spencer from MTV’s “ The Hills ” ) and hire some decoy Pattinsons to roam about New York and distract the mobs .
Hey , why not bring that decoy on set to do your job of ignoring the fans while you shoot your scenes in privacy .
2. Remember that with enough overexposure , some of these celebrity - obsessed women will get sick of you .
So give them what they want !
Entertain !
Do a song and dance on the streets of Manhattan !
While they snap their pictures , send in the guards ( your security ) and hightail it outta there .
3 . If milking it for the crazed fans does n’t work , try pleading .
If you really are as scared as the press says you are , be upfront about it .
If anything , New Yorkers are straight forward and appreciate it when people are the same .
Tell the most aggressive fans that you want to peacefully get your work done , and maybe they ’ll leave you alone .
4. Move to Ireland .
Irish people love you , Mr. Edward Cullen , and the British have nothin ’ on the Irish when it comes to being relaxed around stars .
In fact , many famous people ( think Daniel Day - Lewis , Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick ) flee to Ireland to escape the limelight and enjoy the peace and quiet .
Why not follow in their footsteps ?
Your co-star Brosnan can give you some great tips on where to go !
5 . Something tells me none of these are going to be that effective , but just remember , Rob : all this is part of the “ cost of fame . ”
If all you ’re in it for is the “ art , ” go home to England and do some community theater .
Otherwise , suck it up and deal with it ‘ til your stint in New York is over .
Tell us why you are looking to get rid of your timeshare …

Those that know me , know I ’m a big fan of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon .
Yea , it started out slow but he ’s already starting to get rid of the nerves and be himself .
Last night he had a pretty funny infomercial skit regarding Obama ’s health care .
Why am I talking about this on a sports blog ?
Well its done in a work out video infomercial format with Carol Alt .
And you know what ?
It ’s funny so I just felt like posting it anyways .
If today ’s videos are well received like last week , Saturdays will become video day .
Parkinson Disease and Your Pharmacist
The National Parkinson Foundation sponsors many Parkinson Disease ( PD ) support groups .
( Most people refer to Parkinson as Parkinson ’s , but that is incorrect ) .
I had the opportunity to visit a support group in Northern Virginia and found them to be a very friendly , supportive group .
No matter how mild the PD , a support group can be very uplifting .
Additionally , the speakers for the meeting give valuable information .
On the day I visited , one speaker was Ernest Dixon , RPH , owner of Centreville Medical Arts Pharmacy .
He explained that PD is a degenerative disease mostly of the aged .
There are over 1 million people in the United States and 4 million people worldwide with the disease .
It is characterized by tremors , rigidity with stiffness and slowness , and postural instability , all because the nerves in the brain become impaired when it stops producing dopamine .
Early treatment is best and Ernest recommended the following :
Know yourself and your body .
Know your medical provider and the medication prescribed , including side effects .
Know your pharmacist .
Build a relationship with the pharmacist .
Centreville Medical Arts Pharmacy is an independent pharmacy located in Northern Virginia .
Ernest is a gregarious and friendly pharmacist who truly enjoys helping people .
After his many years of experience with chain pharmacies , he decided he wanted to really work with people counseling them on their medication and not just filling prescriptions all day .
In addition , the pharmacy is a “ compounding pharmacy ” meaning that they are able to “ mix ” drugs , such as changing the form of the medication from a pill to a liquid or to remove a non-essential ingredient that the patient might be allergic to .
Getting to know your pharmacist is a really good idea if you take many different kinds of prescription medication prescribed by different doctors so that the pharmacist can be on the lookout for any potential problems .
Additionally , if you want to add over the counter medication to the mix , you need to talk to the pharmacist .
Or , if you simply want to add high quality nutritional supplements such as vitamins , consult your pharmacist .
A pharmacist like Ernest Dixon will be happy to give you professional advice .
When we ’re all surrounded by big chain pharmacies and pharmacies in supermarkets , it is refreshing to know that there are independent pharmacies with people like Ernest Dixon , RPH .

An adult male Nelson 's small - eared shrew , alive and well A tiny species of shrew has been rediscovered in the wild , more than a century after first being described .
In 1894 , a handful of specimens of the Nelson 's small - eared shrew were collected in southern Mexico .
But the shrew was never seen again , and was considered by many experts to already be extinct .
That was until two researchers found three shrews in a small patch of forest , a find that is reported in the journal Mammalian Biology .
The Nelson 's small - eared shrew ( Cryptotis nelsoni ) is named after the man who first discovered it .
In 1894 , Edward Nelson and Edward Goldman collected 12 specimens some 4,800 feet up the slopes of the San Martín Tuxtla volcano in Veracruz , Mexico .
A year later , the creature was formally described for science , and the specimens were stored away in the drawers of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC , US .
In Mexico , the shrews are very poorly known , even by the people who co-exist with these beautiful animals
Mammaologist Lazaro Guevara , who rediscovered the species
That was the last time the shrew was seen alive for 109 years .
The biology of the shrew has remained a mystery .
It was even believed to have become extinct because it had gone unrecorded so so long .
That changed when two mammalogists based in Mexico decided to look for it .
Fernando Cervantes of the National Autonomous University of Mexico teamed up with Lazaro Guevara of the University of Veracruz in Mexico .
In 2004 , they set off for the forest slopes of the San Martín Tuxtla volcano to search for the long - lost shrew .
The skull of an adult female Nelson 's small - eared shrew Setting 100 pitfall traps a night for four nights , they eventually caught three shrews - one adult male , one juvenile male and an adult female .
Since then , the researchers have been validating their find .
" We have reviewed [ all the ] papers about Cryptotis .
We visited several biological collections and museums , " says Guevara .
" A recent study on the mammalian diversity of Sierra de Santa Martha , Veracruz , did not record the presence of C. nelsoni .
Therefore , we believe that no more specimens exist . "
The shrews are tiny , measuring less than 10 cm from nose to tail .
They have sooty brown fur , which is darker than a related shrew species C. mexicana .
It also has a larger and heavier , but flatter skull than its relative .
The researchers found the animals scurrying around a patch of cloud forest , that local people know as " dwarf forest " due to its small trees .
" We know very little about its behaviour , " says Guevara .
The shrew 's last stronghold , in the forests of Veracruz , Mexico
He says that after 100 years or more , it was acceptable to think that the Nelson 's small - eared shrew had gone extinct , especially as shrews tend to be overlooked by many scientists .
The surviving shrews are still so scarce that they must be considered critically endangered , say the researchers .
The volcano upon which they live erupted in 1793 , destroying all the vegetation around the crater .
Despite this eruption , the shrew managed to survive .
But so few now exist that any small change to their habitat could prove disastrous , says Guevara .
" A small habitat alteration may cause changes in the population that may lead to their extinction , " he says .
Subsistence crops and livestock are reared in the region , " and any conservation plan needs to involve communities , government and schools to promote the dissemination of the importance of this species , " says Guevara .
" In Mexico , the shrews are very poorly known , even by the people who coexist with these beautiful animals . "
Guevara explains that , when they started their search they knew that the last record of the species was from 1894 .
" We thought it was very important research , " he says .
" We thought that was risky but high value for wildlife conservation .
So , we travelled to find it .
When we found it , we ( were ) very pleased . "

PARIS ( Reuters ) - A French nuclear submarine with advanced sonar equipment began searching on Wednesday for the flight recorders of an Air France airliner that crashed into the Atlantic last week , the French military said .
The Emeraude was sent to the area to hunt the “ black box ” recorders , which may help explain the disaster and which are believed to lie on the ocean floor .
Investigators face a long search for clues to what went wrong when the Airbus A330 jet disappeared on a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris killing all 228 people on board , French military spokesman Christophe Prazuck said .
“ Up to now , the time frame for the search for victims and debris has been of the order of days or a week .
Here , at the very least , it ’s going to be of the order of weeks or months , ” he told LCI television .
The Air France flight is believed to have run into trouble when it hit a violent storm midway over the Atlantic Ocean and potential problems with speed sensors have become one of the focal points of the inquiry .
The European Aviation Safety Agency said on Tuesday it issued a reminder to pilots on how to proceed when they suspect airspeed readings are unreliable .
It said it was analyzing speed sensor data “ with a view to issuing mandatory corrective action . ”
The agency added it would not prejudge the outcome of the investigation and reiterated that Airbus planes are “ airworthy and safe to operate . ”
Late on Wednesday , Airbus denied a report in an early edition of French daily newspaper Le Figaro that it was considering grounding its fleet of A330 and A340 planes following the crash .
“ We are not considering grounding the fleet because it is safe to operate , ” said Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath .
Other causes have not been ruled out , but France ’s interior ministry said two passengers identified as suspicious turned out not to be a concern .
The website of the French weekly L’Express had quoted a French military spokesman as saying they could have been linked to Islamic terrorism .
WEATHER HAMPERS SEARCH
Brazilian military search teams using planes and ships had recovered 41 bodies by Tuesday , but none were found on Wednesday .
Briefing reporters , Air Force Brigadier Ramon Borges Cardoso said visibility had been poor in the search areas .
Television pictures showed a military plane preparing late on Wednesday to fly the first 16 bodies found to Recife on mainland Brazil from the archipelago Fernando de Noronha off the northeast coast , where the search operations are based .
Slideshow ( 25 images )
The 16 bodies had undergone preliminary identification procedures which would be continued in Recife .
Cardoso said the search for bodies would continue until around June 19 , but could go on further if weather conditions and ocean currents were favorable .
Military planes expanded their search into airspace controlled by Senegal due to ocean currents that may have swept some bodies in that direction , Brazil ’s Air Force said , but searches there on Wednesday were interrupted by bad weather .
Slideshow ( 25 images )
France has sent about 400 military personnel , three planes , one frigate with a helicopter , and a research vessel with mini-submarines as well as the nuclear submarine .
In the search zone , where scattered pieces of debris including a large section from the aircraft tail have been recovered , vessels are trying to comb a rugged area of the ocean floor , thousands of meters below the surface .
Prazuck said searchers had taken two weeks to locate the black box recorders after the crash of a Boeing 737 at Sharm el - Sheikh in Egypt in 2004 , despite much easier conditions .
“ Here the accident happened 1,000 kilometers ( 620 miles ) from the coast .
The situation is very complex , ” he said .
He said the Emeraude was searching an area of 36 square kilometers ( 14 sq miles ) and the search zone would change daily .
If the recorders are found , miniature submarines from the Pourquoi Pas , the French exploration and survey ship , could be used to retrieve them .
The doomed plane sent 24 automated messages in its final minutes on June 1 , detailing a rapid series of systems failures .
The speed sensors that gauge how fast an aircraft is flying have become the focus of the investigation after some of the messages showed they provided inconsistent data to the pilots .
Air France said on the weekend it had noticed icing problems on the speed sensors known as pitot tubes in May 2008 and had asked Airbus for a solution .
Airbus responded by reaffirming existing operating procedures , according to Air France , which decided to go ahead and change the sensors from April 27 .
The A330 that crashed had not yet been modified .
Thousands of top traders and bankers on Wall Street were awarded huge bonuses and pay packages last year , even as their employers were battered by the financial crisis .
Nine of the financial firms that were among the largest recipients of federal bailout money paid about 5,000 of their traders and bankers bonuses of more than $ 1 million apiece for 2008 , according to a report released Thursday by Andrew M. Cuomo , the New York attorney general .
At Goldman Sachs , for example , bonuses of more than $ 1 million went to 953 traders and bankers , and Morgan Stanley awarded seven - figure bonuses to 428 employees .
Even at weaker banks like Citigroup and Bank of America , million - dollar awards were distributed to hundreds of workers .
The report is certain to intensify the growing debate over how , and how much , Wall Street bankers should be paid .
Anyone harboring doubts that the institutional Church is riding shotgun for the system , even regarding heinous sin like torture , should be chastened by the results of a recent survey by the Pew Research Center .
Who but the cowardly crew leading the " Christian " churches can be held responsible for the fact that many of their flock believe torture of suspected terrorists is " justified ? "
Those polled were white non-Hispanic Catholics , white Evangelicals , and white mainline Protestants .
A majority ( 54 percent ) of those who attend church regularly said torture could be " justified , " while a majority of those not attending church regularly responded that torture was rarely or never justified .
I am not a psychologist or sociologist .
But I recall that one of the first things Hitler did on assuming power was to ensure there was a pastor in every Lutheran and Catholic parish in Germany .
Why ?
Because he calculated , correctly , that here would be a force for stability for his regime .
Thus began another horrid chapter in the history of those professing to be followers of Jesus of Nazareth but had forgotten his repeated admonition , Do not be afraid .
A mere seven decades after the utter failure of church leaders in Germany , their current American counterparts have again yielded to fear , and have condoned evils like torture by their deafening silence .
What kinds of folks comprise this 54 percent ?
An informal " survey " of my friends suggests these are " my- country - first " people — like the fellow who recently gave me the finger when he saw my bumper sticker , which simply says " God bless the rest of the world too . "
They are people accustomed to hierarchy and comfortable being told what they should think and do to preserve " our way of life . "
They place a premium on nationalism , which they call patriotism , and on what the Germans call Ordnung .
I suppose that this may be part of why they go to church on Sunday .
It ’s a problem that has existed for almost 1,700 years , ever since 4th Century Christians jettisoned their heritage of non-violent resistance to war and threw in their lot with Constantine .
Subservience
Nowhere is the phenomenon of obeisance to hierarchical power highlighted more clearly than in the Grand Inquisitor story in Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky , who could plumb the human heart as few others .
In the tale , Dostoevsky has Jesus joining the " tortured , suffering people " of Seville during the Inquisition .
The Cardinal of Seville immediately jails and interrogates Jesus , telling him that the Church has " corrected " his big mistake .
Rather than donning " Caesar ’s purple , " Jesus gave us freedom of conscience .
While it has been 130 years since he wrote Brothers Karamazov , Dostoevsky captures the trap into which so many American " believers " have fallen in forfeiting freedom through fear .
His portrayal of Inquisition reality brings us to the brink of the moral precipice on which our country teeters today .
It is as though he knew what would be in store for us as fear was artificially stoked after the attacks of 9/11 .
Here is how the cardinal ridicules Christ for imposing on humans the heavy burden of freedom of conscience :
" Didst thou forget that man prefers peace , and even death , to freedom of choice in the knowledge of good and evil ? …
We teach them that it ’s not the free judgment of their hearts , but mystery which they must follow blindly , even against their conscience . …
In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet [ and ] become obedient . …
We shall tell them that we are Thy servants and rule them in Thy name . …
We shall tell them that every sin will be expiated if it is done with our permission . "
Recently , prominent Baptist layman and distinguished senator from South Carolina , Lindsey Graham , gave a hat - tip to the Inquisition .
At a May 13 Senate hearing discussing interrogation techniques like waterboarding , Graham explained that , " One of the reasons these techniques have been used for about 500 years is that they work . "
I was reminded of one of the things Gandhi said about Christians : " Everyone in the world knows that Jesus and his teachings were non-violent except Christians . "
And the reason that regular churchgoers do n’t seem to know this is because the historical Jesus is not preached .
My guess is that those who go to church on Sunday expect a modicum of moral leadership .
If the pastor is silent on torture , then torture must somehow be okay .
How easy it is then to cede one ’s conscience to an American - flag - draped pulpit .
Jesus ( and Luther ) Did n’t Really Mean It ?
A progressive Lutheran pastor in Dallas asked me to give a talk to his parish on the issues I had been addressing in my writings .
It struck me that since George W. Bush had moved into their neighborhood , I might ask the congregants how they thought they should relate to someone who had given written approval to torture .
I was too clever by half — actually , naïve .
I would show them the " smoking gun " memorandum signed by George W. Bush on Feb.
7 , 2002 , which the Senate Armed Forces Committee has determined " opened the way " to all manner of detainee abuse , and then I would challenge them by quoting Martin Luther who , after all , was one of their guys .
I chose this passage cited by George Hunsinger in an essay he wrote in 1987 ( appearing in his book Disruptive Grace ) :
" If , " wrote Martin Luther , " I profess with the loudest voice and clearest exposition every portion of the truth of Gods except precisely that little point which the world and the devil are at the moment attacking , I am not confessing Christ , however boldly I may be professing him .
Where the battle rages , there the loyalty of the soldier is proved and to be steady on all the battlefield , except there , is mere flight and disgrace if one flinches at that point . "
Hunsinger emphasizes that faithfulness to Jesus of Nazareth is always situational , that one can spout impeccably orthodox theological truths and still be " fatally disloyal . "
Genuine loyalty is proven where it counts — in the pitch of battle , where it really costs something .
Writing 22 years ago , Hunsinger was already addressing what he called " an overwhelming spiritual collapse , in which we have lost touch with even minimal standards of morality . "
" The prevailing sense seems to be that , if the demands of biblical morality contradict the dictates of national security , so much the worse for biblical morality .
…
Dungeons … torture , and death are described as belonging to the free world .
…
War criminals in high places we honor . …
Acts of aggression we celebrate as noble deeds .
… of preemptive self - defense .
Orwell has become our destiny .
…
" The passive acquiescence of a Christian community which has lost its moral conscience in matters of state contributes substantially … to misery and oppression .
…
‘ Seek your own welfare above all else ’ has become the maxim of the day . "
Hunsinger has earned the right to criticize those who confess Jesus of Nazareth " from the safety of some remote enclave , where confession may be true but costs nothing . "
He is professor of systematic theology at Princeton Theological Seminary , but was so aghast at U.S. practice of torture that he devoted untold time and energy to founding the National Religious Campaign Against Torture ( NRCAT ) .
Luther Not Popular in Dallas
I suggested to the gathering of Lutherans that Dallas , where the " decider " on torture is now their neighbor , might be where the battle rages for them .
I had very few takers .
" But he kept us safe … is n’t it better to fight the terrorists over there than to fight them here ? "
There was little appetite to listening to THAT Luther in that Lutheran church .
The pastor shared with me later that he had encountered all manner of criticism for having invited someone disrespectful of George W. Bush .
Despite the turbulence I caused , the pastor thanked me for coming , but noted that " torture is not high on anyone ’s agenda . "
In a brief thank - you note he wrote , " I believe that if the full scope of the nation ’s use of torture comes to light , there may be need for churches to propose confession and repentance , as a positive witness for the rest of the world . "
Presbyterians :
To their credit , the Presbyterians have been more outspoken — some of them at least .
In 2006 , the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) called on Congress to convene an independent investigative body to establish responsibility for the abuse of detainees and , if appropriate , to recommend the appointment of a special prosecutor .
The clerk of the General Assembly followed up on April 23 , 2009 , with an appeal to President Barack Obama to work with Congress to establish a non-partisan Commission of Inquiry to bring " an understanding of what happened , how it happened , and who was accountable , " adding :
" If those responsible are not held accountable , nothing beyond wishful thinking and admonitions exists to compel future leaders to resist the temptation to torture in times of fear or threat . "
Good for the Presbyterians , I thought .
I led off a Sunday evening talk to a Dallas area Presbyterian congregation by complementing those assembled on the gutsy appeal of April 23 .
I was greeted by blank stares .
This congregation was no exception to the general rule that courageous statements at high official levels do not find their way into Sunday sermons , much less workshops .
A disappointment , but hardly a surprise .
Methodists : The United Methodist General Board of Churches and Society , acknowledging the results of the Pew survey , is also supporting an independent inquiry into torture .
Top executive Jim Winkler has been very direct : " Shame , shame , shame on any Christian who could imagine there is any justification of torture against another human being .
I cannot conceive in my wildest dreams of Jesus Christ giving any blessing to torture . "
It is another question , of course , as to whether Pew reaches the pews .
As for the Dallas Methodists , Southern Methodist University has shown itself eager to host George W. Bush ’s presidential library and an independent institute to sponsor programs to " promote the vision of the president and celebrate " his presidency .
The protests of thousands of Methodists , including prominent alumni of SMU ’s School of Theology pointing to the policy of torture , fell on the deaf ears of the Methodist bishops and trustees who blessed the enterprise .
Catholics : Sadly , the U.S. Catholic bishops cannot find their voice on torture .
This is history repeating itself , for Hamlet - like Pope Pius XII kept trying to make up his mind on whether he should put the Church at some risk in Germany , while Jews and other minorities were been tortured and murdered .
In 1948 , the French author / philosopher Albert Camus addressed a Dominican monastery of friars who had asked what an " unbeliever " thought about Christians in the light of their behavior during the 30s and 40s .
Camus said :
" For a long time during those frightful years I waited for a great voice to speak up in Rome .
I , an unbeliever ?
Precisely .
For I knew that the spirit would be lost if it did not utter a cry of condemnation . …
" It has been explained to me since that the condemnation was indeed voiced .
But that it was in the style of encyclicals , which is not all that clear .
The condemnation was voiced and it was not understood .
Who could fail to see where the fault lies in this case ?
" Christians should voice their condemnation loud and clear , in such a way that never a doubt , never the slightest doubt , could rise in the heart of the simplest person . …
They should get away from abstraction and confront the blood - stained face history has taken on today . "
And today ?
True to form , laudable statements and papers have been produced and placed in in - boxes in the bowels of the bishops ’ bureaucracy , but they rarely find their way to the pulpit on Sunday .
I am a Catholic , and initially was happy to find , by a search of the bishops ’
Web site that there is a Catholic Study Guide titled " Torture is a Moral Issue . "
It was developed in collaboration with the National Religious Campaign Against Torture , the group Professor Hunsinger founded .
This was news to me .
Had any of my Catholic friends heard of this ?
The answer from a representative sampling , including progressive parishes , was No .
So I called the bishops ’ staff to inquire as to why the study guide on torture had not been published and made available to pastors to use in their preaching or workshops .
I was told that it was " not designed as a publication , because there was uncertainty as to how much demand there would be for such a study . "
A publishing run would not be cost effective unless it produced at least a thousand copies and this particular issue might not warrant that kind of run .
( There are 70 million Catholics in this land . )
As for Pope Benedict XVI , he arrived here in April 2008 , a week after media reports that the most senior officials of the Bush administration had met regularly at the White House to plan which torture techniques might be most appropriate for which high - value detainees .
He said nothing .
All the more strange , it would seem , since Jesus of Nazareth , after all , was tortured to death .
If the pope had an opinion on torture , he kept it to himself .
Mormons : What about the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints ?
My small random sampling of the information available shows a strong propensity among Mormons toward Dostoevsky ’s caricature of a strong , top - down authoritative church , but with the notable exception of at least one person who could , and did , think for herself — to her own peril .
The most prominent Mormon with torture connections is Jay Bybee , a devout Mormon with undergraduate and law degrees from Mormon - owned Brigham Young University .
As leader of the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel in August 2002 , Bybee approved a memorandum indicating that interrogators could apply virtually any harsh techniques , so long as the pain involved was less than that accompanying " serious physical injury , such as organ failure , impairment of bodily function , or death . "
In my view , his memorandum must surely be the most shameful text ever to appear beneath Department of Justice letterhead .
It was among the ones released by President Obama in mid-April , over the strong objections of many top officials .
A lively debate rages among Mormon lawyers over the morality of Bybee ’s approval of harsh interrogation techniques .
Dan Burke , a law professor at the University of Minnesota , was incensed to learn that a fellow Mormon could justify such actions .
" I cannot believe that the practice of torture is acceptable to anyone who claims to be a disciple of Jesus Christ , " said Burk .
Not so fast , say other Mormon lawyers — David Wenger of New York , for example .
" I would personally be uncomfortable writing a memo on how the administration could legally justify torture of people , but I do n’t think it ’s against the tenets of our faith , " Wenger told the Salt Lake Tribune .
" One might believe that the value of ready access to torture - obtained intelligence outweighed the negative , " said Wenger .
Yet another Mormon , a woman Army specialist named Alyssa Peterson , was clear on the morality of torture .
She refused to take part in applying torture techniques approved by Bybee .
She walked away from an interrogation in the " cage , " where Iraqis were stripped naked in front of female soldiers , mocked and burned with cigarettes .
Three days later , on Sept. 15 , 2003 , Peterson was found dead of a gunshot wound at Tal Afar base in Iraq .
The Army said her death was a suicide .
It gets worse .
The two faux - psychologists to whom the CIA turned to show them how to torture , James Elmer Mitchell and Bruce Jessen , are both Mormons , and were widely referred to by other U.S. interrogators as the " Mormon mafia . "
Add to the mix Robert Walpole , the CIA analyst who wove out of whole cloth what has been referred to as " The Whore of Babylon " — the worst National Intelligence Estimate in the history of U.S. intelligence .
" Iraq ’s Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction " dated Oct. 1 , 2002 , was a deliberate — and successful — attempt to deceive Congress into authorizing war on Iraq .
In his memoir , At the Center of the Storm , former CIA Director George ( slam - dunk ) Tenet praises Walpole as a " brilliant analyst . "
In a transparent attempt to defend Walpole against charges of being " hell bent on war , " Tenet insists that Walpole is " one of the most unlikely people to be accused of being a war hawk . "
Tenet notes that Walpole did not think an attack on Iraq justifiable – and Tenet adds that Walpole is a Mormon bishop .
Did Tenet think that that should do it , as far as credibility was concerned ?
In any event , Walpole did what he was told in managing the production of the Estimate that paved the way to war .
I know there are many Mormons besides Alyssa Peterson with integrity .
It remains a mystery to me why so many of the ones who gain prominence seem to lose their sense of right and wrong when they are asked by hierarchical authority to do things they know are wrong .
In sum , with respect to the Christian churches I believe author Chris Hedges summarizes the situation neatly , if sadly :
" The utter failure of nearly all our religious institutions — whose texts are unequivocal about murder — to address the essence of war has rendered them useless .
These institutions have little or nothing to say in wartime because the god they worship is a false god , one that promises victory to those who obey the law and believe in the manifest destiny of the nation . "
The Good News
Who would have thought we would have to turn to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to carry the moral ball on torture .
Adm . Mike Mullen has called his commanders on the carpet .
He is reliably reported to have been so " appalled " and " disgusted " after viewing some of the abuse photos being kept under wraps by the Obama administration that he warned senior military officers on July 10 : " We have n’t all absorbed or applied all the lessons of Abu Ghraib . "
Mullen ordered that more be done to halt detainee abuse .
He is quoted as saying , " We ’re better than this ; and now we have to show it . "
Hopefully , Adm .
Mullen will stay around long enough to start a thorough clean - up of the torture mess — at least in the military .
He has acted responsibly and with integrity on a number of issues ; the country is lucky to have him in that very senior post .
For it is clear that , as long as demagogues keep insisting that we are " at war " with global terrorists all manner of abuse can be heaped on " the enemy . "
It ’s always the same " during wartime . "
Here ’s what one widely admired U.S. general had to say about the German enemy during WWII .
It is an attitude about which we must be aware , so that we can guard against it :
" My God , I actually pity those poor bastards we ’re going up against , " said General George Patton .
" We ’re not just going to shoot the bastards , we ’re going to cut out their living guts and use them to grease the treads of our tanks . …
" Do n’t worry ; I can assure you that you ’ll do your duty .
The Nazis are the enemy .
Wade into them .
Spill their blood .
Shoot them in the belly .
When you put your hand into a bunch of goo that a moment before was your best friend ’s face , you ’ll know what to do . "
Waiting for the Church ?
Do n’t wait for the churches to speak out against such violence .
We have seen enough of their vacillation to know that , for us , this would be a cop-out .
Sad to say , the same challenge facing Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero before he was assassinated faces us .
And we must have the courage and honesty to act , like him , in putting ourselves where the battle rages :
" A church that does n’t provoke any crisis , a gospel that does n’t unsettle , a word of God that does n’t get under anyone ’s skin , a word of God that does n’t touch the real sin of the society in which it is being proclaimed , what kind of gospel is that ? "
We cannot avoid the challenge ; it is up to us .
We have to supply what is lacking in the institutional church .
There is hope .
As St. Augustine warned 1,600 years ago :
" Hope has two children .
The first is anger at the way things are .
The second is courage to do something about it . "
With those two , well , yes we can .
Earlier this year , Mozilla 's design gurus began exploring the possibility of improving on the principle of tabbed browsing .
They launched a discussion about various ways to transcend the limitations imposed by the current tab system .
To encourage broader community participation in this discussion , Mozilla Labs launched a competition and called for designers to submit mockups and concept art that depicted new ideas and interfaces for tabbed browsing .
The results of the Summer Design Challenge were announced this week and Mozilla has published the best entries .
The winning designs are listed by category — including the most innovative , the best executed , the best user interaction model , and easiest to ship .
These were selected by a panel comprised of representatives of Mozilla , the IxDA interaction design community , and the Johnny Holland collective .
There was also a separate " People 's Choice " category where the winner was elected by the community through a voting process .
A design called TabViz took the top spot in the category for most innovative entry .
It was created by a team of three students from the University of Michigan School of Information .
After conducting user studies to determine how people use tabs , they decided to tackle the problem of tab overload by implementing a radial tab navigation control system .
They have published a prototype implementation which is available for download from the group 's Google Code webpage .
The current implementation is designed to complement the existing tab system rather than replace it .
It adds a small icon to the left - hand side of the browser status bar that can be used to invoke the radial view .
As the user spawns new tabs , the radial view adds labeled thumbnails for the contents of those tabs in a semi-circle next to the thumbnail of the parent tab .
It provides a very clear overview of the user 's browsing pattern and the relationships among various tabs .
It will also segment individual slices of the radial display to provide easy access to the forward and backward history of the associated tab .
Despite being an early prototype , their implementation is surprisingly good .
It exhibited several bugs and lagged in certain contexts , but it is mostly in working condition .
With additional refinement , I could imagine using it on a regular basis .
It has practical real - world value to end users and provides a very effective visualization of tabbed browsing activity .
I also really liked the FaviTabs concept , which took the top spot in the category for most producible prototype .
The mockup introduced a hugely impressive timeline view that would significantly improve the usability of interacting with browser history .
The other winning entries also offer some interesting concepts , including built - in search mechanisms , nameable tab groups , vertical sidebar views , contextual ordering , and better bookmark handling .
You can see videos of the winners at the Mozilla Labs website .
They also have an index page that provides easy access to the videos of all 128 entries .
Some of them , like this Mario parody interface , are quite funny .
The design challenge has clearly generated a lot of good ideas , some which could be adopted in future versions of the Firefox Web browser .
In addition to shedding light on new tabbed browsing concepts , the contest also demonstrated the power and efficacy of crowdsourcing user interface design .

Glenn Greenwald needs a neck brace , and I can't say I blame him .
First the news seems to be that the attorney general really is going to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the illegal Bush - Cheney torture program ; then it appears that it 's going to be restricted solely to abuses on top of the baseline torture techniques approved by Yoo and Cheney .
I agree with Glenn and Tim F. that the latter would be worse than nothing at all .
A further round of scapegoating in order to protect the real architects of the program would be deeply damaging to the rule of law and the line of command .
It would implicitly bless the torture that it did not prosecute .
And as Cheney conceded , these were presidential - level decisions on presidential policy grounds .
You do n't take the United States into the ranks of countries that torture prisoners at the behest of a low - level functionary or an excessively aggressive torturer .
Someone higher up ordered these barbaric practices that were found systematically in identical fashion across every theater of combat .
The investigation into legal responsibility for the commission of these crimes as defined in international and domestic law should go wherever the evidence leads - as far up the line of command as it goes .
That 's what the Department of Justice means .
And justice is not subject to Rahm Emanuel 's politicking .
Scott 's scoop is here ; Glenn 's reaction - updated thrice - is here .
The resistance to bringing the torture architects to justice seems to be coming from political sources , but they may have over - played their hand :
In the days after Obama ’s speech at the CIA , both Axelrod and Emanuel insisted that the White House had made the decision that there would be no prosecutions .
According to reliable sources , that incensed Holder , who felt that the remarks had compromised the integrity both of the White House and Justice Department by suggesting that political advisers made the call on who would or would not be criminally investigated .
After Axelrod and Emanuel made their statements , Holder realized , a source said , that the Justice Department might have to appoint a special prosecutor to uphold its reputation for independence .
Observers caution that even if a special prosecutor is appointed , actual indictments would still be far off .
The Bush torture policy was implemented with the advice of lawyers well skilled in the ways of Washington bureaucracy .
Any prosecutor would face considerable legal obstacles in bringing charges .
A review of the torture memoranda themselves shows that a consuming concern was thwarting the possible bringing of charges by a future prosecutor .
Now , perhaps , the defenses they devised may be put to the test .

We ’ve all heard of the plastic menace .
Plastic bags litter streets , trees , and streams .
They suffocate wildlife .
They can take over 1,000 years to decompose .
And we ’re only consuming and throwing away more of them every year .
They also have a knack for getting into the world ’s oceans .
Plastic bags and cigarettes account for more than 80 percent of marine litter , according to a recent landmark study by the U.N. Environment Programme , or UNEP .
They are eaten by all kinds of fish and kill an estimated 1 million seabirds a year .
The Great Pacific Garbage Patch , an island of litter twice the size of Texas floating in the Pacific Ocean , is largely made up of plastic .
UNEP says cutting bags off at the source is much cheaper than removing them later .
Enter the bag tax .
A bag tax works by charging shoppers a fee— typically between 5 and 30 cents — for every bag they get in a store .
This fee drives consumers to buy reusable bags and change their habits .
It also causes high - quality reusable bags to emerge and diffuse because it ’s a market solution .
The resulting revenue can be used to raise awareness , to pay for environmental clean up , or to subsidize reusable bags .
Paper bags , often touted as a green alternative , are n’t any better for the environment — they drive deforestation , take four times more energy to manufacture , and 10 times more energy to recycle .
This means less litter but much more global warming , so an effective tax should therefore cover both kinds of bags .
Bag taxes have worked in other countries .
Ireland ’s famous PlasTax , passed in 2002 , cut an astounding 90 percent of bag use within weeks .
It has not only changed consumer habits , but also social norms — carrying a plastic bag is seen as the moral equivalent of smoking on a plane .
In China , where plastic bags are referred to as “ white pollution , ” the parliament outright banned them in 2008 .
The measure cut plastic bag usage by 66 percent in its first year , saving 40 billion bags and 1.6 million tons of petroleum despite some initial problems with compliance .
The idea has taken off worldwide .
Taxes or bans have been implemented in Australia , Russia , Italy , Germany , Switzerland , the Netherlands , Hong Kong , and South Africa .
Thin plastic bags have even been banned in some of the world ’s poorest countries , including Eritrea , Rwanda , Somalia , Tanzania , Kenya , and Uganda .
Detractors argue that the added fees hurt the poor .
Smart bag taxes address this problem by using the revenue to buy reusable bags for low - income families .
Critics also point out that people can already recycle plastic bag in many supermarkets .
The problem is that consumers do n’t — at least not nearly enough to solve the problem .
According to the Environmental Protection Agency , only 10 percent to 15 percent of paper bags and 1 to 3 percent of plastic bags are recycled in the United States .
Cities in the United States have been leading the charge against the plastic nuisance .
San Francisco became the first American city to ban the bags in 2007 .
Los Angeles has passed a tax as well that goes into effect next year .
And just last month , Washington , D.C. ’s city council approved a five - cent fee on both paper and plastic bags .
It will go into effect following a public awareness campaign and distribution of reusable bags to low - income residents .
But the nationwide push against plastic bags has been turbulent .
Portland , Oregon ’s Mayor Sam Adams backed off his own bag tax proposal earlier this year .
In May , Philadelphia ’s City Council killed another promising initiative under intense industry pressure .
On August 18 , Seattle will vote on a bag fee modeled after Ireland ’s successful PlasTax .
The political battle , however , has been intense : Plastic bag industry lobbyists have poured over $ 750,000 into a campaign to kill the measure , and voters are divided .
At the state level , bag tax bills have been proposed in Connecticut , Maryland , Massachusetts , Virginia , and Texas , but none have passed yet .
There has even been some movement in Congress .
Rep. James Moran ( D - VA ) introduced the Plastic Bag Reduction Act of 2009 in June .
The bill would phase in a nationwide five - cent fee on both paper and plastic bags starting in January of 2010 , increasing to a 25 - cent fee by 2015 .
The case for a national bag tax is clear .
Plastic bags are a huge and growing problem .
They ’re not free , either , since retailers pass on the costs to consumers .
In comparison , good reusable bags pay for themselves in no time .
Bag taxes have been proven effective , and many other countries have passed them .
It ’s time that we do , too .

Movement and call data showed a different picture of connectivity than surveys
Friendships can be inferred with 95 % accuracy from call records and the proximity of users , says a new report .
Researchers fitted 94 mobiles in the US with logging software to gather data .
The results also showed that those with friends near work were happier , while those who called friends while at work were less satisfied .
The data , published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , showed a marked contrast with answers reported by the users themselves .
" We gave out a set of phones that were installed with a piece of ' uber - spyware ' , " said the study 's lead author Nathan Eagle , now at the Santa Fe Institute .
" It 's invisible to the user but logs everything : communication , users ' locations , people 's proximity by doing continuous Bluetooth scans . "
The researchers then compared the data with results from standard surveys given to the mobile users - and found , as the social sciences have found time and again , that people reported different behaviour than the mobile data revealed .
" What we found was that people 's responses were wildly inaccurate , " Dr Eagle told BBC News .
Mobile phone data are fantastic complements to the existing , very deep survey literature that the social sciences already have
Nathan Eagle
Santa Fe Institute " For people who said that a given individual was a friend , they dramatically overestimated the amount of time they spent .
But for people who were not friends , they dramatically underestimated that amount of time . "
The researchers were able to guess from the mobile data alone , with 95 % accuracy , if any given pair of users were friends .
An analysis of the overall proximity of a given user to his or her friends - maximised if they worked together - was correlated to people who reported a high level of satisfaction at work .
Conversely , those who made calls to their friends while working were found to report lower levels of satisfaction at work .
Wide application
One principal question of such a small sample size , made up exclusively of students from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , is how much the results really mean in a sociology context .
However , the group has gone on to carry out a larger study that just finished , comprising 1,000 people in Helsinki , Finland .
There is also an ongoing trial of the approach in Kenya , which Dr Eagle said includes participants ranging from computer science students to people who had never used a phone before .
Standard Nokia 6600 handsets were fitted with " uber- spyware " Dr Eagle sees the approach not as a means to supplant but rather to supplement traditional measures .
" Mobile phone data are fantastic complements to the existing , very deep survey literature that the social sciences already have , " he said .
Moreover , he sees it not just as a means to map out the networks of friends that mobile users might have , but to carry on this " reality mining " in contexts ranging from the modelling of the spread of disease to the design of urban spaces .
" We were capturing data when the Red Sox won the [ baseball championship ]
World Series for the first time , " Dr Eagle recounted .
" Suddenly all our subjects became unpredictable ; they all flooded into downtown Boston to a rally in the centre of the city .
" City planners approached us because they wanted to know how people were using urban infrastructure , to know when the people left the rally , how many walked across the bridge and how many took the subway , how many biked or took the bus .
" We can give them some real insight with the idea of helping them build a better city that reflects people 's actual behaviour . "

Foreign fruit pickers are taking home as little as £ 45 a week at a company which provides some of Britain 's largest supermarkets with thousands of tonnes of fruit , an investigation by The Independent has found .
S&A Produce , which supplies both Tesco and Sainsbury 's , employs thousands of eastern Europeans who are given a specific work visa allowing them to work for the company .
They are attracted by the prospect of earning up to £ 200 a week by picking fruit on its farms in Herefordshire and Kent .
The workers are officially paid the minimum wage of £ 5.74 , a comparatively high sum for foreign nationals who often have an average annual income of less than £ 3,000 in their own countries .
But employee pay slips obtained by The Independent show that the real hourly rate for the company 's fruit pickers often amounts to less than half the minimum wage once a series of obligatory charges has been deducted .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
One pay slip handed to The Independent by a Bulgarian employee who still picks strawberries on a farm in Brierley near Leominster , Herefordshire , showed that his net pay one week once the charges were removed was £ 45.12 for 19 hours of work – an equivalent of being paid just £ 2.37 an hour .
Another employee at the same farm was paid £ 58 for 22 hours ' work , the equivalent of just £ 2.61 per hour .
The most substantial pay slip seen by The Independent , which was earned by a fruit picker last month , provided £ 70 for 16 hours ' work , or £ 4.43 per hour .
At the peak of the fruit - picking season last month the firm hired more than 2,400 people , predominantly Romanians and Bulgarians who come to Britain on the Government 's Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme ( Saws ) , which allows them to stay on a single farm for six months .
Unlike other eastern Europeans who have full working rights , Bulgarians and Romanians are unable to change their jobs if they fall foul of their employers or do not like their surroundings .
Each week S&A Produce , which is one of just nine operators of the Saws scheme appointed by the Government , deducts £ 31.22 for accommodation , which comprises either caravans or temporary " pods " .
The fruit pickers are also charged £ 2.75 a week for " entertainment " , including internet access which some employees said rarely worked .
Photographs of the computers handed to The Independent show that many have floppy disk drives , suggesting that they are at least seven years old .
The company also charges a " one -off " fee of £ 35 for " pastoral care " , which includes helping employees make appointments with doctors or dentists and providing transport .
Employees interviewed by The Independent also said they thought they would be working for a full six months .
But earlier this week S&A Produce , which is Britain 's largest producer of strawberries , fired 346 employees who now have to return home , because the majority of the fruit picking had been completed .
There is no suggestion that S&A , which also uses the name S&A Davies , has broken any employment laws as the contract signed by the fruit pickers states that they will only be offered work when it is available .
A spokesperson for the company said many fruit pickers had reduced hours this year because the weather conditions meant that much of the fruit was picked earlier than usual and that productivity was up 45 per cent on last year .
But Peter McCaull , a councillor and former mayor of Leominster , said the firm needed to improve how it communicated to migrant workers the hours they would be working and how much money they could expect to make .
" If I had family that went out to work in Bulgaria I would expect them to be treated like human beings and be paid a fair wage for a fair day 's work , " he said .
" These people have paid £ 200 of their own money to come over to work here and yet they are given barely enough work to survive .
Many of them are unable to afford their flights back home . "
Locals have complained that since the workers were laid off , some Bulgarians have been knocking on doors looking for cash - in - hand jobs to earn enough money to return home .
The revelations will also pile extra pressure on Tesco which was criticised last month by the Unite union for exploiting foreign agency workers in its UK meat and poultry supply chains .
Last night a spokesperson for Britain 's largest supermarket said it would investigate the claims .
" We take the treatment of agency labour in our supply chain extremely seriously , " the spokesperson said .
" Our suppliers are subject to regular independent audits as well as our own checks .
We are therefore very concerned by these reports and are working with S&A Davies to investigate them . "
Last night Sainsbury 's said it would also talk to the company .
" We 're meeting with our supplier to assess the situation and understand the basis of these allegations , " a spokesperson said .
Rebecca Edmonds , a spokeswoman for S&A Davies , said the pay deductions were needed to provide accommodation and entertainment facilities and added that any accusation that the company was exploiting workers was unfounded .
" We try to make it as clear as we can that we cannot guarantee the number of days or hours worked because of the seasonal nature of fruit picking , " she said .
" Regrettably we have had to offer fewer hours than we would have liked .
But at least 84 per cent of the people we had to let go indicated in writing that they would like to come back next year which suggests that it is a minority , not a majority , or workers who have disliked working with us . "
Strapped for cash in the mid-1950s , Kurt Vonnegut took a job at Sports Illustrated , though he “ did n’t care or know squat about sports . ”
They asked him to write a piece about a racehorse that had jumped the fence at the local track .
He fed a page into his typewriter , stared at it for several hours , typed “ The horse jumped over the fucking fence ” and left .
Adobe Flash .
It ’s everywhere .
Not all of us want it , but many are forced into submission simply because it ’s weaseled its way into a myriad of applied and common uses .
This just makes all the worse the news that a vulnerability in Adobe Flash , Reader , and Acrobat applications is allowing malcontents to exploit computers with these products installed .
Adobe has confirmed that this vulnerability exists and is currently working to remedy it .
As it is , many of the major companies that provide antiviral software have already updated their applications to catch one of the exploits , which said exploit is carried out by way of a PDF file sent in an email ; this PDF - equipped email is generally targeted to attack corporations rather than personal accounts .
According to Paul Royal , principal researcher at Purewire , the other type of attack that currently remains unchallenged is merely “ a Flash movie of one - frame length .
This malicious Flash file is being embedded in Web pages , sometimes of legitimate Web sites that are compromised . ”
According to his research , this multimedia attack ’s code is just different enough from the PDF attack that it will not be caught by many antiviral programs until a separate package can be designed .
From Adobe : “ A critical vulnerability exists in the current versions of Flash Player ( v9.0159.0 and v.10.022.87 ) for Windows , Macintosh and Linux operating systems , and the authplay.dll component that ships with Adobe Reader and Acrobat v.9x for Windows , Macintosh and Unix operating systems .
This vulnerability could cause a crash and potentially allow an attacker to take control of the affected system . ” .
So if you were thinking that you ’re safe with a Linux - based system or OS X , you ’re unfortunately incorrect .
This vulnerability has apparently been known about since December of last year , but then it was merely regarded as a bug .
It probably began to be exploited around the beginning of July .
Still , it ’d be nice for known and exploitable bugs to be fixed within a relative time after being found .
The good news is that Adobe will have a fix brewed up for most of the exploitable applications by the end of this month .
Not that it ’s the end of the world and that we ought to shun Flash simply because of this exploit alone , but it ’s no secret that Flash is n’t liked by a lot of people for varied reasons , and this will just amount on top of them .
Taking a leaf out of Kroc Camen ’s book , I suggest that , if this new exploit in the Flash implementation bothers you enough , simply do without .
Is the time been long coming for newer , better multimedia implementations ?
Is this the final straw for you ?
Should it be the final straw for everyone else , too ?
Or is it just another storm that ’ll blow by ?
The comments are waiting .
When Alex Goodenough was 13 , his English teacher asked his class to write the first chapter of a novel .
Alex began writing his , and after chapter one he thought he might as well carry on .
He kept writing and writing - about space - faring aliens killing each other - and when the day came to submit his work , he handed in 97,000 words .
An entire novel .
" I noticed it was bigger than anyone else 's , " he says today .
He thought the teacher would like it .
" I judge books by how many aliens get shot - and everyone died in the end . "
Instead , he got " a thinly veiled comment about how important it is to wrap things up nicely - to write only what you can write in the duration of a Sats exam . "
Alex had always been out of sync .
At six months he was talking ; by 14 months he was constructing full sentences .
He began studying German at 13 , sat his GCSE at 14 and got an A ; by 15 he had four more GCSEs - he and his mother were already planning his Cambridge application .
But at 16 his local school flatly refused to give him a place in the sixth form .
Alex ended up teaching himself from textbooks at home , isolated , nocturnal , seldom leaving the house .
" It was just the word ' Asperger's ' , " his mother Jan says .
" Once they heard ' Asperger's ' , they did n't want to know . "
When I arrive at their home in Bishop 's Stortford , Hertfordshire , Alex is playing on his Xbox .
The first impression is of a typically awkward teenage boy , monosyllabic and shy , but no more so than many 17 - year - olds .
It 's only when he fails to make eye contact , and withdraws into himself like a computer shutting down , that the difference becomes discernible .
He says nothing unprompted , and answers questions with an air of literal - minded detachment that is unnerving and oddly touching .
His mother looks like a photo negative of her son - fair , articulate , bustling with smiles .
She has the intense , slightly strained energy of a tireless campaigner , but shows nothing but tender affection towards her son .
Asperger 's is an autistic spectrum disorder , and while children with the syndrome often have strong cognitive development , they can be socially inhibited , have trouble empathising and display unusual obsessions and verbal tics - repeating catchphrases or jokes , for instance .
Jan had known from very early on that her son was unusual , but it was some years before his diagnosis .
" I did n't have a name for it , " she says , " but I knew from when he was tiny .
It was quite bizarre ; it was like having a little old man about the place .
He needed so much mental stimulation ; the phrase ' pushy parent ' is the opposite of what it would be .
When he was three , I 'd say , ' Oh , let 's go and play in the park . '
And he 'd say , ' No , teach me from the books . '
There was this desire to achieve encyclopedic knowledge about absolutely everything .
Dinosaurs to start with . "
I ask Alex if he can remember the dinosaur phase .
" I had a little book with dinosaurs I used to read every day , and I entered a competition at school about drawing dinosaurs , and I won , and I wanted a dinosaur , but they only gave me a picture of one in a frame .
And I threw a tantrum . "
" That 's right ! "
His mother rolls her eyes ; as she and I laugh , Alex is impassive , but I get the feeling he is pleased to have made us smile .
It 's the first hint of something more knowingly playful , and I begin to see what his mother means when she says Asperger 's can be more complex than the stereotypes suggest .
" If there was a cure for Asperger 's , " she says , " I would n't want it .
Al 's just himself . "
When Alex and his sister , Imogen , were six and four , their father left , and Jan has since brought them up alone .
They attended a private preparatory school in Cambridge , where they used to live , and were very happy , but Jan could n't afford secondary school fees , so when Alex turned 13 the children enrolled at a local state school , Hockerill , in Bishop 's Stortford .
Academically , Alex shone .
And socially , too , he got by for the first year .
Other kids soon realised how clever he was - " And it made them like me when I did their homework . "
But by the age of 14 , he says , " I just stopped having friends , and started going to sit in the library by myself every break time . "
Can he remember why they stopped being his friends ?
" Um ... Dunno , really . "
He looks at his mum and sees her expression .
" What ? "
" Well , they beat you to a pulp ! " she exclaims .
" Well , yeah , " he agrees softly .
" And that , yeah . "
Can he remember what provoked the fight ?
" Probably me .
It 's always me . "
He says it without self - pity .
" He 's been bullied by other kids ever since nursery , " his mother says quietly .
In the two years Alex spent at Hockerill , he never once visited a schoolfriend 's house .
" When I left my prep school , I do n't know why , but I did n't bother to get anyone 's phone number or email address to keep in touch .
I never thought of it .
This is going to sound bad , " he says , " but I just forgot about them . "
The normal adolescent obsession with the dramas of friendship must have baffled him , I say .
" Generally , if everyone else is doing something , then I think , ' Why are n't I doing that thing ? '
And if I can see a benefit in doing it , I 'll do it .
But I could n't see any benefit . "
Alex 's solution was to stop going to school .
By year 10 he was working on his third novel - a sci - fi fantasy - and would sit up all night writing , sleeping during the day and waking at around 3 pm , just as his mother and sister were arriving home .
Gradually , he stopped leaving the house .
" I was comfortable there .
I was safe .
To be honest , I quite liked being in my own little world . "
" He was a mess , " his mother says quietly .
For years , Jan had wondered if her son might have Asperger 's - around one in 100 Britons is on the autistic spectrum .
But , like most people , she had only a limited understanding of the condition , and his facility for language seemed to rule it out .
By now , she was desperate ; a doctor had diagnosed her son with clinical depression , but Jan suspected this was a symptom , not a cause , of his problems , so she paid for Alex to see a psychiatrist and an educational psychologist .
" It was a fuming , gritted - teeth Al , " she smiles ruefully , " who went to see them . "
Alex 's objection was simple : " I do n't think I 've got a disability .
I like being me . "
The diagnosis of Asperger 's felt , he says , " like a label .
I felt like a jam jar . "
You can see what he means , for the word conjures images of The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night - Time , Mark Haddon 's bestselling novel about a boy with Asperger 's that has come , for most people , to represent the definitive account of the condition .
But when Jan shows me Alex 's Facebook page , I 'm amazed ; on screen is someone almost unrecognisable - witty , acute , confident .
" I like it on Facebook , " Alex says simply .
" It 's removed , it 's detached .
It 's just me talking to one other person at a time , so I'm OK . "
Though Alex shares many of the classic Asperger 's symptoms - social awkwardness , alarm at noise and disorder - his interest in literature confounds the stereotype of the science boffin , and his sense of humour is even more of a surprise .
When he says , " As soon as you say Asperger 's , people think he 's going to have glasses - which I do - he 's going to be pretty intelligent and he's not going to talk much , " he pauses one beat before setting up his punchline : " And he 's going to play chess . "
Does he play chess ?
" No , I play guitar . "
The diagnosis did solve one problem - it got Alex into another school .
By then , Jan was teaching at Helena Romanes school , a " bog - standard comprehensive , but one of the most inclusive schools I 've ever come across . "
The Goodenoughs lived outside the catchment area , having moved to Bishop 's Stortford , but because Alex was now classified as having special educational needs , he was given a place .
Alex 's education finally seemed to be working .
The school arranged for him to take some of his lessons by himself in the library , using textbooks ; he could have his lunch at a different time , to avoid the uproar of the canteen , and " whenever things were getting overwhelming for Al , he could retreat to my room " .
He took two GCSEs in English and two in maths a year early , and in year 11 the school allowed him to begin studying for four AS levels - English literature , philosophy , general studies and maths - while completing six more GCSEs .
" He was allowed this individual , hybrid year timetable , and that 's all he needed , " his mother says wistfully .
Had she been able to continue teaching there , that would probably have been the end of the matter .
But , Jan says , a perception of favouritism had formed among some of her colleagues .
" Al was being treated like something really special , and allowed to run his own show .
Other teachers who'd wanted their kids in the school had n't been able to do it . "
The idea that Alex could qualify as special needs when he was clearly the most able child in the school struck some colleagues as ludicrous , and the hostility that Jan says she felt became intolerable .
She took a new job and , once again , Alex had to find a new school .
Jan thought it would be easy ; the Hertfordshire & Essex High school was close by , and who would say no to a straight - A student ?
But the school refused even to send Alex an application form .
Over the course of several months , Jan was told three times that the sixth form was full - it was n't .
She was told the school could not accept
Alex because the staff did n't know him well enough to write his Ucas reference - even though Ucas does not insist upon a school reference for university applications .
She was told she 'd applied too late - even though the school later admitted this was n't the case .
And she was told Alex was n't wanted because his condition meant he could n't guarantee regular full - time attendance .
" I think , " Jan says , " because of the prejudices and preconceptions about Asperger 's , plus their disbelief that any teenager could be naturally motivated to learn , when I described Al they thought I was lying . "
So Alex spent the second year of his A - levels back in his room again , alone , teaching himself maths , further maths , further maths additional and physics from textbooks .
Before long , he was nocturnal again , refusing to leave the house , so Jan took the school to a special educational needs and disability tribunal .
According to the National Autistic Society , 25 % of children with autism have been excluded from school at least once .
More tribunal cases concern autism than any other special educational need .
In truth , accommodating children such as Alex , who almost invariably require some special arrangements , must be a challenge for any busy mainstream school .
But under the Disability Discrimination
Act , schools have an obligation to make " reasonable adjustments " for a disability .
Oliver Hyams , the barrister who represented the Goodenoughs , warned Jan that there was " no money to be won " ; she would have to pay her own costs , and even if she won there would be no compensation .
Nor was there any guarantee of success .
" This question of ' reasonable adjustments ' , " Hyams says drily , " has been the subject of much litigation . "
But the Goodenoughs won their case .
The tribunal found Alex 's education was " probably adversely affected " , and ordered the school to apologise to Alex for treating him less favourably , " for a reason related to his disability " .
In a statement to the press , the school said it was " very sorry that a misunderstanding arose " , adding that it " was very much a mutual confusion in failing to arrive at a clear understanding on the part of the school as to what Mrs Goodenough was seeking for her son .
The tribunal also acknowledged that the school is alive to the issue of discrimination . "
The chair of governors , David Redfern , seems weary and dismayed by the whole saga .
" This is not the nasty and the good , " he says , choosing his words with care .
" This is a total misunderstanding .
My instinct has been to let it rest and say nothing , because I do n't think it helps anyone - least of all Alex - to inflame it any further .
But this is very upsetting for the school , because there is absolutely no issue of discrimination here . "
The school had n't even realised Alex had a disability until the lawyers got involved , he insists .
" He would have been welcomed with open arms .
But we never understood that , and it just blew up out of all proportion before we knew where we were . "
He points out that the tribunal did not - as it could have - order staff to undergo any training in discrimination issues .
" It did n't because we do n't need it . "
Like most legal disputes , it became a quagmire of claim and counterclaim .
But by then Alex had sat most of his A - levels from home , and the tribunal had cost Jan £ 7,500 - a moral victory she feels was worth it , though Alex can't quite see it .
" What he can't understand , " Jan says , " is I 'm taking issue with the system .
I did n't think it should be possible for someone to do damage to another human being , and not have to pay some sort of compensation .
I find it appalling that special needs people do n't have the same rights as other people .
Someone can mess up their lives , and all they 're due is a letter of apology . "
What Alex also now has - much more importantly to him - is an offer of a place from Trinity College , Cambridge , to study engineering .
With three A - levels at A grade already , and three AS levels , he was offered the place on condition that he sit his practical exams in physics - for which his mother has enrolled him at a fee - paying school , funded by selling part of their back garden .
While he was there , he thought he might as well take chemistry and economics , too .
All being well , by this summer he will have six A - levels - and in October he will become a Cambridge fresher .
What are his hopes for the future ?
" I would n't mind Jeremy Clarkson 's job , but he 'll probably still be alive .
It 's a nice job .
It 's about engineering . "
And when he pictures life at university , what does he see ?
" Umm ... " he says .
" Lectures .
Random chats .
Robots .
Drinking , possibly . "
" But you do n't drink ! " his mother laughs .
For a second , Alex looks thrown .
" I 'll learn how , " he says .
" I 'll teach myself . "
• Information about Asperger 's is available from autism.org.uk .
A single evolutionary event appears to explain the short , curved legs that characterize all of today 's dachshunds , corgis , basset hounds and at least 16 other breeds of dogs , a team led by the National Human Genome Research Institute ( NHGRI ) , part of the National Institutes of Health , reported July 16 .
In addition to what it reveals about short - legged dogs , the unexpected discovery provides new clues about how physical differences may arise within species and suggests new approaches to understanding a form of human dwarfism .
In a study published in the advance online edition of the journal Science , the researchers led by NHGRI 's Elaine Ostrander , Ph.D. , examined DNA samples from 835 dogs , including 95 with short legs .
Their survey of more than 40,000 markers of DNA variation uncovered a genetic signature exclusive to short - legged breeds .
Through follow - up DNA sequencing and computational analyses , the researchers determined the dogs ' disproportionately short limbs can be traced to one mutational event in the canine genome — a DNA insertion — that occurred early in the evolution of domestic dogs .
" Every species , including canine and human , carries an amazing record of evolution scripted in its genome that can teach us about the mechanisms at work in biology , as well as about human health and disease , " said NHGRI Scientific Director Eric Green , M.D. , Ph.D.
" This work provides surprising evidence of a new way in which genome evolution may serve to generate diversity within a species . "
Specifically , the researchers found that in contrast to other dog breeds , all short - legged dog breeds have an extra copy of the gene that codes for a growth - promoting protein called fibroblast growth factor 4 ( FGF4 ) .
Although functional , the extra gene lacks certain parts of the DNA code , called introns , found in normal genes .
These characteristics led researchers to conclude that the extra gene is a so - called retrogene that was inserted into the dog genome some time after the ancestor of modern dog breeds diverged from wolves .
To understand retrogenes , one first needs to understand how the cell normally makes proteins .
To produce a protein , a gene 's DNA code is transcribed into a molecule called messenger RNA ( mRNA ) .
The mRNA then leaves the cell 's nucleus and enters the outer region of the cell , called the cytoplasm .
There the mRNA is read by tiny molecular machines , called ribosomes , which use the information to assemble proteins .
Retrogenes are formed when the mRNA encounters something — often a type of virus called a retrovirus — that turns it back into DNA through a process referred to as reverse transcription .
This new piece of DNA , which contains the same protein - coding information as the gene that produced the mRNA , may then be inserted back into the genome , usually at a much different place than the original gene .
Depending on where it is inserted , this piece of DNA may or may not be capable of producing proteins .
If it is functional , it is called a retrogene .
In the case of short - legged dogs , the inserted retrogene results in the overproduction of the FGF4 protein , which researchers hypothesize may turn on key growth receptors at the wrong times during fetal development .
Veterinary researchers already know that in certain dog breeds the development of long bones is curtailed due to calcification of growth plates , resulting in short legs with a curved appearance .
The trait , called disproportional dwarfism , or chondrodysplasia , is an American Kennel Club standard for more than a dozen domestic dog breeds , including the dachshund , corgi , Pekingese and basset hound .
This trait is distinct from the uniformly miniature size of toy breeds , such as the toy poodle .
" Our findings suggest that retrogenes may play a larger role in evolution than has been previously thought , especially as a source of diversity within species , " said the study 's first author , Heidi G. Parker , Ph.D. of NHGRI .
" We were surprised to find that just one retrogene inserted at one point during the evolution of a species could yield such a dramatic physical trait that has been conserved over time . "
In the past , retrogenes have been recognized as an important source of changes that have fueled the divergence of species .
However , the dog findings are the first example of a retrogene that has spurred significant and long - lasting variation within a single species .
The findings also may have implications for understanding human biology and disease .
Researchers note that some people are affected by a similar appearing growth disorder , called hypochondroplasia , which belongs to a group of conditions commonly referred to as dwarfism .
While about two - thirds of cases of human hypochondroplasia have been linked to a different gene , the cause of the other one - third remains a mystery .
" This study points to a new gene that should be investigated for its possible role in human hypochondroplasia , " said Dr. Ostrander , the study 's senior author and a senior investigator in NHGRI 's Division of Intramural Research .
" Our findings may prove valuable to scientists studying other aspects of human growth and development .
The work also underscores the value of canine studies for uncovering new biological mechanisms that are likely relevant to human disease . "
In addition to Ostrander and her colleagues at NHGRI , the team included researchers from Cornell University in Ithaca , N.Y. ; the University of California , Los Angeles ; Oregon Health and Science University , Portland ; the Waltham Center for Pet Nutrition in Leicestershire , England ; and Affymetrix Corporation , Santa Clara , Calif .
A new half - cent sales tax to build transportation projects in Los Angeles County goes into effect today , raising the county ’s rate to 9.75 % .
But the measure passed by voters in November might generate about $ 1.8 billion less than originally estimated .
Officials for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority said that the worst recession since World War II would probably reduce the revenue collected under Measure R from about $ 40 billion to roughly $ 38.2 billion during the next 30 years .
They noted that the economic downturn cut revenue from Measures A and C -- the county ’s two other transportation sales taxes -- about 19.5 % in January through March , compared with the same period last year .
During the last three months of 2008 , the decline was about 13 % , compared with the same period in 2007 .
Terry Matsumoto , the MTA ’s treasurer and chief financial officer , said the drop in Measure R ’s projected revenue is based on an analysis prepared last month for the MTA board .
The study assumes a robust recovery of the nation ’s economy in the years ahead .

If all goes well , Matsumoto said , the drop in estimated revenue should not be that serious , though the decline might reduce the amount of matching funds the MTA could obtain from the state and federal governments .
He noted that there have been strong economic turnarounds after past recessions .
“ This will all depend on how fast the economy recovers , ” Matsumoto cautioned .
“ Using a crystal ball is always a little dangerous .
Past performance is not always an indicator of future performance . ”
The MTA is scheduled to receive its first Measure R revenue in September , but the amount of the initial installment has not yet been estimated .
The money will pay for highway improvements , commuter rail systems , buses and the subway extension to the Westside .
With the activation of Measure R , the basic sales tax rate in L.A. County jumps to 9.75 % , one of the highest in the state .

Sales tax rates in Orange , Riverside , San Bernardino and Ventura counties are lower , which may provide some incentive for people to shop there instead of Los Angeles County .
MTA officials said the difference , however , would have little effect on Measure R ’s revenue .

Subject : Lemme get out my red , white and blue tie - dye ... " Bicentennial " ( aka " 200 " ) is pure 1970s psychedilia .
The designs remind me strongly of Peter Max and Yellow Submarine .
This short film is a series of flag and other American symbol motifs , almost done to abstraction .
Interesting bits include the remenants of the hippie culture ( the Woodstock logo , the flag shaped around a peace sign ) contrasted with the symbols of mainstream consumer culture ( a cornacopia spewing out cars , tvs , hamburgers , and hot dogs ) .
Washington crossing the Delaware becomes a Fauvist riot of color .
While trying to use all the American symbols it becomes a oblique critique of those symbols , as they are shown to be changable and repeated unto abstraction .
The fact this was made for the US Information Agency is all the more surprising .
The trippy visuals also have a decent jam band rock soundtrack .
Put this movie up on the projecter at your next house party .
The perfect addition to your 70's theme party .

Scott Roeder appeared in court via video link from jail
A man has been charged with the murder of a prominent abortion doctor in the US state of Kansas .
Scott Roeder , 51 , was charged with the first - degree murder of Dr George Tiller , who was shot dead on Sunday at a church in Wichita .
Mr Roeder is also charged with aggravated assault against two people who tried to intervene in the attack .
Dr Tiller , who performed so - called late term abortions , had long been a focus of anti-abortion groups in the US .
Mr Roeder is being held in a Wichita jail and appeared in Sedgwick County District Court , also in Wichita , via video link .
The suspect has requested a lawyer and has been assigned to the public defender 's office , the Kansas City Star newspaper reported .
A preliminary hearing has been tentatively set for 16 June , the report added .
Mr Roeder was arrested in a suburb of Kansas City about 170 miles ( 274 km ) from the scene , some three hours after the shooting at the Reformation Lutheran Church .
Dr Tiller 's clinic - Women 's Health Care Services - had often been the site of demonstrations , and he had been shot and wounded by an assailant 16 years ago .
Following the fatal shooting , US Attorney General Eric Holder promised protection to " appropriate people and facilities " .
Anti-abortion groups in the US have denounced Dr Tiller 's killing .

I 'm not going to go through the con since that 's the whole fun of the show , but there 's high tech golf , making Eliot seem like a popular fighter , stealing a huge production for a singer , and faking someone 's death .

Rutger discovers that he is being conned and decides to bet against Eliot in a fight or terrorize their clients forever .
After Eliot fakes killing someone , Rutger runs away and the police find guns and cash .
Good luck !
I thought Christian Kane was amazing and really showed his acting ability , especially when he was explaining why MMA fighters do what they do .
The episode had plenty of funny moments , my favorite being when Eliot got Parker to use some MMA moves on Hardison and she kept choking him while Nate was still talking .
I found the plot much easier to understand this week , though I would have liked to see what kind of operation they are running now .
Score : 9.3/10
If you ’re at all interested in Open Source or Linux you ’ve probably heard about the debate surrounding the inclusion of Mono and Mono - based apps in the default Ubuntu distribution .
Here is the original post that seemed to trigger it all .
Here is the reply that was posted by Jo Shields , a member of the Debian Mono group .
Richard Stallman also weighed in on the matter , in favor of removing Mono .
Now I think having ideals and standing up for them is great and that people should always stand up for what they believe in .
However , it ’s one thing to stand up for your ideals and do what you have to , but it ’s quite another to use your ideals as an excuse for making people use something that is of lower quality and that they do n’t want to .
I think that people who advocate open source often forget that a lot of people ( including a lot of people working with computer technology ) care less about the licensing of their software and more about whether or not it works well .
The reason open source succeeded is n’t so much due to a religious zeal to use only Free products but rather due to the fact that it let people open up the innards of their software and make changes so that things worked better .
The reason I use Linux over Windows is that I can start up in 30 seconds as opposed to 5 minutes and have things organized just the way I like .
And I like OS X better for managing my media and doing graphic related stuff .
The second bone I have to pick regards all the talk of “ alternatives ” .
The original post says “ There are alternatives to every Mono application that for the most part are better ” and quite conveniently fails to mention any of them .
Stallman says that the ‘ probem ’ is with applications like Tomboy which depend on Mono and also fails to mention any alternatives that would not depend on Mono .
It ’s this sort of condescending attitude towards developers who are doing real work that really irritates me .
Stallman is a very inspiring figure who has done a lot of work for open source , but let ’s not forget that a lot of ‘ pure ’ free software GNU projects have been stalling for years while alternatives leap ahead .
Free software owes its position today in no small part to the Linux kernel , while the GNU ’s own Hurd kernel which started development before Linux is still unusable for most intents and purposes .
The Guile scripting language which was supposed to become standard across all GNU tools is also mostly a pipe dream .
GNU ’s Flash replacement is mostly inadequate .
GNU Emacs is a wonderful piece of technology , but it ’s losing out to newer IDEs .
I personally believe these IDEs are inferior to Emacs in many ways , but are much more in - tune with modern developer needs while Emacs is in many ways is stuck in the past .
“ Show me the code ” was a popular slogan when Microsoft threatened to use it ’s patent portfolio against linux , I think it ’s time Open Source enthusiasts followed their own slogans .
Finally , this whole business of “ Microsoft is evil ” is getting tiresome .
Yes Microsoft did bad things .
Yes , they ’re out to get Linux and free software .
Maybe Novell is a sell out .
So ?
I do n’t like them either .
Do n’t use Windows and close down your Hotmail account .
If you read Jo Shields ’reply , you ’ll see that Microsoft had no hand in the development of Mono and the agreements with Novell do not cover it .
Tomboy and F - Spot are free applications running on a free runtime system .
It is reimplementation of a Microsoft standard , containing no Microsoft code .
If you still think that Mono is ‘ tainted ’ because of the association , then that ’s your choice and you can take Mono off your system and vow never to use Mono - reliant apps .
As a user of free software that is your choice .
But it is not your right nor your duty to force other people to do the same .
Choice is at the core of free software and if you are trying to tell people that they ca n’t use or distribute some piece of software , then you are no better than Microsoft or other commercial software makers pulling users into vendor lock in .
At this point , I ’m going to change track and talk about a post that appeared as a blip on Reddit a few days ago .
It ’s called Thumbs Down on Clojure and it basically denounces Clojure as a false Lisp because it interfaces tightly with Java and so has to abandon a lot of the ‘ pure ’ principles behind real Lisp .
Now I have nothing at all against the author ’s actual post and I actually like it that he is speaking his mind .
The author drew a lot of flak from Reddit users because he placed purity above practicality and more importantly because he had nothing but vaporware to offer as an alternative .
To tell the truth , I have very mixed opinions about what this guy is doing ( and talking about ) .
Having seen the power of Lisp , I understand the attraction of purity .
Having struggled to find a good cross- platform UI toolkit that does n’t take a CS major to install makes me believe that when it comes to software , practicality trumps purity every single time ( though pure and practical can coexist ) .
And one bird in the hand is worth two in the bush .
Though I use Linux and OS X , I have issues with modern operating systems in general .
I would love to have an operating system with a fast , lean core but with a uniform , powerful , managed runtime on top in which all user applications are built and which achieves close - to - the - metal performance .
I have some ideas on how it could be done , but I do n’t have the knowledge or the resources to implement something like that .
And till I ’m in a position to make real contributions to the world around me , I do n’t think it ’s fair for me to deride the works that others are doing to make the world a little better for all of us .
The core thread behind both the above issues is that free software really is n’t free at all .
There is a significant time and energy investment behind every single line of open source code that you ’re using , which includes the software that runs this blog and probably the browser you ’re using to read it .
Ideals are well and good , but there are real . people who are behind all the free software we use today .
Ultimately , the software and ideals do n’t really matter , it ’s the people that do .
The people who make the software , the people who believe and stand up for the ideals and the people who can benefit from both the software and ideals without consciously taking part in either process .
It makes me laugh when people like Stallman talk about software being ‘ ethical or not ’ when the only things that are really ethical are people and their actions .
It almost makes me cry when people laugh and deride the work of other people but are incapable of doing anything about it .
This is n’t the first time that I ’ve heard a Lisp admirer say that they ’re appalled at the state of modern Lisps .
It ’s an understandable sentiment , but what ’s equally disturbing to me is that all these smart people ( and some of them are really smart ) ca n’t seem to be able to pull together and create something that can blow the socks of all the supposedely substandard solutions that people are using to get real work done right now .
So where does this leave all of us ?
The same place as where we started .
Neither the Mono controversy nor the Lispers ’ pining for the good old days is really anything new .
Writing good software is hard and always has been , even with the best of tools .
And it does n’t help anyone to criticize productive projects if you do n’t have an equally well working alternative .
Opposing ideas on a purely ideological basis is often not the best idea ( though there are notable exceptions which must not be forgotten ) .
I think Linus Torvalds probably sums things up the best into two quotes .
The first one , as I already mentioned , is “ Talk is cheap .
Show me the code . ” .
The other one which is equally valid given the circumstances and the rest of this article is “ Anybody who tells me I ca n’t use a program because it ’s not open source , go suck on rms .
I ’m not interested .
99 % of that I run tends to be open source , but that ’s my choice , dammit . ”
So what are you all waiting for ?
Start showing some code .
Now it ’s time to turn up the heat .
I ’ve spent the last several days talking with fellow pro-life Senators about our strategy to ensure that any new national health care plan does NOT include coverage for abortion on demand .
We ’re all agreed on two main points :
This has to be the # 1 objective of the pro-life cause right now — if we fail , millions of babies will pay the ultimate price , and ;
We have the truth and public opinion on our side , but what ’s needed is steady grassroots pressure on key lawmakers nationwide .
And it needs to begin right now .
That ’s why I ’m asking you to click here to sign the Susan B. Anthony List ’s petition to keep abortion out of healthcare .
We must ACT to stop the abortion mandate today .
Because if President Barack Obama and Speaker Nancy Pelosi pass a national health insurance plan that includes full coverage for abortion on demand :
Taxpayer - funded abortions will be the law of the land in all 50 states .
Health clinics nationwide will become federal abortion facilities .
Millions upon millions will be killed each year .
That ’s some kind of “ hope and change ” is n’t it ?
I do n’t know about hope , but it ’s a definite change away from everything we ’ve achieved these past eight years to promote a culture of life .
So please act right now and sign the petition - – if we all come together and make our voices heard , this could be the biggest victory for unborn children in a decade .
What makes this such a desperate fight ?
For beginners , new entitlements never go away .
President Obama knows that , and so do Nancy Pelosi and the lobbyists at Emily ’s List and NARAL –- they see this as a way to solidify government policy in support of abortion for generations to come .
Of course , we created federal entitlements like Social Security and Medicare in the past to help people live .
This new entitlement promotes abortion , not life .
That ’s not a sign of progress .
It ’s horrifying , and we can not allow it .
So after you sign the petition , I hope you will rush the most urgent contribution you can afford right now to the Susan B. Anthony List .
This legislation creating a new national health care plan is changing rapidly , moving through various committees , with anti-life lobbyists trying to sneak abortion coverage in at every turn .
You have my word that I am paying close attention to all the language in these bills , and so are my pro-life colleagues both in the House and the Senate .
Emily ’s List , NARAL and Nancy Pelosi ’s pro-abortion friends wo n’t sneak anything by us .
If they want to create a new abortion entitlement , they ’re going to have to cast a series of public roll - call votes .
And those votes will be very close .
Because I do n’t have pro-life stalwarts like Elizabeth Dole and Rick Santorum here with me anymore , I ’m not working with a big margin in the Senate .
The numbers are difficult in the House as well .
But there is hope .
Recently , 19 House Democrats signed a letter to Speaker Pelosi expressing their opposition to abortion funding in health care reform .
I ’m told a handful of Senate Democrats are prepared to express similar principles to Majority Leader Harry Reid .
The rest –– and victory or defeat — is up to you .
If you and the really dedicated pro-life footsoldiers across America can summon enough energy , outrage , noise and financial generosity on our side , we ’ll win .
Susan B. Anthony
List staffers and I have identified the dozen lawmakers we consider the key “ swing votes ” on this issue , and our petition with thousands of names of Americans nationwide will go directly towards applying pressure on them to vote against taxpayer - funded abortions .
We need to act quickly , so please click here to sign the SBA List petition to keep abortion out of health care .
I ’m doing everything in my power as Senator to stop Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi from creating a new national health insurance program that funds abortions , and the Susan B. Anthony List is playing a vital role in this fight .
Townhall Reader , we really need your help .
Sincerely ,
David Vitter
U.S. Senator
P.S. Townhall Reader , this will come down to one or two Senators and maybe ten Representatives -– that ’s who will make the difference between a huge pro-life victory or a new national health insurance plan that will use taxpayer dollars to fund the entire abortion - on - demand agenda and result in millions of murdered babies .
I ’m doing everything I possibly can in the Senate to stop this new abortion entitlement , but I need your help .
Please sign the SBA List petition to keep abortion out of health care TODAY .

The single most basic fallacy underlying the present American catastrophe in Iraq is the belief that the U.S. can somehow solve that country 's problems , however extreme and intractable they may seem ; that , in short , we are part of the solution in Iraq , not part of the problem .
Once you 're thinking that way , it 's always a matter of setting the latest incorrect or inept tactics right , or of changing a policy that has been incompetently put into operation by unprepared administrators wielding too few resources too poorly .
But the belief in the power of the United States to solve problems for others -- by force -- reflects a deep - seated imperial mind - set that exists not just in the Bush administration , but among its mainstream critics as well .
You can see it everywhere , if you care to look .
You can note it in the way , as things continue to devolve in Iraq , the military and its various internal critics have been bobbing and weaving from one set of counterproductive counterinsurgency tactics to another ( each time claiming that the previous set had somehow overlooked basic insurgency doctrine or the lessons of Vietnam ) .
The latest of these is a modified version of the old ( failed ) Vietnam " ink blot " strategy in which we pull troops back to Baghdad , a city now evidently in utter , violent disarray , to nail down at least some of the capital 's neighborhoods ( while denuding troop strength in areas of Sunni Iraq where the insurgency rages ) .
Or consider the latest in Bush administration thinking .
In a superb front - page New York Times piece last week , Bombs Aimed at G.I.'s in Iraq Are Increasing , reporters Michael R. Gordon , Mark Mazzetti and Thom Shanker offered impressive evidence that , since the killing of Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the Sunni insurgency against the Americans and allied Iraqi forces has only heightened .
Perhaps most striking were the final paragraphs of the piece , meant only for news junkies and buried deep inside the paper ( reinforcing my sense that the imperial press can sometimes most profitably be read from back to front ) :
" ' Everybody in the administration is being quite circumspect , ' the expert said , ' but you can sense their own concern that this is drifting away from democracy . ' "
" ' Senior administration officials have acknowledged to me that they are considering alternatives other than democracy , ' said one military affairs expert who received an Iraq briefing at the White House last month and agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity .
" ' Senior administration officials have acknowledged to me that they are considering alternatives other than democracy , ' said one military affairs expert who received an Iraq briefing at the White House last month and agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity .
" ' Everybody in the administration is being quite circumspect , ' the expert said , ' but you can sense their own concern that this is drifting away from democracy . ' "
White House spokesman Tony Snow was forced to deny this at a press briefing the next day , but it makes complete sense .
This was , after all , the solution the elder Bush 's top officials looked to after the first Gulf War .
They hoped a war - weakened Saddam would be overthrown by a Baathist strongman from within his own military , someone we could deal with -- as we had with him in the 1980s .
( Juan Cole speculates that this time around it would be " a Shiite ex-Baathist officer in the old Iraqi army who knew how to make people an offer they could n't refuse . " )
Even in the unlikely event that it were possible to put such a plan into effect , it 's a given that it , too , would fail .
That the Bush administration is looking for new solutions to the Iraqi conundrum , however , should be unsurprising .
So many situations in our world make a mockery of all attempts at prediction ; and yet Iraq , since March 2003 , has seemed otherwise .
There is a terrible logic to the situation in that country , which has only worsened incrementally under three - plus years of American ( and British ) occupation .
Whatever the promises , whatever the " turning points , " whatever the provisional good news offered at any moment , the situation in that country ( and the region ) only gets worse .
In this case , history should be our guide .
As long as Americans believe that Iraq is some kind of imperial Rubik 's cube , where what 's at stake is hitting on just the right combination of tactics , plans , and political mix inside Baghdad 's Green Zone , as long as we believe that we are indeed part of the solution , not part of the problem , matters will only continue to worsen .
Michael Schwartz , a Tomdispatch regular , offers seven facts that help explain why the lethal brew our invasion let loose in that country will have no hope of " solution " under present conditions .

With a tenuous cease - fire between Israel and Lebanon holding , the ever - hotter war in Iraq is once again creeping back onto newspaper front pages and towards the top of the evening news .
Before being fully immersed in daily reports of bomb blasts , sectarian violence , and casualties , however , it might be worth considering some of the just - under - the - radar - screen realities of the situation in that country .
Here , then , is a little guide to understanding what is likely to be a flood of new Iraqi developments -- a few enduring , but seldom commented upon , patterns central to the dynamics of the Iraq war , as well as to the fate of the American occupation and Iraqi society .
1. The Iraqi Government Is Little More Than a Group of " Talking Heads "
A minimally viable central government is built on at least three foundations : the coercive capacity to maintain order , an administrative apparatus that can deliver government services and directives to society , and the resources to manage these functions .
The Iraqi government has none of these attributes -- and no prospect of developing them .
It has no coercive capacity .
The national army we hear so much about is actually trained and commanded by the Americans , while the police forces are largely controlled by local governments and have few , if any , viable links to the central government in Baghdad .
( Only the Special Forces , whose death - squad activities in the capital have lately been in the news , have any formal relationship with the elected government ; and they have more enduring ties to the U.S. military that created them and the Shia militias who staffed them . )
Administratively , the Iraqi government has no existence outside Baghdad 's heavily fortified Green Zone -- and little presence within it .
Whatever local apparatus exists elsewhere in the country is led by local leaders , usually with little or no loyalty to the central government and not dependent on it for resources it does n't , in any case , possess .
In Baghdad itself , this is clearly illustrated in the vast Shiite slum of Sadr city , controlled by Muqtada al - Sadr 's Mahdi Army and his elaborate network of political clerics .
( Even U.S. occupation forces enter that enormous swath of the capital only in large brigades , braced for significant firefights . )
In the major city of the Shia south , Basra , local clerics lead a government that alternately ignores and defies the central government on all policy issues from oil to women 's rights ; in Sunni cities like Tal Afar and Ramadi , where major battles with the Americans alternate with insurgent control , the government simply has no presence whatsoever .
In Kurdistan in the north , the Kurdish leadership maintains full control of all local governments .
As for resources , with 85 % of the country 's revenues deriving from oil , all you really need to know is that oil - rich Iraq is also suffering from an " acute fuel shortage " ( including soaring prices , all - night lines at gas stations , and a deal to get help from neighboring Syria which itself has minimal refining capacity ) .
The almost helpless Iraqi government has had little choice but to accept the dictates of American advisors and of the International Monetary Fund about exactly how what energy resources exist will be used .
Paying off Saddam - era debt , reparations to Kuwait from the Gulf War of 1990 , and the needs of the U.S. - controlled national army have had first claim .
With what remains so meager that it cannot sustain a viable administrative apparatus in Baghdad , let alone the rest of the country , there is barely enough to spare for the government leadership to line their own pockets .
2. There Is No Iraqi Army
The " Iraqi Army " is a misnomer .
The government 's military consists of Iraqi units integrated into the U.S. - commanded occupation army .
These units rely on the Americans for intelligence , logistics , and -- lacking almost all heavy weaponry themselves -- artillery , tanks , and any kind of airpower .
( The Iraqi " Air Force " typically consists of fewer then 10 planes with no combat capability . )
The government has no real control over either personnel or strategy .
We can see this clearly in a recent operation in Sadr City , conducted ( as news reports tell us ) by " Iraqi troops and US advisors " and backed up by U.S. artillery and air power .
It was one of an ongoing series of attempts to undermine the Sadrists and their Mahdi army , who have governed the area since the fall of Saddam .
The day after the assault , Iraqi premier Nouri Kamel al - Maliki complained about the tactics used , which he labeled " unjustified , " and about the fact that neither he , nor his government , was included in the decision - making leading up to the assault .
As he put it to an Agence France - Presse , " I reiterate my rejection to [ sic ] such an operation and it should not be executed without my consent .
This particular operation did not have my approval . "
This happened because the U.S. has functionally expanded its own forces in Iraq by integrating local Iraqi units into its command structure , while essentially depriving the central government of any army it could use purely for its own purposes .
Iraqi units have their own officers , but they always operate with American advisers .
As American Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad put it , " We 'll ultimately help them become independent . "
( Do n't hold your breath . )
3 . The Recent Decline in American Casualties Is Not a Result of Less Fighting ( and Anyway , It's Probably Ending )
At the beginning of August , the press carried reports of a significant decline in U.S. casualties , punctuated with announcements from American officials that the military situation was improving .
The figures ( compiled by the Brookings Institute ) do show a decline in U.S. military deaths ( 76 in April , 69 in May , 63 in June , and then only 48 in July ) .
But these were offset by dramatic increases in Iraqi military fatalities , which almost doubled in July as the U.S. sent larger numbers of Iraqi units into battle , and as undermanned American units were redeployed from al - Anbar province , the heartland of the Sunni insurgency , to civil - war - torn Baghdad in preparation for a big push to recapture various out - of - control neighborhoods in the capital .
More important , when it comes to long - term U.S. casualties , the trends are not good .
In recent months , U.S. units had been pulled off the streets of the capital .
But the Iraqi Army units that replaced them proved incapable of controlling Baghdad in even minimal ways .
So , in addition , to fighting the Sunni insurgency , American troops are now back on the streets of Baghdad in the midst of a swirling civil war with U.S. casualties likely to rise .
In recent months , there has also been an escalation of the fighting between American forces and the insurgency , independent of the sectarian fighting that now dominates the headlines .
As a consequence , the U.S. has actually increased its troop levels in Iraq ( by delaying the return of some units , sending others back to Iraq early , and sending in some troops previously held in reserve in Kuwait ) .
The number of battles ( large and small ) between occupation troops and the Iraqi resistance has increased from about 70 a day to about 90 a day ; and the number of resistance fighters estimated by U.S. officials has held steady at about 20,000 .
The number of IEDs placed -- the principle weapon targeted at occupation troops ( including Iraqi units ) -- has been rising steadily since the spring .
The effort by Sunni guerrillas to expel the American army and its allies is more widespread and energetic than at any time since the fall of the Hussein regime .
4. Most Iraqi Cities Have Active and Often Viable Local Governments
Neither the Iraqi government , nor the American - led occupation has a significant presence in most parts of Iraq .
This is well - publicized in the three Kurdish provinces , which are ruled by a stable Kurdish government without any outside presence ; less so in Shia urban areas where various religio- political groups -- notably the Sadrists , the Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ) , Da'wa , and Fadhila -- vie for local control , and then organize cities and towns around their own political and religious platforms .
While there is often violent friction among these groups -- particularly when the contest for control of an area is undecided -- most cities and towns are largely peaceful as local governments and local populations struggle to provide city services without a viable national economy .
This situation also holds true in the Sunni areas , except when the occupation is actively trying to pacify them .
When there is no fighting , local governments dominated by the religious and tribal leaders of the resistance establish the laws and maintain a kind of order , relying for law enforcement on guerrilla fighters and militia members .
All these governments -- Kurdish , Shia and Sunni -- have shown themselves capable of maintaining ( often fundamentalist ) law and ( often quite harsh ) order , with little crime and little resistance from the local population .
Though often severely limited by the lack of resources from a paralyzed national economy and a bankrupt national government , they do collect the garbage , direct traffic , suppress the local criminal element , and perform many of the other duties expected of local governments .
5. Outside Baghdad , Violence Arrives with the Occupation Army
The portrait of chaos across Iraq that our news generally offers us is a genuine half - truth .
Certainly , Baghdad has been plunged into massive and worsening disarray as both the war against the Americans and the civil war have come to be concentrated there , and as the terrifying process of ethnic cleansing has hit neighborhood after neighborhood , and is now beginning to seep into the environs of the capital .
However , outside Baghdad ( with the exception of the northern cities of Kirkuk and Mosul , where historic friction among Kurd , Sunni , and Turkman has created a different version of sectarian violence ) , Iraqi cities tend to be reasonably ethnically homogeneous and to have at least quasi-stable governments .
The real violence often only arrives when the occupation military makes its periodic sweeps aimed at recapturing cities where it has lost all authority and even presence .
This deadly pattern of escalating violence is regularly triggered by those dreaded sweeps , involving brutal , destructive , and sometimes lethal home invasions aimed at capturing or killing suspected insurgents or their supporters .
The insurgent response involves the emplacement of ever more sophisticated roadside bombs ( known as IEDs ) and sniper attacks , aimed at distracting or hampering the patrols .
The ensuing firefights frequently involve the use of artillery , tanks , and air power in urban areas , demolishing homes and stores in a neighborhood , which only adds to the bitter resistance and increasing the support for the insurgency .
These mini -wars can last between a few hours and , in Falluja , Ramadi , or other " centers of resistance , " a few weeks .
They constitute the overwhelming preponderance of the fighting in Iraq .
For any city , the results can be widespread death and devastation from which it can take months or years to recover .
Yet these are still episodes punctuating a less violent , if increasingly more run-down normalcy .
6 . There Is a Growing Resistance Movement in the Shia Areas of Iraq
Lately , the pattern of violence established in largely Sunni areas of Iraq has begun to spread to largely Shia cities , which had previously been insulated from the periodic devastation of American pacification attempts .
This ended with growing Bush administration anxiety about economic , religious , and militia connections between local Shia governments and Iran , and with the growing power of the anti-American Sadrist movement , which had already fought two fierce battles with the U.S. in Najaf in 2004 and a number of times since then in Sadr City .
Symptomatic of this change is the increasing violence in Basra , the urban oil hub at the southern tip of the country , whose local government has long been dominated by various fundamentalist Shia political groups with strong ties to Iran .
When the British military began a campaign to undermine the fundamentalists ' control of the police force there , two British military operatives were arrested , triggering a battle between British soldiers ( supported by the Shia leadership of the Iraqi central government ) and the local police ( supported by local Shia leaders ) .
This confrontation initiated a series of armed confrontations among the various contenders for power in Basra .
Similar confrontations have occurred in other localities , including Karbala , Najaf , Sadr City , and Maysan province .
So far no general offensive to recapture the any of these areas has been attempted , but Britain has recently been concentrating its troops outside Basra .
If the occupation decides to use military means to bring the Shia cities back into anything like an American orbit , full - scale battles may be looming in the near future that could begin to replicate the fighting in Sunni areas , including the use of IEDs , so far only sporadically employed in the south .
If you think American ( and British ) troops are overextended now , dealing with internecine warfare and a minority Sunni insurgency , just imagine what a real Shiite insurgency would mean .
7 . There Are Three Distinct Types of Terrorism in Iraq , All Directly or Indirectly Connected to the Occupation
Terrorism involves attacking civilians to force them to abandon their support for your enemy , or to drive them away from a coveted territory .
The original terrorists in Iraq were the military and civilian officials of the Bush administration -- starting with their " shock and awe " bombing campaign that destroyed Iraqi infrastructure in order to " undermine civilian morale . "
The American form of terrorism continued with the wholesale destruction of most of Falluja and parts of other Sunni cities , designed to pacify the " hot beds " of insurgency , while teaching the residents of those areas that , if they " harbor the insurgents , " they will surely " suffer the consequences . "
At the individual level , this program of terror was continued through the invasions of , and demolishing of , homes ( or , in some cases , parts of neighborhoods ) where insurgents were believed to be hidden among a larger civilian population , thus spreading the " lesson " about " harboring terrorists " to everyone in the Sunni sections of the country .
Generating a violent death rate of at least 18,000 per year , the American drumbeat of terror has contributed more than its share to the recently escalating civilian death toll , which reached a record 3,149 in the official count during July .
It is unfortunately accurate to characterize the American occupation of Sunni Iraq as a reign of terror .
The Sunni terrorists like those led by Abu Musab al - Zarqawi have utilized the suicide car bomb to generate the most widely publicized violence in Iraq -- hundreds of civilian casualties each month resulting from attacks on restaurants , markets , and mosques where large number of Shia congregate .
At the beginning of the U.S. occupation , car bombs were nonexistent ; they only became common when a tiny proportion of the Sunni resistance movement became convinced that the Shia were the main domestic support for the American occupation .
( As far as we can tell , the vast majority of those fighting the Americans oppose such terrorists and have sometimes fought with them . )
As al - Qaeda leader Ayman al - Zawahiri wrote , these attacks were justified by " the treason of the Shia and their collusion with the Americans . "
As if to prove him correct , the number of such attacks tripled to current levels of about 70 per month after the Shia - dominated Iraqi government supported the American devastation of Falluja in November 2004 .
The Sunni terrorists work with the same terrorist logic that the Americans have applied in Iraq : Attacks on civilians are meant to terrify them into not supporting the enemy .
There is a belief , of course , among the leadership of the Sunni terrorists that , ultimately , only the violent suppression or expulsion of the Shia is acceptable .
But as Zawahiri himself stated , the " majority of Muslims do n't comprehend this and possibly could not even imagine it . "
So the practical justification for such terrorism lies in the more immediate association of the Shia with the hated occupation .
The final link in the terrorist chain can also be traced back to the occupation .
In January of 2005 , Newsweek broke the story that the U.S. was establishing ( Shiite ) " death squads " within the Iraqi Ministry of Interior , modeled after the assassination teams that the CIA had helped organize in El Salvador during the 1980s .
These death squads were intended to assassinate activists and supporters of the Sunni resistance .
Particularly after the bombing of the Golden Dome , an important Shia shrine in Samarra , in March 2006 , they became a fixture in Baghdad , where thousands of corpses -- virtually all Sunni men -- have been found with signs of torture , including electric - drill holes , in their bodies and bullet holes in their heads .
Here , again , the logic is the same : to use terror to stop the Sunni community from nurturing and harboring both the terrorist car bombers and the anti-American resistance fighters .
While there is disagreement about whether the Americans , the Shia - controlled Iraqi Ministry of Defense , or the Shia political parties should shoulder the most responsibility for loosing these death squads on Baghdad , one conclusion is indisputable :
They have earned their place in the ignominious triumvirate of Iraqi terrorism .
One might say that the war has converted one of President Bush 's biggest lies into an unimaginably horrible truth : Iraq is now the epicenter of worldwide terrorism .
Where the 7 Facts Lead
With this terror triumvirate at the center of Iraqi society , we now enter the horrible era of ethnic cleansing , the logical extension of multidimensional terror .
When the U.S. toppled the Hussein regime , there was little sectarian sentiment outside of Kurdistan , which had longstanding nationalist ambitions .
Even today , opinion polls show that more than two - thirds of Sunnis and Shia stand opposed to the idea of any further weakening of the central government and are not in favor of federation , no less dividing Iraq into three separate nations .
Nevertheless , ethnic cleansing by both Shia and Sunni has become the order of the day in many of the neighborhoods of Baghdad , replete with house burnings , physical assaults , torture , and murder , all directed against those who resist leaving their homes .
These acts are aimed at creating religiously homogeneous neighborhoods .
This is a terrifying development that derives from the rising tide of terrorism .
Sunnis believe that they must expel their Shia neighbors to stop them from giving the Shiite death squads the names of resistance fighters and their supporters .
Shia believe that they must expel their Sunni neighbors to stop them from providing information and cover for car - bombing attacks .
And , as the situation matures , militants on both sides come to embrace removal -- period .
As these actions escalate , feeding on each other , more and more individuals , caught in a vise of fear and bent on revenge , embrace the infernal logic of terrorism : that it is acceptable to punish everyone for the actions of a tiny minority .
There is still some hope for the Iraqis to recover their equilibrium .
All the centripetal forces in Iraq derive from the American occupation , and might still be sufficiently reduced by an American departure followed by a viable reconstruction program embraced by the key elements inside of Iraq .
But if the occupation continues , there will certainly come a point -- perhaps already passed -- when the collapse of government legitimacy , the destruction wrought by the war , and the horror of terrorist violence become self - sustaining .
If that point is reached , all parties will enter a new territory with incalculable consequences .
