I could come up with an architecture idea - such as speeding up the processor five times - but other engineers designed the chips .
I felt it was n't critical for me to be there , even though I loved Apple .
I was working in the Apple II division after the Apple III project was closed , so the engineers from that department just gravitated around me .
It was fun .
And there were cool people with cool projects starting in my building .
On the next floor down from me they were finishing up the Apple IIc .
This was as small as today 's laptops except it plugged it into a wall .
I thought it was a beautiful computer , my favourite one to this day .
One of the engineers was Joe Ennis , the kind of guy I love who 's so enthusiastic and passionate about the products he 's working on and where they can go and what he could do with them .
He had great ideas about extending the Apple II into areas far beyond anything even the Macintosh people talked about .
He thought you could have an Apple II programmed to be a complete telephone switchboard .
Today , switchboards are cards you plug into a computer .
He imagined storing voices digitally and you could route them to other channels .
I HAD this nice home up in the Santa Cruz Mountains with high - end audio and video equipment .
By that time TV sets and VCRs had remote controls .
I had laser discs , so I had a remote control for that too .
I had an expensive hi-fi system from Bang & Olufsen with a remote .
That was rare .
I got a satellite TV through a friend , Chuck Colby , who was building custom dishes for people .
But man , there it was .
Another remote control .
So I would turn on the TV with one remote and maybe I 'd turn on the hi-fi with another , and then I would press buttons for the satellite channel and I turned on my VCR to pass a signal through it .
I am sitting in bed operating all of this equipment with different remotes .
It was crazy .
I wanted one remote with one button programmed for all my devices .
A single button to sequentially emit many infra-red codes corresponding to buttons on other remotes .
That meant that the buttons on my control were like macros ; exactly like a program .
I realised that soon people would need more remote controls and it would become a problem , like it was for me .
I talked to a few people about this idea and I got excited because I realised how easy it was to build .
A little microprocessor looks at the codes coming in , stores the data , and outputs the same codes when you press the buttons .
And I thought , I 'm the one to do it .
And I really did become the first person in the world to do what is now known as a universal remote control .
I built a programming language into the remote , a beautiful language I was proud of .
I was still at Apple when I got this idea .
And I started telling people like Joe Ennis about it .
I pitched real heavily to Joe the whole idea of " Let 's leave Apple and start this company " .
I never felt like I was turning my back on my own company .
Apple was a large company , and it was n't and still is n't the love in my life .
The love in my life is starting small companies with small groups of friends .
Bringing new ideas out and trying to build them .
I was heading up a new Apple II that was supposed to be better than anything , called the Apple II X .
But shortly after we started , upper Apple management canned it .
That was probably a decent decision .
They were used to products that sold 20,000 a month , and a high - end product like the Apple II X , because it would be so expensive , probably would n't sell more than 2000 a month .
The Apple II GS , with 24 - bit colour and real sound ( not just chirps ) , was born out of the Apple II X .
You could do interesting things like games and software for kids who needed that level of production to be engaged .
I was so happy to see that we got a project that all of a sudden brought the Apple II into where it really needed to be .
But there were morale problems in my group as a result of the people in the Apple II group feeling undervalued compared with the Macintosh group , which was in development .
And I was ready for something new .
I decided to start a company to build the remote control .
Joe and my assistant , Laura Roebuck , she 'd just had a baby and wanted to work part - time , both wanted to do it .
I called my boss ' boss , Wayne Rosing , in the Apple II division , to tell him I was leaving .
I did n't call Steve ( Jobs ) or ( Apple co-founder ) Mike Markkula or anyone on the board .
I had a job in engineering and I felt like I just had to tell someone I reported to so they would know .
I sat them down and sketched out my idea .
It would not compete with Apple .
I left within about a week ( the letter of release wished me well ) but I stayed on the payroll as an Apple employee .
I am to this day .
I just have the lowest salary a full - time employee can have .
I still represent Apple at computer clubs this way .
Steve probably heard I was leaving the day a piece came out in The Wall Street Journal .
But the piece got it all wrong .
The reporter called me the day I was leaving and said : " I understand you 're starting a new company ? "
I told him yeah , and he asked me what it was all about .
And I told him .
He asked me : " Are there any things that you are n't happy about at Apple ? "
And I told him the truth .
I told him yes , and then I stood up for the people I was working with who were offended by the lack of respect they received .
At the time , the people in the Apple II group were treated as very unimportant by the rest of the company .
This despite the fact that the Apple II was by far the largest - selling product in our company and would be for years .
It had only just recently been overtaken as No. 1 in the world by the IBM PC , which had connections in the business world that we did n't have .
If you worked in the Apple II division , you could n't get the money or parts you needed in the same way you could if you worked in the new Macintosh division .
That was n't fair .
Also , there were limitations on the Apple II in terms of taking advantage of new advances in technology .
So I made some comments like this , and then the reporter asked : " So that 's the reason you 're leaving ? "
And I said : " Oh no , that 's not the reason .
I 'm leaving because I want to do this remote control . "
But The Wall Street Journal printed the article suggesting I was mad at Apple and that was the reason I was leaving .
It was very wrong because I went out of my way to tell the reporter not to get it confused .
Maybe it was more interesting to shape the story the way they did .
I have to think it was an accident , but it 's been picked up by every book and every bit of history .
Everyone in the world ended up thinking I left because I was mad at Apple .
The only reason I left my day - job at Apple is that I was enthusiastic about the idea of doing this new neat project that had never been done before .
If I had n't had the remote control idea , I would have stayed , but this was such a cool idea .
And we got moving pretty quickly .
OUR first thoughts were where to locate .
I lived on Summit Road in the Santa Cruz mountains .
Up there at the summit were two restaurants , the Summit Inn and the Cloud 9 .
I knew that the Cloud 9 was closing so I suggested it as a site .
We settled on CL 9 as the name of the new company .
Maybe two weeks after that , we got an office in this older part of Los Gatos , the town where I lived .
It felt just like the early Apple days , so exciting .
We were building something no one else had thought of yet .
Today it 's more obvious but not back then .
The first thing we did was meet with companies that sold components we would need : infra-red sensors and transmitters and microprocessors .
We looked over the data sheets .
We got together an idea but it was n't a design you could breadboard .
This was exactly what I did with the Apple II .
A problem we had to tackle was how do you receive infra-red signals in the remote ?
We did n't have that much expertise .
We hired a consulting firm to help us read an infra-red signal .
They designed an intricate circuit with a lot of parts .
I said : " If you 're close and it 's powerful , then why can't you just detect it with a lot simpler circuitry ? "
Just go straight to a photo transistor , which senses light instead of electronic signals .
And they came up with a very good circuit that worked reliably .
You could play your remote control into our little receiver device and it would capture the signal .
It determined how many microseconds the infra-red signal was on and off .
Then it traced the signal and made a time recording .
The time came for us to come up with a plastics design .
We went to design companies to see if they would show us some samples .
One of those companies was Frog Design , which had done the Macintosh , and they said : " Sure , we do third - party development for people other than Apple . "
They said they 'd design for anyone .
We told them what we wanted , and they did it up in a few models .
Steve Jobs was over at Frog and saw a CL 9 prototype .
From what I heard , he threw it against a wall and put it in a box and said , " Send it to him . "
As if Apple owned it .
The Frog guy told me that Steve told him they could n't do any work for us because Apple " owned " Frog .
Not true , and everyone knew it .
But Frog told us they felt uncomfortable doing it without Apple 's permission .
I thought , good , fine .
We 'll go somewhere else .
I ended up choosing two processors for the device - the first remote control with a dual processor .
One microprocessor for small tasks like reading the keyboard and keeping time , and another to do the heavy - duty work .
The larger processor was an updated version of the old MOS 6502 used on the Apple I .
The other was a smaller , cheaper ( 50 cents each ) , 4 - bit processor .
Man , was it hard to control .
Nothing was built into the hardware , and when you do n't have the resources , you take advantage of what 's inside the chip .
The program kept the time , monitored the keyboard , ran the LCD , and gave power to some of the circuit .
And it communicated with the bigger , 8 - bit microprocessor .
And the LCD connected to the same 4 - bit microprocessor chip that was reading the keyboard .
The real guts of our product - memorising all these infra-red codes and repeating them when you pressed buttons - was done by the second , more powerful microprocessor .
We designed our board so you could connect an Apple IIc to it and type data on the screen , although the remote control was the computer , like a cousin to the Apple II .
The Apple 's mini-assembler and other tools were useful in developing the remote control .
Just after we hired the firm Selectron to make the device , I got a call one day from a venture capitalist in England who I had sold some Apple stock to before the company went public .
His venture capital company made a tonne of money on the London market as a result .
I told him all about this new company , and he said : " Can I visit you ? "
I described what we were doing and he immediately said he wanted to invest .
I told him I was n't taking any money , but he begged .
When people beg to be a part of something , I give in .
Then I had another big investment from the big Silicon Valley venture firm New Enterprise Associates , which did 3Com , Adaptec , and Silicon Graphics .
This guy from England had brought his friends in .
So we had 2 or 3 million dollars .
I asked an old friend from Commodore , Sam Bernstein , to be president .
We kept CL 9 in business for about three years .
But I had two small children so it was hard making sure I had enough time to devote to them .
And my relationship with my wife , Candi , was getting rocky .
We fought about how to raise the children , and we were talking separation .
So I went to Hawaii and I set up my little Apple IIc so I could start typing the new ( 8 - bit remote control ) program in .
I thought solitude would help me finish the project .
But I did n't do a single thing that week .
I sat there looking out my window and watching whales every day .
I stayed for four weeks and did not writes a single bit of code .
I just enjoyed being there .
I thought there are a lot of engineers in the world and I 've got kids .
So we hired another programmer to do that job .
I wanted more time with my children .
THE PRODUCTS people credit with bringing Apple back to life - the iPods and the iMacs - were being deigned by Jonathan Ives back when Apple was in trouble .
But the way Steve Jobs presented those new products was amazing .
So when the iPod came out , I was excited .
It was expensive but that was the way to do it .
Steve is great at choosing the right technologies , the new ones that will succeed .
And the iPod had iTunes , software that treated your computer as the centre of things where all the music is stored .
The iPod is a satellite .
And that was perfect .
And it makes so much sense that Apple was the one to come up with it .
Apple 's history is making both the hardware and the software with the result that the two work better together .
I 'm proud because Apple turned around in line with our early values about design - so excellent that people would drool over the idea of having that product .
Those values were about an emotional feeling - a feeling of fun .
Like the way we decided to have colour on the Apple II .
I 'm so proud that Apple is back doing important things .
If you 're as lucky as I 've been , then you 'll get to live in a time when you 're young just as a revolution is about to take off .
I was there to see and build the first personal computers .

NEXT LESSONS
My advice has to do with what you do when you find yourself sitting there with ideas in your head and a desire to build them .
But you 're young .
You have no money .
Those ideas are what drive you , they 're all you think about .
But there 's a big difference between just thinking about inventing something and doing it .
So how do you do it ?
How do you actually set about changing the world ?
· Believe in yourself .
Do n't waver .
· A revolutionary new product wo n't be understandable to most people .
Do n't let these people bring you down .
They only know what they 're exposed to .
It 's a type of prejudice against the spirit of invention .
Trust your intuition , that way lies happiness .
· See things in " grey scale " .
· Do n't follow the crowd .
Do a factual study .
Do n't waste time supporting a bad idea .
Keep your ego out of the equation .
· Work alone .
· Don't work in a corporate environment where products are designed by committee .

* Wozniak received a BS in computer science from UC Berkeley in 1986 ( he left in 1975 ) under the name " Rocky Raccoon Clark " .
In the two years between crashing his light aircraft in 1981 and returning to Apple , he re-entered the university 's undergraduate program , married Candi Clark ( his second ) , and sponsored two loss - making music festivals .
Goodling quickly won Comstock ’s trust for her hard work and talent for digging up information on tort litigation and judicial nominations .
And when Griffin left in 2001 , Goodling became Comstock ’s deputy .
They helped prepare Ashcroft and Theodore Olson for their confirmation hearings to be attorney general and solicitor general , respectively .
When Comstock became Ashcroft ’s spokeswoman in 2002 , she brought Goodling along as her deputy .
Goodling stayed for three years .
In no time , Goodling became “ indispensable ” to the office , says Corallo , who became Ashcroft ’s spokesman in 2003 .
“ I have never known anybody that works harder or does better work than her . ”
Her dedication was legendary , so much so that Ashcroft ’s office would ask to “ borrow ” her for projects .
Corallo says Goodling would stay all night .
“ I ’d come in at 8 a.m. , and she ’d be sleeping on my sofa in the office . ”
Goodling often traveled with Ashcroft on tours promoting neighborhood safety and the Patriot Act.
Former colleagues say Ashcroft also had a particular taste for Goodling ’s brownies .
She was meticulous and a perfectionist .
She was the point person on judicial nominations , often working in the Office of Legal Policy with then - Assistant Attorney General Viet Dinh , says a former colleague .
And just to reiterate why I 'm so suspicious about Monica Goodling 's personal involvement in politicizing the DOJ , let 's look at precisely the questions Schumer asked Kyle Sampson during his Senate Judiciary testimony :
SCHUMER : Thank you .
OK .
Are you aware of whether anyone at DOJ who has -- whether anyone at DOJ has asked applicants for career positions , not political positions , line positions -- questions about any of the following : their support for the president ?
SAMPSON : I 'm not aware of that .
SCHUMER : How they voted in any election ?
SAMPSON : I do n't remember .
I did not participate in career hires .
And I 'm not aware of people doing that .
SCHUMER : You 're not aware -- that 's my question :
Were you aware of anyone doing that ?
SAMPSON : Let me be precise .
I do n't remember ever being aware of anything like that .
SCHUMER : OK -- whether they were registered Democrats or Republicans ?
SAMPSON : I do n't remember being aware of anything like that .
SCHUMER : OK -- and what their political leanings were ?
SAMPSON : I do n't remember anything -- I do n't remember anything like that .
SCHUMER : OK .
So you have no knowledge if such questions were ever asked of line - level assistant U.S. attorney applicants ?
SAMPSON : Senator , I do n't have any recollection of anything like that .
I was not -- did not participate in the hiring of assistant U.S. attorneys .
SCHUMER : Would it be appropriate to ask such questions ?
SAMPSON : I understand that assistant U.S. attorneys are career employees , and so it would not be appropriate .
SCHUMER : Thank you .
Let me just ask you a couple more on this .
Did you know whether Ms. Goodling or anyone else asked such questions ?
Well , let 's ask -- Ms. Goodling -- so you have no knowledge that Ms. Goodling asked such questions of such people ?
SAMPSON : Of career ...
SCHUMER : Career , correct .
SAMPSON : ... applicants --
I do n't remember any questions like that , that she would ask .
[ my emphasis ]
Koubi layered his deception so thick that his subjects never knew exactly when their interrogation ended .
After questioning , captives usually spent time in a regular prison .
The Israelis had bugged the prison with a system that was disguised well enough to appear hidden but not well enough to avoid discovery .
In this way prisoners were led to believe that only certain parts of the prison were bugged .
In fact , all of the prison was bugged .
Conversations between prisoners could be overheard anywhere , and were closely monitored .
They were an invaluable source of intelligence .
Prisoners who could hold out through the most intense interrogation often let their guard down later when talking to comrades in jail .
To help such inadvertent confessions along , Koubi had yet another card to play .
Whenever an interrogated subject was released to the general prison , after weeks of often grueling questioning , he was received with open arms by fellow Palestinians who befriended him and congratulated him for having endured interrogation .
He was treated like a hero .
He was fed , nursed , even celebrated .
What he did n't know was that his happy new comrades were working for Koubi .
Koubi calls them " birdies . "
They were Palestinians who , offered an incentive such as an opportunity to settle with their families in another country , had agreed to cooperate with Shabak .
Some days or weeks after welcoming the new prisoner into their ranks , easing his transition into the prison , they would begin to ask questions .
They would debrief the prisoner on his interrogation sessions .
They would say , " It is very important for those on the outside to know what you told the Israelis and what you did n't tell them .
Tell us , and we will get the information to those on the outside who need to know . "
Even prisoners who had managed to keep important secrets from Koubi spilled them to his birdies .
" The amazing thing is that by now the existence of the birdies is well known , " Koubi says , " and yet the system still works .
People come out of interrogation , go into the regular prison , and then tell their darkest secrets .
I do n't know why it still works , but it does . "
Big Daddy Uptown
Most professional interrogators work without the latitude given the CIA , the FBI , or the military in the war on terror .
A policeman 's subjects all have to be read their Miranda rights , and cops who physically threaten or abuse suspects — at least nowadays — may find themselves in jail .
Jerry Giorgio , the legendary NYPD interrogator , has operated within these rules for nearly forty years .
He may not know all the names of the CIA and military techniques , but he has probably seen most of them at work .
Known as " Big Daddy Uptown , " Giorgio now works for the New York County district attorney in a cramped office in Lower Manhattan that he shares with two others .
He is a big man with a big voice , thinning gray hair , a broad belly , and wide , searching greenish - brown eyes .
He is considered a wizard by his former colleagues in the NYPD .
" All of us of a certain generation came out of the Jerry Giorgio school of interrogation , " says John Bourges , a recently retired Manhattan homicide detective .
" Everybody knows the Good Cop / Bad Cop routine , right ? " Giorgio says .
" Well , I 'm always the Good Cop .
I do n't work with a Bad Cop , either .
Do n't need it .
You want to know the truth ?
The truth is — and this is important — everybody down deep wants to tell his or her story .
It 's true .
No matter how damaging it is to them , no matter how important it is for them to keep quiet , they want to tell their story .
If they feel guilty , they want to get it off their chest .
If they feel justified in what they did , they want to explain themselves .
I tell them , ' Hey , I know what you did and I can prove it .
Now what are you going to do about it ?
If you show remorse , if you help me out , I 'll go to bat for you . '
I tell them that .
And if you give them half a reason to do it , they 'll tell you everything . "
The most important thing is to get them talking .
The toughest suspects are those who clam up and demand a lawyer right at the start .
Giorgio believes that once he gets a suspect talking , the stream of words will eventually flow right to the truth .
One murderer gave him three voluntary statements in a single day , each one signed , each one different , each one slightly closer to the truth .
The murderer was Carlos Martinez , a hulking former football player who in May of 1992 killed his girlfriend , Cheryl Maria Wright , and dumped her body in New York , right at the Coliseum overlook off the Henry Hudson Parkway .
Since many young female murder victims are killed by their boyfriends , Giorgio started looking for Wright's .
Martinez phoned Giorgio when he heard that the detective wanted to ask him some questions .
Giorgio had pictures of Wright with Martinez , and in all the pictures the young beau had a giant head of Jheri curls .
But he showed up in Giorgio 's office bald .
The detective was immediately more suspicious ; a man who worries that somebody might have seen him commit a crime generally tries to alter his appearance .
Here is how Giorgio summarizes what turned out to be a very long and fruitful conversation :
" I was at home last night , " Martinez said .
" She did call me . "
" Really , why ? "
" She wanted me to pick her up .
I told her , ' I 'm watching the Mets game ; I can't pick you up . ' "
That was it .
Giorgio acted very pleased with this statement , thanked Martinez , wrote it up , and asked the young man to sign it .
Martinez did .
Then Giorgio stared at the statement and gave Martinez a quizzical look .
" You know , Carlos , something about this statement does n't look right to me .
You two had been going out for , what ?
Seven years ?
She calls you and asks you to pick her up at night where she 's just gotten off work .
It 's not a safe neighborhood , and you tell her no ?
You mean a ball game on TV was more important to you ? "
The question was cunning .
The detective knew that Martinez was trying to make a good impression ; he definitely did n't want to leave Giorgio with any unresolved issues to play in his mind .
So it concerned him that his first statement did n't sound right .
Giorgio's question also touched Martinez 's sense of chivalry , an important quality for many Hispanic men .
It would n't do to be seen as ungentlemanly .
Here was a young woman who had just been brutally killed .
How would it look to her family and friends if he admitted that she had called and asked him for a ride and he had left her to her fate — for a ball game on TV ?
The question also subtly suggested an out :
The neighborhood was n't safe .
People got hurt or killed in that neighborhood all the time .
Maybe Martinez could admit that he had seen Cheryl on the night of the murder without directly implicating himself .
No one ever accused the former footballer of being especially bright .
He rose to Giorgio 's bait immediately .
He said , " Jerry , let me tell you what really happened . "
( " Note , " Giorgio says proudly , " already I'm Jerry ! " )
Martinez now said that he had left his place to pick Wright up after work , but they had gotten into an argument .
" She got mad at me and told me she did n't need a ride , so I waited until she got on the bus , and then I left . "
( " Look , now he 's the picture of chivalry ! " Giorgio says happily . )
" Let me take that down , " Giorgio said , again acting pleased with the statement .
He wrote it out neatly and asked Martinez to look it over and sign it .
Martinez did .
Again Giorgio squinted at the paper .
" You know , Carlos , something is still not right here .
Cheryl was a strikingly beautiful girl .
People who saw her remembered her .
She 's taken that bus home from work many nights , and people on that bus know who she is .
And you know what ?
Nobody who rode that bus saw her on it last night . "
( This was , in Giorgio 's words , " pure bullshit . "
He had n't talked to anybody who rode that bus .
" Sometimes you have to just take a chance , " he says . )
Again Martinez looked troubled .
He had not allayed the detective 's suspicions .
So he tried again .
" Okay , okay , " he said .
" This is really it .
Let me tell you what really happened .
Cheryl called , and I left to pick her up , but I ran into a friend of mine — I can't tell you his name — and we picked her up together .
Then Cheryl and I got in this argument , a big fight .
My friend got fed up .
So we drove away , up Broadway to 181st Street , and stopped at the McDonald 's there .
He pulled out a gun , my friend , and he told me to get out of the car .
' Wait here , ' he told me .
' I 'm going to get rid of your problem . '
Then he left .
I waited .
Then he came back .
He said he had gotten rid of my problem . "
Giorgio nodded happily and started to write up statement No. 3 .
He acted troubled over the fact that Martinez refused to name the friend , and the young man quickly coughed up a name .
Giorgio's lieutenant , who had been watching the session through a one - way mirror , immediately got to work tracking down Martinez 's friend .
By the time the third statement had been written up , signed , and nestled neatly on top of the other two , Giorgio had a new problem to pose to Martinez : it seemed that his friend was in South Carolina , and had been for some time .
" We never did get to finish the fourth statement , " Giorgio says .
" Martinez 's family had hired a lawyer , and he called the station forbidding us to further question his client . "
It was , of course , too late .
Captain Crunch Versus the Tree Huggers
On a spring morning in the offices of Amnesty International , in Washington , D.C. , Alistair Hodgett and Alexandra Arriaga were briefing me on their organization 's noble efforts to combat torture wherever in the world it is found .
They are bright , pleasant , smart , committed , attractive young people , filled with righteous purpose .
Decent people everywhere agree on this : torture is evil and indefensible .
But is it always ?
I showed the two an article I had torn from that day 's New York Times , which described the controversy over a tragic kidnapping case in Frankfurt , Germany .
On September 27 of last year a Frankfurt law student kidnapped an eleven - year - old boy named Jakob von Metzler , whose smiling face appeared in a box alongside the story .
The kidnapper had covered Jakob 's mouth and nose with duct tape , wrapped the boy in plastic , and hidden him in a wooded area near a lake .
The police captured the suspect when he tried to pick up ransom money , but the suspect would n't reveal where he had left the boy , who the police thought might still be alive .
So the deputy police chief of Frankfurt , Wolfgang Daschner , told his subordinates to threaten the suspect with torture .
According to the suspect , he was told that a " specialist " was being flown in who would " inflict pain on me of the sort I had never experienced . "
The suspect promptly told the police where he'd hidden Jakob , who , sadly , was found dead .
The newspaper said that Daschner was under fire from Amnesty International , among other groups , for threatening torture .
" Under these circumstances , " I asked , " do you honestly think it was wrong to even threaten torture ? "
Hodgett and Arriaga squirmed in their chairs .
" We recognize that there are difficult situations , " said Arriaga , who is the group 's director of government relations .
" But we are opposed to torture under any and all circumstances , and threatening torture is inflicting mental pain .
So we would be against it . "
Few moral imperatives make such sense on a large scale but break down so dramatically in the particular .
A way of sorting this one out is to consider two clashing sensibilities : the warrior and the civilian .
The civilian sensibility prizes above all else the rule of law .
Whatever the difficulties posed by a particular situation , such as trying to find poor Jakob von Metzler before he suffocated , it sees abusive government power as a greater danger to society .
Allowing an exception in one case ( saving Jakob ) would open the door to a greater evil .
The warrior sensibility requires doing what must be done to complete a mission .
By definition , war exists because civil means have failed .
What counts is winning , and preserving one 's own troops .
To a field commander in a combat zone , the life of an uncooperative enemy captive weighs very lightly against the lives of his own men .
There are very few who , faced with a reluctant captive , would not in certain circumstances reach for the alligator clips , or something else .
" It is n't about getting mad , or payback , " says Bill Cowan , the Vietnam interrogator .
" It 's strictly business .
Torturing people does n't fit my moral compass at all .
But I do n't think there 's much of a gray area .
Either the guy has information you need or not .
Either it 's vital or it's not .
You know which guys you need to twist . "
The official statements by President Bush and William Haynes reaffirming the U.S. government 's opposition to torture have been applauded by human - rights groups — but again , the language in them is carefully chosen .
What does the Bush Administration mean by " torture " ?
Does it really share the activists ' all - inclusive definition of the word ?
In his letter to the director of Human Rights Watch , Haynes used the term " enemy combatants " to describe those in custody .
Calling detainees " prisoners of war " would entitle them to the protections of the Geneva Convention , which prohibits the " physical or mental torture " of POWs , and " any other form of coercion , " even to the extent of " unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind . "
( In the contemptuous words of one military man , they " prohibit everything except three square meals , a warm bed , and access to a Harvard education . " )
Detainees who are American citizens have the advantage of constitutional protections against being held without charges , and have the right to legal counsel .
They would also be protected from the worst abuses by the Eighth Amendment , which prohibits " cruel and unusual punishment . "
The one detainee at Guantánamo who was discovered to have been born in the United States has been transferred to a different facility , and legal battles rage over his status .
But if the rest of the thousands of detainees are neither POWs ( even though the bulk of them were captured during the fighting in Afghanistan ) nor American citizens , they are fair game .
They are protected only by this country 's international promises — which are , in effect , unenforceable .
What are those promises ?
The most venerable are those in the Geneva Convention , but the United States has sidestepped this agreement in the case of those captured in the war on terror .
The next most important would be those in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which asserts , in Article 5 , " No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment . "
There is also the Convention Against Torture , the agreement cited by Bush in June , which would seem to rule out any of the more aggressive methods of interrogation .
It states , in Article I , " For the purposes of this Convention , torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental , is intentionally inflicted on a person . "
Again , note the word " severe . "
The United States is avoiding the brand " torturer " only by sleight of word .
The history of interrogation by U.S. armed forces and spy agencies is one of giving lip service to international agreements while vigorously using coercion whenever circumstances seem to warrant it .
However , both the Army and the CIA have been frank in their publications about the use of coercive methods .
The Kubark Manual offers only a few nods in its 128 pages to qualms over what are referred to , in a rare euphemism , as " external techniques " : " Moral considerations aside , the imposition of external techniques of manipulating people carries with it the grave risk of later lawsuits , adverse publicity , or other attempts to strike back . "
The use of the term " strike back " here is significant ; it implies that criticism of such unseemly methods , whether legal , moral , or journalistic , would have no inherent validity but would be viewed as an enemy counterattack .
Bill Wagner , the former CIA agent , remembers going to the Agency 's three - week interrogation course at " The Farm , " in Williamsburg , Virginia , in 1970 .
Until it was shut down , a few years later , it was considered the Agency 's " premier course , " Wagner says , and only the best recruits were invited to take it .
" To say you had been through it was a real feather in your cap . "
Volunteers played the role of captives in return for guaranteed space in a future session of the coveted course .
They were deprived of sleep , kept doused with water in cold rooms , forced to sit or stand in uncomfortable positions for long periods , isolated from sunlight and social contacts , given food deliberately made unappetizing ( oversalted , for instance , or tainted with a green dye ) , and subjected to mock executions .
At least 10 percent of the volunteers dropped out , even though they knew it was just a training exercise .
Wagner says that many of those who had served as victims later refused to take the course and victimize others .
" They lost their stomach for it , " he says .
Several years after Wagner took the course , he says , the Agency dropped it entirely .
The scandals of the Nixon years put the CIA under unprecedented scrutiny .
Over the next three decades spying schools and most human - intelligence networks were gradually dismantled .
The United States itself was losing its stomach for hands - on intelligence gathering — and with it , interrogation .
Nobody experienced the effects of this shift more dramatically than Keith Hall , who earned the nickname Captain Crunch before he lost his job as a CIA agent .
Now he describes himself as " a poster child for political correctness . "
He is a pugnacious brick of a man , who at age fifty - two is just a thicker ( especially in the middle ) version of the young man who joined the Marines thirty years ago .
After his discharge he earned a master 's degree in history and international relations ; he took a job as a police officer , because he craved a more physical brand of excitement than academia had to offer .
His nickname comes from this craving .
The CIA hired Hall immediately after he applied , in 1979 , because of his relatively rare combination of academic and real - world credentials .
He was routed into the Investigation and Analysis Directorate , where he became one of the Agency 's covert operators , a relatively small group ( " about forty - eight guys , total , " Hall says ) known as the " knuckle - draggers . "
Most CIA agents , especially by the 1980s , were just deskmen .
Hall preferred traveling , training , and blowing things up , even though he felt that the rest of the Agency looked down its patrician nose at guys like him .
When the U.S. Embassy in Beirut was bombed , on April 18 , 1983 , eight of the seventeen Americans killed were CIA employees .
There were going to be plenty of official investigations , but the Agency wanted one of its own .
Hall was selected to carry it out .
" They flew me to Langley on one of their private planes , and delivered me to the seventh floor , " he says .
" They told me , ' We want you to go to Beirut and find out who blew up the embassy and how they did it .
The President himself is going to be reading your cables .
There is going to be some retribution here . ' "
Hall was honored , and excited .
This was a mission of singular purpose , of the highest priority , and he knew he was expected to get results .
Having been a police officer and a Marine , he knew that the official investigations had to build a case that might someday stand up in court .
His goal was not to build a case but just to find out who did it .
He slept on rooftops in Beirut , changing the location every two nights .
It was a dangerous time to be an American — especially a CIA officer — there , and Hall kept moving .
He worked with the Lebanese Special Security Force , and set up a computer in the police building .
Hall says he took part without hesitation in brutal questioning by the Lebanese , during which suspects were beaten with clubs and rubber hoses or wired up to electrical generators and doused with water .
Such methods eventually led him to the suspected " paymaster " of the embassy bombing , a man named Elias Nimr .
" He was our biggest catch , " Hall says — a man with powerful connections .
" When I told the Lebanese Minister of Defense , I watched the blood drain out of his face . "
Nimr was a fat , pampered - looking twenty - eight - year - old , used to living the good life , a young man of wealth , leisure , and power .
He came to the police building wearing slacks , a shiny sport shirt , and Gucci shoes .
He had a small , well - trimmed moustache at the center of his soft , round face , and wore gold on his neck , wrists , and fingers .
When he was marched into the building , Hall says , some of the officers " tried to melt into the shadows " for fear of eventual retribution .
Nimr was nonchalant and smirking in his initial interview , convinced that when word got back to his family and connections , he would promptly be released .
When Hall got a chance to talk to him , he set out to disabuse Nimr .
" I'm an American intelligence officer , " he said .
" You really did n't think that you were going to blow up our embassy and we would n't do anything about it , did you ?
You really should be looking inside yourself and telling yourself that it's a good idea to talk to me .
The best way to go is to be civilized ...
I know you think you are going to walk right out of here in a few minutes .
That 's not going to happen .
You 're mine .
I 'm the one who will make the decisions about what happens to you .
The only thing that will save your ass is to cooperate . "
Nimr smiled at him dismissively .
The next time they met , Nimr was n't in such good shape .
In this case his connections were failing him .
No one had roughed him up , but he had been kept standing for two days .
Hall placed him in a straight - backed metal chair , with hot floodlights in his face .
The agent sat behind the light , so that Nimr could n't see him .
Nimr was n't as cocky , but he was still silent .
At the third interrogation session , Hall says , he kicked Nimr out of his chair .
It was the first time anyone had physically abused him , and he seemed stunned .
He just stared at Hall .
He had n't eaten since his arrest , four days earlier .
But he still had nothing to say .
" I sent him back to his cell , had water poured over him again and again while he sat under a big fan , kept him freezing for about twenty - four hours .
He comes back after this , and you can see his mood is changing .
He has n't walked out of jail , and it 's beginning to dawn on him that no one is going to spring him . "
Over the next ten days
Hall kept up the pressure .
During the questioning sessions he again kicked Nimr out of his chair , and both he and the Lebanese captain involved cracked him occasionally across the shins with a wooden bat .
Finally Nimr broke .
According to Hall , he explained his role in the bombing , and in the assassination of Lebanon 's President .
He explained that Syrian intelligence agents had been behind the plan .
( Not everyone in the CIA agrees with Hall 's interpretation . )
Soon afterwards
Nimr died in his cell .
Hall was back in Washington when he heard the news .
He assumed that Nimr had been killed to prevent him from testifying and naming others involved in the plot .
Armed with tapes of Nimr 's confession , Hall felt he had accomplished his mission ; but several months after finishing his report he was fired .
As he understood it , word had leaked out about torture sessions conducted by a CIA agent , and the U.S. government was embarrassed .
None of the men charged was ever prosecuted for the bombing .
Hall believes that the United States may have paid dearly for backing away from his investigation and letting the matter drop .
William Buckley , who was Hall 's station chief , was subsequently kidnapped , tortured , and killed .
He was among fourteen Western civilians kidnapped in Beirut in 1984 .
In October of the previous year , 241 American servicemen were killed in the bombing of their barracks at the Beirut airport .
Some analysts believe that all these atrocities were committed by the same group , the one Hall believes he unearthed in his investigation .
Still bitter about it nineteen years later , Hall says , " No one was punished for it , except me ! "
Hall sees the loss of his career as dramatic proof that the CIA sold out to the " tree huggers " two decades ago , and points with scorn to a directive from President Bill Clinton that effectively barred intelligence agents from doing business with unsavory characters .
The full - scale U.S. retreat from the uglier side of espionage is well documented — but has , by all accounts , been sharply reversed in the aftermath of 9/11 .
" People are being very careful , very legal , and very sensible , " one former top intelligence official says .
" We are not inflicting intense pain , or doing anything damaging or life - threatening .
We are once again asking , ' How do you take people down a series of steps in such a way that it has an impact ? '
That 's the only game in town . "
Despite the hue and cry over mistreatment of prisoners at Guantánamo , two former Pakistani inmates there —
Shah Muhammad and Sahibzada Osman Ali — told me that except for some roughing up immediately after they were captured , they were not badly treated at Camp X - Ray .
They both felt bored , lonely , frustrated , angry , and helpless ( enough for Shah Muhammad to attempt suicide ) , but neither believed that he would be harmed by his American captors , and both regarded the extreme precautions ( shackles , handcuffs , hoods ) that so outraged the rest of the world as comical .
" What did the American soldiers think I could do to them ? " asked Sahibzada , who stands about five feet eight and weighs little more than 150 pounds .
Indeed , the lack of fear at Camp X - Ray no doubt made it more difficult to sort out foot soldiers from dedicated terrorists .
The perfect model of an interrogation center would be a place where prisoners lived in fear and uncertainty , a place where they could be isolated or allowed to mingle freely , as the jailer wished , and where conversations anywhere could be overheard .
Interrogators would be able to control the experience of their subjects completely , shutting down access to other people , or even to normal sensation and experience , or opening that access up .
Subjects ' lives could be made a misery of discomfort and confusion , or restored to an almost normal level of comfort and social interaction within the limitations of confinement .
Hope could be dangled or removed .
Cooperation would be rewarded , stubbornness punished .
Interrogators would have ever growing files on their subjects , with each new fact or revelation yielding new leads and more information — drawn from field investigations ( agents in the real world verifying and exploring facts gathered on the inside ) , the testimony of other subjects , collaborators spying inside the prison , and surreptitious recordings .
The interrogators in this center would have the experience and the intuition of a Jerry Giorgio or a Michael Koubi .
Serious interrogation is clearly being reserved for only the most dangerous men , like Sheikh Mohammed .
So why not lift the fig leaf covering the use of coercion ?
Why not eschew hypocrisy , clearly define what is meant by the word " severe , " and amend bans on torture to allow interrogators to coerce information from would - be terrorists ?
This is the crux of the problem .
It may be clear that coercion is sometimes the right choice , but how does one allow it yet still control it ?
Sadism is deeply rooted in the human psyche .
Every army has its share of soldiers who delight in kicking and beating bound captives .
Men in authority tend to abuse it — not all men , but many .
As a mass , they should be assumed to lean toward abuse .
How does a country best regulate behavior in its dark and distant corners , in prisons , on battlefields , and in interrogation rooms , particularly when its forces number in the millions and are spread all over the globe ?
In considering a change in national policy , one is obliged to anticipate the practical consequences .
So if we formally lift the ban on torture , even if only partially and in rare , specific cases ( the attorney and author Alan Dershowitz has proposed issuing " torture warrants " ) , the question will be , How can we ensure that the practice does not become commonplace — not just a tool for extracting vital , life - saving information in rare cases but a routine tool of oppression ?
As it happens , a pertinent case study exists .
Israel has been a target of terror attacks for many years , and has wrestled openly with the dilemmas they pose for a democracy .
In 1987 a commission led by the retired Israeli Supreme Court justice Moshe Landau wrote a series of recommendations for Michael Koubi and his agents , allowing them to use " moderate physical pressure " and " nonviolent psychological pressure " in interrogating prisoners who had information that could prevent impending terror attacks .
The commission sought to allow such coercion only in " ticking - bomb scenarios " — that is , in cases like the kidnapping of Jakob von Metzler , when the information withheld by the suspect could save lives .
Twelve years later the Israeli Supreme Court effectively revoked this permission , banning the use of any and all forms of torture .
In the years following the Landau Commission recommendations , the use of coercive methods had become widespread in the Occupied Territories .
It was estimated that more than two thirds of the Palestinians taken into custody were subjected to them .
Koubi says that only in rare instances , and with court permission , did he slap , pinch , or shake a prisoner — but he happens to be an especially gifted interrogator .
What about the hundreds of men who worked for him ?
Koubi could not be present for all those interrogations .
Every effort to regulate coercion failed .
In the abstract it was easy to imagine a ticking - bomb situation , and a suspect who clearly warranted rough treatment .
But in real life where was the line to be drawn ?
Should coercive methods be applied only to someone who knows of an immediately pending attack ?
What about one who might know of attacks planned for months or years in the future ?
" Assuming you get useful information from torture , then why not always use torture ? " asks Jessica Montell , the executive director of B'Tselem , a human - rights advocacy group in Jerusalem .
" Why stop at the bomb that 's already been planted and at people who know where the explosives are ?
Why not people who are building the explosives , or people who are donating money , or transferring the funds for the explosives ?
Why stop at the victim himself ?
Why not torture the victims ' families , their relatives , their neighbors ?
If the end justifies the means , then where would you draw the line ? "
And how does one define " coercion , " as opposed to " torture " ?
If making a man sit in a tiny chair that forces him to hang painfully by his bound hands when he slides forward is okay , then what about applying a little pressure to the base of his neck to aggravate that pain ?
When does shaking or pushing a prisoner , which can become violent enough to kill or seriously injure a man , cross the line from coercion to torture ?
Montell has thought about these questions a lot .
She is thirty - five , a slender woman with scruffy short brown hair , who seems in perpetual motion , directing B'Tselem and tending baby twins and a four - year - old at home .
Born in California , she emigrated to Israel partly out of feelings of solidarity with the Jewish state and partly because she found a job she liked in the human - rights field .
Raised with a kind of idealized notion of Israel , she now seems committed to making the country live up to her ideals .
But those ideals are hardheaded .
Although Montell and her organization have steadfastly opposed the use of coercion ( which she considers torture ) , she recognizes that the moral issue involved is not a simple one .
She knows that the use of coercion in interrogation did not end completely when the Israeli Supreme Court banned it in 1999 .
The difference is that when interrogators use " aggressive methods " now , they know they are breaking the law and could potentially be held responsible for doing so .
This acts as a deterrent , and tends to limit the use of coercion to only the most defensible situations .
" If I as an interrogator feel that the person in front of me has information that can prevent a catastrophe from happening , " she says , " I imagine that I would do what I would have to do in order to prevent that catastrophe from happening .
The state 's obligation is then to put me on trial , for breaking the law .
Then I come and say these are the facts that I had at my disposal .
This is what I believed at the time .
This is what I thought necessary to do .
I can evoke the defense of necessity , and then the court decides whether or not it 's reasonable that I broke the law in order to avert this catastrophe .
But it has to be that I broke the law .
It ca n't be that there 's some prior license for me to abuse people . "
In other words , when the ban is lifted , there is no restraining lazy , incompetent , or sadistic interrogators .
As long as it remains illegal to torture , the interrogator who employs coercion must accept the risk .
He must be prepared to stand up in court , if necessary , and defend his actions .
Interrogators will still use coercion because in some cases they will deem it worth the consequences .
This does not mean they will necessarily be punished .
In any nation the decision to prosecute a crime is an executive one .
A prosecutor , a grand jury , or a judge must decide to press charges , and the chances that an interrogator in a genuine ticking - bomb case would be prosecuted , much less convicted , is very small .
As of this writing , Wolfgang Daschner , the Frankfurt deputy police chief , has not been prosecuted for threatening to torture Jakob von Metzler 's kidnapper , even though he clearly broke the law .
The Bush Administration has adopted exactly the right posture on the matter .
Candor and consistency are not always public virtues .
Torture is a crime against humanity , but coercion is an issue that is rightly handled with a wink , or even a touch of hypocrisy ; it should be banned but also quietly practiced .
Those who protest coercive methods will exaggerate their horrors , which is good : it generates a useful climate of fear .
It is wise of the President to reiterate U.S. support for international agreements banning torture , and it is wise for American interrogators to employ whatever coercive methods work .
It is also smart not to discuss the matter with anyone .
If interrogators step over the line from coercion to outright torture , they should be held personally responsible .
But no interrogator is ever going to be prosecuted for keeping Khalid Sheikh Mohammed awake , cold , alone , and uncomfortable .
Nor should he be .
The climate debate is over , said US presidential candidate John McCain
Delegates agreed that developing countries would also have to meet targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions , as well as rich countries .
The informal meeting also agreed that a global market should be formed to cap and trade carbon dioxide emissions .
The non-binding declaration is seen as vital in influencing a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol , correspondents say .
The forum 's closing statement said man-made climate change was now " beyond doubt " .
" Climate change is a global issue and there is an obligation on us all to take action , in line with our capabilities and historic responsibilities , " said the statement from the Global Legislators Organisation for a Balanced Environment ( Globe ) .
' Tipping point '
The two - day meeting brought together legislators from countries including the Group of Eight rich nations , plus Brazil , China , India , Mexico and South Africa .
The BBC 's environment analyst Roger Harrabin was at the meeting and says that although the declaration carries no formal weight , it indicates a real change in mood .
The legislators agreed that developing countries had to face targets on greenhouse gas emissions , in the same way rich countries do .
They said they wanted a successor to the Kyoto Protocol - which expires in 2012 - in place by 2009 .
US senator Joe Lieberman forecast that the US Congress would enact a law on cutting emissions by the end of next year , possibly this year .
And presidential candidate John McCain , who is co-sponsoring climate legislation with Mr Lieberman , was emphatic on the need for new initiatives .
" I am convinced that we have reached the tipping point and that the Congress of the United States will act , with the agreement of the administration , " he told the forum .
But Dr John Holdren , the head of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) , said President George W Bush needed to appreciate that the US economy would not suffer unnecessarily if emission were capped .
" The economic damage from not addressing climate change is much larger than the economic cost of addressing it , " he said .
Meanwhile , the Canadian parliament moved to force the government to meet its Kyoto Protocol target for reducing emissions .
The ruling Conservative party argues that meeting the target , of reducing emissions by 6 % from 1990 levels by the period 2008 - 2012 , is impossible .
The parliamentary vote gives the government 60 days to formulate a plan for getting back on track .
With United Nations climate negotiations in December failing to agree a timetable for mandating new cuts in emissions when the current Kyoto targets expire in 2012 , the British - led Globe set up the Washington meeting in the hope of stimulating progress in a less formal setting .
The UN 's panel on climate change said earlier this month that higher global temperatures caused by man-made pollution would melt polar ice , worsen floods and droughts and cause more devastating storms .
Human beings are directly responsible for more than 110,000 chemical substances which have been generated since the Industrial Revolution .
Every year , we “ invent ” more than 2,000 new substances , most of them contaminants , which are emitted into the environment and which are consequently present in food , air , soil and water .
Nonetheless , human beings are also victims of these emissions , and involuntarily ( what is known in this scientific field as “ inadvertent exposure ” ) .
Every day humans ingest many of these substances which cannot be assimilated by our body , and are accumulated in the fatty parts of our tissues .
This is especially worrying for pregnant women .
During the gestation period , all the contaminants accumulated in the organism have direct access to the microenvironment where the embryo / foetus develops .
The doctoral thesis “ Maternal - child exposure via the placenta to environmental chemical substances with hormonal activity ” , written by María José López Espinosa , from the Department of Radiology and Physical Medicine of the University of Granada , analyzes the presence of organochlorine pesticides –normally used as pesticides - in the organisms of pregnant women .
The analysis was developed at San Cecilio University Hospital , in Granada , with 308 women who had given birth to healthy children between 2000 and 2002 .
The results are alarming : 100 % of these pregnant women had at least one pesticide in their placenta , but the average rate amounts to eight different kinds of chemical substances .
Fifteen different pesticides in the organisms of pregnant women
In her study , through the analysis of the placentas , López studied the presence of 17 endocrine disruptive organochlorine pesticides ( i.e. , pesticides which interfere with the proper performance of the hormonal system ) .
The results showed that the most frequent pesticides present in the placenta tissue are DDE ( 92.7 % ) , lindane ( 74.8 % ) , endosulfan diol ( 62.1 % ) y endosulfan - I ( 54.2 % ) .
Among these , the most prevalent was endosulfan - diol , with an average concentration of 4.15 nanograms per gram of placenta ( 156.73 ng/g lipid ) .
Surprisingly , the UGR researcher discovered that some patients ’ placentas contained 15 of the 17 pesticides analyzed .
A total of 668 samples from pregnant women were used in this study , which was approved by the Ethical Commission of San Cecilio University Hospital .
Mothers were informed of the study ’s goals before giving their express consent .
Thanks to gynaecologists , the nurses and the midwives who participated in the study , biological samples were extracted from the blood , the umbilical cord and the placenta during childbirth .
The following day , an epidemiological survey was carried out by trained survey statisticians .
The survey contained questions on the general data of the parents , their places of residence , profession , medical history , anthropometric information , age , tobacco habits , lifestyle and diet during pregnancy , among other factors .

The study made at the UGR has facilitated research into the association of the characteristics of parents , newborn babies and childbirth with exposure to pesticides found in the mothers ’ placenta .
Among the aspects associated with a higher presence of pesticides we find an older age , higher body mass index , less weight gained during pregnancy , lower educational level , higher workplace exposure , first - time motherhood and lower weight in babies .
“ Serious effects on the baby ”
According to María José López , “ we do not really know the consequences of exposure to disruptive pesticides in children , but we can predict that they may have serious effects , since this placenta exposure occurs at key moments of the embryo’s development ” .
The research group to which María José López belongs , directed by Prof.
Nicolás Olea Serrano , has conducted several studies which associate exposure to pesticides with neonatal malformations if the genito - urinary system , such as cryptorchidism ( undropped testicles ) and hypospadias ( total fusion of the urethral folds ) .
The UGR researcher underlines the fact that , in spite of “ inadvertent exposure ” , “ it is possible to control pesticide ingestion by means of a proper diet , which should be healthy and balanced , through consumption of food whose chemical content is low .
Moreover , daily exercise and the avoidance of tobacco ( which could also be a source of inadvertent exposure ) are very important habits which help to control the presence of pesticides in our organisms .
The UGR researcher ’s work is framed within the objectives established in the research project ” Increasing incidence of human male reproductive health disorders in relation to environmental effects on growth - and sex steroid - induced alterations in programmed development ” ( Environmental Reproductive Health ) , directed and carried out by a multidisciplinary group of clinicians , basic researchers and epidemiologists at several institutions from countries such as Denmark , Finland or England and financed by the European Union ( QLK4-1999-01422 ) .

Affidavit : $ 90,000 found in congressman 's freezer FBI wraps up search of Jefferson 's office in bribery probe A box of materials is loaded into a car after FBI agents searched Rep. William Jefferson 's office .
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) William Jefferson or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Federal agents searched the Capitol Hill office of a Louisiana congressman under investigation on bribery charges Sunday , while newly released court papers said agents found $ 90,000 in cash last year in his Washington home .
In a 95 - page affidavit used to obtain a warrant for the office search , investigators stated that an August 2005 search of Democratic Rep. William Jefferson 's home turned up the cash sum in a freezer .
The money was divided among various frozen food containers , according to the heavily redacted affidavit .
( Watch what Jefferson said about the ' hell ' of being investigated -- 4:47 )
Agents told a judge the money was part of a $ 100,000 payment that had been delivered by an informant in the bribery probe , which already has led to guilty pleas by a Kentucky businessman and a former Jefferson aide .
The Justice Department has been investigating Jefferson 's relationship to telecommunications deals in Africa and elsewhere , and the House Ethics Committee launched an investigation of him last week .
The eight - term congressman , whose district includes New Orleans and some of its suburbs , has denied any wrongdoing and vowed to remain in office to battle any criminal charges he may face .
But the affidavit states that investigators have collected evidence linking Jefferson to at least seven other cases in which he " sought things of value in return for his performance of official acts . "
Robert Trout , the congressman 's lawyer , decried the release of the affidavit .
In a statement issued Sunday night , he said it served " no legitimate investigative purpose . "
" This disclosure by the prosecutors is part of a public relations agenda and an obvious attempt to embarrass Congressman Jefferson , " Trout said .
" The affidavit itself is just one side of the story , which has not been tested in court . "
He said Jefferson would respond " at the appropriate time " if charged with any wrongdoing .
FBI agents searched Jefferson 's office in the Rayburn House Office Building from Saturday evening to early Sunday afternoon , bureau spokeswoman Debra Weierman said .
One government official told CNN the search marked the first time FBI agents have searched a lawmaker 's Capitol Hill office .
Weierman would not comment on what agents removed from Jefferson 's office .
But in the papers released Sunday , investigators stated they were searching for faxes , notes , telephone records and other forms of communication , as well as ledgers and computer files related to meetings and travel .
In an earlier statement , Trout called the search of Jefferson 's office " outrageous " and said it was not necessary .
" There were no exigent circumstances necessitating this action .
The government knew that the documents were being appropriately preserved while proper procedures were being followed .
We are dismayed by this action -- the documents were n't going anywhere and the prosecutors knew it , " he said .
However , a redacted copy of the search warrant and affidavit stated that federal investigators were unable to obtain the records relevant to the investigation inside Jefferson 's office and , " left with no other method , " proceeded with the search .
A government official close to the investigation told CNN the search was executed over the weekend when few people are on Capitol Hill because they believed that time would " be appropriate . "
Agents had previously searched Jefferson 's home in New Orleans .
The cash found in his Washington residence was part of a $ 100,000 payment delivered by a cooperating witness , according to the affidavit , which said the delivery was videotaped by the FBI .
The FBI began investigating Jefferson in March 2005 stemming from accusations made by the witness , a Virginia resident who owns an investment firm .
He told the FBI that he was " a victim of a fraud and bribery scheme " involving Jefferson ; Vernon Jackson , CEO of the Louisville , Kentucky - based company iGate ; and Brett Pfeffer , the president of the investment firm owned by the unnamed witness and a former Jefferson aide .
According to the affidavit , Jefferson had asked the witness for a percentage ownership interest in his Nigerian broadband company in exchange for the congressman " using his official acts to support the the Nigerian business venture . "
Guilty pleas Jackson pleaded guilty in federal court earlier this month to bribing the congressman with more than $ 400,000 in payments , company stock and a share of the profits in order to promote iGate 's high - tech business ventures in Africa .
( Full story ) Pfeffer , of Herndon , Virginia , pleaded guilty in January to aiding and abetting bribery of a public official .
Both have agreed to cooperate with authorities as part of their plea agreements .
The affidavit states Jefferson " attempted to use his position as a United States Congressman " to promote other iGate business ventures in Nigeria , Ghana and possibly other African nations .
" In exchange for his official acts supporting the proposed business ventures , " the affidavit said , Jefferson has received a 30 percent equity stake in the witness '
Nigerian company and more than $ 400,000 in payments from iGate .
The 30 percent equity , in the form of stocks , was placed in the name of a Nigerian limited liability corporation held by the congressman 's children , the affidavit said .
The cloud over Jefferson comes as Democratic leaders have been attacking what they call a " culture of corruption " surrounding the Republican leadership in Congress .
With midterm elections in November , Democrats are trying to highlight GOP ties to the influence - peddling investigation surrounding lobbyist Jack Abramoff , the indictment of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay in a Texas court , and last year 's guilty plea of California Rep.
Randy " Duke " Cunningham , now serving an eight - year stretch for taking bribes from defense contractors .
In a news conference last week , Jefferson said he was innocent and that he would remain in office while he fights any charges .
( Full story ) " I wish to say emphatically that in all of my actions that are here under scrutiny , that I have never intended to dishonor my office , or you , the public , and I certainly did not sell my office , " Jefferson told reporters .

Conyers worries about ' false testimony ' from Justice Department staff Michael Roston
Published : Friday May 25 , 2007 Print This Email This After Wednesday 's hearing with former Justice Department liaison Monica Goodling , House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers sought testimony in an open hearing with two Justice Department officials who he was concerned gave ' false ' testimony in prior settings .
" I am writing to formally request that you make available for testimony both Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty and Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General William Moschella , " the Michigan Democrat wrote to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
" Although we had requested informally that these officials testify even before yesterday 's hearing , the testimony of Monica Goodling has made it even more imperative that we hear from Mr. McNulty and Mr. Moschella about concerns that they testified falsely about the 2006 dismissal of U.S. Attorneys . "
In the Thursday hearing , Goodling suggested that these officials may not have been fully forthcoming with regard to their knowledge of certain matters related to the dismissal of the US Attorneys .
" I believe the Deputy was not fully candid about his knowledge of White House involvement in the replacement decision , failed to disclose that he had some knowledge of the White House 's interest in selecting Tim Griffin as interim US Attorney in the Eastern District of Arkansas , inaccurately described the Department 's internal assessment of the [ bipartisan commission that selects Attorneys in California ] , and failed to disclose that he had some knowledge of allegations that Tim Griffin had been involved in ' vote caging ' in the President 's 2004 campaign " Goodling said of McNulty in the Wednesday hearing .
She later added , " When I looked back on the testimony , I believed that there were a number of things that I did brief him on and that that information was n't fully -- was n't fully revealed . "
Goodling also detailed strategy sessions held at the Justice Department over the testimony of Moschella in February .
McNulty , the Deputy Attorney General , is set to resign from his position in the Justice Department this summer .
But he had earlier denied that he provided any inaccurate testimony .
" I testified truthfully at the Feb. 6 , 2007 , hearing based on what I knew at that time , " according to a statement printed by the New York Times .
" Ms. Goodling s characterization of my testimony is wrong and not supported by the extensive record of documents and testimony already provided to Congress . "
Thesis - driven investment is the process of making investments based on theories about the future .
The basic process is as follows
Make a prediction about the future based on economic , legal , technological , and social trends .
Figure out ways to create value based on the differences between the world today and the predicted future .
Invest in companies aligned with said world - view .
Having a better understanding of the future than everyone else is a great reason to invest .
It 's also a really lousy reason to start a company .
Do n't believe me ?
Ten years ago I bet you could 've told me that most people today would get their news online .
Almost anyone could have told you this .
Except of course for the newspaper owners themselves .
So why did n't you create Digg ?
Do n't get me wrong , a solid thesis is certainly non-trivial .
But its importance is dwarfed by another less tangible factor .
Our understanding of human nature .
How does understanding influence our design decisions ?
Allow me to explain through example .
Below is a list of three assumptions about human nature .
See if you can figure out which startup (s ) they go with .
Web traffic is constant .
Your website has the same number of viewers on Monday morning as on Sunday afternoon .
So the best way to decide which stories are the best is to divide the number of votes by the time elapsed .
The way people network in real life is as follows .
The more networked person gives their entire rolodex to the less networked person and says , " have at it ! "
We should design our business networking websites to reflect this reality .
Most couples meet in bars .
When you are walking down the street and you see a couple holding hands , there 's like a 98 % chance they met in a bar .
Because bars are so effective for meeting new people , our online dating sites should mirror the social atmosphere of a bar .
The problem with assumptions is that they 're usually correct .
For certain people , at a certain times , in certain places .
The danger is n't that you 'll sometimes be wrong .
The danger is that you 'll always be right .
That is , your assumptions about human nature will be true , but less useful than those of your competitors .
Consider online video .
Five years ago anyone could have told you that online video was going to be big .
The truth of the thesis was self - evident .
But it took Chad Hurley to figure out the money was in the half - hour after lunch when employees were too comatose work .
YouTube did n't make it big by having a better thesis , but rather by having a better understanding of human nature .
This is why thesis - driven investment works for venture capitalists but not for entrepreneurs .
For VCs , merely having the best thesis is good enough .
After all , they get to look at every solution to a given problem and evaluate each on a binary basis .
All the assumptions are built in , and the product either works or it does n't .
If you saw a prototype of Digg then you 'd have probably been smart enough to invest .
Or maybe not .
But at least the decision - making process involved is relatively straight forward .
Compare this to actually solving problems .
You do n't get to choose your solution from a list .
You need to solve it yourself .
All too often people start businesses after finding a cool new problem .
Bad idea , because being the first to find a problem confers zero advantage .
None .
Think about it .
Now you have two problems instead of one .
First you have to convince others that there is a problem .
Then you have to solve it .
In practice so much of your time is spent on the former that you 're lucky if you even get to the latter .
And even if you do , you 're just as unlikely to be successful as everyone else .
But what do you do if you REALLY REALLY know what the future is going to look like .
If you 've found all the cool new problems .
The ways to create value .
The areas for innovation .
What then ?
Go have a beer and let someone else work on it .
Much better to wait until you 've discovered something new about human nature .
Something that makes your assumptions more accurate for more people , more of the time , in more places .
Something more useful .
Something more actionable .
Call it assumption - driven entrepreneurship .
The best part is that theories are invisible so they can't easily be found and copied .
Your theory of human nature is your hidden sustainable competitive advantage .
Make sure you have one .
And use it wisely .

The rapier is more silver than the moon .
The horse , red eyed and fierce in the California night , is rearing up , and its rider points his sword toward the sky , and its tip seems to touch the lunar surface , dimpling it further between the craters .
On the wall near his desk in the Russell Senate Office Building , Chuck Hagel has hung a painting of Zorro done by his brother Mike .
" Is n't that a great effect ? " asks Hagel .
He is informed that his visitor not only dressed up as Zorro for every Halloween from third grade all the way to his freshman year in college but also credits Johnston McCulley 's hero for his ongoing career as an aging epee hack .
Hagel 's laugh lasts just long enough to be heartfelt , and not so long as to be calculated .
" I always thought he was the best of them , " Hagel says .
If Hagel were better fitted for metaphor , Zorro would be an awfully good one , certainly better than that overrated royalist stooge Robin Hood .
With his Michael Curtiz pastels and his Merry Men , the former Earl of Locksley fought to restore to the throne Richard I , the bloodthirsty slaughterer of Saracens , who'd left England to corruption and destitution while he went haring off to the Middle East on some damned Crusade .
A renegade aristocrat himself , Zorro fought only to free the peons from a tyrannical governor .
Zorro wore black .
Zorro always rode alone .
But there are no places in Hagel for metaphor .
His face is too meaty for poetics , its tectonics shaped by old football injuries and one horrible day in the Mekong Delta when the flesh of it bubbled and burned .
His sentences are too often arrhythmic , breaking in the middle , when what he 's saying takes an unexpected turn that seems to startle him most of all .
" The president says , ' I do n't care . '
He 's not accountable anymore , " Hagel says , measuring his words by the syllable and his syllables almost by the letter .
" He 's not accountable anymore , which is n't totally true .
You can impeach him , and before this is over , you might see calls for his impeachment .
I do n't know .
It depends how this goes . "
The conversation beaches itself for a moment on that word — impeachment — spoken by a conservative Republican from a safe Senate seat in a reddish state .
It 's barely even whispered among the serious set in Washington , and it rings like a gong in the middle of the sentence , even though it flowed quite naturally out of the conversation he was having about how everybody had abandoned their responsibility to the country , and now there was a war going bad because of it .
" Congress abdicated its oversight responsibility , " he says .
" The press abdicated its responsibility , and the American people abdicated their responsibilities .
Terror was on the minds of everyone , and nobody questioned anything , quite frankly . "
He is developing , almost on the fly and without perceptible calculation , a vocabulary and a syntax through which to express the catastrophe of what followed after .
Rough , and the furthest thing from glib , he 's developing a voice that seems to be coming from somewhere else , distant and immediate all at once .
Listen to him calling out his fellow senators in committee .
" If you wanted a safe job , " Hagel said memorably , " go sell shoes . "

No pricey Beltway word whore could come up with " Go sell shoes . "
Not enough poetry .
No Churchillian carillon ringing through the image .
But the language is changing as the country 's calling , because the war 's gone bad .
Country 's calling now .
War 's gone bad and nobody 's listening , and the country 's calling the way it always does , like the moan of a train whistle , soft and distant at first , but with increasing power behind it , the way the trains come through all the small places where Chuck Hagel grew up in Nebraska .
All the little towns , where everyone knew if your father was drunk and smashed up the car or lost his job , where every family kept secrets that every other family knew anyway but were too polite or kind to mention .
Rushville and York and Ainsworth .
And Columbus , too — the City of Power and Progress — founded in 1856 by men of grim visage and considerable chin whiskers , where Bill Cody first worked out the rough parts of his Wild West show before taking it down the line to the bright lights of Omaha .
The old man , a veteran of the Pacific war who never quite made it all the way home , died in the little house on Woodland Avenue in Columbus on Christmas Eve 1962 .
Five years later , his sons went off to war .
A train whistle blows in Columbus and it could be calling from four blocks away or 150 years ago .
Country 's calling from places just like that , louder and louder , demanding in a new , plainer language an end to incompetence and vainglory , creating one of those moments that find the man through which the moment finds its voice .
Go sell shoes .
Slowly , then , too slow , too late , maybe , but with inexorable purpose , the country begins to move .

His face has darkened and his eyes seem to have turned to stone .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has come before the Foreign Relations Committee of a radically different Senate to try and explain , among other things , how sending twenty - one thousand additional United States troops into a meat grinder of a ground war is somehow not an escalation of the conflict .
She keeps calling it an " augmentation . "
She crawfishes on the subject of what will happen if the new strategy somehow sends American troops across the Iranian border .
Chuck Hagel is having none of this .
" Some of us , " Hagel says , " remember 1970 , Madam Secretary , and that was Cambodia , and when our government lied to the American people and said , We did n't cross the border into Cambodia .
In fact , we did .
I happen to know something about that .
" I have to say , Madam Secretary , that I think this speech given last night by this president represents the most dangerous foreign - policy blunder in this country since Vietnam — if it 's carried out .
" I will resist it . "
Rice sits there like an ice sculpture .
The committee room erupts in applause .
I will resist it .

Hagel speaks only for himself , but he clearly feels the force at his back .
The country was divided , but not the way it was divided over Vietnam .
That war split families .
It got brothers storming away from each other at the dinner table and beating each other bloody on the front lawn .
This war is different .
It is massively unpopular in the country the way Vietnam never was ; in the latest Gallup poll , 74 percent of the people surveyed disapproved of Bush 's conduct of the war , and its only fervent supporters seem to be a cadre of Washington think - tankers , a couple of senators , and the president of the United States , and they seem to be the only ones who matter .
" You do n't have the draft , " Hagel says , " so you do n't have that many people touched .
This is a more sophisticated political divisiveness .
It divides people from their government .
' They do n't care what we think , so they 're not accountable to us . '
That 's the kind of thing that 's going to widen and deepen . "
A rock - ribbed Reagan conservative , he 's become the voice of uncompromising dissent on this war .
" If all these new troops get in there and the casualties start mounting , you 're going to see that 74 number go to 80 and higher , " he continues .
" You can't do anything about the president .
He 's gone .
But you can do something about your congressman .
That 's why all these Republicans are so nervous . "
The Congress of the United States — the 110th of that name — is walking on eggshells this morning .
It was elected the previous November in large part out of revulsion against a war in Iraq that was built on fraud and that thereafter was prosecuted by an executive branch that seemed to combine the giddy certitude of a sociopath with the geopolitical acumen of the Marx Brothers .
A whopping 18 percent of the country believed it to be a good idea to send more American troops there — and just the night before , the president of the United States had announced that he would do exactly that and that , if need be , he might just have to send some troops into Iran and Syria in order to make his new plan work .
The president had announced this even with the country so revolted by the whole business that it had decided in what was obviously abject desperation that the Democrats might even be a better bet , and it handed over to them both houses of the Congress .
At first , there was a lot of talk about " civility " and " bipartisanship . "
The senators even got together before the opening of the new Congress — no staff , no press — in the old Senate chamber in the Capitol building to talk about getting along with one another .
It was a rather ill - omened place to talk about bipartisan amity , the chamber in which a South Carolina congressman named Preston Brooks once caned abolitionist senator Charles Sumner into insensibility .
Some issues are irreconcilable .
The voters want Congress to function , but they also clearly want somebody 's head on a stick .
Which is the reason why the Congress of the United States is walking on eggshells this morning .
They 're going to have to do something , and Rice is sitting there , the implacable face of an administration that believes its powers in this regard are limitless .
Many of these people spent the previous six years enabling those powers , or folding in the face of them .
The committee 's new chairman is Joe Biden , who inveighs at Rice as though armoring himself in his own ambition , a blowhard who 's choked at critical moments almost his entire career .
He throws the Constitution at Rice , and she all but hands him a lollipop in return .
Hagel sits to Biden 's left , glowering and impatient .
Elected in an upset in 1996 over popular Democratic governor Ben Nelson , Hagel was as reliable a Republican as there was in the Senate .
He voted for all the tax cuts .
He proposed his own plan to monkey around with Social Security .
He voted 100 percent of the time with the National Right to Life Committee , and 93 percent of the time with the United States Chamber of Commerce , and 5 percent of the time with the League of Conservation Voters .
He wanted to protect the womb - babies and drill for oil in Alaska .
( Even Hagel 's upset win over Governor Nelson in 1996 was tinged with what have become de rigueur charges of Republican jiggery - pokery .
Prior to the campaign , he had been the chairman of the company that manufactured the machines that counted most of the votes .
Nelson subsequently got elected to the other Senate seat from Nebraska anyway .
The best anyone can say about their relationship is that their staffs get along well . )
He even voted for the resolution authorizing George Bush to use force in Iraq in 2002 , but he did so in a speech shot through with dark ambivalence .
He warned against believing in cakewalks .
" Imposing democracy through force , " he warned , " is a roll of the dice . "
Then Hagel voted aye .
" I was watching it , " says his brother Tom , a law professor at the University of Dayton who 's tied to Chuck by blood in every sense of the word .
" And it was an excellent speech on all the reasons not to go to war .
I thought ,
Here 's a guy who 's thought this through , who 's clearly agonized over it , and he 's set down on paper all the reasons for his ultimate act , which is to vote against it .
But then he could n't pull the trigger . "
" There were two reasons I did it , " Chuck Hagel explains .
" I believed what the administration said , that war would be a last resort , and the second thing is , at a critical time like this , the president needs a strong hand , and to some extent , you 've got to trust him , until he lies or screws up or something .
Is there a gamble in that ?
Sure .
But there was a gamble in sending Hagel to the Senate . "
Tom believes that Chuck " has a history of being too loyal for too long to people who do n't deserve it . "
Chuck disagrees .
It is not the first time .
However , the way George W. Bush operates always has made Chuck Hagel concerned .
He saw close up how the Bush campaign savaged his friend John McCain in the South Carolina primary .
In 2000 , he said he favored a statewide recount of the disputed presidential ballot in Florida , which was the last thing the Bush people wanted .
Then the planes hit the towers and the country got scared and a whole lot of things happened that made Hagel even more concerned .
" It was what Churchill called a ' jarring gong , ' " Hagel says .
" The country got knocked off balance for a long time . "
He spoke out against the excesses of the Patriot Act and the cavalier disregard of constitutional guarantees it embodied , becoming one of only four Republican senators to vote against its renewal in 2005 .
He fumed against what he saw as a country ill served by an indolent press , an impotent Congress , and its own shell - shocked acquiescence .
The Republicans had found an issue they thought they could ride to power for the next fifty years .
The Democrats apparently thought so , too , curling up into a ball , whimpering their opposition .
Out in the country , the American People — that fragile flower of an entity that everyone claimed to be working so hard to protect — seemed to function largely as set decoration .
Out of this , inevitably , came the Iraq war .
However , as the evidence piled up that the original casus belli was a complicated farrago of lies , bureaucratic grandiosity , wonkish wet dreams , and wishful thinking , and the bodies piled up — infantry , most of them , as he and his brother had been — Hagel engaged in dissent .
He called for the American troops to be redeployed , removed from the middle of a running sore of a civil war in which the only thing all sides seemed capable of agreeing upon was that it was a good thing to kill Americans , a burgeoning Belfast with sand .
He also found himself an audience .
The louder he spoke , the bigger the audience became .
Then the president gave his speech , and Rice came to the Hill to defend it , and Chuck Hagel said what he'd been building up to say for two years and what the country — the fragile American People — had been telling pollsters and shouting into the wind for somewhat longer .
I will resist it .
Here 's another thing about that committee .
A whole clutch of them are now — or have considered — running for president in 2008 .
Biden 's in , and so are Barack Obama and Christopher Dodd .
Feingold thought about it and , after contemplating how well a twice - divorced Jewish person from Wisconsin would play south of Kenosha , abandoned the idea .
And then there 's Chuck Hagel , who is n't even sure at this moment whether he 'll run for reelection to the Senate but who , in his own dogged , deliberately anticharismatic way , has found a cause with an audience .
The Republican field is wide and eccentric .
There is Newt Gingrich , once again running for emperor of his own private universe , and Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas , who seems to be bucking to be the national archbishop .
Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts has good looks and a thin resume , and he 's stuck in the mud because he had to promise to treat gay people like human beings to get elected in Massachusetts , which is n't playing well in Jesusland .
Rudy Giuliani has been taking his sweet time .
And there 's John McCain , Hagel 's great friend , who attached himself hip and thigh to the new policy in Iraq and who , even prior to that , had appeared to be on the verge of becoming a very ridiculous man .
But it was after he signed on to the surge that , according to one poll , his support among his core independent voters in New Hampshire tanked from 54 to 27 percent .
And then there 's Chuck Hagel , who 's not sure of his future but who 's positioned at this moment in history to be a presidential candidate of strange historical resonance : a Reaganite version of Eugene McCarthy , who , forty years ago , determined that he would run against a president of his own party in order to stop the misbegotten war in which Tom and Chuck Hagel were at that moment fighting .
" I do n't think it 's the same thing , because McCarthy was strictly an antiwar candidate , " Hagel muses , turning the comparison over and over in his mind .
" That would n't be what I would be . "
Oh , but it 's already pushed him there , because the war is going to be the only issue for the next two years , both the hammer and the anvil that pounds out the next president , the one who is going to have to deal with all the wreckage .
It is going to redefine American politics for at least the next decade , and that one sentence — I will resist it — has marked Hagel as something he might never otherwise have become : the vehicle through which the country found a voice for its anger and discontent .
A true maverick .
I will resist it .
The voice of a country , moving .
The Real McCain .

The senator 's father , Charles Dean Hagel , went off to war , a tail gunner in the Pacific theater .
Not long ago , some of Chuck Hagel 's cousins discovered a cache of his father 's wartime letters .
They describe hilarious leaves in Australia and a girlfriend his family never knew he had .
They also talk a lot about how much he was looking forward to having a drink or three when he got home .
In a very real sense , Charlie Hagel never made it home .
" If you look at the symptoms my father had , " says Tom Hagel , " I do n't think there 's any question that he had what we came to call post - traumatic - stress syndrome .
So many of them came home , and booze was what they had .
I mean , there was n't cocaine around then . "
He married Betty Dunn in 1946 , and they had four sons , but Charlie Hagel could n't shake the booze any more than he could shake the malaria he 'd picked up on one island or another .
He caught polio .
He kept having accidents at work .
He broke his back once when he piled up his car after a bender .
The family moved seven times in a great loop around Nebraska .
On one occasion , they lived in the furnace room of a hotel .
Chuck remembers this as a time of opportunity .
" Looking back on it now , " he says , " it was a tremendous advantage .
We all had to make new sets of friends all the time .
I hated it at the time , but it was a liberating experience . "
It was the way he always was — a grinder , a smart and diligent oldest son who set his jaw and moved ahead , a solid fullback on the several football teams on which he played .
Tom was different .
He was mercurial , quicker .
He cut class to read the Encyclopaedia Britannica , cover to cover .
You knew instantly how Tom felt about something .
You had to pry it out of Chuck .
He was the one who had to step between his parents when Charlie 's drinking set him after his wife , but it was Tom who felt most deeply what that meant in these little towns where every family had secrets that everybody else in town knew .
But they were two sides of the same personality .
Put them in a room with two hundred strangers and you 'd pick them out as brothers .
No matter where the Hagels lived , in all the small towns , the center of Charlie 's life was the American Legion post .
" The Legion hall was the center of the universe , " Chuck recalls .
" They had bake sales , wedding receptions .
It would be where your mother and father would get dressed up and go to dance , where they 'd have Guy Lombardo 's third team in there . "
It also functioned as the local bar .
In 1960 , they moved to Columbus , where Charlie got a job in sales with the Gerhold Concrete Products company .
They moved into a ranch house on Woodland Drive , a small development off Nebraska Route 30 on the eastern side of town .
They 'd lived there for two years when , on Christmas Eve , Charlie said goodnight and went to bed .
The aneurysm hit in the middle of the night .
He was thirty - nine years old .
They gave him a full military funeral out at St. Bonaventure 's cemetery .
" We found him dead in his bed , " Chuck recalls , measuring every word .
" I 'd like to think we reacted like any family would .
I recall my mother , right after they removed my father 's body , saying , ' You 're all going to have to help me . ' "
( After Jimmy Hagel , her youngest son , was killed in a car wreck , Betty Hagel spiraled into depression and alcoholism .
Redeeming the promise they 'd all made to her earlier , Tom Hagel organized the surviving brothers into an intervention and had their mother hospitalized .
" When she came home , " Tom recalls , " she went through the house and pulled out all the little bottles she 'd hidden away and poured them down the sink . " )
In 1967 , Chuck was at loose ends .
Stops at two colleges had n't taken , largely because a pinched nerve in his neck had ended his football career .
He 'd sold encyclopedias door - to - door .
He 'd enrolled in a broadcasting school in Minnesota and even worked briefly at a radio station back in Lincoln .
When his draft notice came , there was never a question about his serving , not after all the time he'd spent with his father and the guys down at the Legion hall .
They called and you went and then you came back and drank beer and shot the shit about all the good times .
He went through basic training and he showed some aptitude for something called a Redeye gun , a shoulder - fired gizmo that was a precursor to the modern Stinger missile .
It was a top - secret weapon system , and the Army wanted to transfer him to Germany for further training .
He asked instead for a transfer to Vietnam and the infantry .
By this time , Tom had been drafted , too , and the Army originally tried to make him a cook .
" We were about the smartest kids in basic training in El Paso , Texas , because we were probably the only two that had high school degrees and wore shoes before we were out of high school , " Chuck recalls .
" And we had no criminal record , and that did n't mean anything , either . "
They would never serve together .
The Army promised that .
Forty years later , going through Charlie Hagel 's letters , his sons came upon one that stopped them both short .
" If I thought I would ever have a son who would have to go through this , " he 'd written to his sister , " I would never get married . "

Senator Hagel is out of patience .
This morning , he happens to be out of patience with Senator Joseph Lieberman , the putative Democratic senator from Connecticut and one of the president 's very few supporters on his latest plans for Iraq .
They are on a Sunday chat show together , and Lieberman is droning on and on about the historic moment we all face , and every word he says seems transparent .
You can see in them a treacly syrup turning slowly to blood .
Finally , Lieberman says he 's supporting this war for his grandchildren .
" We all have children and grandchildren , " says Hagel .
" He does n't have a market on that . "

Watch Sen. Chuck Hagel joust with Sen. Joseph Lieberman on Meet the Press . Via YouTube.com .
He 's out of patience with the young cheerleaders of this war , the chickenhawks at places like The Weekly Standard who once called him part of an " axis of appeasement . "
He is out of patience with think - tank cowboys and talk - show Napoleons .
" I 'm always taken aback by that certain cavalier manner , not connecting at all with that human loss , " he says .
" I do think of those guys , kicking doors down , walking target practice for snipers .
" Nobody lobbies for the guy on the ground .
To too many people in this business , committing men and women to war , and many of them to their deaths , is an abstraction . "
This impatience is what caused him to step in , loudly , in 2002 , when a Georgia Republican Senate challenger named Saxby Chambliss — who 'd sat out Vietnam with a knee problem — ran an odious television commercial in which Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden were linked to Democratic incumbent Max Cleland , a triple - amputee Vietnam veteran .
Hagel called Senator Bill Frist , the chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee , and chewed Frist 's ass like it was steak .
Take the ad down today , Hagel told him , or I 'm going to Georgia and cut a commercial endorsing Max .
" I told Max 's guys to start writing it , " Hagel recalls .
The ad came down .
He 'd seen this kind of thing before , in South Carolina , in 2000 , when the Bush people submarined his friend John McCain .
They ran whispering campaigns that a Bangladeshi child the McCains had adopted was the senator 's love child with a black woman .
Hagel was appalled .
" These are people with no courage , on both sides , " he says .
" Cowards .
Nameless and faceless .
I called it the filthiest thing I 'd ever seen . "
Now , though , it is 2007 and McCain wants to be president again .
To that end , he has embraced — literally — the president on whose behalf his wife and daughter were publicly slandered .
He has sought the support of those Christian Right leaders he 'd memorably denounced seven years earlier .
He has hired the admen who created the Swift Boat spots against John Kerry , which in 2004 he called " dishonest and dishonorable . "
He has gone back on so much of his vaunted " Straight Talk " that McCain has become a parody of himself .
And of course , there is the war .
McCain is the new policy 's biggest supporter , even bigger than Lieberman is , which is saying something .
How much of that , one wonders , was political calculation ?
" I do n't know if he 's even being honest about it , " says Tom Hagel .
" He would kiss anybody 's ass and say anything to whatever group if he figures it 'll help him become president .
He has given himself up to his ambition , and I wanted to vomit knowing what the Bush people did to him in South Carolina and watching him in 2004 . "
Is that the price you have to pay to be president now , to be granted the privilege of trying to figure a way out of the blood and death and misadventure ?
Asked about it , and about what his friend has done in pursuit of that office , Chuck Hagel takes a long time to answer .
" I cannot , and will not , ever speak for other people , " he says finally .
Tom thinks Chuck has a problem with loyalty to the wrong people .
Chuck does not agree .
It 's not the first time .
To this day , they do n't know how it happened .
Tom was with the 5th Cavalry Regiment up north , in the area around the DMZ , and Chuck was working the Mekong Delta with the 9th Division .
In Vietnam , the units were fluid .
It did n't matter what the patch on your arm said .
If someone needed bodies , you got sent there .
It was another thing the Army did n't tell you when you signed up .
In February 1968 , Tom put in for a transfer south in order to be somewhere near his brother .
At almost the same time , Chuck got word that he was being sent north , to the highlands , where the 4th Division had taken some major hits .
" I laughed to myself , " Chuck Hagel says .
" It 'll be incredible if Tom gets transferred down here and I 'm gone . "
They put him on a truck to go north , and for reasons about which he is still completely in the dark , Chuck Hagel got pulled off the truck and sent back to his unit .
At the time , he was afraid something had happened to Tom .
Five days later , he wandered into the orderly room and Tom was standing there with his duffel bag .
" Never , ever , have I had any idea to this day why they pulled me off the truck , " Chuck says .
They were put in the same unit , which was something else the Army said would never happen .
Chuck was a steady , earnest trooper , and Tom became something of a character , dropping the words he 'd learned from the Great Books into casual conversation and cracking everyone up .
It was grinding , brutal work in the Delta , hard by the Cambodian border and , occasionally , unofficially , across it .
There were mines and booby traps , grenades hanging like fruit in the trees .
They would see the Swift - boat guys go zipping up the rivers and canals , where the enemy would hang piano wire across the narrowest parts .
Jesus , the grunts thought , that 's some shit duty right there .
On March 28 , while they were walking in column through the jungle , someone ahead of them tripped a mine that had been hung from a tree — what today 's grunts call an IED .
Tom was fording a small creek when he was knocked down by a blast carrying pieces of the men who'd been in line ahead of him .
He looked around for Chuck and found him , bleeding profusely from a chest wound .
Tom got the bleeding stopped before he noticed that he'd been hit in the arm .
They both stayed on patrol .
Almost a month later , they were riding together in an armored vehicle when someone in a village they 'd just passed set off a mine .
Chuck 's eardrum punctured and the left side of his face burned , the flesh bubbling .
Tom was unconscious .
Chuck yanked him free of the wreckage and then shielded him with his own body when the machine gunners in the village opened up on them .
How do you go on from that ?
How do you live as brothers with those moments , surreal and desperate , hanging between you back in the world ?
" You have to have a life separate from it .
Because it was a cloud over us for far too long , " Tom says , his voice quavering .
Chuck 's stays firm and he says , " It 's always there , but you move forward . "
By the following March , they were both back in Omaha with five Purple Hearts between them .
Tom had a hard time .
He drank and flew into rages .
He was openly furious at the government for lying them into a war .
Chuck thought the war was a good idea badly executed .
This was enough to send them at each other .
" My mother , " says Mike Hagel , their younger brother , " would send them away from the table . "
Once , at a party at a small house Chuck rented , they had their picture taken in a state of blissfully intoxicated brotherhood only to find themselves a little while later punching themselves senseless on the lawn .
They bonded again only when the police came .
" We told them nothing was going on , " Tom recalls .
" But we wrecked that house . "
The one thing they did agree on was that Mike was n't going to join the Army .
" I tried to enlist three times , " Mike says .
" They stopped me all three . "
Chuck did what he always did , doggedly putting one foot in front of the other .
He worked for a Republican congressman in Washington .
He came back with enough connections in Nebraska to make a lot of money getting in on the ground floor of the wireless - communications industry .
He married , divorced , and remarried , this time to Lilibet Ziller of Meridian , Mississippi , a congressional aide whom he'd met while working in Washington .
He was prairie Catholic .
She was Southern Baptist .
As a compromise , they and their two teenage children , Allyn and Ziller , go to an Episcopal church .
He ran for the Senate as a rookie and won , beating a popular Republican attorney general in the primary and incumbent governor Ben Nelson in the general election .
Tom got a law degree and moved to Dayton in 1982 .
His politics stayed left .
Once , he was romanced by the law school at the University of Mississippi .
He was charmed by the antebellum campus in Oxford .
Then , at a reception that night , he heard some of his prospective colleagues talking about " nigras . "
He stayed in Dayton .
The two brothers gradually made a hard - won peace with their war .
They became somewhat famous when Myra MacPherson made them the centerpiece of the opening of Long Time Passing , her seminal 1984 study of Vietnam veterans .
In 1999 , they were invited to be part of the delegation attending the opening of the first American consulate in Ho Chi Minh City .
Gradually , though , Chuck moved closer to Tom 's view of Vietnam .
It was the tapes that did it , the release of recordings of Lyndon Johnson 's anguished phone calls to Richard Russell in which he tells Russell that he knows the war can not be won .
The calls were recorded two years before the Hagels went to Vietnam .
" To know that , and to continue to send kids into that meat grinder ... " says Chuck Hagel , sitting in an office in a building named after Richard Russell , an office across the hall from the one out of which Lyndon Johnson once ran the Senate .
It seems impolite to ask him , as his sentence fades away and he shakes the voices of Johnson and Russell out of his head , whether we are still talking completely about the past .
Today ,
Tom jokes that we 'll all know whether Chuck 's running for president if Tom is suddenly packed off to a desert island somewhere for the duration of the campaign .
For his part , Chuck points out that Tom , who , he says , once railed against veterans ' groups , is a post commander of the Disabled American Veterans .
" When he came back , " Chuck says , " he would n't walk across the street for those guys .
' They 're a bunch of no - good , beer - swilling , fat - bellied swine . '
Now he 's part of the establishment . "
They tear up at different times .
Tom starts talking about the day Chuck pulled him out of the wrecked vehicle , and he has to turn away for a second and pick up a cup of coffee , and even that does n't help altogether .
It happens to Chuck when he talks about their father , who never came all the way home .
He 's sitting in the Senate Caucus Room in the Russell Building .
All the lights are off , and the city 's gone dark , and the only illumination comes from some small lamps that a photographer is using to take his picture .
There are shades moving amid the shadows in this room .
It was here where Harry Truman , a mediocre machine hack from Missouri , roasted his own party over war profiteering , and where J. William Fulbright , an urbane Arkansan , roasted his own party over the lies it had used to launch a war , and where Sam Ervin , an unremarkable segregationist , used the Constitution to pry the lid off the excesses of a rogue presidency .
It was in this room where , often , the building moments met the unlikely men who gave them their voice .
Chuck Hagel talks about the night his father died .
In the dark , you can barely see his fingers move discreetly under his eyes , wiping away the tears .
You can see the pain and loss there , beneath the scars and the bone and everything else that 's been built on top of it , the essential archaeology of a man and his time .
Any war 's wounds are vast and gratuitous .
None of its damage is ever collateral .

“ Mr. President , it has been four years since the President sent our troops into Iraq - - four long years .
That is longer than it took to win World War II .
More than 3,300 troops have sacrificed their lives in Iraq , and nearly 25,000 have been wounded - - many severely .
With passage of this conference agreement , Congress will have appropriated more than $ 450 billion for the war in Iraq .
$ 450 billion .
That compares with the $ 296 billion which the U.S. spent on World War II .
“ Yet , in the four years since our troops succeeded in removing Saddam Hussein from power , the President has failed in his mission to bring peace and stability to the people of Iraq .
The troops had the courage and the strength to win the war , but the President has not had the wisdom to win the peace .
It is time , past time for a new direction in Iraq .
“ The agreement that is before us today provides that new direction . "
" Rather than admit the need to change course , the President - - and I say this with all due respect - - continues to try to mislead the America public about the war in Iraq .
He recently asked Congress to ' put partisanship on hold . '
But then he voiced the incredible assertion that the attacks of 9/11 are linked to the war in Iraq .
" That is not true and the American people know it .
He complained that Congress is holding funding for the troops hostage to funding for domestic needs .
President Bush claims that Democrats are adding pork barrel spending to a bill intended for the troops .
The President has charged that Democrats are ' legislating defeat ' in Iraq .
President Bush has tried to scare the pants off the public by suggesting that our bill could result in death and destruction in America .
“ What utter nonsense .
What hogwash . "
" The American people do not support an open - ended U.S. military occupation in Iraq .
It is time for the truth .
It is time for the White House to stop the fear mongering and face the truth .
In the Book of John , Chapter 8 Verse 32 , are the words ' And ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free . '
The United States Congress is not holding funding for the troops hostage to domestic pork barrel spending .
“ $ 6.9 billion for rebuilding the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina is not pork barrel spending .
Ask the citizens of New Orleans .
“ $ 1.8 billion for the VA to provide first class health care to our wounded veterans is not pork barrel spending .
Ask the troops who are waiting for care .
Ask their families .
“ $ 20 million to repair Walter Reed Hospital is not pork barrel spending .
“ $ 650 million for the S - CHIP child health program to deal with the shortfall in fourteen states is not pork barrel spending .
Ask the parents with sick children .
“ $ 2.25 billion for securing the country from terrorist attack , including port and border security , transit security , funds to improve screening for explosives at airports , and for screening cargo on passenger aircraft .
This is not pork barrel spending .
It is homeland security to prevent the death and destruction which President Bush warns about . "
“ The President claims that this is a partisan bill .
The President claims that Congress is trying to micromanage the war , substituting our judgment for the judgment of our generals .
The President knows better .
“ The Constitution says that ' the Congress shall have power to . . . provide for the common Defense . '
It is the Congress that is given the sole power to declare war .
The Congress is sworn to , ' raise and support Armies . '
The Congress has heard the voices of the people and we have responded as we are elected to do . "
Senator Robert Byrd ( D - WV ) gave a great statement on the floor of the Senate this morning in the final debate before the Senate votes on the Emergency Supplemental Conference Report , which funds the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan , but mandates withdrawal of American forces from the Iraqi civil war .
Here 's Byrd :
He then slams the White House for their intentional misdirection on the real purpose of the bill and calls Bush 's characterizations " nonsense " and " hogwash . " Byrd then hits Republicans on their ongoing spin that the $ 120 billion measure is filled with too many items that are not directly related to the Iraq war .
Finally , the West Virginia Senator hammers Bush for minimizing Congress 's role in national defense : Byrd sums it up by putting the onus on Bush to drop his twisted , personal agenda and do what 's right for the troops and our country .
Said Byrd : “ If the President decides to veto the bill , he will be holding funding for the troops hostage to his stubborn insistence on going into Iraq and the resulting disaster caused by his war policies . "
In a speech Friday night to the Annual American Association for the Advancement of Science conference , Google co-founder Larry Page let slip with a truth we all suspected :
“ We have some people at Google [ who ] are really trying to build artificial intelligence ( AI ) and to do it on a large scale …
It ’s not as far off as people think . ”
Yep , you read that right , Google is trying to build real AI .
The worlds most dominant online company , with the largest conglomeration of computing power the world has ever seen , is trying to build artificial intelligence , and according to Page it is n’t that far away either .
The term Googlebot is about to take on a whole new meaning , and in the not to distant future as well .
But Google is a good company , you may well say , after all Do No Evil is the company mantra .
But true artificial intelligence not only has serious ethical and moral implications , self aware intelligence may also not be controllable , after all it thinks for itself and makes decisions based on that reasoning , as we all do .
What if Google creates AI with the logical reasoning of Hitler or Stalin ? or even George W Bush ?
Food for thought … literally :-)

The dead and injured - including nine children , four women and six men - were sleeping when the first shell hit at around 6 am local time .
Many of the victims were taken to hospital in their pyjamas .
In response to the attack , Hamas called for attacks on the US .
“ America is offering political , financial and logistic cover for the Zionist occupation crimes , and it is responsible for the Beit Hanoun massacre .
Therefore , the people and the nation all over the globe are required to teach the American enemy tough lessons , ” the Islamist group said in a statement sent to the Associated Press .
Israeli army sources said that the army fired a volley of artillery shells at the northern Gaza Strip which missed their target , probably because of a human or technical error .
Officially the army said it was still investigating the incident .
Witnesses said that the first shell hit a home , causing deaths and injuries .
Residents took shelter while rescuers attempted to retrieve the bodies and care for the wounded .
Many residents were sheltering in a nearby alleyway when a second shell landed , causing most of the casualties .
A further five or six shells landed in the same vicinity over a period of 15 minutes , witnesses said .
Most of the victims belonged to the Athamna family who lived in several adjacent homes .
Majid Athamna , 55 , said he was sleeping when the first shell landed .
“ Some people were killed and injured .
We went downstairs and the second shell hit while we were taking out the bodies .
Then more shells came .
I saw bodies cut into pieces .
There were children and women .
God knows why they hit this house . ”
At Kamel Adwan hospital in nearby Beit Lahiya , Yazan Athamna , 15 , was being treated for shrapnel injuries to his stomach and legs .
He said that his mother and two grandmothers were killed as they slept .
“ I got out of the house and was running in the street .
Then people came to help and the shelling started again , ” he said .
Muhammed Odwan , 21 , was lying on his stomach with shrapnel injuries to his back .
“ I was in the house sleeping .
The shelling started and I got out of my house .
All my neighbours were screaming for help and then it started it again as people gathered .
My father was killed in the alleyway where we stood .
Why did they do this ?
They want to destroy our houses and force us into exile . ”
The killings follow Israel ’s withdrawal from Beit Hanoun after a one - week occupation which resulted in the deaths of 52 Palestinians .
During the operation , Israeli soldiers visited the houses that were hit , searched them and questioned the residents .
The operation was aimed at preventing the firing of missiles at Israel , but rocket attacks have continued .
Beit Hanoun is on the border with Israel and is overlooked by Israeli tanks and artillery batteries .
Israel has fired tens of thousands of shells into Gaza in the last year , killing dozens of civilians .
In June a family of seven and another man died when a shell landed on a beach in northern Gaza .
Palestinian politicians reacted with fury to the most recent attack .
Atef Odwan , the Hamas minister of refugee affairs , visited the scene of the shelling , where there were deep pools of blood .
“ We can not accept this destruction , ” he said .
“ We cannot accept the peace process or talk about stopping resistance .
They are trying to break the Palestinian people and its resistance and trying to force us out of our homes .
But we have nothing to lose .
We have no choice but to stand for our rights . ”
The president , Mahmoud Abbas , ordered three days of mourning throughout the Palestinian territories .
“ This is a horrible , ugly massacre committed by the occupation against our children , our women and elderly in Beit Hanoun , ” he said in a statement .
“ We urge and call the security council to convene immediately to stop the massacres committed against our people and to uphold their responsibility to stop these massacres . ”
Ismail Haniyeh , the prime minister , said that negotiations on a unity government between Fatah and Hamas would be suspended in protest at the attack .
Ghazi Hamad , a government spokesman , told AP : “ After this barbaric operation , Israel proved that it ’s not a humane state .
It ’s a state that believes in killing , and therefore this state should cease to exist . ”
Israeli leaders showed little remorse for the deaths , stating that the army did not intend to kill civilians .
Tzipi Livni , the Israeli foreign minister , described the incident as “ regrettable ” while Miri Eisin , a spokeswoman for Ehud Olmert , the prime minister , said that Israeli operations would continue as long as missiles were fired over the border , weapons were smuggled into Gaza and Hamas continued to provoke Israel .
The killings provoked protests in Gaza and the West Bank .
Shots were fired at the empty EU offices in Gaza City and demonstrators called for revenge against Israel .
At the Kamal Adwan hospital , Nizar Rayan , a local Hamas leader , said : “ We are going to fight against the so - called Israel .
We are going to launch our rockets , our martyrs are going to sacrifice their lives in the depths of our occupied land .
They will strike in Jaffa , in Haifa , inside Ashdod .
The battle will continue .
The rifle is not going to be set down .
All of us are martyrs in waiting .
Revenge is coming . ”
The Islamic Jihad militant group also called for revenge .
“ Martyrdom is coming .
The response will not take long , because the time is ready for punishment , and the time is ready for revenge , ” it said in a statement .
In the hours after the attack militants fired eight rockets at Israel from Gaza .
Most of the rockets landed in open land but two landed in the centre of the town of Sderot , causing one minor injury .
THE “ tax wedge ” is the gap between employers ' labour costs and what employees take home as pay .
It is made up of income taxes and the social - security contributions of both firms and workers .
The bigger the wedge , the greater are the barriers to job creation .
Tax wedges are fattest in continental Europe , exceeding 50 % of gross labour costs in Germany , France and Belgium .
Jupiter Images
The sharpest image ever taken of the large " grand design " spiral galaxy M81 was just released at the American Astronomical Society Meeting in Honolulu , Hawaii .
This beautiful galaxy is tilted at an oblique angle on to our line of sight , giving a " birds - eye view " of the spiral structure .
The galaxy is similar to our Milky Way , but our favorable view provides a better picture of the typical architecture of spiral galaxies .
Though the galaxy is 11.6 million light - years away , NASA Hubble Space Telescope 's view is so sharp that it can resolve individual stars , along with open star clusters , globular star clusters , and even glowing regions of fluorescent gas .
The spiral arms , which wind all the way down into the nucleus , are made up of young , bluish , hot stars formed in the past few million years .
They also host a population of stars formed in an episode of star formation that started about 600 million years ago .
The greenish regions are dense areas of bright star formation .
The ultraviolet light from hot young stars are fluorescing the surrounding clouds of hydrogen gas .
A number of sinuous dust lanes also wind all the way into the nucleus of M81 .
The galaxy 's central bulge contains much older , redder stars .
It is significantly larger than the Milky Way 's bulge .
A black hole of 70 million solar masses resides at the center of M81 .
The black hole is about 15 times the mass of the Milky Way 's black hole .
Previous Hubble research shows that the size of the central black hole in a galaxy is proportional to the mass of a galaxy 's bulge .
M81 may be undergoing a surge of star formation along the spiral arms due to a close encounter it may have had with its nearby spiral galaxy NGC 3077 and a nearby starburst galaxy ( M82 ) about 300 million years ago .
Astronomers plan to use the Hubble image to study the star formation history of the galaxy and how this history relates to the neutron stars and black holes seen in X - ray observations of M81 with NASA 's Chandra X-ray Observatory .
M81 is one of the brightest galaxies that can be seen from the Earth .
It is high in the northern sky in the circumpolar constellation Ursa Major , the Great Bear .
At an apparent magnitude of 6.8 it is just at the limit of naked - eye visibility .
The galaxy 's angular size is about the same as that of the Full Moon .
The Hubble data was taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys in 2004 through 2006 .
This color composite was assembled from images taken in blue , visible , and infrared light .
With efficient bandwidth usage , it 's low - latency and can even run over a 56 Kbps connection .
It 's tiny too , weighing in at a lightweight about 50 MB package available for Windows , Mac and Linux .
On the correct settings , it can even run on old hardware ( Pentium III and above ) .

SEASON your shashlik with onion , pepper , coriander and basil .
Then marinate in the fridge for 12 hours , advises Dmitry Kuzmin , mayor of the southern Russian city of Stavropol , and also local leader of the Just Russia party .
Posing in their pinafores , Mr Kuzmin and his fellow candidates published a leaflet of their favourite recipes as part of their campaign for the regional elections on March 11th .
“ Sell the Bentley — pay the alimony ” , election posters urged the region 's governor , who has had a nasty divorce and is aligned with United Russia , a rival party that dominates both the Duma , the lower house of Russia 's parliament , and most of the regions .
Trivial and dirty tactics these may be , but they are effective .
Just Russia surprisingly topped the poll in Stavropol .
Does that point to a real political fight in Russia ?
Just Russia 's strong showing was hailed by Sergei Mironov , its leader , as “ a victory over fear ” .
But the party was created only last October , and like United Russia , it is sycophantically loyal to the Kremlin in general and to Vladimir Putin in particular .
Both parties have the president 's blessing and , rather like rival disciples to a prophet , both claim to be his true acolytes .
“ I support him completely , ” says Alexander Babakov , Just Russia 's top man in the Duma .
Criticising the president , he adds , lies outside the purview of party politics .
His party purports to be more social - democratic than United Russia .
But in the regions , says Nikolai Petrov of the Carnegie Moscow Centre , the important divides are not ideological but between fractious elites vying for power and assets .
The votes held on March 11th in 14 of Russia 's 86 regions ( United Russia won in the 13 other than Stavropol ) marked the start of a political season that will culminate in elections for the Duma this December and for the presidency next March .
They suggested how the Kremlin 's election - cooking recipe is likely to turn out : one of fake competition , conducted by candidates who are much less different than they try to seem .
Undesirables will be nobbled in advance , by denying them access to state - controlled television , and by new laws on political parties and elections that make it difficult for them to run or to win seats when they do .
( The head of Russia 's central election commission , a placeman who nevertheless publicly doubted some of the new rules , was ousted from his job this week . )
In St Petersburg , for example , apparently fierce regional campaigning by United Russia and Just Russia generated such ruses as bogus death notices and the circulation of pornographic videos featuring candidate lookalikes .
But Yabloko , a liberal party , was kept off the ballot , because ( say its leaders ) of its opposition to the governor and to Gazprom 's plans to build a skyscraper in the city .
Regional governors are unlikely to stray from the Kremlin 's plans .
The regions have varying levels of autonomy and prosperity , but all their bosses are , in effect , now appointed by the president .
The Stavropol result was probably in part a protest against an unpopular governor , whom voters cannot remove directly .
In the Duma elections in December , only four parties look likely to climb over the 7 % threshold for seats : Just Russia and United Russia , which seem destined to emerge as the components of a simulated two - party system , plus the Communists and the misnamed Liberal Democrats .
The Union of Right Forces , a liberal party that is less troublesome than Yabloko , may also just squeeze in .
As for the presidential election , rather than being a simple anointing of Mr Putin 's chosen successor , it may turn out to be a contest between two principal candidates — albeit both approved by the Kremlin .
This recipe is likely to work well enough to leave little need for the massive falsification and repression that mark elections in some of Russia 's neighbours ( although there was a polling day shoot - out last weekend in the Russian republic of Dagestan ) .
But riot police will be available if necessary , as participants at a violently dispersed protest rally in St Petersburg on March 3rd were quick to discover .
“ There is no political competition in our country any more , ” says Mikhail Kasyanov , a former prime minister turned Kremlin critic , gloomily .
To some , the situation is starting to look rather like the old Soviet Union , in which elections also took place .
Indeed , in some places , United Russia is now behaving uncannily like the old Communist Party , with applicants for certain jobs required to be members .
Even so , a closer analogy is probably with the pre-revolutionary period , when groups of powerful boyars — sort of barons — competed for the tsar 's ear and favour .
( During the civil war Ivan Bunin , a writer , noted the “ extreme repetitiveness ” of Russian history , “ its fatal peculiarity of always moving forward in circles ” . )
A case can be made that this arrangement works quite well .
Witness Russia 's economic progress under Mr Putin , and his still - stellar popularity — even if that is attributable in part to the Kremlin 's media management , and to the widespread political quietism that followed Russia 's stressful 1990s .
Elections may be closed and phoney , but Russia 's rulers are responsive to the popular mood in their own way , as in the nervous backtracking that followed big street protests against a reform of the benefits system in 2005 .
But there are risks in a situation in which all politicians owe their positions to the Kremlin , not to the voters .
Many of those voters continue to suffer horrifically from Russia 's widespread poverty and inequality , which may explain the enduring appeal of the Communists , who came second by share of the vote in last week 's polls .
( Mr Babakov says they are not real communists but “ just a group of people who are exploiting the brand ” . )
Add to this a catastrophic demographic collapse , mind - boggling corruption and a bloody crisis in Chechnya that may look solved but is n't .
After Mr Putin leaves office , especially if the oil price falls and the material gains of his presidency fade away , ever more Russians may become frustrated with rulers who offer them recipes for shashlik but not for genuine change .
— The Wake County school system cannot convert 22 traditional - calendar schools to mandatory year - round schedules this summer , a judge ruled Thursday .
Superior Court Judge Howard Manning 's decision throws the district 's plans for the 2007 - 08 school year into chaos , with only three months to find classroom space for an expected 8,000 new students , hire teachers and rework bus routes .
The school board called an emergency meeting for Friday morning to discuss its next move .
" Obviously , it causes a lot of concerns for us at this point , " district spokesman Michael Evans said .
" The board 's going to walk through this step by step , and we 'll come up with a decision that 's going to be the best , given the circumstances we 're facing . "
The district approved moving 19 elementary schools and three middle schools to year - round schedules last fall , saying they needed the extra space provided by year - rounds to accommodate surging enrollments .
Manning 's ruling not only affects the 22 schools , but it affects any studetn who is currently assigned to a year - round or modified year - round school .
But a group of parents , organized as WakeCares , sued to block the move , contending that forcing them to switch schedules would be unfair to their children and would disrupt family life .
The mayors of Apex and Garner backed the parents ' group , saying their towns would suffer in year - round conversions and the district 's decision deprives many parents of educational choices .
In a 35 - page decision , Manning ruled that school districts can require students only to attend a traditional - calendar school .
Any assignments to magnet or year - round schools must be voluntary , he said , citing a 2004 state law that said public schools should begin classes no earlier than Aug. 25 and end no later than June 10 .
" The Wake County Board of Education lacks the statutory authority to convert traditional - calendar schools to mandatory year - round .
Thus , the board of education may not require the attendance of students at year - round calendar schools without informed parental consent , " he ruled .
About 20,000 families would have been be affected by the conversions .
" We 'd like to thank Judge Manning for protecting the right of children to an equal - opportunity education , " said Kathleen Brennan of WakeCares .
" The No. 1 thing that strikes me is never underestimate the determination of some mommas , " Apex Mayor Keith Weatherly said about the parents ' victory in the suit .
School district administrators said converting the schools is necessary to create enough seats for an expected 8,000 new students in the fall .
Year - round schools can handle more students because students are separated into four groups with rotating schedules , with three in class and one on break at all times .
Without the conversions , schools might have to run on split schedules , with some students attending early - morning classes and others going to school in the afternoon and evening , district officials have said .
Manning 's ruling opens the door to a possible legislative battle for the district , which could turn to lawmakers to obtain the statutory authority for the year - round conversions .
WakeCares members complained Thursday that district administrators did n't prepare a back - up plan in the event they lost the lawsuit .
Now , they said , thousands of students and families are left in limbo as the district scrambles to make up ground .
" We are extremely sorrowful if this is going to cause any kind of problem for families that have made plans because we know what that is like , " said Patrice Lee of WakeCares .
" This is a false crisis made up by the school system for whatever reason , " Weatherly said .
A day at Intel
At the Research@Intel day last week , Intel had a huge array of technologies and active research initiatives on display for press and analysts .
As I toured the company 's Santa Clara offices , I was able to piece together a few major themes and directions by stepping back and looking at the places where Intel is currently focusing its forward - looking research .
In my next few articles , starting with this one , I 'll take an in - depth look at each of these themes and at what it tells us about where computing is headed in the next decade .
I 'm going to start this series with a discussion of power , because — as boring as it is to the performance - oriented enthusiast crowd — plain old wattage is the metric that constrains all others in the realm of computing for the foreseeable future .
So much of what Intel showed at their research day had power as either a primary or a secondary theme that it 's worth taking some time to look at a few of their power - related research projects .
I also had some on - background conversations with current and former employees of companies with names you 'd recognize , and those chats also had power consumption as a major theme .
In short , everyone that I talked to in Silicon Valley is thinking about power in some form or another : how to generate it , how to save it , and how to wring the most out of every watt .
So let 's talk power .
The basics of dynamic power optimization
I said in my recent Griffin / Puma article that the key to power optimization lies in turning off components when they 're not in use .
But in addition to turning off components that are n't in use , you also have to be able to detect when part of a device is heating up for some reason so that you can shut that device down and move its work elsewhere .
So to flesh out our abstract picture of power optimization , we can say that the essence of power optimization lies in dynamically adapting hardware to fit two primary constraints :
Dynamic workload : Power usage must match the ever - changing demands of whatever task the device is currently carrying out Fixed thermal envelope :
The temperature of the device must not exceed a certain ceiling .
So the art of dynamic power optimization is about tuning the voltage and / or current going into a device in real - time in order to meet those two constraints .
But enough with the generalities for now .
Let 's take a look at some of Intel 's research efforts to see these principles in action .
I 'll also draw some more general conclusions about power optimization and computing technology in general at the close of this article .
Processor - level power optimization
As I 've reported before , Intel 's Terascale program is a network on a chip ( NoC ) that consists of multiple different types of processing elements arranged in a grid configuration . *
The silicon die containing this grid of elements — or " tiles , " as Intel prefers to call them — is stacked directly on top of a chunk of RAM , and connections go vertically downwards from the router embedded in each tile into the RAM array so that the tiles can dip into this large pool of shared memory beneath them .
* Note :
Once again , I am compelled by inaccurate tech press coverage of Intel 's research day to point out to the press , analysts , and anyone else who'll listen : Larrabee is not " the first Terascale product " or any such nonsense .
Larrabee is a many - core product family that will first see the light of day in GPU form .
Terascale is a multifaceted research initiative , and though there 's a chance that one or two technologies developed under its auspices will make it into the first Larrabee part , it is not equivalent to Larrabee .
So please make it stop , and please see this article for more on the relationship between the two .
Perhaps the most important way that the Intel Terascale prototype , called " Polaris , " controls power across the chip is by turning each tile on or off depending on its usage level and temperature level .
So if a core is idle , then it can be put into one of two low - power sleep states ; likewise , if one of the many thermal sensors scattered throughout the Polaris die reports that the area of the chip containing that core is too hot , that core is turned off .
If a core is shut down due to overheating , Polaris will try to transfer its work to one of the other cores in a cooler area of the chip .
This way , work can be dynamically moved around the chip from tile to tile in order to adapt to changing thermal conditions .
One such thermal condition that may need adapting to is a hotspot in the large RAM cache beneath the Polaris die .
Such a hotspot could arise from multiple , repeated accesses to a particular part of the memory array due to locality of reference .
Polaris could shut down the tiles over this hotspot and move their work elsewhere until things cool down .
Note that cores can turn themselves and each other off , so Polaris does n't need one master core to control the thermal management across the chip .
If the cores have access to the thermal sensors , then they can work with each other to move the workload around in response to changing thermal conditions .
Datacenter - level power optimization
This notion of workloads moving to match to changing thermal conditions is also being enacted at the datacenter level , with a suite of large - scale power - management technologies that Intel is working on in conjunction with a long list of partners ( IBM and Microsoft among them ) .
In a nutshell , the idea behind Intel 's Group - Enabled Management System ( GEMS ) is much the same as what I described above for Polaris , except at the server level .
GEMS servers are able to communicate with each other in order to move workloads around to units that are either underutilized or overheated .
For instance , if an air conditioning unit goes out in one part of the datacenter , then those servers can use virtualization to pass their workloads on to servers in another location before switching themselves off .
Individual servers that are running the GEMS agent can organize themselves into functional groups and elect a group leader that does thermal monitoring and power optimization for the entire group .
A key hardware part of this picture is a special instrumented power supply , which can give out information on exactly how much power the system is drawing at any given moment .
This way , the power optimization software ( and the datacenter administrators ) can get precise , real - time data on power usage for every server in the system , enabling them to adjust server workloads and actual power usage dynamically over the course of the day .

Facebook Circuit City Stores ' ( CC ) decision to lay off 3,400 employees in order to hire lower - paid replacements is raising questions about the impact of severe cost - cutting on employee morale .
The consumer electronics retailer announced Wednesday that it was immediately firing store associates " who were paid well above the market - based salary range for their role . "
New workers will be paid less , although Circuit City did not reveal the pay of the workers .
Laying off workers who earn higher pay raises the risk of deflating the morale of employees who are left behind , says Penelope Trunk , author of Brazen Careerist : The New Rules for Success .
" People left behind are probably thinking they do n't have a future there , " Trunk says .
ON DEADLINE BLOG : Some eye - openers about Circuit City situation
Those hourly workers who are laid off will get severance packages and can apply for open positions after 10 weeks .
" We have and continue to pay competitive wages in the stores across the country , but we have to control costs , " Circuit City spokesman Jim Babb says .
" We 've got to get our stores to adhere to wage ranges . "
The layoffs could have broad impact : • Copycats .
Other employers could follow Circuit City 's lead .
Many already are trying to curtail compensation costs .
Seven percent of companies plan to trim staff levels during the second quarter of 2007 , according to a survey by Manpower .
" If lower - cost labor is available , it 's the right thing to do .
They 're not a charity , " says Francie Dalton of Columbia , Md. , president of Dalton Alliances , a management consultancy .
" If it was your business and you have lower - cost labor available , you should do the same thing . "
• Employee morale .
After layoffs , companies must deal with a demoralized workforce by reassuring them that the decision is in the best interest of the company and those left behind .
" You have to reassure ( the remaining workers ) that , ' You 're OK , and we 're a stronger company now , ' " says Paul Endress , president and CEO of Maximum Advantage , a Harrisburg , Pa. - based company that focuses on applying psychology to hiring and retaining workers .
• Waning productivity .
Employees left behind or rehired later at lower wages could struggle with productivity , which is common in the wake of corporate cost-cutting .
Circuit City , which like other electronics retailers faces stiff competition , reported a loss for its most recent quarter ended Nov. 30 , and its stock price has fallen 39 % from its 52 - week high .
Its share price rose Wednesday to $ 19.23 , up 1.9 % Contributing : Jayne O'Donnell Copyright 2007 The Associated Press .

There ’s a perfectly good reason that war supporters , from McCain to Petraeus , are scrambling to lower expectations for September — the surge policy is n’t working .
Three months after the start of the Baghdad security plan that has added thousands of American and Iraqi troops to the capital , they control fewer than one - third of the city ’s neighborhoods , far short of the initial goal for the operation , according to some commanders and an internal military assessment .
The American assessment , completed in late May , found that American and Iraqi forces were able to “ protect the population ” and “ maintain physical influence over ” only 146 of the 457 Baghdad neighborhoods .
In the remaining 311 neighborhoods , troops have either not begun operations aimed at rooting out insurgents or still face “ resistance , ” according to the one - page assessment , which was provided to The New York Times and summarized reports from brigade and battalion commanders in Baghdad .
According to the NYT report , much of this is due to the shortcomings of Iraqi security forces , which were supposed to help make the policy effective .
Since the start of the surge , these forces , promised by the Maliki government , either have n’t shown up or have n’t been able to do anything .
Basic tasks , such as manning checkpoints and conducting patrols , have proven too challenging for Iraqi police and army units .
( ” That is forcing American commanders to conduct operations to remove insurgents from some areas multiple times , ” the NYT added . )
As for the politics of all of this , when the White House unveiled its surge policy in January , they raised expectations .
Lawmakers ( and the nation ) were told that we ’d start to see progress quickly .
Benchmarks were laid out , highlighting what we could expect to see .
Creating a stable security environment in Baghdad , for example , was supposed to be complete in July .
Then it was September .
Now , it ’s nowhere in sight .
Stasi scent - tracking methods are being used to keep a check on selected protesters planning to demonstrate at next month 's G8 summit .
Scent traces collected directly from everything from people 's palm sweat to their vests and cigarette lighters have been made available to investigators so that sniffer dogs can detect potentially violent protesters , federal prosecutors confirmed yesterday following reports in the German media .
" This has happened to several suspects , " said Andreas Christeleit , a spokesman for the prosecutors .
It is believed that most samples were collected during recent early - morning raids across Germany .
The revelations have immediately led to comparisons with the methods of the former East Germany 's secret police , the Stasi , who habitually collected the scents of dissidents to identify suspects at a later date .
It was thought that such chilling espionage techniques had been consigned to history .
But the news that similar methods are to be deployed at the upcoming summit in a democratic Germany has further angered activists already fuming over the construction of a 7.5 - mile barbed - wire fence around the venue , at Heiligendamm on the Baltic coast .
" [ This is ] another step away from a democratic state of law towards a preventive security state , " said Petra Pau , a member of the opposition Left party .
" A state that adopts the methods of the East German Stasi robs itself of every legitimacy . "
But according to experts it is as legal as collecting fingerprints .
Scientists looking to expand the use of smell banks say it is possible to determine someone 's age , their sex and any illnesses they might have through traces of their body odour .
A 68 - year - old atomic energy protester from Hamburg , identified by police as a possible danger to the G8 summit , reported how investigators knocked on his door at 8 am and demanded scent samples from him .
The man said he was made to hold metal pipes in his hands - as palms give off an immediate scent - which were then sealed and marked with his name before being taken away .
The police have responded to the reports by saying that they are trying to find out the sender of letters confessing to 14 arson attacks in the Hamburg and Berlin areas which are believed to be connected to the anti-G8 movement .
They hope that a scent register will help them to do so .
Police say they suspect that the same people are planning fire bombs and other attacks on the June 6 - 8 meeting .
Summit opponents are trying through the courts to lift a ban on a so - called " star march " planned at Heiligendamm on June 7 , introduced after an interior ministry decision to prevent protesters coming within five miles of the resort .
The number of car burnings in Berlin has risen considerably over the past fortnight as tension rises , as have incidences of anti-G8 graffiti .

Dyslexia is a social fig leaf used by middle - class parents who fear their children will be labelled as low achievers , a professor has claimed .
Julian Elliott , a leading educational psychologist at Durham University , says he has found no evidence to identify dyslexia as a medical condition after more than 30 years of research .
" There is a huge stigma attached to low intelligence , " he said .
" After years of working with parents , I have seen how they do n't want their child to be considered lazy , thick or stupid .
" If they get called this medically diagnosed term , dyslexic , then it is a signal to all that it 's not to do with intelligence . "
He added : " There are all sorts of reasons why people do n't read well but we can't determine why that is .
Dyslexia , as a term , is becoming meaningless . "
One in ten people in the UK - including 375,000 schoolchildren - has been diagnosed with dyslexia .
The condition is said to impair short - term memory and the ability to read , write , spell and do maths .
Supporters of the condition argue that dyslexics are intelligent people who have difficulties processing information and need extra help and time than others who are poor readers .
But Professor Elliott has claimed that the symptoms of dyslexia - such as clumsiness and letter reversal - are similar to those seen in those who simply cannot read .
He argues that the condition should be rediagnosed as a reading difficulty .
His comments provoked fury among dyslexia campaigners .
John Rack , head of research and development at the charity Dyslexia Action , denied that the disability was a middle - class phenomenon .
He told The Times : " There is ample evidence that dyslexia exists across the spectrum and the argument that there is no consistent means of identifying it is one cited by people who do n't know enough about the subject . "
However , other experts have suggested that parents are putting their children forward for reading ability assessments to " get them off the hook " .
Dr Michael Rice , a dyslexia and literacy expert at Cambridge University , said : " There is a sense of justification when children are diagnosed .
" It gets them off the hook of great embarrassment and personal inadequacy . "
According to Professor Elliott , dyslexic university students are gaining an unfair advantage by getting extra time for their studies and many are getting diagnosed simply to get up to £ 10,000 worth of equipment including laptops and extra books .
University lecturers have complained about students " milking the system " by pretending they have the condition .
One lecturer who teaches in the South - East said :
" On one degree course I teach , about one quarter of the students get help with their coursework and other assistance because they have this label .
You become quite cynical . "
The number of students who receive disability allowances at university has risen to a record 35,500 at a cost of £ 78.4 million a year .
BANGALORE : Under a project facilitated by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , about 500 sex workers in Mysore own chip - embedded smart cards , which when presented during transactions help them get discounts at select shops and hotels and earn them loyalty points that can be redeemed for discounts on later purchases .
The shopping basket can include provisions , food at restaurants and clothes .
But the card serves another purpose .
It has the medical record of the sex worker , who has to compulsorily get his or her health check up at a clinic once in three months .
The card becomes inactive if the holder fails to do this .
The sex workers will be checked for sexually transmitted diseases ( STD ) and treatment provided if necessary .
The vendors and the health specialists are provided with Simputer , the homegrown handheld device developed by scientists at the Indian Institute of Science ( IISc ) , to bridge the digital divide and the data is stored in real time at a central server to maintain confidentiality .
The encrypted card bars access of health records by traders , while doctors cannot find out the business transaction details .
“ Sex workers face stigma and discrimination in their daily life .
The smart card is a symbol of self - esteem that creates a sense of inclusion for them in the society , ” Ratna , a community member at Ashodaya , a non-government organisation ( NGO ) that works on AIDS , said .
The smart card initiative is being implemented by Ashodaya Women ’s Co-ordination Committee , Karnataka Health Promotion Trust ( KHPT ) and Pennant Consulting Services .
KHPT reaches about 1400 female and around 200 male sex workers active in Mysore city and most of them conduct their business during the day .
They earn anywhere between Rs200 and Rs1,500 a day .
“ It is not uncommon for us to buy as many as three new saris a month .
Looking attractive is essential in our trade , ” Pushpa , a sex worker , said .
KHPT officials said that the smart card initiative came from discussion with the sex workers , who identified an incentive of discounts with a health card to be a better alternative than a pure health card .
For those of you who do n't know Pirates is perhaps the biggest and most expensive porn film to date starring some huge names in the Adult industry .
It 's won many an Adult Video ( it 's a throwback term ) Award and is rated highly .
Apparently so highly that an R rated version is to be released .
Now , again for those of you who do n't know , that means there will be no ponrographic elements and it will be deemed a mainstream movie .
The story comes from Cinematical who suggest this is the opposite way around for most mainstream movies , do n't they release an uncut special edition ?
This one is going to be a porn film that 's going to release a special edition with huge cuts , some 47 minutes out of 127 minutes total .
Now , saying that , it 's not really that much is it ?
So perhaps there 's are a lot of acting and story ?
We 're led to believe there is .
Very amusing indeed .
First they release the uncut Special Edition , then you get the fully cut version .
Either the mainstream has the model very wrong or the Adult Industry really does have it very right !
Could this really be a good movie without the adult part ?

Exclusive Nokia is one of the world 's best known brands , and spends a lot of money keeping it that way .
The Finnish giant splashed out £ 175 m ( $ 340 m ) on advertising alone last year .
Much of this advertising is designed to remind us that we 're inadequate unless we have one of its latest high - end pieces of gadgetry , which grow ever more sophisticated each year .
" It 's what computers have become , " the latest campaign reminds us .
As well as enormous brand advertising , Nokia seeds prototypes of these expensive toys with drooling bloggers in the hope their uncritical enthusiasm will catch on amongst the rest of us .
In fact , the conventional wisdom for many years has been that Nokia 's high - end , high - margin multimedia devices are the company 's future .
But the reality that 's emerging from the hard numbers tells a remarkably different story , we learn from a research note issued by Dresdner Kleinwort Investment Bank ( DKIB ) , and seen by The Register .
Nokia is now " reliant " on sub-€50 budget models , says DKIB Research .
And far from being the company 's past , cheapo handsets may be Nokia 's future .
Sub € 50 handsets grew to take up 42 per cent of Nokia 's sales in 2006 , the company 's CFO revealed last week .
If that 's true , DKIB says , " then , one can conclude , the lower priced segment made up all ( 100 per cent ) of Nokia 's shipment growth last year " .
DKIB extrapolates that Nokia 's sales of " above € 50 " remained flat at around 202 million units last year , which is a retreat in what is a growing market .
Or as the research note put it , " a volume share attrition to the tune of 200 bps [ base points ] as the market grew by around nine per cent " .
By contrast , Nokia 's thriving low - end added 500 bps last year .
Shipments doubled to 146 million , and Nokia commands two thirds of this budget market .
" If the current trend continues , then parity should soon be attained between the ' above ' and ' below ' € 50 product categories , " DKIB warns .
" Unless management takes special efforts to kick - start demand for the more luxurious models ( N95 , E - series , 8600 etc ) through dedicated marketing campaigns , we would anticipate the 200 m barrier to mark the ' point of cross - over ' . "
It 's a remarkable observation .
When we posted a piece a year ago entitled Whatever Happened To ... The Smartphone ? , we did n't expect this to happen , let alone so soon .
In 1988 , London 's Victoria and Albert Museum , with the help of advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi , began to brand itself as " an ace cafe with quite a nice museum attached " .
It 's going to be hard for us industry - watchers to start thinking of Nokia as a budget phone company with " a nice multimedia division attached " - but perhaps we should .
Phones ?
They 're what , er ... phones will become . ®
Gary burst into my office terror - stricken .
“ We 're out of money ! ” he croaked .
“ Already ? ” I gasped .
“ Did n't you just arrange an extended credit line last month ? ”
“ We maxed it out , ” he said
“ How is that possible ? ” I protested .
“ I thought it would last forever ! ”
“ So did I , but we 're adding customers much faster than projected , ” he replied .
“ And that 's bad ? ” I asked .
“ It is when our suppliers demand to be paid before we are able collect from our customers .
Plus we have to add more employees to handle the growth which also means more training , more desks , more computers , more phone lines , and stuff like that .
All that burns cash .
It 's a vicious cycle , ” he explained .
“ Did you call Art at the bank ? ” I asked .
“ Of course but he said no way . ”
“ Really ?
Maybe Cliff should call , ” I suggested .
“ He 's good at putting a favorable spin on things . ”
“ He already tried .
Art turned him down flat . ”
“ Now what ? ” I asked .
Gary shrugged .
I got up and walked into Cliff 's office .
Gary followed me .
Cliff was sitting in the center of a swirl of letters , contracts , memos , charts , print - outs , reports , trade journals , and books , all liberally flagged with Post - It notes .
A few clung to his computer monitor .
Cliff looked harried .
“ We 've got to sell stock this second !
Or we 're dead ! ”
Cliff declared , not mincing one word .
“ Finding investors will take weeks , even months , ” I countered .
“ And who 's got time to court investors , let alone put together a memorandum ?
Certainly not you . ”
“ We have no choice , so we may as well get started , ” argued Cliff .
“ Gary , how much time do we have before you guys start to squeak down there ? ” I asked .
“ There is no time left , ” said Gary .
“ One vendor is threatening to cut us off . ”
“ There 's got to be another way out , ” I said .
“ Like what ? ” Cliff asked irritably .
“ I 'll give Art another call , ” I said .
“ I 'll start by begging and go from there . ”
“ You 'd be wasting your time , ” said Cliff .
“ He was adamant .
He told me he wo n't even talk to us until we get a decent accounting system that can produce timely , accurate reports .
We 've got to sell shares .
End of story . ”
“ But if the bank hates our accounting system , what makes you think an investor will feel differently ? ” I went back in my office .
Not wanting anyone to overhear me grovel , I closed the door and reluctantly dialed Art 's direct line .
When he answered , I braced myself for an onslaught of angry words .
My quavering voice betrayed my nervousness .
“ Look , ” he said , getting straight to the point , “ I told Gary and I told Cliff , the bank wo n't lend you any more money until you can produce a complete picture of how you are doing financially .
I can't keep going to the well for you guys .
It 's getting ridiculous .
You have no substantiation .
I 'm looking like a fool in front of the loan committee .
You guys should just sell some stock . ”
“ How ? ” I asked .
“ Our accounting is a mess . ”
“ Change your accounting system , ” he said .
“ I wish it were that easy , ” I said .
“ Art , we are trying to solve that problem , but software vendors are telling us a new system will take many months to install , besides costing a bundle .
The trouble is , we 're desperate now and have no where else to turn . ”
Art sighed and was silent .
“ How much do you need ? ” he finally asked .
“ Gary told me $ 500,000 . ”
Art sighed again .
The pause was longer and more awkward .
I could n't take the silence any longer , so I just blurted out , “ We 're growing so darn fast that things keep exploding .
Not only have we blown out our accounting system , everything is strained to the breaking point – people , office space , phone system , computer network , cash flow , you name it .
We even have a parking space crisis .
Our database software can no longer handle the number of people who need to use it , plus we can't put any more new customers in it because it keeps crashing .
The vendor issued us some emergency Band - Aids , but they said that their software can't be pushed any further .
We had to divide it in two , and now customer service is toggling between two separate databases , which is a major headache .
Look , we started this company on a shoestring .
Now those early choices are killing us .
But who knew the business would take off like this ?
And even if we did , we did n't have the money back then to do anything differently .
Now we 're trying to find a comprehensive solution , but that is not easy . ”
Emotionally spent , I fell silent .
This time Art broke the silence .
“ Fred , ” he sighed , “ are you making money ? ”
His question took me aback .
“ I do n't know , ” I replied honestly .
“ And there 's no way of knowing .
The accounting system is next to useless … as you well know . ”
My response produced another abyss of dead air .
When
Art did n't speak , my heart dropped and my soul shrank .
I pondered the tragic irony that my business was going to fail because it was too successful .
And then ….
The Universe must have hiccupped .
God must have shot an air ball .
Or Mother Nature must have dropped a stitch .
I do n't know what caused it but a banker , and not just any banker mind you , but a slicked - down , big time , urban banker said something that was completely uncharacteristic of his profession .
“ Fred , ” Art asked , “ does it feeeeel like you 're making money ? ”
The earth froze in its orbit .
The cosmic flow of life jolted to a halt .
All sentient beings on the planet instantly stopped doing what they were doing and concentrated their full attention on this unprecedented rent in the space - time continuum .
Was the cosmos witnessing a great leap in the evolution of a species akin to the discovery of the wheel ?
Let me call a “ time out ” here to make a clarifying comment .
It is no secret that most businessmen live in the linear , logical , analytical world of their left brain hemispheres , bankers being a prime example of this mental functioning .
In fact , in my experience , all of Mercantile - dom worships the left hemisphere with such fervor that any expressions from the spatial , emotional , intuitive right hemisphere are either demeaned , defamed , degraded , denied , denigrated , discredited , dishonored , disgraced , or discounted as having no value whatsoever .
For me , that is a problem .
It is a problem because the right hemisphere is where I have set up shop .
My left one is , well , to be charitable , not very alert .
Alas , no amount of schooling , tutoring , effort , concentration , reading , vitamins , or flagellation , self - imposed or externally administered , has been able to wake it up .
Linear thought , logic , sustained attention span , and retention of information are daily casualties of my left hemispheric sluggishness .
Now , here was a banker , in direct contravention to his genetic underpinnings , his psychological make - up , and his educational upbringing , attempting non-linear communication .
My drowsy intellect notwithstanding , I am able to recognize a hanging curveball in my wheelhouse when I see one .
When I heard his question , my eyes grew as big as Frisbees and I whacked that pitch into the bleachers in left center field .
“ Well , it feeeeeels like we are making money , ” I answered with Pavarotti - like sincerity , my moist eyes glistening with fresh , heart - felt tears .
Again there was a long pause .
I heard Art exhaling resignedly .
“ I need some numbers , ” he said .
“ So just send me something .
Anything !
Even if it is on the back of an envelope . ”
I hung up the phone in stunned disbelief .
I sprung out of my chair and danced euphorically all the way to Gary 's office where I delivered a blow - by - blow description of my phone conversation .
I ended with a flourish as I dramatically said those most improbable words “ even if it is on the back of an envelope . ”
I was floating in ecstasy .
I had just been validated .
My gangly , touchy - feely , open style of functioning succeeded where the polished , spin-doctored , MBA approach failed .
Art over - nighted the documents but before he did he made it unambiguously clear that this was the absolute last time he would go to bat for us until we got our accounting in order .
I thanked him profusely and promised we would never put him in such an untenable position again .
Three weeks passed .
Gary burst into my office panic - stricken .
“ We 're out of money ! ” he cried .
I blanched .
“ How can that be ? ”
“ Same story as before .
We 're outgrowing our cash flow . ”
“ How much do we need now ? ” I asked
“ $ 750,000 , ” he responded .
I winced .
“ Did you call Art ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ And ? ”
“ He got angry and I had to hear him scream about how he told us last time was THE last time , ” said Gary .
“ Did you get Cliff to call ? ”
“ Yes . ”
“ And ? ”
“ He got angrier still . ”
“ Hoo boy , ” I exhaled .
Cliff exploded into my office .
“ We 've got to sell stock , ” he declared .
“ Maybe I should call Art , ” I said .
Disgusted , Cliff spun on his heels and left .
“ No , no , no , no , a thousand times no ! ”
Art barked .
“ I told you three weeks ago that was the last time .
I can NOT go to the loan committee again .
I can't .
And I wo n't .
Period .
Sorry , but period , ”
“ I know you can't , ” I said as despair flooded my body .
“ We did n't know where to turn and you were our last hope . ” I said .
“ Do you have any advice for us ?
Can you at least point us in a right direction ? ”
No words were spoken .
The moment was supercharged with emotion – my hopelessness and his anger .
“ How much are we talking about ? ” he finally asked .
“ $ 750,000 , ” I said .
“ $ 750,000 ? ” he demanded .
“ Are you sure that 's what you need ? ”
“ That 's what Gary told me , ” I answered .
“ This stinks , ” he spat .
“ You know this really stinks . ”
“ I know , ” I said .
There was a long stretch of silence .
I heard computer keys being clicked in the background .
I thought he had ended the call and forgot to hang up .
“ Art ? ” I inquired .
“ Wait , ” he said irritably and typed some more .
When he came back on the phone his mood had mollified .
“ Why do n't you borrow it from yourself ? ”
Art finally asked .
“ You have got to be kidding , ” I said .
“ None of us have that kind of money . ”
“ I do n't mean from yourselves personally , I mean from your business .
I just checked your average daily cash balance and it appears you guys never dip below $ 775,000 .
Since that is what you need , why do n't you just borrow it from yourself ? ” he suggested .
“ How ? ” I asked naively .
“ By managing your cash more tightly , ” he responded .
“ I do n't understand , ” I confessed , knowing full well I was appearing hopelessly stupid – a sure way to scaring off what little confidence Art had in me .
“ I do n't know what an average daily cash balance is or what it means to manage cash more tightly . ”
“ It means you guys always have at least $ 775,000 in your account with us at any given time .
You just have to manage your cash more tightly , ” he said putting a Monty - Pythonesque hint - hint - nudge - nudge emphasis on his last words .
“ But we 've already written checks against that money .
It 's just those checks have n't cleared yet , ” I said innocently .
“ But if you manage your cash more tightly , you 'd have the money you require , ” he said impatiently .
I was at a loss not grasping what he was telling me .
It seemed so inconsistent to my conception of how bankers thought .
“ Are you suggesting we kite checks ? ” I asked in astonishment .
“ Absolutely not , ” he protested .
“ I 'm simply suggesting that you manage your cash more tightly , ” he said once more , enunciating the last five words slowly and deliberately .
I definitely was not seeing any difference between kiting checks and managing cash more tightly , so I asked a clarifying question .
“ Let 's say , hypothetically speaking , ” I began , “ that in the process of managing our cash more tightly we accidentally slip up and a check clears sooner than we planned and we end up writing a check that exceeds our cash balance by say …. ”
“ By say $ 250,000 , ” Art interrupted .
I was blindsided by his example as I was about to say $ 25 .
“ Okay , let 's say we bounce checks for $ 250,000 more than we have in our account , would you guys cover them ? ” I asked .
“ Yes , ” he responded .
“ But we 'd have to pay interest on them , right ? ” I naturally assumed .
“ No , ” Art said .
“ No ? ” I asked surprised .
“ What would happen then ?
We 'd have to pay some kind of penalty , right ? ”
“ You 'd have to pay an overdraft fee , ” he explained patiently .
“ How much is that ? ” I asked girding myself emotionally against what was sure to be an astronomical figure that would make managing one 's cash more tightly both too risky and highly impractical , given our slipshod accounting system .
“ Thirty five dollars , ” Art said .
“ Thirty five dollars ! ” I shrieked .
“ We bounce a check for $ 250,000 and we only have to pay $ 35 ? ”
“ That 's right , ” said Art .
My brain swooned as all the implications clamored in .
“ All right then , ” I said warming to the lesson and feeling a lot more cocky , “ how many times , hypothetically speaking of course , could we bounce a check of this magnitude before the bank got irritated with us ? ”
“ Let me put it this way , ” Art answered , “ I would n't make a regular habit of it if I were you . ”
I hung up the phone dazed .
Art , who was incensed with us for wanting to come in through the front door , was now enthusiastically waving us down the alley and through the back door .
To this day I shake my head in disbelief .
If it was n't for the integrated hemispheric functioning of Art 's brain ( and heart ) , we 'd have died ingloriously in mid-sprint .
His heaven - sent strategy of managing cash tightly gave us enough money , time , and flexibility to continue operations and get our financial house in order .
We did not require further loans and were able to obtain a mezzanine investment of $ 20 million before eventually taking the company public .
Art saw that my enterprise had caught a major wave .
Everyone did .
That was never the issue .
I think what ultimately convinced
Art to give us more chances was my guileless approach in discussing the business .
I never tried to hide our many warts .
I discussed them frankly .
And I suspect that was refreshingly rare given all the spin and hand - waving he must have been exposed to by countless other businessmen .
Epilogue
It should be fairly obvious that Art 's corpuscles were far too oxygenated to be suited for a blue - blooded profession like banking .
Predictably he ended up leaving his bank 's employ , on excellent terms I hasten to add , to join the ranks of us wild - eyed entrepreneurs and start his own company .
He must have seen how quickly he was able to turn our shrieks of terror into rollercoaster - induced squeals of delight and I guess that he thought it looked like fun being one of the screamers .
In any event , with his new entrepreneurial endeavor , I hope he finds a banker who can rescue him as frequently and as creatively as he did for us .

Symbolic programming has been a core idea in Mathematica since the very beginning .
But it is a big idea and an abstract idea .
And people understandably just want to know what the bottom - line benefit is , and could care less about what went into making it happen .
Fortunately , Mathematica 6 is making it a lot easier to illustrate ideas about symbolic computation in visual and interactive forms .
High - Level Functions
For starters , illustrating the core programming primitives with visual examples is a piece of cake with the new graphics and typesetting functions .
For example , Map will take a function and apply it to each element in a list :
NestList will take a function and apply it over and over again to the initial seed , returning a list of all the iterations :
Programming in Mathematica is based on transforming trees .
The built - in function TreeForm allows us to visually represent the tree backbone of Mathematica programs and data structures :
System - Wide Design and Integration
The symbolic language of Mathematica allows us to create simple structures that are then highly integrated everywhere in the system .
There are lots of good examples in mathematics and in programming ( for example Piecewise ) , but user - interface structures make the point in a visual way .
Take , for example , Tooltip , which is used inside documents and inside 2D and 3D graphics — even functions like Plot can use it to automatically “ tooltip ” different curves .
Here is a minimal Tooltip illustrating its syntax :
The various plotting functions have been taught about Tooltip , so Mathematica will compute the curve using a variety of technologies and then apply Tooltip appropriately to the resulting graphics :
If you are constructing your own graphics out of a set of pieces , you can just wrap Tooltip around any polygon or other shape , and its location and behavior will be automatically taken care of .
Here we build up a map of Africa , using each country ’s flag as its Tooltip :
One thing I really appreciate from a design standpoint is that buttons and mouseovers work in exactly the same way , using the same minimal syntax .
For example , if we want the countries to highlight when we mouse over them , we just make a Mouseover with a polygon in a different color :
What makes this possible is the fact that Tooltip and other such features are not merely functions or objects — they ’re lightweight declarative descriptions that can easily be passed around from one structure to the next .
They have simple , clear meanings , and there is no overhead involved in setting them up .
Therefore , it ’s easy to incorporate them into the design of other functions , essentially “ teaching ” different parts of the system — like graphics , or plotting functions — about their existence .
Ridiculous Levels of Generality for Free
Mathematica ’s use of symbolic programming allows its algorithms to operate at the appropriate level of abstraction .
This makes code simpler , cleaner and more general .
For example , this algebraic expansion does n’t care what abstract entities it is dealing with :
A somewhat more useful example is drawing a graph , where we want the nodes to be represented by graphics :
The fact that the GraphPlot function can trivially accommodate graphics in its syntax is just one of many useful consequences of the generality of Mathematica , as is the fact that I can take those graphics from anywhere and just paste them in as arguments to the function as if they were text as an alternative to laboriously using code to get them to massage into the right place in some complicated structure .
I ’ll be writing more about symbolic programming in the future , particularly on what symbolic programming really means and how its structures compare to other languages .
Watch this broadcast of tonight 's ABC News report on the Foley scandal .
Denny Hastert is done as House speaker .
Hastert is through .
ABC is reporting that not only did GOP staff know about Foley in 2001 - 2002 , but some people in that class got predatory emails from Foley .
And do n't forget , the instant message chat from 2003 and the emails from 2005 would never have happened had they dealt with Foley in 2001 when they knew about it .
Take this instant message exchange between Foley and yet another child , AFTER the GOP already knew he was trouble , AFTER the GOP had already warned children to stay away from him .
According to ABC , Foley was talking about the boy 's penis .
Denny Hastert and John Boehner , and Alexander and Reynolds and Shimkus all must have known about Foley 's behavior long behavior the last kid complained in 2005 - the kid they ignored because Foley told them it was nothing .
It is simply not credible that the House leadership knew nothing about Foley 's past .
From ABC
News ( note : this is NOT the transcript from tonight 's ABC News report , watch the video above , it 's FAR WORSE :
A Republican staff member warned Congressional pages five years ago to watch out for Congressman Mark Foley , according to a former page .
Matthew Loraditch , a page in the 2001 - 2002 class , told ABC News he and other pages were warned about Foley by a supervisor .
Loraditch , the president of the Page Alumni Association , said the pages were told " do n't get too wrapped up in him being too nice to you and all that kind of stuff . "
The Office of Vice President Dick Cheney proposed to abolish the Information Security Oversight Office ( ISOO ) , the executive branch organization that oversees the national security classification system , after its Director insisted that the Vice President comply with reporting requirements that apply to all executive branch entities .
Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , the chairman of the House Oversight Committee who revealed the move today , said in a letter to the Vice President ( pdf ) that it “ could be construed as retaliation ” against ISOO .
The proposed change in ISOO ’s status was ultimately rejected by an interagency review group which is considering revisions to the executive order on classification policy .
The dispute between ISOO and the Office of the Vice President was prompted by a complaint filed with ISOO by the Federation of American Scientists in May 2006 ( Secrecy News , 05/31/06 ) .
The FAS complaint ( pdf ) noted that the OVP had ceased to comply with its obligation to submit an annual report on classification and declassification activity , and asked the ISOO Director to enforce the requirement .
When the OVP continued to resist compliance , ISOO Director J. William Leonard formally asked the Attorney General in January 2007 ( pdf ) to intervene and to render an interpretation of the executive that would resolve the dispute in one direction or another .
A truncated copy of the ISOO letter to the Attorney General , with two attachments missing , was released by Rep. Waxman today .
A complete copy of the January 9 , 2007 letter is available here .
The Attorney General has not responded to the ISOO letter .
Energy Affordable Mass Market LED
Lights on the Way By Ryan McGreal
Published February 23 , 2007
( this article has been updated )
The folks at treehugger just reported that a company in The Netherlands has launched a new LED light , called the " Pharox " , which generates as much light as a 40 watt bulb but uses only 3.4 watts .
A pack of four costs € 22.68 .
That 's $ 8.63 Cdn per bulb .
Granted , that sounds like a lot of money , but as always with these matters , it 's important to pay attention to the lifecycle costs , not just the initial capital cost .
A three - way comparison between LEDs , compact fluorescent lights ( CFL ) and incandescent light bulbs ( ILB ) is in order .
Purchase Costs
Because LEDs and CFLs have a much longer lifespan than ILB , we need to calculate the lifetime costs of replacing the lights .
Let 's start with LEDs , which have the longest lifespan .
Because the LED actually produces less light than the other two , I bumped the price up to an even $ 10 for the sake of comparison .
LED : lasts 60,000 hours .
At $ 10.00 per light , it costs $ 10 for 60,000 hours .
CFL : lasts 10,000 hours .
At $ 10.00 per light , it costs $ 60 for 60,000 hours .
ILB : lasts 1,000 hours .
At $ 0.50 per light , it costs $ 30 for 60,000 hours .
Energy Costs
So far , LEDs are ahead .
However , we also have to calculate the lifetime energy costs of operating the lights .
For the sake of this example , I used $ 0.10 per kilowatt - hour .
Bear in mind that over the next twenty years , that price is ridiculously optimistic ; we will more likely be paying at least triple that price , either directly in our hydro bills or indirectly through tax subsidies .
Note : the featured LED is 3.4 watts but only produces light equivalent to a 40 watt bulb .
For the sake of comparison , I calculated that an LED producing light equivalent to a 60 watt bulb would require 5.1 watts .
So :
LED : 5.1 watts * 60,000 hours = 306 kilowatt - hours .
At 10 cents per kilowatt - hour , you 'll pay $ 30.60 to run an LED for 60,000 hours .
CFL : 16 watts * 60,000 hours = 960 kilowatt - hours .
At 10 cents per kilowatt - hour , you 'll pay $ 96.00 to run CFLs for 60,000 hours .
ILB : 60 watts * 60,000 hours = 3600 kilowatt - hours .
At 10 cents per kilowatt - hour , you 'll pay a whopping $ 360.00 to run incandescent bulbs for 60,000 hours .
Total Costs
Now we can add up the purchase price and usage price for each light over 60,000 hours to get the total price .
Light Types Total Cost Comparison Light Purchase Price Usage Price Total LED $ 10.00 $ 30.60 $ 40.60 CFL $ 60.00 $ 96.00 $ 156.00 ILB $ 30.00 $ 360.00 $ 390.00
Over the 60,000 hour life of an LED light , you 'll save $ 115.40 compared to CFL , and $ 349.40 compared to ILB .
Hmmm , tough decision .
Update : A reader noticed that my summary table erroneously listed the total purchase costs of a CFL as $ 10 instead of $ 60 .
I 've corrected this .
Thanks for pointing it out ! - R .
Update 2 : A few commenters have suggested that $ 10 per CFL is too much money .
The last time I bought CFLs was a couple of years ago and they were that much back then .
For the sake of argument , I re-calculated the Cost Comparison based on $ 3 per CFL .
Replace six times , that works out to $ 18 .
Light Types Total Cost Comparison , $ 3/CFL Light Purchase Price Usage Price Total LED $ 10.00 $ 30.60 $ 40.60 CFL $ 18.00 $ 96.00 $ 114.00 ILB $ 30.00 $ 360.00 $ 390.00
As you can see , at $ 114 total cost , CFL is still considerably more expensive .

Wenn Terror nicht reicht , sollen nun Tauschbörsen herhalten Twister ( Bettina Winsemann )
Thilo Weichert : " Es gibt keinen Grund für den Bundestag , eine grundrechtswidrige Vorgabe aus Brüssel umzusetzen "
Terrorgefahr ist als Argument für die geplante Vorratsdatenspeicherung ( VDS ) offensichtlich nicht mehr ausreichend .
Doch mögliche Urheberrechtsverletzungen durch Tauschbörsen sind offensichtlich ein noch weit schlagkräftiger Grund und sollen die ungeliebte Richtlinie nun legalisieren .
Nachdem die Richtlinie zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung in Brüssel abgesegnet wurde , steht die praktische Umsetzung in Deutschland bevor .
Der Bundestag hat sich zuvor bereits für die Umsetzung der Richtlinie ausgesprochen und schob den Zwang durch Brüssel als Begründung vor .
Ein Argument , welches Dr. Thilo Weichert nicht nachvollziehen kann .
Im Interview mit Telepolis spricht der oberste Datenschützer Schleswig - Holsteins über die Gefahren und die eigentliche Intention hinter der Vorratsdatenspeicherung .
Der Bundestag hat am 16.02.2006 beschlossen , die EU - Richtlinie zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung umzusetzen .
Kurz darauf wurde sie in Brüssel abgesegnet .
Der Bundestag war noch 2005 gegen eine Vorratsdatenspeicherung .
Warum dieser Meinungswandel ?
Was hat sich seitdem geändert ?
Thilo Weichert : Neu sind die verbindlichen europäischen Vorgaben .
Nicht geändert haben sich die verfassungsrechtlichen Hindernisse auf nationaler wie auf europäischer Ebene .
Es gibt und gab keinen Grund für den Bundestag , eine grundrechtswidrige Vorgabe aus Brüssel umzusetzen .
Gerade in Deutschland haben ja der ehemalige Innenminister Otto Schily und die Justizministerin Frau Zypries tatkräftig daran mitgewirkt , dass die VDS über den EU - Weg dann für Deutschland verbindlich wird .
Dies insbesondere , nachdem der Bundestag sich gegen die VDS ausgesprochen hatte .
Diese " Politikwäsche " wird ja auch von den Kritikern stets angesprochen , weil sie den deutschen Bürgern dann suggeriert , man würde völlig machtlos sein gegenüber den Brüsselschen Vorgaben .
Jörg
Tauss hat dies ja nach der Abstimmung so formuliert : „ Ich halte das ( die VDS ) in der Tat für einen Anschlag auf Bürgerrechte und auf Datenschutz in Europa , der inakzeptabel ist ; da stimme ich den Kritikern zu .
Mit dieser Bewertung komme ich jetzt aber nicht weiter .
Wir haben diese Richtlinie nun einmal umzusetzen .
Würden
Sie deswegen nicht auch konstatieren , dass sich hier etwas an der Lage geändert hat ?
Wir müssen eine Richtlinie umsetzen , ob sie uns gefällt oder nicht . “
Ist diese Machtlosigkeit nicht eigentlich nur vorgeschoben ?
Thilo Weichert : Ich nehme Jörg Tauss ab , dass er sich gezwungen fühlt .
Trotzdem kann ich seine Konsequenz , nämlich zuzustimmen , nicht nachvollziehen .
Deutsches und europäisches Verfassungsrecht und das eigene Gewissen sollten einem fragwürdig zustande gekommenen EU - Beschluss vorgehen .
Bei vielen in der Regierung und in den Regierungsfraktionen in Deutschland glaube ich zwar , ein schlechtes Gewissen zu erkennen , aber inhaltlich volle Begeisterung angesichts der Nachhilfe aus Brüssel .
Seitens des Bundesjustizministeriums wird momentan die VDS als Maßnahme gegen Terror und Kindesmissbrauch definiert .
Die Empfehlung des Rechtsausschusses enthielt aber den Passus " auch anwendbar auf mittels Telekommunikation begangener Straftaten " .
Eine Pressemeldung des Bundesjustizministerium sagt dazu : " Zweck der Speicherung ist die Ermittlung , Aufdeckung und Verfolgung schwerer Straftaten , zu denen auch alle mittels Telekommunikation begangene Straftaten gehören "
Wie ist diese Aussage zu bewerten ?
Thilo Weichert : Die Ankündigung des Justizministeriums zeigt , dass es die verfassungsrechtlichen Bindungen und auch die Vorgaben in der Richtlinie , die versuchen , den Verhältnismäßigkeitsgrundsatz umzusetzen , nicht sehr ernst nimmt .
Uns Datenschützern ist von Anfang an klar gewesen , dass dieses neue Ermittlungsinstrument , einmal unter engen Konditionen eingeführt , sukzessive ausgeweitet werden wird .
Die Verfolgung von sog .
Urheberrechtsverstößen mit den Vorratsdaten steckt ja schon in der Pipeline .
Dass die Schamfrist so kurz ist , diesen Begehrlichkeiten nachzugeben , hätte ich nicht gedacht , ist aber ehrlich : Hier geht es nicht gegen Terroristen , sondern gegen das Herunterladen von Musik und künftig von Filmen .
Wo wäre denn die Gefahr eines direkten Auskunftsanspruches für die Contentindustrie ?
Vielfach wird ja schlichtweg argumentiert , dass die Contentindustrie ein Recht darauf hätte , schnell zu erfahren , wer hier Rechte verletzt .
Thilo Weichert :
Es kann doch nicht sein , dass die staatlich angeordnete zwangsweise Vorratsdatenspeicherung von 240 Millionen EU - Bürgern , die zu 99,99 % nichts mit Urheberrechtsverletzungen am Hut haben , genutzt wird , um fragwürdige private Interessen durchzusetzen .
Das " Quick Freeze " - Verfahren , welches beispielsweise in den USA angewandt wird , spielte in der Diskussion um die VDS nie eine Rolle .
Wie ist es zu erklären , dass selbst die USA , welche ja von den Attentaten des 11 .
September 2001 direkt betroffen waren und sind , auf eine derartige Maßnahme verzichten während sie auf europäischer Ebene konsequent weiterverfolgt wurde bis zur endgültigen Umsetzung ?
Thilo Weichert : Quick Freeze wurde von uns Datenschützern in der Debatte um die Vorratsspeicherung immer als eine mögliche Alternative dargestellt .
Dass diese nie ernsthaft erwogen wurde , könnte den Verdacht aufkommen lassen , dass es gar nicht nur um die Bekämpfung schwerer Straftaten geht .
Die USA folgten der praktischen Vernunft : Quick Freeze lässt sich real umsetzen – die Vorratsdatenspeicherung voraussichtlich nicht .
Meines Wissens sind die Länder , die heute schon solche Regelungen haben , bei der Umsetzung völlig im Schwimmen .
Es wird noch viel Hadern und Zähneklappern geben , wenn wirklich versucht werden sollte , das von der EU Beschlossene umzusetzen .
Aber diese praktischen Probleme sind kein wirklicher Schutz der Freiheitsrechte in der Informationsgesellschaft .
Das Bundesjustizministerium versichert in seiner Pressemitteilung , " Den Zugang der Strafverfolgungsbehörden zu diesen Daten müssen die Mitgliedstaaten unter Beachtung der Verhältnismäßigkeit , des Rechts der europäischen Union und des Völkerrechts , insbesondere der Europäischen Menschenrechtskonvention regeln .
Wie bislang schon wird auch künftig der Zugang zu solchen Daten grundsätzlich nur aufgrund eines richterlichen Beschlusses zulässig sein . "
Dennoch sehen viele die VDS als Zwischenschritt zum direkten Auskunftsanspruch der Contentindustrie auf Daten der TK - Nutzer .
So auch der Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragte .
Die Contentindustrie hat einen solchen Auskunftsanspruch schon oft gefordert .
Wie stehen nun die Chancen dafür ?
Ist eher damit zu rechnen oder kann man auf die zuvor erwähnte Versicherung , dass es beim richterlichen Beschluss bleibt , bauen ?
Thilo Weichert : Sämtliche Befürchtungen bzgl .
der Ausweitung der Datennutzung sind mehr als gut begründet .
Das Hoffen auf die abhaltende Wirkung von Richterbeschlüssen war in der Vergangenheit leider nicht immer berechtigt .
Dies gilt insbesondere in einem derartig techniklastigen Bereich wie hier .
Die von Björn Fay eingereichte Petition zur Vorratsdatenspeicherung hat bisher über 7.000 Mitzeichner .
Für Datenschützer und Bürgerrechtler stellt sich natürlich jetzt die Frage , welche Strategien und Gegenmaßnahmen überhaupt sinnvoll sind .
Neben der rein technischen Umgehung der Maßnahme durch Anonymisierer oder Proxies – was ist politisch gesehen jetzt überhaupt noch möglich ?
Thilo Weichert : Diese politische Diskussion hat erst angefangen .
Den Wenigsten ist bis heute klar , was da auf uns alle zukommt .
Dies muss und dies wird sich ändern .
Daher sind alle Diskussionsbeiträge und Aufklärungsaktionen nötig und sinnvoll .
Was kann jetzt der Einzelne noch tun ?
Vielfach hat sich jetzt ja die Ansicht " es ist sowieso alles zu spät , die Sache ist gelaufen " durchgesetzt .
Deutschland hat sich für die VDS entschieden , Brüssel hat Vorgaben geliefert .
Welche Möglichkeiten stehen denn noch offen ?
Wäre beispielsweise eine Verfassungsklage möglich und wie sind da die Erfolgschancen zu bewerten ?
Thilo Weichert : Ich halte alles für möglich :
Am unwahrscheinlichsten ist eine Klage gegen die Richtlinie vor dem Europäischen Gerichtshof ( EuGH ) direkt , weil es wohl keinen klagenden Staat geben wird .
Sehr wahrscheinlich halte ich aber einen Vorlagebeschluss , der zum EuGH geht .
Doch das wird leider etwas dauern .
Auch vermute ich , dass das Bundesverfassungsgericht bei einer Verfassungsbeschwerde gegen das nationale Umsetzungsgesetz bei allem Respekt vor dem Europarecht eine Grundrechtsprüfung durchführen wird .
Und die kann meines Erachtens nur negativ ausfallen .
Außerdem wird es noch viele praktische Hürden geben , die überklettert werden müssen .
Ein Nachbessern an der EU - Richtlinie halte ich dabei nicht für ausgeschlossen .

Fedora 7 , the latest version of the popular community - driven Linux distribution sponsored by Red Hat , was released this morning .
This is the first Fedora release to incorporate and unify both the Core and Extra platform components , thus obviating the need for the traditional inclusion of the word " Core " in the distribution 's name .
This is also the first release to be constructed with Fedora 's new build system , which will vastly simplify development of custom versions and derivatives .
" Beyond the usual set of upstream changes and improvements , our latest release is by far the most exciting and flexible to date , " comments Fedora Project leader Max Spevack .
" With our new open - source build process , our community of contributors will enjoy much greater influence and authority in advancing Fedora .
The ability to create appliances to suit very particular user needs is incredibly powerful . "
Fedora 7 features the latest versions of many popular open - source software programs , including GNOME 2.18 , KDE 3.5.6 , Xorg 7.2 , and version 2.6.21 of the Linux kernel , with integrated KVM virtualization support .
The version of Xorg 7.2 included in Fedora 7 features extensive support for display hot - plugging , a much - anticipated feature that will hopefully eliminate the need for frustrating Xorg configuration tweaking typically required for multiple monitor configurations and projector support .
Fedora 7 also includes the NetworkManager utility for improved wireless networking , a new SELinux graphical configuration tool , support for Fast User Switching , a new Firewire stack , and support for the experimental Nouveau driver , an open - source alternative to NVIDIA 's proprietary drivers that could eventually provide complete support for hardware - accelerated 3D rendering .
Comprehensive release notes are currently available but might not be for very long .
When Fedora Core 6 was released last year , content at the Fedora web site was accessible only intermittently as a result of heavy traffic .
ISO images are available from Fedora mirrors , but users will probably have better luck with torrents .

I argued on Tuesday that national security issues will continue to be a cornerstone of the 2008 election and that Democrats will need a more developed message to prevail than simply being " anti-war . "
A big part of that message needs to be how Democrats intend to deal with al Qaeda -- and not just al Qaeda in Afghanistan , where all the Democratic candidates seem eager to send more troops to engage in the fight -- but also al Qaeda in Iraq , where the organization has a very robust presence , is killing American troops , and will continue to foment serious problems for the foreseeable future .
Democrats seem to have an allergic reaction toward speaking about al Qaeda in Iraq .
( The words " al Qaeda " were uttered only twice by candidates in the South Carolina debate , one by Clinton discussing the 2001 attack on al Qaeda and the Taliban and once by Kucinich noting the lack of a pre-war al Qaeda / Iraq connection ) .
Perhaps we fear that mentioning al Qaeda in Iraq would ratify the fraudulent position taken by the Administration about a pre-war operational connection between al Qaeda and Saddam .
Perhaps we do n't mention al Qaeda 's presence in Iraq because it makes it more difficult to explain our position on troop withdrawals .
Whatever the reason , continuing to deny or ignore the reality that al Qaeda is causing grave damage in Iraq plays right into the Republican attack that Democrats " do not understand the full nature and scope of this terrorist war against us . "
The crazy thing about our hesitance is that we have a devastating story to tell about 1 ) how the Bush policies created an al Qaeda problem in Iraq when one did n't exist prior to the war , 2 ) how the mismanagement of the war allowed al Qaeda to gain a stronghold in Iraq and strengthen its organization and capacity , and 3 ) how Democrats are proposing a means for dealing with al Qaeda where the Republican strategy has failed for four years running .
Democrats ought to go out of their way to talk about al Qaeda in Iraq .
Here are my talking points on this :
** There were many problems in Iraq four years ago , but at least al Qaeda did not have a stronghold in that country , al Qaeda did not have free reign to foment sectarian violence , and al Qaeda was not training a new generation of fighters how to conduct jihad .
Today , we have all of these problems , thanks to the Republicans ’ failed policies for dealing with terrorism in Iraq .
** There was still not an al Qaeda problem in Iraq when the statute of Saddam fell .
But by failing to have enough troops to maintain order and disaffecting the Sunni population , Republican policies allowed al Qaeda to gain a constituency and a base of operations right under our noses .
** Republicans now claim that because their policies created a jihadi terrorist problem in Iraq , and they have now failed to eliminate the terrorist threat in Iraq for four years , we have no choice but to continue their failed policies .
** There is a better way .
And I will discuss that better way in my next post .
The internet has become easily accessible to everyone such that , even children have access to it .
These days , it is a source of worry to parents because , they feel the internet is depriving them from having real life experiences .
Asides gaming , the free time of kids is never left unoccupied , they use that time to surf the internet , blog , download and perform other activities online .
There are some warning signs which parents need to take note of in their children , to tell if they are addicted to the internet or not .
To start with , children who are addicted to the internet , tend to lose track of time when they are online .
The reason for this is not far - fetched .
The internet is a virtual space which has created a home - like safe atmosphere that plays on the psychology of everyone .
It takes a disciplined person to realize that it is falsehood .
For children , it is somewhat difficult for them to know that the internet is robbing them of reality .
Therefore , they can spend hours without knowing , and this prevents them from taking part in other profitable activities .
In addition to this , they become angry or sad whenever they have to let go of the internet .
When this sign is displayed in a kid , parents should act swiftly .
Such child would also go through his or her messages online , emails inclusive several times daily .
Also , children who are addicted to the internet , would prefer to spend time online instead of spending it with their family or friends .
Due to this , they become liars because they do not want their loved ones to have an idea of what they are doing online .
As a matter of fact , they go to the extent of sneaking to use the internet when there is no one around .
Parents need to solve this problem in kids , and one of the best ways is to address this problem by confronting their kid .
You need to put some measures in place to cut down on their internet time .
Parents also need to be internet - savvy , they need to learn how it works in this age , so that they can be able to effectively monitor their children .
Ah , if only Apple would 've stuck with PowerPC , maybe it could 've skipped the magical 3GHz mark and jumped straight to 4.7GHz .
Okay , that 's really just a cheap shot , but I could n't resist , given today 's major announcement by IBM that the 65nm POWER6 will not only debut next month at a stratospheric 4.7GHz , but it also shreds most of the relevant benchmarks .
But before we get into the details , let 's take a look at the basics of what was announced .
From IBM 's press kit , shorn of some of the marketspeak and with some of the details expanded :
Top frequency of 4.7GHz
> 790 million transistors
341 m m2 die size
65nm SOI process with ten layers of copper interconnect and a low -k dielectric on the first eight levels
Dual - core
Two - way simultaneous multithreading ( SMT ) on each core
Two memory controllers
Manufactured at IBM 's 300 mm semiconductor fab at East Fishkill , NY
With the exception of the actual top frequency number , all of the details above have been reported here previously .
In fact , you might recall that at this past year 's ISSCC , IBM claimed that POWER6 would debut north of the 5GHz mark , so Big Blue fell a bit short on that score .
But such a shortcoming is pretty forgivable when you consider the fact that POWER6 has the same number of pipeline stages as its predecessor ( 15 integer stages ) , and it does n't draw much more power .
My previous coverage of IBM 's ISSCC revelations mentioned that serious questions remain about the POWER6 core architecture ; questions on which IBM has kept decidedly mum .
These questions center on the chip 's out - of - order execution capabilities or the potential lack thereof .
It 's a good bet that one of the tricks that IBM used to get POWER6's clockspeed up so high was that the design team stripped away a ton of complexity from the pipeline by removing the out - of - order execution window .
IBM has stated that floating - point instructions can issue out - of - order , but such issuing is certainly very limited in order to cut down on bookkeeping overhead .
Ultimately , there 's a lot that can and should be said about what IBM did to bring about such a dramatic boost in clock frequency with POWER6 , but that will have to wait for a separate article .
In the meantime , let 's take a look at the fruits of IBM 's success .
Benchmark bombshell
Aside from the fact that IBM appears to have delivered on 90 percent of their clockspeed and power envelope promises with POWER6 , the real news in today 's announcement comes from the benchmarks that have been unveiled .
Not only has IBM nearly doubled the frequency of the POWER5 design , but it has nearly doubled the benchmarks scores as well .
Indeed , IBM is so happy with the benchmark results that it has dedicated an entire section of their site to publishing POWER6 benchmarks on a whole slew of different types of workloads .
The TPC-C benchmarks that were announced today put IBM's new POWER6 - based p570 at the top of the 16 - core pack with a score of 1,616,162 tpmC .
This score is more than double that of its POWER5 - based predecessor .
The situation is similar with the Oracle Applications Standard Online Benchmark , which shows an 8 - core POWER6 system doubling the performance of its POWER5 predecessor on this popular suite of transaction processing benches .
And then there are the famous SPEC scores , where POWER6 cleans up as well .
On specjbb2005 , the new POWER6 p570 ( 16 - core ) clocks in at 691,975 business operations per second ( bops ) , a number that 's more than double the 326,651 bops score of the machine 's POWER5 +- based predecessor .
In the CPU2006 benchmarks , POWER6 takes the crown in both floating - point and integer with a specint of 21.6 and a specfp of 22.3 ( both are single - core , single - threaded numbers ) .
This puts POWER back ahead of the previous integer champ , Intel 's Core architecture , and it also gives it a solid lead over Intel 's Itanium line .
Indeed , POWER6 is looking significantly better than the IPF lineup for a number of tasks , a fact that makes one wonder about the impact that the new launch will have on Itanium 's growth .

Stuff Does n't Make You Happy . . .
While everyone is busy unwrapping all of their holiday gifts , here 's something to mull over : Stuff does n't make you happy .
There has been an ongong thread about this amongst some of the econoblogs , and I think some of the commenters may be missing the main point :
The value of wealth is n't necessarily the THINGS you can acquire , it is the things you can do with it -- the experiences and memories that you can " acquire . "
Think of it this way :
Its the not the TOYS , its the PLAYING .
Now , let 's be honest -- I am in no position to lecture anyone about the evils of materialism ;
Does anyone really need a 500 HP car ?
How many watches can one person wear ?
The silk neckties in my closest cost more than the GDP of a small country -- please do not take this as a holier than thou finger wagging .
I am as guilty as anyone else
No , this is merely a moment of reflection during the holidays of what truly matters , and what actually makes people happy .
In my experience , most of us would get more out of taking an advanced driving course at Skip Barber , where you learn HOW TO DRIVE high performance cars , and wring the most performance out of them -- than merely having one .
If you still want the F - car , then go get -- but drive the shit out of it , join a car club , go on roadtrips -- but do n't just leave it in the garage .
Basic psychology suggests we do not have an innate need to accumulate " stuff ; " indeed , we were nomadic throughout all but the last 10,000 years or so .
How you spend your time -- your relationships are a big key to this -- will determine how " happy " your life is .

These are just one man 's opinion and experiences . . .
However you spend them , do have a Happy Holiday !

UPDATE December 31 , 2005 9:56am
Today 's NYT has an article ont hat exact same theme :
" As some of you may have heard , money does not have a very strong relationship to happiness .
Indeed , it is unclear whether the two parties are even well acquainted .
Yet , according to the renowned British economist Richard Layard , author of " Happiness : Lessons From a New Science " ( Penguin , 2005 ) , humans cling to the notion that the two are linked - with a result , Mr. Layard said in an interview , that " people tend to expect more from money than it can give . "
That 's not to say being broke is better .
One of my favorite quotations in Mr. Layard 's book is credited to Woody Allen : " Money is better than poverty , if only for financial reasons . "
Amen to that .
At the same time , Mr. Layard points out that the research on this topic suggests that we would all be a lot happier if we understood the true effect of money on our psyches .
You or I may wish for a more prosperous new year , a big raise , a fat bonus , the wherewithal to buy a bigger home , a nicer car and so forth , but Mr. Layard says that " many studies show that people have an exaggerated forecast of the benefits of having that higher income or bigger house . "
As soon as your material position improves , researchers have found , there is a remarkable tendency to adapt .
The thrill is gone , as they say .
" When we monitor how people are affected by the house or car , it 's not anything like they expected , " Mr. Layard said .
" Your happiness does go up for a while , then it returns to the base level .
If you think that sounds like a recipe for that chronic not - quite - satisfied feeling , you would be right .
People tend to crave more money and more things to restore that peak of good feeling - only to adapt to those pleasures and seek the next high - an addictive phenomenon that economists have called the hedonic treadmill . "
Fascinating stuff . . .

Money may not buy happiness but it is a hell of alot more pleasant living in a castle than living in a dirt hut .
Those studies are BS .
The human condition never changes regardless of our social standing .
We still have mental illness , we still get sick , we still lust after what we do n't have , we still complain about what is n't right , we still compartmentalize so that we can feed our face at Xmas while tens of millions in the world do n't have anything to eat , etc .
( But we feel better giving to our local charity . )
But , all things equal , I 'd prefer to do it with alot of money than wondering if I am going to die in the middle of the night from hunger .
Btw , I know that poll is flawed because The Nederlands is n't at the very top .
Anyone who gets to legally smoke Ganja and eat shrooms has to be happier than that .

Story Highlights •
A new poll suggests New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg could affect 2008 race
• Bloomberg earned 17 percent in a race with Sen. Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani
• Sen. Clinton leads Democratic field with 43 percent , with Al Gore out of the race
• Giuliani leads GOP presidential candidates with 30 percent
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Is there popular support for a Michael Bloomberg presidential candidacy ?
The latest CNN - Opinion Research Corporation poll released Monday has the answer : Yes -- a surprising amount .
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg insists he 's not running for president .
" We even have two people from New York who are candidates for president of the United States , " Bloomberg said .
" I 'm not sure the state needs a third . "
One New Yorker , former Mayor Rudy Giuliani , is the national front - runner for the Republican nomination , with 30 percent support .
Undeclared candidate Fred Thompson is now tied with John McCain for second ( 19 percent for Thompson , 18 percent for McCain ) .
Among the other GOP contenders , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Texas congressman Ron Paul were tied with 2 percent ; Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas , Rep. Tom Tancredo of Colorado and former Wisconsin governor and Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson came in with 1 percent each ; and former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore and Rep. Duncan Hunter of California drew less than half of 1 percent .
( Read the complete poll results -- PDF )
Another New Yorker , Sen. Hillary Clinton , is the Democrats ' national front - runner .
With Al Gore out of the race , Clinton of New York led the list of contenders with 43 percent .
Sen . Barack Obama of Illinois was next with 25 percent , and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina ran third with 17 percent .
( View how the candidates stand in the polls )
Among the second - tier candidates , New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson had 5 percent support ; Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Joseph Biden of Delaware , 3 percent ; and Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich , 2 percent .
Connecticut Sen. Christopher Dodd and former Sen. Mike Gravel of Alaska each had less than half of 1 percent support .
The margin of error for the Republican poll is plus or minus 5 percent .
The margin of error for the Democratic poll was 4.5 percent .
Pit the two front - runner 's against each other and what do you get ?
A very close match -- Clinton 49 percent , Giuliani 48 percent .
Is there any room for Bloomberg ?
Maybe .
The New York mayor does have a message :
The country does n't need more division .
" It 's my perception that government at all levels is becoming more partisan rather than less , " Bloomberg said .
Formerly a Democrat , Bloomberg has been elected twice as a Republican and recently just declared himself an independent .
That 's fueled a week of speculation about a run for the White House .
" I am disappointed he left the Republican Party .
I have no idea if he 's running or not , " Giuliani said .
What does the public make of Bloomberg ?
Forty percent of Americans have no opinion of him at all .
Among those who do , the balance is mildly favorable ( 37 percent favorable , 23 percent unfavorable ) .
And views are about the same among Republicans , Democrats and independents .
Polls taken earlier this year showed that if Bloomberg ran for president as an independent , his support would have been in the single digits .
With all the new attention since his party switch , Bloomberg 's support seems to be on the rise -- 17 percent in a three - way contest against Clinton and Giuliani .
That puts Bloomberg in third place , but 17 percent is still an impressive showing for a candidate who 's not even running .
Seventeen percent nearly matches the 19 percent of the vote Ross Perot got the first time he ran in 1992 .
Even if he does n't win , some people think Bloomberg could affect the outcome of the race .
" If he runs there will be two liberals in the race versus one Republican .
So unlike the Perot phenomenon that really hurt Republicans , this has a chance to hurt Democrats , " Republican strategist Scott Reed said .
That 's not happening yet .
Right now , Bloomberg would take votes about equally from Hillary Clinton and Rudy Giuliani , and the outcome would still be close ( 41 percent for Clinton , 38 percent for Giuliani ) .
Keep in mind that Bloomberg is not well known nationally .
If he were to run , he could spend a lot of money defining himself to voters across the country .
But the CNN - ORC poll shows that a lot of voters are open to a new choice .

Children between eight and 15 will take part
Daily Variety has reported that the show , tentatively titled Kid Nation , will observe 40 children from eight to 16 without parental supervision .
The series will be screened towards the end of the year on CBS , Variety said .
Lord of the Flies tells of a group of boys on a desert island , who quickly descend into primitive behaviour .
The reality show will be set in Bonanza City , an old New Mexico mining town which has been deserted for over a century .
Free to go
Variety reports that children would be given choices between things they need , such as food and supplies , and things they want , such as toys .
The children will be able to go home whenever they want .
Instead of the traditional eviction at the end of each show , every episode will culminate with one child being selected by his or her peers to earn a reward .
The programme's aim will be to build a society by passing laws , choosing leaders and creating an economy .
Computers Beat Humans At Facial Recognition
Computers now outperform humans in recognizing faces .
For scientists and engineers involved with face - recognition technology , the recently released results of the Face Recognition Grand Challenge -- more fully , the Face Recognition Vendor Test ( FRVT ) 2006 and the Iris Challenge Evaluation ( ICE ) 2006 -- have been a quiet triumph .
Sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) , the match up of face - recognition algorithms showed that machine recognition of human individuals has improved tenfold since 2002 and a hundredfold since 1995 .
Indeed , the best face - recognition algorithms now perform more accurately than most humans can manage .
I expect artificial intelligence to come about as a result of advances made to solve many practical computing problems .
Computer face recognition , like computer voice recognition , has many useful applications .
Attempts to meet market needs will push development of algorithms to solve an increasing variety of the problems that human minds can solve .
Artificial intelligence will become easy to create once we reach a critical mass of accumulated algorithms that replace humans for performing many tasks .
PARIS —
In the current debate over laws governing music downloads here , some condemn Aziz Ridouan as an advocate of criminal piracy , while others say he represents the new generation of online consumers .
In either case , just about everyone involved listens to what Mr. Ridouan , an 18 - year - old high school student , has to say .
" All sides must listen to Aziz because he has an entire generation behind him , " said Julien Dourgnon , economic director of the Consumer 's Federal Union , one of the largest consumer advocacy groups in France .
" He may still be in high school , but Aziz has a more profound understanding of copyright law than most lawyers and members of Parliament . "
New proposals to govern music piracy have faced a roller coaster ride through both the French legislature and public opinion here .
The National Assembly passed legislation that could force Apple Computer and other companies to make songs purchased on their proprietary online services playable on any MP3 device .
The Senate , responding to corporate arguments against such openness , appears ready to approve a weaker version of the law soon .

05:00 am - Chris Dodd or Sam the Eagle ?
While watching Chris Dodd during the democratic presidential debate , I got this nagging feeling that he reminded me of someone .
But not a person .
He reminded me of a muppet .
It 's been a while since I watched the muppets - specifically , Muppets Tonight - so it took some digging on the muppet wiki , but I recognized those eyebrows immediately .
Chris Dodd is Sam the Eagle .
Not to mention the ugliest man in the Senate .

The White House ’s huffing and puffing about Nancy Pelosi ’s visit to Syria is just a bunch of hooey .
Congress is an independent and coequal branch of our government .
Its members can go anywhere they wish to go , and that includes the current House speaker , Pelosi .
As for the Bush administration ’s stated desire to " isolate " Syria , that is just another of the president ’s inside - the - bubble delusions .
He seems to think that saying something makes it so .
Syria is not isolated .
It is a normal country with normal relations , commercial and diplomatic , with most countries in the world .
Mr. Bush is not emperor of the world , and most of the world ignores whatever he manages to say .
Furthermore , as many Americans more experienced in foreign policy than the president have advised , the U.S. should be engaged with Syria .
Its location between Iraq and Lebanon and its relative power make it a player in the region that cannot be ignored .
A basic rule of diplomacy , which the president seems unable to grasp , is that one talks to people with whom one disagrees .
So the exchange of views between the speaker and the president of Syria is a good thing , even if neither convinced the other of anything .
The U.S. , taking its cue from the Israeli lobby , has branded Hezbollah and Hamas as terrorist organizations .
Since they and other organizations have offices in Syria , the U.S. considers that " state sponsoring of terrorism . "
There again , not everyone in the world considers them as terrorist organizations , even though some members of both organizations have committed acts of terrorism in the past .
So , for that matter , has Israel , which generally is credited with being the inventor of the car bomb .
So , for that matter , have we , though we call all the thousands of innocent civilians we kill with our bombs " collateral damage , " which is one of the more morally obscene euphemisms in this age of propaganda .
At any rate , Speaker Pelosi is as committed to the Israeli lobby as the president , so her visit changed nothing in policy matters .
It did , however , pay dividends in good personal relations .
We sometimes forget that countries are not abstract concepts , but places run by individual human beings .
Personal relationships can make a difference .
Let us not forget , either , that the speaker of the House is second in line to succeed the president .
That does n’t mean that we should have multiple foreign policies , but it does mean that it ’s not a bad idea for those members of the House and Senate with an interest in foreign policy to make their own contacts and collect their own information .
After all , " briefings " by this executive branch have been shown to be unreliable .
Nor is it true that the Constitution puts foreign policy exclusively in the hands of the president .
It does no such thing .
All ambassadors and all treaties have to be ratified by the Senate .
Every penny of funding for anything overseas , including the military , is the responsibility of Congress .
In fact , the Constitution assigns several functions involving foreign policy to the legislative branch .
Other than appointing ambassadors and making treaties , both with the advice and consent of the Senate , the only reference to foreign - policy duty assigned to the president by the Constitution is to " receive ambassadors and other public ministries . "
Clearly , the current president is at odds with the authors of the U.S. Constitution .
A simple reading of that document will assure any doubters that the man temporarily occupying the White House is not a monarch , dictator or emperor .
And the Constitution is truly the supreme law of the land .

You do n’t need eyes to see .
You need vision .
You might have thought that the White House had enough on its plate late last month , what with its search for a new Supreme Court nominee , the continuing war in Iraq and the C.I.A. leak investigation .
But it found time to add another item to its agenda -- stopping The Onion , the satirical newspaper , from using the presidential seal .
The newspaper regularly produces a parody of President Bush 's weekly radio address on its Web site ( www.theonion.com/content/node/40121), where it has a picture of President Bush and the official insignia .
" It has come to my attention that The Onion is using the presidential seal on its Web site , " Grant M. Dixton , associate counsel to the president , wrote to The Onion on Sept. 28 .
( At the time , Mr. Dixton 's office was also helping Mr. Bush find a Supreme Court nominee ; days later his boss , Harriet E. Miers , was nominated . )
Citing the United States Code , Mr. Dixton wrote that the seal " is not to be used in connection with commercial ventures or products in any way that suggests presidential support or endorsement . "
Exceptions may be made , he noted , but The Onion had never applied for such an exception .
December 8 , 1941 , is not normally known as a date which will live in infamy .
That phrase of President Franklin D. Roosevelt ’s usually refers to the preceding day , on which the American Naval fleet at Pearl Harbor was savaged by a surprise Japanese air raid .
But “ Pearl Harbor , ” the war novel that is Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen ’s latest foray into what they call “ active history , ” deliberately calls attention to the fact that Japan and Hawaii were on different sides of the International Date Line .
When the attack began , it was Dec. 7 at Pearl Harbor but Dec. 8 in Japan .
The book is subtly subtitled “ A Novel of December 8th ” to signal its attention to the Japanese point of view .
On the basis of that detail , you might expect a high level of fastidiousness from “ Pearl Harbor . ”
And you would be spectacularly wrong .
Because you would find phrases like “ to withdraw backward was impossible , ” sounds like “ wretching noises ” to accompany vomiting , or constructions like “ incredulous as it seemed , America had not reacted . ”
Although the book has two authors , it could have used a third assigned to cleanup patrol .
This is not a matter of isolated typographical errors .
It is a serious case for the comma police , since the book ’s war on punctuation is almost as heated as the air assaults it describes .
“ One would have to be dead , very stupid Fuchida thought , ” the book says about the fighter pilot Mitsuo Fuchida , “ not to realize they were sallying forth to war . ”
Evidence notwithstanding , the authors do not mean to insult the fighter pilot ’s intelligence — or , presumably , the reader’s .
Send neocons Wolfowitz , Perle to Iraq , says GOP lawmaker Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday May 29 , 2007 Print This Email
This A Republican lawmaker has an unorthodox suggestion for Paul Wolfowitz 's future employment now that the neoconservative war architect has been ousted as World Bank president -- send him to Iraq .
Rep. Walter Jones , R - N.C. , suggested the Middle East assignment for Wolfowitz during a hearing of the House Armed Services Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee last week , as reported by ABC News 's blog , The Blotter .
" I would like to suggest ... that maybe we give Paul Wolfowitz a new job and send him over there as mayor of Iraq , since the neocons got us in over there , " Jones said .
" And maybe Mr. ( Richard ) Perle could be co-mayor or co-chairman . "
Wolfowitz served as deputy secretary of defense from 2000 to 2005 , and he was among the key players in the administration who sold the idea of an Iraq invasion based on the wrong - headed assumption that US troops would be greeted as liberators and the war would finance itself from Iraqi oil revenues .
Perle , another of the war 's main proponents , served on the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee during President Bush 's first term .
In an interview with Vanity Fair published last year , Perle said he regretted his support of the war .
As RAW STORY reported last week , recently de-classified pre-war intelligence estimates predicted the turmoil Iraq found itself in after Saddam Hussein 's ouster , despite the pre-invasion public assurances from Wolfowitz and other war supporters .
Jones was initially a staunch supporter of the American invasion , but he has since recanted , and become one of few anti-war Republican voices in Congress .
He called on the House cafeteria to rename French fries to " freedom fries " to protest France 's lack of support for the US invasion , before he switched his position on the war .
" I will tell you that the American people are fed up , and I 'm frustrated and fed up " with the lack of progress in the war , Jones said at last week 's hearing .
Some psychiatrists who advocate use of atypicals in children acknowledge that the evidence supporting this use is thin .
But they say children should not go untreated simply because scientists have failed to confirm what clinicians already know .
“ We do n’t have time to wait for them to prove us right , ” said Dr. Kent G. Brockmann , a psychiatrist from the Twin Cities who made more than $ 16,000 from 2003 to 2005 doing drug talks and one - on - one sales meetings , and last year was a leading prescriber of atypicals to Medicaid children .
The Reaction
For Anya Bailey , treatment with an atypical helped her regain her appetite and put on weight , but also heavily sedated her , her mother said .
She developed the disabling knot in her back , the result of a nerve condition called dystonia , in 2005 .
The reaction was rare but not unknown .
Atypicals have side effects that are not easy to predict in any one patient .
These include rapid weight gain and blood sugar problems , both risk factors for diabetes ; disfiguring tics , dystonia and in rare cases heart attacks and sudden death in the elderly .
In 2006 , the Food and Drug Administration received reports of at least 29 children dying and at least 165 more suffering serious side effects in which an antipsychotic was listed as the “ primary suspect . ”
That was a substantial jump from 2000 , when there were at least 10 deaths and 85 serious side effects among children linked to the drugs .
Since reporting of bad drug effects is mostly voluntary , these numbers likely represent a fraction of the toll .
Jim Minnick , a spokesman for AstraZeneca , said that the company carefully monitors reported problems with Seroquel .
“ AstraZeneca believes that Seroquel is safe , ” Mr. Minnick said .
Other psychiatrists renewed Anya ’s prescriptions for Risperdal until Ms. Bailey took Anya last year to the Mayo Clinic , where a doctor insisted that Ms. Bailey stop the drug .
Unlike most universities and hospitals , the Mayo Clinic restricts doctors from giving drug marketing lectures .
Ms. Bailey said she wished she had waited to see whether counseling would help Anya before trying drugs .
Anya ’s weight is now normal without the help of drugs , and her counseling ended in March .
An experimental drug , her mother said , has recently helped the pain in her back .
“ The blast threw me to the ground and shattered a window over my body , ” said Salar Kamal Zari , a 37 - year - old teacher visiting from Kurdistan , who had just stepped into a nearby store when the bomb exploded .
“ I saw a human head in front of the store and many cars burning and smoke everywhere . ”
“ I will never stay in Baghdad anymore , ” he vowed .
The Baghdad security plan calls for 28,000 additional American troops , as well as thousands of Iraqi soldiers , most of whom will be deployed in the streets of the violent capital in an attempt to pacify it .
But Mr. Maliki said the gradual handover to Iraqi authority would continue , with three provinces in the relatively tranquil region of Kurdistan the next to come under Iraqi security authority , followed by Karbala and Wasit Provinces in the south .
“ In this way , province by province , we will reach the end of the line before the end of the year , ” the prime minister said in a speech delivered by Mowaffak al - Rubaie , his national security adviser .
The speech marked the handover of the southern province of Maysan from British to Iraqi control .
Maysan is the fourth of Iraq ’s 18 provinces to be handed to Iraqi security forces .
American commanders have said the Baghdad security effort has reduced the kinds of sectarian killings associated with Shiite death squads , in part because of the decision by many militia fighters to lay low .
But the plan has failed to curb the spectacular attacks , many of them suicide bombings , that have become a gruesome hallmark of the Sunni Arab - led insurgent group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
As a result , commanders say , overall civilian casualty rates are actually higher now than they were before the plan was initiated .

White House Continues to Withhold e-mails from Moschella and Burton to Five Potential Witnesses Discussing Response to Potential Subpoenas .
On Friday , DOJ released to the Committee a list of e-mails that continue to be withheld by White House lawyers as " privileged " .
At the very last page of that list is another most intriguing document .
Withheld e-mails , Page 10 , Lines 160 and 161 ( March 7 , 2007 ) - http://hosted.ap.org/...
Line 160 , From Faith Burton , DESCRIPTION : Discussion re : draft subpoenas for KS ( Kyle Sampson ) , MG ( Monica Goodling ) , ME ( Michael Elston ) , WM ( William Mercer ) , and MB ( Michael Battle ) .
Line 161 , From William Moschella , DESCRIPTION : Discussion re : voluntary interviews or testimony from leadership staff before the SJC ( Senate Judiciary Committee ) .
Five of those on the list for receipt of subpoenas receive two e-mails from Faith Burton and William E. Moschella " discussing " the subject of their subpoenas .
CONCLUSION :
It is nothing less than astonishing that the White House would continue to withhold the Moscella and Burton e-mails that discuss testimony to Congress on grounds of Executive Privilege .
On Monday , officials discuss how to avoid a direct response to Congressional questions about the AG firing lists -- what other " deliberative documents " would they be talking about ? -- documents that on Tuesday Moscella testifies both do and do n't exist , and then on Wednesday he discusses his testimony with several other witnesses facing subpoenas -- and the White House now withholds Moscella 's Wednesday e-mails .
This raises serious questions about the judgment and good faith of the White House about the communications it continues to claim privilege .
These e-mails also show a pattern and practice of deception , a concerted effort to evade Congressional subpoenas , and a criminal conspiracy to deceive Congress and withhold materials from investigators .

KABUL , Afghanistan ( AP )  U.S. - led coalition and NATO forces fighting insurgents in Afghanistan have killed at least 203 civilians so far this year — surpassing the 178 civilians killed in militant attacks , according to an Associated Press tally .
Insurgency attacks and military operations have surged in recent weeks , and in the past 10 days , more than 90 civilians have been killed by airstrikes and artillery fire targeting Taliban insurgents , said President Hamid Karzai .
On Sunday , another civilian may have been killed when British troops opened fire in a populated area after their convoy was hit by a roadside bomb , officials and witnesses said .
Separate figures from the U.N. and an umbrella organization of Afghan and international aid groups show that the numbers of civilians killed by international forces is approximately equal to those killed by insurgents .
After a seething speech by Karzai on Saturday — in which he accused NATO and U.S. forces of viewing Afghan lives as " cheap " — NATO conceded that it had to " do better . "
Coalition spokesman Maj .
Chris
Belcher suggested that some civilians reportedly killed by foreign forces may in fact have been killed by insurgents .
" One of the problems is sometimes determining who exactly caused the casualties .
It 's not always clear if a civilian casualty is caused by an extremist or coalition forces , " Belcher said .
Accurate figures for civilian death tolls are hard to come by in Afghanistan , where militants often wear civilian dress and seek shelter in villagers ' homes .
Furthermore , after a quarter of a century of civil war and conflict , it is not unusual for Afghans to have weapons in their homes .
Much of the violence takes place in remote areas that are too far or too dangerous for independent observers or journalists to reach for verification of the reports .
The AP count of civilian casualties is based on reports from Afghan and foreign officials and witnesses through Saturday .
Of the 399 civilian deaths so far this year , 18 civilians were killed in crossfire between Taliban militants and foreign forces .
The U.S. and NATO did not have civilian casualty figures .
The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has counted 213 civilians killed by insurgents in the first five months of this year — compared to 207 killed by Afghan and international forces .
ACBAR — the Agency Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief — has counted 230 civilians killed in U.S. and NATO operations , basing their figure on reports from the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission , Afghan NGO Security Office and the U.N .
The number of civilians killed in militant attacks was approximately the same as those killed by foreign forces according to ACBAR 's latest figures from about a month ago , said Anja de Beer , director of ACBAR .
" The international forces are here to support the Afghan government , the purpose is to get a better and safer life for the Afghan people , " de Beer said .
" If in doing so , they 're causing more civilian deaths than the people they 're fighting against , that does n't look very good , to put it mildly . "
Maj .
John Thomas , a spokesman for NATO 's International Security Assistance Force , blamed the insurgents for hiding in areas populated by civilians , who are then killed during attacks against militants , but he said " that does not absolve ISAF of the responsibility of doing all it can to minimize civilian casualties . "
On Saturday , Karzai accused NATO and U.S. - led troops of carelessly killing scores of Afghan civilians and warned that the fight against resurgent Taliban militants could fail unless foreign forces show more restraint .
" Afghan life is not cheap and it should not be treated as such , " Karzai said angrily .
The mounting toll is sapping the authority of the Western - backed Afghan president , who has pleaded repeatedly with U.S. and NATO commanders to consult Afghan authorities during operations and show more restraint .
Karzai also denounced the Taliban for killing civilians , but directed most of his anger at foreign forces .
In one of the recent incidents lamented by Karzai , police said NATO airstrikes killed 25 civilians along with 20 militants who fired on alliance and Afghan troops from a walled compound in the southern province of Helmand .
On Sunday , Helmand provincial police chief Mohammad Hussain said British gunfire killed one man after the troops were attacked , but it was not clear if the victim was a civilian or a militant involved in the attack .
Raz Mohammad Sayed , director of a local hospital , said one man was killed , and another man was wounded by British gunfire .
He referred to both victims as " civilians . "
NATO blames the insurgents for hiding among civilians , and insisted that troops had the right to defend themselves .
" If someone 's firing at me , he 's a combatant , " Thomas said .
Another NATO spokesman , Nicholas Lunt , said , " We need to do better than we have been doing so far .
But unlike the Taliban , we do not set out to cause civilian casualties , and that is a critical difference . "
In Helmand 's Langar village , Afghan and coalition troops clashed with insurgents and called in airstrikes Saturday , killing more than a dozen militants , one coalition soldier and an Afghan soldier , the coalition said .
Other violence around Afghanistan Sunday killed three policemen and wounded six .
Roadside bombs killed three soldiers and wounded five , officials said .

Social Security Cards Issued by Woolworth
The most misused SSN of all time was ( 078-05 - 1120 ) .
In 1938 , wallet manufacturer the E. H. Ferree company in Lockport , New York decided to promote its product by showing how a Social Security card would fit into its wallets .
A sample card , used for display purposes , was inserted in each wallet .
Company Vice President and Treasurer Douglas Patterson thought it would be a clever idea to use the actual SSN of his secretary , Mrs. Hilda Schrader Whitcher .
The wallet was sold by Woolworth stores and other department stores all over the country .
Even though the card was only half the size of a real card , was printed all in red , and had the word " specimen " written across the face , many purchasers of the wallet adopted the SSN as their own .
In the peak year of 1943 , 5,755 people were using Hilda 's number .
SSA acted to eliminate the problem by voiding the number and publicizing that it was incorrect to use it .
( Mrs. Whitcher was given a new number . )
However , the number continued to be used for many years .
In all , over 40,000 people reported this as their SSN .
As late as 1977 , 12 people were found to still be using the SSN " issued by Woolworth . "
Mrs.
Whitcher recalled coming back from lunch one day to find her fellow workers teasing her about her new - found fame .
They were singing the refrain from a popular song of the day : " Here comes the million - dollar baby from the five and ten cent store . "
Although the snafu gave her a measure of fame , it was mostly a nuisance .
The FBI even showed up at her door to ask her about the widespread use of her number .
In later years she observed : " They started using the number .
They thought it was their own .
I can't understand how people can be so stupid .
I ca n't understand that . "
Mrs. Whitcher compares the Social Security card " issued by Woolworth " with her own real card of the same number .
The card that started all the fuss !
NOT THE ONLY ONE
The New York wallet manufacturer was not the only one to cause confusion about Social Security numbers .
More than a dozen similar cases have occurred over the years -- usually when someone publishes a facsimile of an SSN using a made - up number .
( The Whitcher case is far and away the worst involving a real SSN and an actual person . )
One embarrassing episode was the fault of the Social Security Board itself .
In 1940 the Board published a pamphlet explaining the new program and showing a facsimile of a card on the cover .
The card in the illustration used a made - up number of 219-09-9999 .
Sure enough , in 1962 a woman presented herself to the Provo , Utah Social Security office complaining that her new employer was refusing to accept her old Social Security number --219-09-9999 .
When it was explained that this could not possibly be her number , she whipped out her copy of the 1940 pamphlet to prove that yes indeed it was her number !
egypt - a tool for making call graphs
Egypt is a simple tool for creating call graphs of C programs .
Egypt neither analyzes source code nor lays out graphs .
Instead , it leaves the source code analysis to GCC and the graph layout to Graphviz , both of which are better at their respective jobs than egypt itself could ever hope to be .
Egypt is simply a very small Perl script that glues these existing tools together .
The most recent release of egypt is version 1.10 , which can be downloaded here .
Online documentation is here .
You will also need gcc , Perl , and Graphviz .
To install , extract the compressed tar file , cd to the egypt directory , and type

War Divides an American Town
While patriotism runs high , patience with the Iraq war runs thin in W.Va .
MARTINSBURG , W.Va. , May 27 , 2007  --
In this small West Virginia town , nearly everyone knows someone who has served in Iraq .
Waiting for a haircut at a downtown barbershop , Michael Stotler says he once thought about joining the Army , like his uncle .
But he changed his mind as his view of the Iraq war soured .
" In the beginning , when it started out , I thought [ the war ] was good , " he explains .
But now , he says , it 's just getting worse and worse by the day .
Sitting in the barber 's chair , Gregory Williams agrees .
He thinks Congress should set a date for withdrawal .
" There has to be some kind of timeline , or else we 'll be over there forever , " he says .
Martinsburg is home to a veterans ' hospital and a wing of the Air National Guard .
Every Memorial
Day , the town 's boy scouts put flags on the graves of those who have served , and the local paper runs profiles of veterans .
Most here are quick to say they support the troops .
" The sense of support is still there because there are so many people that we know , that we have feelings for , " says Maria Lorensen , editor of The Berkeley Journal .
But while patriotism remains high , patience is running thin .
It 's reflective of a growing pessimism across the country .
" Americans supported the war initially ; they supported it for a fair amount of time , subsequently ; but they 've lost faith , " says Andrew Kohut , director of the Pew Research Center .
Martinsburg is located in a swing district within a swing state .
The local congresswoman , Shelley Moore Capito , is a Republican , while the state 's two senators , Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller , are both Democrats .
In 2004 , West Virginia went for President Bush .
But when it comes to the war in Iraq , views here do n't necessarily fall along party lines .
At the counter in Patterson 's Drug Store , Roger Fazio is a Republican who voted for Bush .
Now he wants the troops out .
" We should n't be over there , " he says .
" I 'm praying day by day to get 'em home . "
Sitting at a booth in the back , Janice Neukam , a former Pentagon employee , calls it a " difficult situation , " but she worries about the impact of withdrawing too soon .
" If we pull out now , what 's going to happen ? " she asks .
" Are they going to come over here on our turf ? "
Across town at the local wine and arts festival , others say the U.S. has an obligation to finish what it started .
" I do n't like seeing people killed , " says Bridget Snapp , a guidance counselor at the middle school .
" But I do n't like pulling out of the country and leaving it devastated , either . "
Cynthia Grills ' son Chad left last Tuesday for Fort Dix .
She says he and the other servicemen and women are fighting for a worthy cause .
" If my son can be a part of bringing freedom to the Middle East , then they can have him , " she says , her eyes welling up with tears .
She pauses , and then adds , " They better bring him back .
That 's the thing . "

I 'm riding in the backseat of an LAPD cruiser , and it sounds like the inside of a giant slot machine .
As officer Christine Labriola speeds down the side streets of LA 's notorious Rampart district , a Dell laptop mounted on the Crown Victoria 's dashboard chimes intermittently .
A picture of each car we pass is displayed on the screen until the next car appears .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
We 're hunting for stolen vehicles using the LAPD 's new tech toy : a digital license plate reader .
The $ 20,000 system consists of two sets of cameras mounted on the squad car 's roof , two more pointing out the rear window , a processing system in the trunk , and the Dell on the dash .
Each Ding !
means the LPR has processed a plate , checking it against the department 's hot list of 123,000 stolen autos and outstanding warrants .
As fast as Labriola can gun it through the littered streets , the Dell keeps pace .
We pass an idling Chevy Impala .
Ding !
It appears on the screen .
An ancient jalopy stripped to its axles sits near the curb .
Ding !
And up it pops .
" In the old way of doing business , " Labriola says , gesturing out the window , " I 'd see a suspect car like this one , an older import , and say to Ryan , ' Four - Zebra - Zebra - Nancy - Seven - Two - Five . ' "
Riding shotgun , officer Ryan Nguyen continues the old - school demonstration , tapping 4ZZN725 into a mobile data terminal mounted near his left knee .
The device dials headquarters and checks the list .
Nada .
" We call it ' playing the stolen - car lotto , ' " Nguyen says .
Los Angeles is the auto - theft capital of the US : 73,071 cars were reported stolen in 2004 .
Still , the chances of a random car on the street turning out to be hot – or driven by someone with an outstanding warrant – are boringly low .
" If you played the lotto all shift , you might type in 100 plates and get nothing , " Labriola says .
But their electronics - laden cruiser typically processes 12 plates a minute .
( It can handle up to 240 plates a minute , but the officers never encounter that many cars in such a short time . )
As a result , Labriola and Nguyen are finding an average of three stolen cars a day , leading to roughly 12 arrests a month ( their personal record is six cars and two busts in a day ) .
They 're essentially doing the work of 10 pre-LPR patrol cops .
We take a right near MacArthur Park , and the Dell suddenly changes its tune .
A red Toyota freezes on the screen , and a robotic voice chirps , " Stolen vehicle .
Stolen vehicle . "
Four two - person teams are testing digital license plate recognition setups for the LAPD .
The systems were supplied by four different companies – AutoVu , Civica , PIPS Technology , and Remington - Elsag – each of which hopes to sign the department to an exclusive contract .
Trials have been running since early 2005 , and the results are striking :
So far , the readers have spotted 200 stolen cars and led to 60 arrests .
In its first few days on the job , a handheld LPR that officers were using in a Topanga mall parking lot before Christmas identified 17 stolen cars , resulting in six arrests .
That 's a lot : Patrol officers receive an award if they nab six car thieves in a single year .
The numbers are so impressive that the department has decided to spend $ 250,000 in a bulk deal to outfit 19 cruisers by summer ( it has n't picked a supplier yet ) .
It 's a tiny portion of the LAPD 's 1,500 - vehicle fleet , but officials say that 's only the beginning .
" This is a big piece of the force 's push into the 21st century , " says commander Charlie Beck , a 28 - year veteran and assistant director of the Office of Operations .
" It will have as dramatic an effect on police work as the radio did in the ' 40s and ' 50s . "
LA is n't the only place toying with machine vision - based traffic enforcement .
Similar trial programs are under way elsewhere in California , as well as at city and state levels in Florida , Connecticut , New York , Ohio , Alabama , and Arizona .
In Miami , as in LA , the systems are helping beat cops find hot cars .
On Alabama 's highways , stationary cameras are being paired with radar systems that automatically write speeding tickets as violators zip by .
And in Sacramento , readers have tripled parking violation revenue by letting officers quickly spot autos with outstanding unpaid tickets ( which they then boot ) .
Europe provides a glimpse of what even bigger deployments can do .
In France , 1,000 mobile and stationary plate - reading cameras have doubled speeding ticket revenue and halved speeding - related deaths in just two years .
In the UK , 200 cameras policing London 's Downtown Congestion Charge Zone generated 13,000 arrests in one year .
British law enforcement loves the technology so much that the government has plans for a $ 43 million campaign to install enough cameras to monitor every motorist on the country 's highways , major roads , and bigger intersections , digitally reading some 35 million plates per day .
This could catch not just every stolen car but nearly every moving violation as it occurs .
Back in the US , police agencies have been reluctant to spend money on plate readers ( trial systems are generally supplied for free by manufacturers hoping for an order ) .
Price and technical problems have been cited as the main barriers .
The cost of a plate - reading system just two years ago was as high as $ 200,000 per car .
And early versions came with painfully slow software and cryptic interfaces .
For Los Angeles , at least , falling prices and improved performance are finally making the systems worth the money .
Other agencies seem to agree : Recently , Mesa , Arizona , purchased two readers , Sacramento got five , and Miami - Dade County bought three .
" You 're going to see more and more of these systems , " says Lieutenant Greg Terp , commander of the Miami - Dade multi-agency auto theft task force .
" An officer looks for stolen car indicators that inform his decision to run a plate .
This just runs everything . "
The idea of cameras monitoring every highway , boulevard , and alley might strike some Americans as Orwellian .
But even the American Civil Liberties Union acknowledges that the public has no right to license plate privacy on public streets .
After all , cops can enter plate numbers by hand , so why not by camera ?
" There 's absolutely no bar on collecting plates in public , " says Barry Steinhardt , director of the ACLU 's technology and liberty program .
" There have n't been any legal challenges , because it 's not illegal . "
" Stolen vehicle .
Stolen vehicle . "
Back in the cruiser , Nguyen turns to look through the rear window for the Toyota displayed on the screen .
" That one ! " he says , pointing to a rotting , red ' 84 Celica with parking tickets sticking out of the hood .
The Celica is a classic mark , renowned among thieves because it can be started with a screwdriver .
It looks abandoned .
Labriola steers her Crown Vic around the corner , where we can watch the vehicle unobtrusively .
Now we wait , hoping the crook will return to the car .
Once , a guy who walked into a hot - car stake� - out turned out to be a heroin addict responsible for 25 open theft cases .
Then there was the woman driving a rental car she had kept for more than a year .
But most cases are more routine .
" Truth is , most people steal cars to save gas on the drive to work , then dump them , " Nguyen says .
After 10 minutes , they tag the car for towing , and we slip off down the alley , hunting for better targets .
An hour later , the cameras catch another old - model import that appears to be abandoned .
A year ago , two hot cars in a single day would have earned the officers a pat on the back at the following week 's roll call .
Now it 's a letdown .
" I'm to the point where I need my fix , " Labriola says with a little laugh .
" My daily felony fix . "
As sunset ignites the downtown skyscrapers , we head back to the station .
Labriola takes the long way home – hoping for one final score – and the Dell chimes away like we just hit the jackpot .

DETROIT , Dec. 18 — Small cars are back in vogue because of high gasoline prices but most fail to provide the same safety protection that buyers find in bigger vehicles , according to the results of new tests simulating crashes with sport utility vehicles or pickup trucks .
All eight models of small cars tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety received passing scores in head - on crash tests , but only one , the Nissan Versa , received high marks in both side - and rear - crash tests .
The Versa is several hundred pounds heavier than competing models and therefore was better able to withstand the test impact .
Three other models — Toyota Yaris , Honda Fit and Mini Cooper from BMW — scored well in side tests but received low ratings in rear tests .
The results , which are being released Tuesday , show that some small cars offer significantly better protection than others , but experts caution that even the safest subcompact car cannot overcome its inherent size and weight disadvantage .
On average , subcompacts weigh about 800 pounds less than midsize cars like the Toyota Camry and 4,000 pounds less than midsize S.U.V. ’s like the Ford Explorer .
1063 - pound , 12 - foot 6 - inch Mako Shark Hooked off Florida Coast May Be World Record
DESTIN , Florida --
A 1,063 - pound mako shark hooked close to shore in the Gulf of Mexico is being investigated as a possible world fishing record .
The Sea Ya Later II was cobia fishing when its crew spotted the 12 - foot 6 - inch shark Wednesday afternoon between Pensacola Beach and Navarre Beach .
The Mother Lode , a 45 - foot charter boat , helped bring in the shark .
They used flying gaffs to secure the fish and then tied the gaffs to the Sea Ya Later II , which was tilting .
`` If ( the shark ) had n't been as tired as she was , this boat would be sitting on the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico , '' said Lindsey Stanley , the Sea Ya Later IIs captain , told the Northwest Florida Daily News .
After the shark died , it took eight men to pull it aboard the Mother Lode and take it to Destin .
The registered weight of 1,063 pounds makes the catch eligible for the world record in the 30 - pound line class for a short - fin mako .
The class record is a 997 - pound , 11 - ounce shark caught in Sidney , Australia , in 1995 .
The largest mako recorded in the all - tackle division was a 1,221 pounder caught in Massachusetts in 2001 .
``I 'm investigating it as a world record , '' said Jim Roberson , who represents the Panhandle for the International Game Fish Association .

The Supreme Court handed a major defeat to state medical marijuana laws this week , but pro-pot advocates said a little - noticed lawsuit wending its way through the courts might yet make legal pot a reality .
The suit hinges on a Food and Drug Administration regulation that says the agency can't approve marijuana – or any other substance – as a medicine unless research shows it 's safe .
But the government , which controls the only legal crop in the country , wo n't give scientists any marijuana to test , according to researchers who want to perform safety studies .
The impasse led to a lawsuit in July 2004 pitting the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies , or MAPS , against the Drug Enforcement Agency as well as the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institute on Drug Abuse , or NIDA , for obstructing medical marijuana research .
" The energy in the legal arena is now going to shift to our effort to break the monopoly on supply , " said Rick Doblin , founder and president of MAPS .
" Now that ( law enforcement ) can go after high - profile targets , the only safety for patients is going to be to have it available through the FDA . "
NIDA refused to comment on the lawsuit because the agency addresses abuse of marijuana rather than its medical uses , a spokeswoman said .
But since the agency is the gatekeeper to the only legal source of the drug from a small farm at the University of Mississippi , researchers who want to study the drug 's medicinal qualities have no choice but to query NIDA .
Doblin said the government pot is not only scarce but also low - quality .
Patients have to smoke up to four times more than they would if they bought it on the street or in a buyers ' club , and it 's full of sticks and seeds .
After several years of rejections and revised protocols , Dr. Donald Abrams , now chief of hematology and oncology at San Francisco General Hospital , managed to gain NIDA 's permission in 1997 to perform a study testing marijuana in AIDS patients .
It found that the patients ' viral load did not increase while smoking the drug .
Abrams recently completed a second study on 16 AIDS patients with painful nerve damage in their hands and feet .
Preliminary results suggest that marijuana eased their pain , he said .
" I 'm trying to generate some data so we can have some real evidence in this discussion , " said Abrams , who is awaiting approval for one more study that if approved will examine the interaction between cannabis and opioids in cancer patients with persistent pain .
Doblin thinks the government is purposely setting up roadblocks to make it impossible to get enough data for FDA approval .
Abrams ' studies have involved 62 and 16 patients respectively – far too few to garner FDA approval – and Doblin said government agencies know that Abrams does n't have the resources to perform a larger trial .
MAPS is also suing NIDA for ignoring its 2003 application to buy 10 grams of marijuana – a small amount worth no more than $ 100 – for a study that would examine the chemical makeup of vaporized marijuana , which it believes could be an alternative delivery method .
The test would not involve human subjects .
" Supposedly that 's what everyone wants – that this issue should be solved through science rather than through politics and that 's what we 're saying as well , " Doblin said .
" The problem is , when we try to do the science we find out the government is not really that interested in solving the issue through science . "
The first hearing regarding the DEA suit is scheduled for late August .
You knew Keith was going to comment after Bush 's disastrous speech last night .
Most of America , many in Congress and Bush 's own military leaders are against this move .
I guess only the neocons matter to Bush .
Being a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute seems to be more important than over 60 % of the country .
Keith takes it apart --- bit by bit .
It is surprising to see him speak out in back to back shows , but the situation obviously warranted it .

( Transcripts below the fold )
And lastly , as promised , a Special Comment about the President 's address last night .
Only this President , only in this time , only with this dangerous , even Messianic certitude , could answer a country demanding an exit strategy from Iraq , by offering an entrance strategy for Iran .
Only this President , could look out over a vista of 3,008 dead and 22,834 wounded in Iraq , and finally say " where mistakes have been made , the responsibility rests with me " -- only to follow that , by proposing to repeat the identical mistake in Iran .
Only this President could extol the " thoughtful recommendations of the Iraq Study Group , " and then take its most far - sighted recommendation -- " engage Syria and Iran " - and transform it into " threaten Syria and Iran " -- when Al - Qaeda would like nothing better than for us to threaten Syria , and when President Ahmmadinejad would like nothing better than to be threatened by us .
This is diplomacy by skimming ; it is internationalism by drawing pictures of Superman in the margins of the text books ; it is a presidency of Cliff Notes .
And to Iran and Syria -- and , yes , also to the insurgents in Iraq -- we must look like a country , run by the equivalent of the drunken pest , who gets battered to the floor of the saloon by one punch , then staggers to his feet , and shouts at the other guy 's friends , " ok , which one of you is next ? "
Mr. Bush , the question is no longer " what are you thinking ? , " but rather " are you thinking at all ? "
" I have made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq 's other leaders that America 's commitment is not open - ended , " you said last night .
And yet -- without any authorization from the public who spoke so loudly and clearly to you in November 's elections ; without any consultation with a Congress ( in which key members of your own party like Senator Brownback and Senator Coleman and Senator Hagel are fleeing for higher ground ) ; without any awareness that you are doing exactly the opposite of what Baker - Hamilton urged you to do , you seem to be ready to make an open - ended commitment ( on America 's behalf ) to do whatever you want , in Iran .
Our military , Mr. Bush , is already stretched so thin by this bogus adventure in Iraq , that even a majority of serving personnel are willing to tell pollsters that they are dissatisfied with your prosecution of the war .
It is so weary , that many of the troops you have just consigned to Iraq , will be on their second tours , or their third tours , or their fourth tours -- and now you 're going to make them take on Iran and Syria as well ?
Who is left to go and fight , sir ?
Who are you going to send to " interrupt the flow of support from Iran and Syria " ?
Laura and Barney ?
The line is from the movie " Chinatown " and I quote it often .
" Middle of a drought , " the mortician chuckles , " and the water commissioner drowns .
Only in L.A. ! "
' Middle of a debate over the lives and deaths of another 21,500 of our citizens in Iraq ... and the President wants to saddle up against Iran and Syria . '
Maybe that 's the point : to shift the attention away from just how absurd and childish , is this latest war strategy ( strategy , that is , for the war already under way , and not the one , on deck ) .
We are to put 17,500 more troops into Baghdad and 4,000 more into Anbar Province to give the Iraqi government " breathing space . "
In and of itself , that is an awful and insulting term .
The lives of 21,500 more Americans endangered , to give " breathing space " to a government that just turned the first and perhaps the most sober act of any Democracy -- the capitol punishment of an ousted dictator -- into a vengeance lynching so barbaric , and so lacking in the solemnities necessary for credible authority , that it might have offended the Ku Klux Klan of the 19th Century .
And what will our men and women in Iraq do ?
The ones who will truly live -- and die -- during what Mr. Bush said last night will be a " year ahead " which " will demand more patience , sacrifice , and resolve " ?
They will try to seal up Sadr City and other parts of Baghdad , in which the civil war is worst .
Mr. Bush did not mention that while our people are trying to do that , the factions in the civil war will no longer have to focus on killing each other but rather , they can focus anew on killing our people .
Because last night the President foolishly all but announced that we will be sending these 21,500 poor souls over -- but , no more after that -- and if the whole thing fizzles out , we 're going home .
The plan fails militarily .
The plan fails symbolically .
The plan fails politically .
Most importantly , perhaps , Mr. Bush , the plan fails because it still depends on your credibility .
You speak of mistakes , and of the responsibility " resting " with you .
But you do not admit to making those mistakes .
And you offer us nothing to justify this clenched fist towards Iran and Syria .
In fact , when you briefed news correspondents off - the - record before the speech , they were told , once again , " if you knew what we knew ... if you saw what we saw ... "
" If you knew what we knew , " was how we got into this morass in Iraq , in the first place .
The problem arose , when it turned out that the question was n't whether or not we knew what you knew but whether you knew what you knew .
You , sir , have become the President who cried wolf .
All that you say about Iraq now , could be gospel .
All that you say about Iran and Syria now , could be prescient and essential .
We no longer have a clue , sir .
We have heard too many stories .
Many of us are as inclined to believe you just shuffled the Director of National Intelligence over to the State Department , because he thought you were wrong about Iran .
Many of us are as inclined to believe you just put a pilot in charge of ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan because he would be truly useful in an air war next door in Iran .
Your assurances , sir , and your demands that we trust you , have lost all shape and texture .
They are now merely fertilizer for conspiracy theories .
They are now fertilizer indeed .
The pile has been built slowly and with seeming care .
I read this list last night , before the President 's speech , and it bears repetition , because its shape and texture are perceptible only in such a context .
Before Mr. Bush was elected , he said nation - building was wrong for America .
Now he says it is vital .
He said he would never put U.S. troops under foreign control .
Last night he promised to embed them , in Iraqi units .
He told us about WMD .
Mobile labs .
Secret sources .
Aluminum tubes .
Yellow - cake .
He has told us the war is necessary because Saddam was a material threat .
Because of 9/11 .
Because of Osama Bin Laden .
Al - Qaeda .
Terrorism in General .
To liberate Iraq .
To spread freedom .
To spread Democracy .
To prevent terrorism by gas price increases .
Because this was a guy who tried to kill his Dad .
Because 439 words in to the speech last night , he trotted out 9/11 again .
In advocating and prosecuting this war he passed on a chance to get Abu Musab Al - Zarqawi .
To get Muqtada Al - Sadr .
To get Bin Laden .
He sent in fewer troops than the Generals told him to .
He ordered the Iraqi army disbanded and the Iraqi government " De-Baathified . "
He short - changed Iraqi training .
He neglected to plan for widespread looting .
He did not anticipate sectarian violence .
He sent in troops without life - saving equipment .
Gave jobs to foreign contractors , and not Iraqis .
He staffed U.S. positions there , based on partisanship , not professionalism .
He and his government told us " America had prevailed " , " Mission Accomplished " , the resistance was in its " last throes " .
He has insisted more troops were not necessary .
He has now insisted more troops are necessary .
He has insisted it 's up to the generals , and then removed some of the generals who said more troops would not be necessary .
He has trumpeted the turning points :
The fall of Baghdad ; the death of Uday and Qusay ; the capture of Saddam ; A provisional government ; a charter ; a constitution ; the trial of Saddam ; elections ; purple fingers ; another government ; the death of Saddam .
He has assured us : we would be greeted as liberators with flowers ; as they stood up , we would stand down .
We would stay the course ; we were never about " stay the course . "
We would never have to go door - to - door in Baghdad .
And last night , that to gain Iraqis ' trust , we would go door - to - door in Baghdad .
He told us the enemy was Al - Qaeda , foreign fighters , terrorists , Baathists , and now Iran and Syria .
The war would pay for itself .
It would cost 1.7 billion dollars .
100 billion . 400 billion .
Half a trillion .
Last night 's speech alone cost another six billion .
And after all of that , now it is his credibility versus that of generals , diplomats , allies , Democrats , Republicans , the Iraq Study Group , past presidents , voters last November , and the majority of the American people .
Oh , and one more to add , tonight : Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia .
Mr. Bush , this is madness .
You have lost the military .
You have lost the Congress to the Democrats .
You have lost most of the Iraqis .
You have lost many of the Republicans .
You have lost our Allies .
You are losing the credibility , not just of your Presidency , but more importantly of the office itself .
And most imperatively , you are guaranteeing that more American troops will be losing their lives , and more families their loved ones .
You are guaranteeing it !
This becomes your legacy , sir :
How many of those you addressed last night as your " fellow citizens " you just sent to their deaths ?
And for what , Mr. Bush ?
So the next President has to pull the survivors out of Iraq instead of you ?
Good night and good luck .
Local traders have welcomed the opening of the pass
The Himalayan pass of Nathu La , 4,000 m ( 14,000 feet ) above sea level , was once part of the ancient Silk Road and saw clashes between the sides in the 1960s .
The opening ceremony took place at the windswept border between the Indian state of Sikkim and Tibet .
Nathu
La has opened just a few days after the first train service was launched from eastern China to Tibet .
The pass was given a festive look with Chinese and Indian flags fluttering and military bands playing .
China 's ambassador to India and local officials from Sikkim and Tibet attended the opening ceremony at the border post in driving rain and bitter cold .
But the BBC's Subir Bhaumik , who was at the opening , says despite the poor weather conditions there was no shortage of enthusiasm among the hundreds of Indian and Chinese traders who had gathered there .
Our lives are going to change once trade gets going

" We hope the reopening of the silk route will improve relations between the two countries , " China 's ambassador to India Sun Yuxi told the AFP news agency .
" Today the border is open for traders and we hope very soon it will be open for tourists .
We are excited and feeling very good . "
The BBC's South Asia correspondent , Navdip Dhariwal , says the reopening of the route signifies a huge leap forward in diplomacy and trade between both countries .
Local traders have welcomed the opening and say it will have a major impact on the regional economy .
" Our lives are going to change once trade gets going , " a grocery supplier , Sonar Bhutia , is quoted as saying by the AFP news agency .
" We 're hoping to profit by it . "
But correspondents say the opening is more symbolic than substantive , with trade confined to some local goods .
India will import 15 items from China , including goat and sheep skins , yak tails and raw silk .
China , for its part , will import 29 items including tea , rice and spices .
" Trading will take place four days a week , Monday to Thursday , " says Sikkim director of industries , Saman Prasad Subba .
Diplomatic triumph
Some analysts believe that trade through the land route could generate millions of dollars in trade eventually .
Both sides have put their bitter past behind them
But at the moment most agree that there are more immediate political benefits rather than economic .
" This resumption of border trade is more significant for Indian diplomacy , not for trade , " says Jayantanuja Bandopadhyay , professor of international relations in Calcutta 's Jadavpur University .
Sikkim is a former Buddhist kingdom that merged with India in 1975 , a move that was opposed by China which lay claim to the state .
" By allowing trade through Nathu La , China has accepted Sikkim as part of India that it refused to do earlier , " Mr Bandopadhyay says .
The Nathu La pass was closed in 1962 after war broke out between China and India .
The famed Silk Road was an ancient trading route that once connected China with India , West Asia and Europe .
The game of PC modding leapfrog now has another formidable participant , as the PC - stuffed Gameboy sure gives the Compubeaver a real run for its money .
Apparently , the zany modders at the helm grabbed Via 's EPIA PX10000G motherboard , a few cutting tools , a couple of LEDs , and went at it .
Quite simply , this classic Gameboy will probably never play a round of Mario ever again , but it should n't have any qualms firing up AIM , Folding@Home , or any other Windows XP application .
The A and B buttons were carefully replaced with activity indicators , while both sides of the unit were gashed open to make room for a pair of USB ports , an Ethernet jack , and a VGA output as well .
Atop the unit sits a 4GB CF card , which purportedly houses a fresh copy of the operating system , and while they did stop short of installing a high - resolution LCD to give users the ultimate mobile Windows experience , you 've got to give cred where it 's due .

The current US presidential debates are almost certain to see the candidates asked to comment on spiritual issues , but some Americans are worried about the trend towards religiosity in public life .
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton will be challenged on their beliefs
It is an idyllic couple of days - a communing with nature which my wife gallantly insists is simply too enjoyable for her to take part in - it has to be a dad 's experience .
Actually it is not that uncomfortable .
The tents are sensible structures with plenty of room to stand up .
There are rudimentary bunk beds you can bang your head on in the early morning .
The setting is a reminder too of the size of the United States - only two hours from the nation 's capital , these are woods and fields as empty and isolated as any in the Scottish Highlands .
The kids love it .
They and 20 other seven - year - olds , roast marshmallows by the campfire , catch tadpoles in the pond , and roam around , unwashed , at five in the morning in the early light of the West Virginia day , pointing their torches into each other 's tents .
Silence before breakfast
" Did Cole see a bug and sleep in his dad 's car ?
Did Peter 's water bottle break ?
Did Talia 's mum fall out of bed ? "
Etc etc , and then comes breakfast .
Breakfast is an indoors affair , not luxurious but hey this is America and these are middle class kids and some parents are beginning to flag by seven in the morning and there is a need for the familiar comforts of multi-coloured cereals and soy milk .
First though - a silence .
" Please take off your hats , " asks the jolly camp counsellor ( yes , that is what they call them ) .
She looks down and up again .
The silence lasts less than 30 seconds and my two children discover that there are pancakes with M&Ms inside them and we give the silence not another thought .
But I am a foreigner here , an anthropologist , and one of the pitfalls of anthropology is that there are some things you have to be a member of the tribe to really get .
Unbeknownst to me the silence has caused outrage , or to be more precise , has caused pleasure to some and great outrage to others .
I discover this later when talking to a dad about the post silence debate which took place between certain concerned parents and the silence enforcing camp counsellor .
Religious divide
Basically the problem is this :
What was the silence ?
Was it contemplative or was it religious ?
The distinction to my English mind was unimportant .
I am personally not religious but I am not fussed about the trappings of religion in the public space .
The Creation Museum exhibits the Earth 's history according to the Bible
Some parents believed that the breakfast silence was an attempt by a religious cabal to take over our camp , to insinuate their beliefs into our get - together , to steal the minds of our kids .
Are they right to be in such a funk ?
I am not sure that they are .
America is famously religious , infamously if you like , but try as they might , the real hard - line theocracy crowd repeatedly fail to get their ideas to fly .
When you visit them , as I did , coincidentally , just days after the breakfast silence issue , you find a group of people in a funk comparable to that of the atheists .
I was at the Creation Museum in Kentucky , the day after it opened , a moment evangelicals should really have been celebrating with great gusto .
And to an extent they were .
The museum is a striking place , with wonderfully life - like models of Adam and Eve and the garden of Eden , and an airy , well put - together feel .
But I did not get the impression from those in charge or from those visiting , that they considered themselves to be on the march in modern America .
In fact the whole thing had a slightly beleaguered feel .
One parent confided : " At last there 's a place I can bring the kids where they are taught what we teach them at home . "
Another asked me almost plaintively whether I was convinced by the museum 's planetarium where the sun was created after the Earth .
Freedom of choice
I had to be honest and say that I was not , but I felt quite sorry as I did .
There is nothing remotely convincing about the Creation Museum and frankly if it poses the threat to American science that some American critics claim it does , that seems to me to be as much a commentary on the failings of the scientific establishment as it is on the creationists .
At the Creation Museum goggle - eyed children watch depictions of the Great Flood
There is a reason , I think , why theocracy will never fly in the United States and it has been touched on , inadvertently , by George Bush himself .
Mr Bush often makes the point that the philosophy of the Islamic radicals , full of hate and oppression , would not be attractive to people who truly had the freedom to choose .
Similarly the philosophy of the Old Testament , so much celebrated by some evangelicals here , has a limited power to enthral free people .
At the Creation Museum , goggle - eyed children watch depictions of the Great Flood in which children and their mums and dads are consumed , because God is cross .
In a nation of kindly moderate people I am not sure this is the future .
I put my faith - in America .

In 10 U.S. states , either this year or last year or both , the state legislature has introduced and considered , though not yet passed , a bill to petition the U.S. House of Representatives to impeach Bush and Cheney .
The question , of course , is what in the heck is wrong with the other 40 states ?
We ca n’t find a single state legislator with the decency to uphold the U.S. Constitution and at least introduce a resolution to impeach ?
Where are the states that created the Constitution ?
Where are Massachusetts and Virginia ?
What ’s holding up New York ?
Where in the world is Oregon ?
Is this all the pressure we can muster in the cause of justice ?
But let ’s give credit where it ’s due .
These 10 states have acted : CA , HI , IL , MN , MO , WA , VT , NM , WI , TX .
These 10 legislators who ’ve taken the lead should be drafted to run for Congress ( except for Ellison , whom we ’ve already elected to Congress ) : Les Ihara , Jr. HI ; Lon Burnam TX ; Gerald Ortiz y Pino NM ; Eric Oemig WA ; Paul Koretz CA ; Daryl Pillsbury VT ; Karen Yarbrough IL ; Jamilah Nasheed MO ; Frank Boyle WI ; and Keith Ellison MN .
Special credit goes to Oemig and Ortiz y Pino who have come close to passing their bills .
( Original Article )
“ You ’ll change your mind when you get older . ”
This is what people are always telling me when I state , firmly and without question , that I do n’t want children .
“ You ’ll change your mind , ” they say , shaking their heads and clucking their tongues , as if somehow getting older will suddenly make me want to tie myself down to one person , grow a parasitic - like life form in my body for an excruciating nine months during which I will probably vomit a lot and have to pee every five minutes , gain weight I will probably never lose , and then actually have to birth the thing .
If there ’s one thing I know for sure , it ’s that my vagina , if not me , does not want to be subjected to something that large trying to push its way out .
Hell no .
I have an aversion to the whole baby thing .
The pregnancy , the birthing , the raising of the child .
I have a feeling I ’d completely fuck it up and my kid would end up being the next Charles Mason .
I ’d almost certainly make him gay by naming him something ridiculous like Jesus or Lance or Jane and forcing him to take ballet classes instead of football , because seriously , even for a child ( or maybe especially for a child ) , I am not going to watch football .
So really , it ’s best that I not have babies .
Of course , I ’ve always said that , if I ever mysteriously got pregnant , I would n’t get an abortion .
It ’s not that I ’m averse to abortions , because I firmly believe in a woman ’s right to choose , but I do n’t think I could actually go through with one .
Philosophically , however , a woman owns her own body and has a right to decide what happens to and in it .
If she does n’t want a parasitic life form growing inside her , making her fat and bloated and nauseous , then I completely understand .
By now you ’re probably wondering what the hell this has to do with GLBT news .
I ’ll be honest with you–so far , not much .
Actually , it has more to do with sheep than anything else .
Gay sheep .
Gay sheep that can be de-gayed through the use of hormone treatments in order to get them interested in ewes for breeding purposes .
This discovery has shaken the liberals in the world of science .
We ’ve always suspected there is likely a genetic component to homosexuality , but for the most part no one has been looking for it .
Conservatives do n’t want to find it because they believe homosexuality is a choice ; liberals do n’t want to find it because , as with gay sheep ( and man , I never thought I ’d hear myself say that in a sentence ) , they do n’t want scientists to also discover a way to prevent or “ cure ” homosexuality , even if such a preventative measure would mean early detection via genetics resulting in abortion .
Because that ’s the next step , is n’t it ?
In developing nations across the world , and even some first world nations , people practice selective abortion .
This has been happening in Asia for decades , particularly in China where there is a limit on the number of children one can have , and in India and Africa , where having girls is far more expensive than having boys .
People in the United States abort if a genetic disease is found early enough , such as Down ’s syndrome .
If scientists are able to find the genetic component that causes homosexuality in humans , is n’t selective abortion the next step ?
Could homosexuality become a genetic disease , like Down ’s , to which parents just ca n’t bear to subject their children ?
People are always saying , “ If I could choose my sexuality , do you really think I ’d choose to be gay ? ”
For me , the answer is YES .
If we were n’t gay , who would we be ?
We would n’t be us ; we ’d be someone else , with different life experiences and a different sense of community and socialization .
Being gay is n’t just a genetic happenstance , it ’s an entire culture .
Like Judaism , with more buttsex .
Allegedly .
As a parent , however , especially in the United States where nearly half the country still believes that gays do not deserve equal rights and votes to keep discrimination in place , if they could choose whether or not to have a gay child ?
It would be quite the conundrum .
On the one hand , most of the same people who believe homosexuality is an abomination also believe that abortion is murder .
Andrew Sullivan addresses this question in his essay from the Sunday Times :
“ In such a world , liberals and conservatives would be at sea .
America ’s religious right would have to make a choice between its goal of ridding the world of homosexuality and its strong opposition to abortion .
Liberals would have to concede that genetics do indeed matter , and deal with the consequences .
But how could they square their support for the right to abortion if it meant the deliberate extinction of a beleaguered minority ? ”
Because this is what we ’re talking about–deliberate extinction , which is just a nicer term for genocide .
As gruesome as the idea is , if Christianists and ultra-conservatives had the ability to detect homosexuality in the womb , what ’s to stop them from deciding that homosexuality is a bigger sin than abortion , and selectively ridding themselves of unborn children who possess the gay gene ?
By the same token , liberals have to take a step back and ask themselves : how important is choice , really ?
Is it more important the preservation of an entire class of people ?
In the end , I do n’t think that what Sullivan and others fear would actually happen–that intra-womb gaydar would mean the end of homosexuality altogether .
But mostly this is because I have a lot of faith in Christianists ’ ability to ignore scientific evidence , believe every life is sacred , and convince themselves that it ’s their duty to have as many babies as humanely possible .
Besides , accepting that homosexuality is based on genetic makeup would force ultra-conservative religious types to also accept that God really did make us this way , and He wants us to be gay .
I think this is a little too much logic for people who still believe the earth was only created 2000 years ago , that dinosaurs are a liberal scientist conspiracy against God , and that global warming is just a figment of Al Gore ’s imagination .
I ’ve read the Chicklet pamphlets , so I know .
Besides which , I bet Corky ’s parents are pretty damned happy they did n’t abort him back in the day .
Science , like sex , is n’t good or bad , it just IS .
It ’s what we do with it , our intentions behind its use that has the potential to create problems .
I ’d like to believe in a world where no one would abort their child because he or she might turn out gay .
No , I do n’t have anything else to add to that ; just , I would like to believe in that world .
And maybe someday , the world will honor my faith , but until then , we ’ll always have San Francisco .

Many of you might recall the 80 's - era sci-fi TV show " Max Headroom . "
The premiere episode 's storyline was about a new kind of advertising which delivered information at such a rapid - fire pace that the viewers ' heads would explode .
While the show might have been somewhat prophetic in one aspect , it seems the opposite effect might actually be more the case : viewers ' info - intake is more likely to shut down and implode under the avalanche of information we 're currently inundated with on a daily basis .
The problem with today 's fast - paced , info - age lifestyle is the danger that we 're becoming * so * harried and bombarded with information that we lose the time and the patience required to actually slow down and be a bit more analytical in our thoughts .
This of course creates an ideal atmosphere for the purveyors of McMemes .
We lead such busy lives that we tend to grab our information on the fly -- often without double - checking or second - guessing .
McMemes ( or McInfo , if you do n't care for memetics jargon ) are kind of a bastard child of Mach 's principle of economy of thought .
Metaphorically speaking , they 're like overprocessed , fast - food , " pieces - parts " nuggets of information -- often aimed right at the gut .
They are n't always the best kind of " brain food " because they are n't always accurate , do n't always encourage you to think , and a lot of them tend to have staying power simply because they push the right buttons .
They tend to encourage and reinforce lazy thinking such as false dichotomies , stereotyping , conflating issues and subject matter , and other emotion - based reasoni reactioning .
Journalists , preachers , lawyers , politicians and entertainers can be quite skilled in serving up McMemes because they love to utilize the kind of language that tugs at the emotions , pushes buttons and win converts / customers .
Thanks to them , we are now familiar with McMemes such as " Men are From Mars ; Women are From Venus " ; various urban legends ; the idea that Iraq was somehow connected to the 9/11 terrorist attacks ; that Republicans or Democrats allegedly represent certain values ; that people from different states are either " red " or " blue " according to the 2004 election results ; etc. etc .
Predictably , with so much competition in this Age of Information , and audiences ' attention spans becoming ever shorter like an ADD child , McMeme purveyors have resorted to grabbing the audiences ' attention through such time - honored advertising techniques as flashy presentation , shouting , simplistic " good guys vs bad guys " dichotomies , and becoming virtual cartoon characters .

Technology Review : なぜ多くのソフトウェアはそんなに粗悪なのでしょうか?
Bjarne Stroustrup : 良いものもあります 。Mars Rovers、 Google、 Human、 Genome Projectは高品質なソフトウェアです。15年前、こういうものを作るのは不可能だと思われていました。技術文明はソフトウェアに依存しているので、ソフトウェアがそんなにダメだったら我々はとうに滅びていたでしょう。
他方で 、 " 平均的な "
コードを見ると私はぞっとします。構造はひどいし、明らかにプログラマーは正しさやアルゴリズムやデータ構造、保全性について深く考えていません。多くの人は実際のところコードを読むことはなく、Internet Explorer やWindows が「フリーズ」するたびに電話で助けを求めたり、新聞でコンピュータウィルスについての記事を読んで戦慄してみたりするだけです。
真の問題は、我々ソフトウェア開発者がいつも緊急事態にあり、仕事を成し遂げるために藁にもすがろうとしていることです。我々は試行錯誤や力業の過度の使用や数多くのテストによって多くの場合そこそこの成功を得ることができますが、しばしばそれは十分ではありません。
ソフトウェア開発者は信頼性の低い部品からそこそこ信頼性のあるシステムを組み上げるという難しい芸当に熟達してしまいました。問題は、我々がしばしば自分でどうやったのかを正確に理解していないことです。(試行錯誤の結果)システムがなんとなく最低限受容可能なものになった、といった感じに。個人的には私はシステムがいつ動き、なぜ動くのかを理解していたほうが良いと思っています。
TR : どうやったら我々が置かれているこのひどい状態を修復できるでしょうか?
BS : 理論的には、答えは単純です。開発者を教育してより適切なデザイン方法を用い、柔軟で長期間の使用に耐えるようなデザインをするのです。正しく堅固で安全なシステムに正当に報い、いい加減な仕事を罰することです。
現実ではそれは不可能です。粗悪でバグのあるソフトを供給する開発者が報酬を受けます。なぜなら人々が新しいいかしたガジェットを求めるからです。彼らは不便を嫌い、コンピュータの使い方を学ぼうとはせず、配達が遅れることを嫌い、品質のために余分な金をかけようとはかけたがりません(品質の違いが明瞭に分かる時以外は、あるいはそういう場合でさえ)。従ってユーザが変わらない限り、ソフトウェア業者が変わることはなさそうです。
コーヒーマシンから会計システムまで全てをプログラミングしなおす間世界を停止させておくというわけにはいきません。だからといって、ただいきあたりばったりでやっていくのも高くつき、危険で、気が滅入るものです。本質的な改革が必要なのです。そして、それは徐々に進めるしかありません。改革は広範なものでなくてはならず、単一の変化だけでは無意味です。
1つの問題は、理論の弊害です。万能薬と思われていることが多過ぎます。より良いデザイン手法、より良い仕様策定技術、よりよいテスト技術、より良いOS、より良いミドルウェアインフラストラクチャー、より良いアプリケーションドメイン、データ構造やアルゴリズムに対するより深い理解といったものが役に立つと思われています。例えば、タイプ理論、モデルベース開発、形式的方法がいくつかの分野で重要であると考えられてます。しかし、大きなプロジェクトにおいて、他のアプローチの代替物として使われるだけでは失敗に終わるだけです。人々は自分たちが知っているものやうまくいくと知っているものを使おうとします。「他にどんな方法があるんだ?」と言って。しかし、要求とリソースをバランスさせるために必要な技術的な成熟度を持ち合わせている人はほとんどいません。
TR : C++には、効率的なコードと引き換えにプログラマーに負担を要求するというコンセプトがあったと思います。ベル研究所は、限られたごく有能な人が、あまり速くなかったElectronic
Switching Systems ( ESS ) のようなコンピュータ上で走らせるコードを書くための言語を求めました。今日では、たくさんのソフトウェア開発者がおり、コンピュータはとても高速です。このことによってC++を使う価値は下がったでしょうか?
BS : C++は特に大型スイッチングマシン用というわけではなく極めて広い種類に渡るアプリケーションを開発するためにデザインされました。ベル研究所では、あらゆる種類のコンピュータやOSを使うあらゆる規模の、多岐に渡る興味深いプロジェクトが生まれました。しかし、確かにベル研究所の平均的プログラマーは多くの人が考える「平均的プログラマー」よりははるかに有能であり、信頼性や高速性は(この順序で)他の場所で考えられるよりははるかに重要視されていました。
高速性は、私が興味あるアプリケーションの多くでは依然として重要課題でした。インターフェイスの応答性、アプリケーションの起動と終了にかかる時間といったものです。ソフトウェア開発者は現代のコンピュータハードウェアの驚くべき性能を、何層もの手の込み過ぎた[ソフトウェア上の]抽象化によって相殺してしまいました。ハードウェアの線形な高速化は限界に達したようですが、多くの場合、奪われたかなりの「計算時間」をソフトウェアから取り戻す余地が残されています。
正規教育によって平均的プログラマーにC++が習得されることが実質的に少なくなった折りには(?) 、C++はあまりにも「エキスパート向け」になってしまった、と言われました。しかし、解決法はプログラミング言語を大衆化することではなく、より多様なプログラミング言語を用い、より多くのエキスパートを育てることなのです。そういったエキスパートが使うための言語が存在する必要があり、C++はその一つなのです。
TR : 振り返ってみて、C++のデザインにおいて、開発効率、セキュリティ、そしてソフトウェアの信頼性を実行時の高速性と引き換えにするという選択は根本的な間違いではありませんでしたか?
BS : 私がそういうトレードオフを行ったとは考えていません。私はエレガントで効率的なコードを求めました。これらの対立(効率性対プログラミング時間、効率性対(プログラミングの)ハイレベルさ、など)はまやかしです。
私のしたことは、C++をまず第一にシステムプログラミング用言語としてデザインすることです。私はデバイスドライバや、組込みシステムや、ハードウェアを直接制御するコードを書けるようになりたかったのです。次に、私はC++をツールをデザインするのに適した言語にしたいと思いました。それには柔軟性と高速性だけでなくエレガントなインターフェイスを表現するための能力が必要でした。私の考えは、ハイレベルなことをするためには、つまり完成されたアプリケーションを構築するためには、まず適当な抽象化を実現してくれるライブラリを買うか開発するか借りるかする必要があるということです。人々がC++ではまるとき、真の問題はしばしば彼らが適切なライブラリを持たないか見つけられないということにあります。
他の言語はより直接的にハイレベルアプリケーションをサポートしようとしました。それはうまくいきますが、しばしばその目的のために特化してしまうことになります。個人的には、私は自分がやりたいことだけができるようなツールをデザインすることはしません。私は汎用性を目指しています。
TR : C++が多くのプログラマーによって批判や憤慨の対象となっていると同時に極めて広く使われているという事実をどう受け止めますか?
BS : 表向きの答えとしては、世の中にはただ二種類だけの言語があり、一つは誰もが不平を言う言語で、もうひとつは誰も使わない言語だということです。
ひどいと言われている言語で開発されたシステムのほうが、美しいと讃えられている言語で開発されたシステムよりもはるかに便利であったりします。プログラミング言語の目的は良いシステムを開発する手助けをすることであり、「良い」にも色々あります。私の簡潔な定義では、正しく、保守可能で、十分高速であることです。美学も大事ですが、1にも2にも大事なのは言語が便利であることです。現実世界のプログラマーが現実世界のアイディアを簡潔にかつ手頃な労力で表現できなければいけません。
C++の成功の主要な要因は、単にC++がその限られたデザイン上の目標を満たすものであったことです。その目標とは、極めて広範なアイディアを直接かつ効率的に表現できるということです。C++はただ一つのことを非常にうまくやるためにデザインされた言語ではなく、「良くない」と考えられていることを人々にさせないようにデザインされた言語でもありません。その代わりに、私は汎用性と高速性に努力を集中しました。
私は、C++が嫌いであると自称しているプログラマーの中でも一人ぐらいは好きになる人がいると確信しています(? ) 。
しかし、私の友達が行ったカンファレンスで、基調講演者が、一つめにどれぐらい多くの人がC++が嫌いか、二つめにどれぐらい多くの人がC++プログラムを書いたか、という質問に対して聴衆に挙手を求めました。一つめの質問に手を挙げたグループは二つめのグループの二倍の人数でした。自分がよく知らない物に対して嫌悪を表明するのはたいていの場合偏見であることが知られています。また、不平を言う人たちはいつも声が大きく、擁護者--分別のある人は欠陥を認める--より確信に満ちています。私は他の誰よりもC++の持つ問題を承知していると思いますが、また一方でそれらを避けてC++の力を使う術も知っていると思います。
そして、もちろんC++との競争に敗れた言語の支持者がそれに対し礼儀正しくあることを期待してはいけません。ソフトウェア開発の世界にはそんなプロフェッショナリズムはありません。私はそれができることを望んでいますが。この点で科学は違います。新しい道具や技術や理論が勝利を収めたとき、人々はそれを進歩と見ます。ソフトウェアの世界では、競争相手や先駆者の寄与が広く認められたり評価されたりすることはなく、理解されることすらありません。
TR : あなた は" The Design and Evolution of C++" の中で、キルケゴールがあなたのプログラミング言語のコンセプトに影響を与えたと述べています。これはジョークですか?
BS : ちょっとうぬぼれてみましたが、ジョークではありません。ソフトウェア開発に関する多くの思想はグループ、チーム、会社に焦点を当てています。これはしばしば個人の独創的な能力や技能を表出させることなく企業「文化」に埋没させるほどです。企業の風習は、技術関係で突出した能力やイニシアティブを持つ個人に冷淡であることがあります。私は技術者に対するそのような扱いは非道で能力の浪費であると考えます。キルケゴールは「大衆」に対する「個人」を強く擁護しており、美学的・道徳的振る舞いの重要性について真摯な議論を行いました。C++の仕様のうち特定の何かを挙げて「これは19世紀の哲学者の影響です」と言うことはできませんが、彼は私が「誤用」を防ぐために「エキスパートレベル」の仕様の排除したり、自分が便利だと考える用途だけをサポートするように仕様を限定したりすることに抵抗することのルーツの一つです。私はキルケゴールの宗教哲学を特に好むわけではありませんが。
TR : 最も後悔することは何ですか ?
BS : 後悔はありません !
もちろんもっと違った形でうまくやれたかもしれないと思うことはありますが、真面目に言って、私が1984年のBjarneにけちをつけられるでしょうか?
彼は今の私より経験は少ないですが、より無能であったというわけではなく、おそらく今よりも賢く、1984年について私よりもよく理解していたでしょう。C++は我々の生活を向上させる多くのシステムを構築するために使われており、後発の言語やシステムに重要な良い影響を与えました。これは誇るべきことです。
The average professional workweek has expanded steadily over the last 10 years , according to the Center for Work Life Policy , and logging 70 - plus hours is now the norm at the top .

So how to reconcile the seemingly conflicting trends — the fact that we are working harder and wasting more time ?
A crotchety boss might say that we ’re working longer because we ’re wasting time , but the opposite may also be true .
We are wasting time because we are working harder .
“ The longer you work , the less efficient you are , ” said Bob Kustka , the founder of Fusion Factor , a productivity and time - management consulting firm in Norwell , Mass .
He says workers are like athletes in that they are most efficient in concentrated bursts .
Elite athletes “ play a set of tennis , a down of football or an inning of baseball and have a pause in between , ” he says .
Working energy , like physical energy , “ is best used in spurts where we work hard on a few focused activities and then take a brief respite , ” he says .
And those respites look an awful lot like wasting time .
It has taken me years to make tentative peace with my stops and starts during work .
Every morning I vow to become a morning person , starting full speed out of the gate .
And every morning I daydream , shuffle papers , read e-mail messages and visit blogs , and somehow it is time for lunch .
Then , at about 2 p.m. , a sense of urgency kicks in , and I write steadily , until about 5 or 6 , when I revert to the little - of - this , some - of - that style of the morning .
Over the years I have come to see that the hours away from the writing are the time when the real work gets done .
When a paragraph turns itself this way and that in a corner of my brain even while my fingers are buying books on Amazon.com .
What appears to be wasted time is really jell time .
This redefinition only makes me feel a little less guilty .

In the wake of World War 2 the United States government enacted legislation which prohibited any other nations from receiving the scientific bounty derived from the Manhattan Project .
This meant that despite the participation of British scientists in the project , Britain recieved none of the benefits of the research .
The year after the United States ’ first successful nuclear bomb test in July of 1945 , the British government decided that they too must develop a nuclear program in order to maintain their position as a world power .
This pilot project eventually developed into the Windscale Nuclear plant .
In October 1957 , after several years of successful operation , the workers at Windscale noticed some curious readings from their temperature monitoring equipment as they carried out standard maintenance .
The reactor temperature was slowly rising during a time that they expected it to be falling .
The remote detection equipment seemed to be malfunctioning , so two plant workers donned protective equipment and hiked to the reactor to inspect it in person .
When they arrived , they were alarmed to discover that the interior of the uranium - filled reactor was ablaze .
Windscale ’s two nuclear piles had been constructed in concrete buildings just outside of the small village of Seascale , Cumbria to produce Britain ’s bounty of weapons - grade plutonium .
The fission reactors had a straightforward air - cooled configuration which allowed each one to exhaust its excess heat through a tall chimney .
Breeder reactors such as those at Windscale create plutonium by bombarding the most common isotope of uranium ( uranium - 238 ) with neutrons .
Any uranium atoms which happen to absorb a neutron briefly become uranium - 239 , an unstable element which rapidly decays into neptunium - 239 .
Having a half - life of only 2.355 days , this element also soon decays , resulting in the desired plutonium - 239 .
Each of the heavily shielded Windscale reactors was comprised of a stack of massive graphite bricks .
A series of vertical boreholes through these blocks acted as channels for the reactor ’s control rods which were used to absorb loose neutrons and thereby govern the fission rate .
Hundreds of horizontal channels were carved into the blocks in a octagonal pattern for inserting canisters filled with whatever substances the scientists wished to bombard with neutrons .
Many contained uranium to convert into plutonium , but others were special isotope cartridges for producing radioisotopes .
The canisters were pushed into place through the front of the reactor⁠ — known as the charge face⁠ — and once the neutrons had worked their magic and turned a good portion of the metallic uranium into plutonium , they were pushed out through the back into a water duct for cooling .
The reactor itself was cooled by way of a fan - driven air duct which forced air over the reactor core and out the 400 - foot - tall discharge stacks .
As a last - minute modification , and at a great effort and expense , a filtering system was added to the top of each chimney at the insistence of a physicist named Sir John Cockcroft .
These filters came to be known as “ Cockcroft ’s Folly ” due to their engineering difficulty and questionable value .
It was not understood during the plant ’s construction that graphite which is subjected to neutron bombardment has a tendency to store that energy within dislocations in its crystalline structure .
This stored energy is called Wigner energy , named after physicist Eugene Wigner who discovered the effect during his own experiments .
Left unchecked , graphite has a tendency to spontaneously release its accumulated Wigner energy in a powerful burst of heat .
This was made apparent after two years of operation , at which time unexpected temperature increases were observed in the cores .
On one occasion this occurred while the reactor was shut down .
To combat the Wigner energy buildup , the operators at Windscale instituted a process whereby the accumulated energy was allowed to escape by heating the graphite bricks to 250 + degrees Celsius , a process called annealing .
At such temperatures the crystalline structure of the graphite expands enough to allow the displaced molecules to slip back into place and release their stored energy gradually , causing a uniform release which then spreads throughout the core .
These annealing cycles were executed every few months , and they were performed while the reactor was fully loaded with its 35,000 cannisters of metallic uranium .
For a time , annealing succeeded in preventing the excessive buildup of Wigner energy .
But the reactors and their attendant instrumentation were not designed with annealing in mind , therefore the monitoring equipment tended to provide misleading feedback to the reactor operators .
The cycles were also notoriously unpredictable , releasing the pent - up energy at temperatures which varied from one instance to the next .
In 1957 , Windscale operators modified their procedures to require annealment every 40,000 Megawatt - days rather than every 30,000 .
They were growing concerned with the observation that higher temperatures were required each time , and that unexpected pockets of excessive Wigner energy were lingering in the graphite piles between cycles .
On 7 October of that year , the operators of Windscale Atomic Pile Number 1 began what would turn out to be its final annealing cycle .
After the initial heating of the reactor core , the control rods were re-inserted to slow down the fission process and allow the reactor to cool .
The temperature monitors , however , indicated a premature dwindling of temperature in the core , leading the operators to believe that the annealing had not been successfully initiated .
Unbeknowsnt to the workers , the readings produced by their equipment were inaccurate due to a combination of improperly placed instruments and uneven heat distribution caused by higher - than - normal pockets of Wigner energy .
Based on this misleading information , the operators made a fateful decision⁠ — they restarted the annealing process by heating the reactor once more .
When the control rods were withdrawn to allow the fission reactions to increase , the temperature inside the graphite stack increased to dangerous levels .
The heat became so extreme within the core that one of the canisters containing uranium or magnesium / lithium isotopes ruptured , spilling its contents and causing oxidation .
The blocks of graphite⁠ — a substance which cannot burn in the air except under extreme conditions ⁠— began to smolder .
Early in the fourth day of the annealing process , operators felt that something was amiss when some instruments indicated the core temperature was not slowly falling as expected , but actually increasing .
Their fears quickly compounded as they realized that the needles were pegged on the radiation meters at the top of the discharge stacks .
The shift foreman declared an emergency .
When the operators attempted to examine the pile with a remote scanner , much to their frustration the mechanism jammed .
The reactor manager ’s deputy Tom Hughes and another operator then made their way to the charge face of the reactor wearing protective gear to make a visual inspection of the core .
A fuel channel inspection plug was opened , and as Hughes later recounted , “ We saw to our complete horror , four channels of fuel glowing bright cherry red . ”
The reactor had been burning for nearly forty - eight hours .
Plant manager Tom Tuohy climbed eighty feet to the top of the reactor building clad in full protective equipment and breathing apparatus , and examined the rear discharge face while standing on the reactor lid .
He saw a red luminescence lighting up the space between the back of the reactor and the rear containment wall .
Unsure of how to deal with a fire of this nature , operators tried turning the cooling fans to full power in order to bleed off heat , but the oxygen provided by this effort only fueled the fire .
Tuohy suggested removing fuel cartridges from the heart of the fire manually by forcing them from their channels and into the cooling ponds using scaffolding poles .
The effort was valiant , but the poles were unable to withstand the punishment .
They were red hot as as they were withdrawn from the nuclear furnace , and the ends were dripping with molten radioactive uranium .
As one of the men battling the unique fire described the exposed fuel channels , “ It was white hot , it was just white hot .
Nobody , I mean , nobody , can believe how hot it could possibly be . ”
Next the men borrowed twenty - five metric tons of liquid carbon dioxide from the newly - built gas - cooled Calder Hall reactors next door .
Equipment was rigged to deliver the carbon dioxide to the charge face , but the heat from the fire was so intense that the oxygen was liberated from the carbon atoms upon contact , feeding the blaze into a renewed intensity .
By the morning of Friday 11 October , eleven tons of uranium were burning .
Equipment was registering temperatures of 1,300 degrees Celsius in the reactor , and climbing at a rate of 20 degrees per minute .
The cement containment around the burning reactor was in severe danger of collapse due to the extreme heat .
Having no other viable options , the operators decided to attempt to extinguish the fire with water .
This was a very risky proposition , as molten metal oxidizes when in contact with water .
The oxidation would create copious amounts of free hydrogen in the highly heated environment , possibly creating an explosion upon mixing with incoming air .
The workers used scaffolding poles to direct their hoses into fuel channels about a meter above the heart of the fire .
As the cooling and ventilating air were shut off , Tuohy ordered the evacuation of everyone except himself and the fire chief .
Tuohy scaled the reactor shielding one final time and ordered the water turned on .
As the hoses sprayed the charge face , he listened carefully for any signs of a hydrogen reaction as the hoses sprayed the graphite core .
Several more times he scaled up and down the reactor and reported how the flames slowly died away , “ I went up to check several times until I was satisfied that the fire was out .
I did stand to one side , sort of hopefully , but if you ’re staring straight at the core of a shut down reactor you ’re going to get quite a bit of radiation . ”
Removing a canister from the charge face
After twenty - four hours , the fire inside the reactor was finally extinguished .
Astonishingly , only about 20,000 curies of radioactive material were released into the environment .
It was determined that the amount of harmful radiation would have been far greater were it not for the “ Cockcroft ’s Folly ” filters .
While no citizens were evacuated from the surrounding areas due to the accident , there was some worry about milk from nearby dairy farms becoming contaminated with Iodine - 131 , which the human body will collect in the thyroid and which can result in thyroid cancer .
As a safety precaution , for about a month all milk from the surrounding 500 square kilometers was diluted and dumped into the sea .
Though some radiation was leaked over the countryside , it did n’t lead to any immediate death or injury to any of the reactor staff or members of the surrounding community .
Reactor Manager Tom Tuohy ⁠ — thought to have been exposed to the most radiation during the event⁠ — is now in his mid-80s and is living with his wife in the USA .
One study conducted in 1987 estimated that as many as thirty - three people may eventually die from cancers as a result of this accident , though the Medical Research Council Committee concluded that “ it is in the highest degree unlikely that any harm has been done to the health of anybody , whether a worker in the Windscale plant or a member of the general public . ”
In contrast , Chernobyl caused forty - seven immediate deaths and as many as 9,000 may die from related cancer .
Today , some areas of Cumbria still prompt a few clicks from Geiger counters due to lingering caesium - 137 isotopes .
While the Windscale reactors have been in the process of being decommissioned since the 1980s , the core of Windscale Pile 1 still contains roughly fifteen tons of warm and highly radioactive uranium , and the cleanup is not expected to finish until 2060 .
Ultimately the unnecessary incident could have been avoided with a bit of knowledge from the Manhattan project .
Had the American government opted to share the nuclear knowledge which the British had helped to gain , the mishap could have been avoided altogether .
Fortunately the foresight of Sir John Cockcroft and the valor of men like Tom Tuohy and Tom Hughes prevented this minor disaster from flaring into a national catastrophe .
An all - electric aircraft could soon appear over the horizon according to an article in the Institute of Physics ' journal , Superconductor Science and Technology .
The new type of aircraft , currently on the drawing board , could be far more efficient than conventional aircraft , produce less greenhouse emissions , and be quieter .
Air travel is on the increase , but it comes at a price in terms of the emissions driving climate change .
Aircraft currently account for about 5 % of UK emissions with a single long - haul flight the equivalent of a ton of carbon dioxide per passenger .
With such worrying figures making the headlines , alternatives to combustion - based propulsion systems could be the key .
Superconducting motors could be one such alternative , according to scientists in America .
Philippe Masson and Cesar Luongo from Florida State University , who have collaborated with Gerald Brown at NASA and Danielle Soban at Georgia Institute of Technology , explain that because superconductors lose no energy through electrical resistance , they could be very efficient components for a new type of aircraft propulsion .
The researchers explain that to build an electric aircraft will require propulsion motors that are high power , lightweight and compact .
Current technology cannot meet these demands because an electric motor using conventional magnets can weigh up to five times as much as conventional jet engine and not be as fuel efficient .
In contrast , a superconducting motor would be very lightweight and far more efficient electrically , generating three times the torque of a conventional electric motor for the same energy input and weight .
In addition , an electric aircraft would be far quieter than a conventional jet as there are no internal combustion processes involved .
It is the combustion of fossil fuels to drive a conventional aircraft that makes them so noisy .
However , superconducting magnets not only have to be cold , but require a unique energy supply .
Masson and his colleagues believe they could solve both problems by using chilly liquid hydrogen to run an electric fuel cell .
Liquid hydrogen is cold enough to make the superconducting magnets work but also has four times as much energy weight for weight than aviation fuel .
A fuel cell produces no polluting emissions , just warm water as the hydrogen combines with oxygen .
This , say the researchers would mean zero carbon emissions from the aircraft as it flies .
" The idea is to reduce the emissions from the aircraft and airports , " explains team leader Masson , " The energy needed to produce the liquid hydrogen could come from a remote powerplant " .
Such a powerplant might be solar or wind powered .
" We could potentially build a superconducting motor and generator smaller than a gas turbine , which would make possible electric propulsion , " says Masson .
Electrical propulsion would not only decrease emissions but also reduce to a minimum the needs for maintenance as all hydraulic systems would be eliminated , he adds .
The team has designed such systems with high fidelity models and optimization tools .
Masson adds that the team is now looking for an industrial partner to build a prototype of the superconducting " turbofan " .
" The technology is there , " he says , " it is a matter of finding a source of funding . "

THE owner of Napoleon ’s penis died last Thursday in Englewood , N.J. John K. Lattimer , who ’d been a Columbia University professor and a collector of military ( and some macabre ) relics , also possessed Lincoln ’s blood - stained collar and Hermann Göring ’s cyanide ampoule .
But the penis , which supposedly had been severed by a priest who administered last rites to Napoleon and overstepped clerical boundaries , stood out ( sorry ) from the professor ’s collection of medieval armor , Civil War rifles and Hitler drawings .
The chances that Napoleon ’s penis would be excised so that it could become a souvenir were improved by his having lived and died at a moment when the physical remains of celebrities held a strong attraction .
Shakespeare did n’t become Shakespeare until the dawn of the romantic period , when his biography was written , his plays annotated and his belongings sought out and preserved .
Trees that stood outside the bard ’s former homes were felled to provide Shakespearean lumber for tea chests and tobacco stoppers .
After Napoleon ’s defeat at Waterloo , his possessions toured England .
His carriage , filled with enticing contents like a gold tongue scraper , a flesh brush , “ Cashimeer small - clothes ” and a chocolate pot , drew crowds and inspired the poet Byron to covet a replica .
When Napoleon died , the trees that lined his grave site at St. Helena were slivered into souvenirs .
The belief that objects are imbued with a lasting essence of their owners , taken to its logical extreme , led to the mind - set that caused Mary Shelley to keep her husband ’s heart , dried to a powder , in her desk drawer .
Of course , relic collecting long predates the romantic period ; medieval pilgrims sought out fragments of the True Cross .
In the aftermath of the Reformation , religious relics that had been ejected from monasteries joined secular collections that freely intermingled belemnites with saints ’ finger bones .
When Keats died , his hair took on the numinous appeal of a religious artifact .
The Design and Implementation of a Dataflow Language for Scriptable Debugging , Guillaume Marceau , Gregory H. Cooper , Jonathan P. Spiro , Shriram Krishnamurthi , and Steven P. Reiss .
Debugging is a laborious , manual activity that often involves the repetition of common operations .
Ideally , users should be able to describe these repetitious operations as little programs .
Debuggers should therefore be programmable , or scriptable .
The operating environment of these scripts , however , imposes interesting design challenges on the programming language in which these scripts are written .
This paper presents our design of a language for scripting debuggers .
The language offers powerful primitives that can precisely and concisely capture many important debugging and comprehension metaphors .
The paper also describes a pair of debuggers , one for Java and the other for Scheme , built in accordance with these principles .
The paper includes concrete examples of applying this debugger to programs .

I expected that for the first couple of days I would feel the muscle - twitching anxiety that came when I missed a dose , but it was not so bad , and I had hopes that I might taper off quickly .
On the third day , however , I began to find it difficult to focus and was unable to sit at my desk for more than a half - hour at a time .
I was agitated , restless and hyperaware of sounds .
When I read , sentences seemed to run into one another on the page , and I realized that this was not just because of difficulty focusing my mind but also my eyes .
By early evening on that day , I felt so jittery and anxious that I decided I needed more medication .
Somewhere , I recalled , a couple of years earlier I stashed a blister pack of 37.5 - milligram capsules , a sample my doctor had passed on to me .
But where ?
Although I could have split open a 75 - milligram capsule , in my anxious state I became bent on finding those 37.5 ’s .
An hour or more later , after manically scavenging through everything in the apartment , I found them — six remaining in the blister pack .
I took one and felt as if I could now go on .
I felt relieved to have them .
I would stay with my reduced dosage as long as I could , but they would be my backup if I found that I absolutely needed them .
Over the next several days they came in handy , especially at night , when I would wake up feeling dizzy , almost seasick , disoriented and in a heavy sweat , the pillow soaked .
One night , awake and not eager to go back to lying restlessly in bed , I went online , typed in “ Effexor withdrawal ” and found bulletin boards full of pained , plaintive and sometimes angry posters who had quit taking their medication and were suffering a broad but surprisingly consistent range of symptoms : dry mouth , muscle twitching , sleeplessness , fatigue , dizziness , stomach cramps , nightmares , blurred vision , tinnitus , anxiety and , weirdest of all , what were referred to as “ brain zaps ” or “ brain shivers . ”
While there were those who went off with few or no symptoms at all , others reported taking months to feel physically readjusted .
In the face of those symptoms , many despaired , gave up and returned to the drugs .
By the end of the second week , I felt confident that I could continue on 75 milligrams a day .
But then my symptoms became more physical : the chills at night and the cold sweats continued .
I felt tingling in my shoulders and hands , spasms in my legs .
These came and went , seemingly with no reason .
And then one night as I lay back to go to sleep , I felt a quick spasm in my head as if an electrical current had suddenly been sent through a circuit somewhere inside my brain .
Two more followed in quick succession .
With each came a wave of nausea .
I sat up .
They seemed to disappear .
They returned .
I realized these were the brain zaps , and over the next few weeks they would come , with no distinguishable pattern , several times a day .

Coping with the ever - changing and seemingly capricious symptoms was beginning to exhaust me .
I could n’t stick to any sleep schedule .
I could n’t think clearly .
I was becoming unfocused , agitated and unable to sit long enough to read or work .
The stress of anxiety and sleeplessness that I ’d almost forgotten seemed to be returning .
And that scared me .
Was my depression returning , or could getting off this drug actually cause so many and various symptoms ?
I spoke with neuroscientists , research psychiatrists and practicing therapists .
All of them knew of the difficulties some people had in getting off not only Effexor but other antidepressants as well .
They also all agreed that most of these symptoms were caused by a deficiency of serotonin .
What was happening was this :
When I started taking Effexor , the drug began inhibiting my brain cells ’ process of reabsorbing “ excess ” serotonin — that is , the serotonin that had gone unused in sending signals across the synapses from one neuron to another .
This was the purpose of taking the drug — to increase the amount of serotonin my cells had to work with and therefore , in theory , enable me to cope with my stress and depression .
I say “ in theory ” because even 20 years since the introduction of drugs like these , every researcher with whom I spoke was cautious about presuming a direct relationship between increased serotonin levels in neural synapses and a decrease in depression .
First , no one has ever measured the amount of serotonin in the synapses between anyone ’s brain cells .
No one knows what constitutes a low , high or even standard level .
Second , for reasons unknown , only a little better than half the people treated with antidepressants respond to them .
Third , studies have shown that placebos have only a slightly lesser rate of effectiveness than the drugs .
Fourth , serotonin levels are affected by many things — exercise , light , sleep , diet and even time of day .
And finally , serotonin has so much influence on chemistry and functions in so many places in the body and brain relating to mood , sleep , sexual desire , appetite and body temperature that to say that it acts in any one particular way is impossible .
Divorce and separation can be very tough on children .
The ultimate goal of co-parenting is to strive to enforce similar rules and cooperate regarding the children .
The key is to separate your marital past from your parental present and do everything you can to make the co-parenting relationship work .

Karen ’s son lied about his homework , so she grounded him from weekend activities .
Her son was scheduled to be with his dad that weekend so she called her ex to ask him to honor the grounding .
He refused , saying that was his only time with his son and he was n’t obligated to fulfill her decisions .
Karen was furious .
Was Karen right to ask her ex to do this ?
Was her ex wrong not to honor her wishes ?
“ The ultimate goal is to have Karen and Ted strive to enforce similar rules and cooperate regarding the children , ” said Ron Deal , author of The Smart Stepfamily .
“ If you can achieve this level of cooperation , terrific , but the reality is , in many instances , they are n’t there .
So , what we work toward is each household being autonomous , but sharing the responsibility for the children .
Co-parenting does not mean sharing all decisions about the children or that either home is accountable to the other for their choices , rules or standards . ”
Probably the most important question one could ask in this situation is , “ What do the children need from their parents ? ”
“ I think it is important for the parenting team to understand that following a divorce , children live in two countries , ” said Mr. Deal .
“ They hold citizenship in each country and are , therefore , invested in the quality of life found in both .
The parenting team should do everything they can to help children thrive and enjoy each of their two homes .
An old African proverb says , when two elephants fight , it is the grass that suffers .
Biological parents who fight and refuse to cooperate are trampling on their most prized possession - their children .
Elephants at war are totally unaware of what is happening to the grass , for they are far too consumed with the battle at hand .
Little do they know how much damage is being done . ”
According to Mr. Deal , there are some guidelines parents can follow to help their children move back and forth between their two homes as smoothly as possible .
Work hard to respect the other parent and his or her household .
Make space for
different parenting styles and rules as there are many healthy ways to raise a child .
different parenting styles and rules as there are many healthy ways to raise a child .
Schedule a monthly “ business ” meeting to discuss co-parenting matters .
Never ask your children to be spies or tattle - tails on the other home .
Children should have everything they need in each home .
Do not disappoint your children with broken promises or by being unreliable .
Do what you say , keep your visitation schedule as agreed , and stay active in their lives .
Make your custody structure work for your children even if you do n’t like the details of the arrangement .
“ I encourage ex-spouses to ask themselves this question , ‘ Can you let your desire to provide the best situation for your child take precedence over your personal issues with each other ? ’ ” said Mr. Deal .
“ Give your ex-spouse the opportunity to be wonderful with the kids , even it he / she was n’t wonderful with you .
The key is to separate your marital past from your parental present and do everything you can to make the co-parenting relationship work .
While parents may not be willing to share the discipline strategies of the other home , you should try to agree on how to approach developmental tasks of childhood such as potty training , taking responsibility for feeding a pet or getting their backpack to school with all the necessary materials for that day .
If both households can support the training of the child then the child wins . ”

Combined with a vast amount of sandblasted glass , the giant AquaDom gives a transparent - like feeling to the lobby .
Guests and visitors are able to travel through the aquarium in a glass - enclosed elevator to reach a sightseeing point and restaurant under the glass roof .
Two full - time divers are responsible for the care and feeding of the fish and maintenance of the aquarium .
Some of the interior rooms and suites look out over the atrium , offering " ocean views " of the AquaDom .
Construction
The AquaDom was opened in December 2003 .
It cost about 12.8 million euros .
The acrylic glass cylinder was constructed by the U.S. company Reynolds Polymer Technology .
The outside cylinder was manufactured on - site from four pieces ; the inside cylinder for the elevator was delivered in one piece .
The Aquadom is the largest acrylic glass cylinder in the world , with a diameter of over 11 meters , built on a 9 meters tall concrete foundation .
Placed at the lobby of the Radisson SAS Hotel in Berlin , the 25 meters high AquaDom is the largest cylindrical aquarium ever built .
Filled with about 900,000 liters of seawater , it contains some 2600 fish of 56 species .

Jets of material have been seen blasting out of quasars , young stars , black holes and other massive objects .
But now astronomers have discovered that even a lowly brown dwarf can have jets of outflowing material .
The discovery was made using the European Southern Observatory ’s Very Large Telescope , which observed the brown dwarf 2MASS1207 - 3932 .
It was already a very interesting object because it has a 5 Jupiter mass planetary companion , and it ’s surrounded by a planetary disc , like a young star .
And like many young stars , it ’s spewing jets of material from its poles .
The brown dwarf only has about 24 times the mass of Jupiter , so it ’s not large enough to ignite solar fusion .
But even so , it has these twin jets of outflow , stretching out a billion kilometres into space .
With an object this small having jets , astronomers think that young giant planets could also have outflows .

WASHINGTON , June 29 — After a string of Republican defections this week — on Iraq , immigration and domestic eavesdropping — President Bush enters the final 18 months of his presidency in danger of losing control over a party that once marched in lockstep with him .
First , two prominent Republican senators broke with the president on Iraq .
Then , Mr. Bush ’s party abandoned him in droves on the immigration bill , sending the measure to its death in the Senate , despite the president ’s fervent lobbying for it .
And when Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to issue subpoenas to the White House for documents related to its domestic eavesdropping program , three Republicans , including a longtime loyalist , Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah , joined them , and another three did not take a position .
For a president who once boasted that he had political capital and intended to use it , the back - to - back desertions demonstrated starkly just how little of that capital is left .
With the nation turning its attention to who will succeed Mr. Bush — and Republican presidential candidates increasingly distancing themselves from him — even allies say it could become increasingly difficult for the president to assert himself over his party , much less force the Democratic majority in Congress to bend to his will .
Today the IPCC released its 4th installment of its report on global warming .
It has found that only .12 percent of world GDP would be needed to stave off the harmful effects of climate change .
Echoing the Stern Report it shows that the only thing we should be afraid of is doing nothing .
The report focused on economic changes that need to be made , pointing out that emissions must start declining by the year 2015 to prevent the world ’s temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrialized temperatures .
( a scenario that would be catastrophic )

While some governments try to delay action , the switch to a cleaner and more efficient energy system is already underway , according to a new report from WWF .
A new briefing from the global conservation organization , Stop Climate Change :
It Is Possible highlights 15 ways in which people , business and governments work with WWF to reduce CO2 emissions and help slow global warming .
The report highlights initiatives from around the world , ranging from India to Brazil , that save energy and reduce carbon pollution .
In Thailand , a new law encourages the clean production of energy from biofuel plants that will feed into the electricity grid .
Elsewhere , major businesses have signed up for WWF ’s Climate Savers programme and are actively reducing their carbon emissions .
And in the UK a new campaign shows that people can simply unplug their phone chargers to cut standby power consumption .
“ Taking action brings real savings and other benefits to consumers and businesses while preventing dangerous climate change , ” says Hans Verolme , Director of WWF ’s Global Climate Change Programme .
“ The planet is running a fever and people are working with WWF to cool it – global warming is costing us dearly already but by acting now we can avoid future calamities . ”
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ’s ( IPCC ’s ) third working group , meeting in Bangkok today , showed that the cost of doing nothing about global warming is far higher than the cost of cleaning up our economies .
The WWF has said that to stay below a dangerous rise in temperature of 2Â°C the world needs to reduce global CO2 emissions by over 50 per cent by the middle of this century .
Independent economic assessments have confirmed that this pays off .
A claim backed up in todays report .
“ We have all the technological and economic tools available today – governments now need to implement clean energy solutions and remove the obstacles that still prevent their break - through , ” says Dr Stephan Singer , Head of WWF ’s European Climate Change Program and expert reviewer of the report by IPCC Working Group III .
“ The facts are clear – preventing climate change is the best deal for the global economy , so why are we still waiting ? ”
Insurgents have shifted tactics to focus on helicopters , and on Wednesday one group forced down an American Black Hawk helicopter , the eight such incident since Jan. 20 .
Roadside bombs have been adapted to become deadlier , punching through heavily armored Humvees .
Attacks on American soldiers also now include coordinated assaults from multiple locations , with a mix of weapons and in at least one case , counterfeit American uniforms and vehicles .
“ The enemy is adaptive , ” Colonel Garver said .
“ The enemy wants to win . ”
The Black Hawk attacked on Wednesday was forced into a “ hard landing ” after taking fire from heavy machine guns and rocket - propelled grenades in Diyala Province , north of Baghdad , the United States military said .
There were no injuries .
A Sunni insurgent group , the Mujahedeen Army , claimed credit for the attack in an Internet posting , according to the SITE Institute , which tracks postings by insurgent groups .
The bombing involving chlorine gas on Wednesday followed an explosion on Tuesday north of Baghdad of a tanker filled with chlorine that had been rigged to explode , killing nine people and wounding 148 , including 42 women and 52 children .
At least one other attack with chlorine also took place on Jan. 28 , according to the American military ’s statements .
Sixteen people were killed in that attack , in the Sunni - dominated Anbar Province , when a dump truck with explosives and a chlorine tank blew up in Ramadi .
The attacks seem to have been poorly executed , burning the chemical agent rather than dispersing it , but more sophisticated weapons involving chlorine could injure hundreds and cause mass panic .
Though it is widely used in water purification and sewage treatment , chlorine is dangerous because it reacts with water in moist tissue , such as eyes and the respiratory tract , to create acid , which essentially burns tissue .
A few breaths of air containing chlorine at a thousand parts per million can be lethal .
The CIA allegedly flew secret detainees in unmarked jets
The Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) report also details torture allegations made by a terror suspect who was held in secret custody for more than two years .
The group has asked US President George W Bush to reveal the location of these detainees and close all US black sites .
Last year Mr Bush said the prisons had all closed and had not used torture .
' Missing ' prisoners
In a televised address in September , Mr Bush admitted that 14 detainees had been held at secret CIA prisons that used interrogation methods that were " tough " but " lawful and necessary " .
" The United States does not torture , " Mr Bush said at the time .
" It 's against our laws , and it 's against our values .
I have not authorised it - and I will not authorise it . "
He said the prisoners had since been transferred to the US military camp at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , and the CIA was not holding any more terror suspects .
But in a report published on Tuesday , HRW has named another 38 people who were believed to have been held in secret CIA prisons , who are now missing .
Quoting US intelligence officials , The Washington Post says more than 60 people have been held in the prisons since 2001 .
' Beaten and burned '
The group has called on the US to reveal the location of all detainees held by the CIA since 2001 and end its " illegal " secret detention and interrogation programmes .
Palestinian Islamic extremist Marwan al - Jabour told HRW he saw or spoke to a number of those named in the report while he was held by the CIA between 2004 and 2006 .
John B Bellinger III has attacked EU probes into secret CIA flights
Mr Jabour , who was arrested in Lahore , Pakistan in May 2004 , also detailed torture tactics he says were used against him while he was in US custody .
He says at various periods during his 28 - month detention Pakistani authorities kept him naked and chained to a ceiling .
He says he was beaten , burned and handcuffed in stress positions .
During this time he was also reportedly interrogated by US agents for hours on end , but Mr Jabour says he was only tortured when the Americans were not around .
Mr Jabour admits that in 1998 he trained in Afghanistan in the hope of fighting in Chechnya .
He also says he helped Arab militants who had fled Afghanistan for Pakistan in 2003 , but he denies any links to al - Qaeda or terror activities .
EU threat
Meanwhile , the US has warned the European Union that ongoing inquiries into secret CIA flights within Europe linked to the black sites are threatening intelligence ties between Europe and the US .
The investigations " have not been helpful with respect to necessary co-operation between the United States and Europe , " John Bellinger , legal adviser to US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , said .
Mr Bellinger also labelled a European Parliament report into the flights , released earlier this month , as " unbalanced , inaccurate and unfair " .
It has been more than 80 years since religion was ripped out of the heart of the new Turkish state , which was assembled from the remains of the Ottoman Empire , the political and economic center of the Muslim world for centuries .
But the portion of Turks who identify themselves by their religion has increased to 46 percent this year , from 36 percent seven years ago , according to a survey of 1,500 people in 23 cities conducted by the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation , an independent research organization based in Istanbul .
That is a trend that has emerged in countries throughout the Muslim world since Sept. 11 , 2001 .
“ I ’m here as a Muslim , ” said Fatma Eksioglu , who was sitting on the grass next to her sister in downtown Istanbul on Sunday at a demonstration of about 20,000 people opposing the pope ’s visit .
She did not belong to the Islamic party that organized the gathering , she said , adding , “ When it comes to Islam , we are one . ”
But in a paradox that goes to the heart of modern Turkey , a stronger Muslim identity does not mean that , as in Iraq , fundamentalism is on the rise , or even that more Turks want more religion in their government .
Indeed , the number of Turks in favor of imposing Shariah law declined to 9 percent from 21 percent , according to the survey , which was released last week .
Perhaps the most powerful factor pushing Turks toward the east has been a series of bitter setbacks in talks on admission to the European Union .
To try to win membership , the Turkish government enacted a series of rigorous reforms to bring the country in line with European standards , including some unprecedented in the Muslim world , like a law against marital rape .
But the admission talks have stalled .
And while the official reason involves the longstanding Greek - Turkish dispute over Cyprus , most Turks say they believe the real reason is a deep suspicion of their country ’s religion .
Indeed , in 2002 , Valéry Giscard d’Estaing , the former French president , said Turkey ’s admission to the union would mean “ the end of Europe . ”
Nicolas Sarkozy , the French presidential hopeful , has made his opposition to Turkish membership a campaign issue .
Even the pope , when he was still a cardinal in Germany , said publicly that he did not think Turkey fit into Europe because it was Muslim .
That talk has begun to grate on Turks .

“ It hurts me that the E.U. expects Turkey to be something it ’s not , ” said Nilgun Yun , a stylish 26 - year - old eating a chocolate muffin in a downtown Istanbul cafe on Sunday .

The color red can affect how people function : Red means danger and commands us to stop in traffic .
Researchers at the University of Rochester have now found that red also can keep us from performing our best on tests .
If test takers are aware of even a hint of red , performance on a test will be affected to a significant degree , say researchers at Rochester and the University of Munich .
The researchers ' article in the February issue of the Journal of Experimental Psychology : General on the effect of red on intellectual performance reveals that color associations are so strong and embedded so deeply that people are predisposed to certain reactions when they see red .
Andrew J. Elliot , lead author and professor of psychology at the University of Rochester , and his co-authors found that when people see even a flash of red before being tested , they associate the color with mistakes and failures .
In turn , they do poorly on the test .
Red , of course , is traditionally associated with marking errors on school papers .
" Color clearly has aesthetic value , but it can also carry specific meaning and convey specific information , " says Elliot .
" Our study of avoidance motivation is part and parcel of that . "
Four experiments demonstrated that the brief perception of red prior to an important test -- such as an IQ test or a major exam -- actually impaired performance .
Two further experiments also established the link between red and avoidance motivation when task choice and psychophysiological measures were applied .
The findings show that " care must be taken in how red is used in achievement contexts , " the researchers reported , " and illustrate how color can act as a subtle environmental cue that has important influences on behavior . "
Elliot and his colleagues did n't use just any color of red .
He assessed the colors using guidelines for hue , saturation , and brightness , and purchased a high - quality printer and a spectrophotometer for the research .
He was stunned to learn that results from earlier work on color psychology by others did n't control for saturation and brightness .
The article 's hypothesis is based on the idea that color can evoke motivation and have an effect without the subject being aware of it .
" It leads people to do worse without their knowledge , " says Elliot , when it comes to academic achievement .
In one of the six tests given , for example , people were allowed a choice of questions to answer .
Most of them chose to answer the easiest question , a classic example of how to avoid failure .
The researchers believe that " color carries different meanings in different contexts . "
If the context changes , the implications do , too .
Elliot 's next study will focus on physical attractiveness .
Co-authors of the article in the Journal of Experimental Psychology : General , a publication of the American Psychological Association , are Arlen C. Moller and Ron Friedman , graduate students in the Department of Clinical and Social Sciences in Psychology at the University of Rochester , and Markus A. Maier and Jörg
Meinhardt at the University of Munich .
The work was funded by a grant from the William T. Grant Foundation , and a Friedrich Wilhelm Bassel Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation to Andrew Elliot .

We cant guarantee we 'll post yours , but we 'll post some .
So let ’s get back to the status of the world of oil .
And while , as one of the recent conferees noted , the public thinks that , since prices having dropped back “ we survived the energy crisis , ” sadly the world picture is really getting worse .
Sometimes , when I have looked at what we have projected , I have consoled myself with the thought to myself along the lines of “ well these are the lower estimates , it really is n’t going to be that bad . ”
Unfortunately the numbers that are now starting to pop up hold no such comfort , and are beginning to confirm what our contributors have been predicting for a while .
Hmm !
Maybe the next book review I ’ll do will be “ The Boy ’s King Arthur . ”
Well actually , given the controversy about him ( he was a Celt and they ultimately lost – after he died - so he has been relegated to mythical status .
The winners write the history books ) , perhaps that might not be such a good idea .
I recently looked at an NRC survey showing the classes of disciplines at a University and while history had more than 8 subdivisions as I remember , there was no mention of energy per se , or most of the energy production disciplines – so just imagine the columns of controversy I might generate .
But it also speaks , by itself , to how important certain issues are ranked in the corridors of the mighty .
As Prof G posted the other day , Matt Simmons thinks that we will peak this year , because the spare capacity to replace the collapsing fields of Mexico and the North Sea is just not there .
Both Khebab and Euan have explained the issues with Mexico , and the Financial Times story in Drumbeat gives the UK situation .
Much hangs on whether Saudi Arabia is going to be able to help match the declines that are now becoming apparent .
Unfortunately there are a couple of possible flies in this particular ointment .
The first of these is that while Paul Roberts mentioned last week that the spare production available between current demand and actual supply is around 2 million barrels , a nasty suspicion still sits in my mind thinking that Saudi Arabia is counting the Manifa field as part of that capacity .
After all the KSA stated goal for their capacity for production increase matches that 2 mbd number .
However , once discovered production from the field was suspended because , as numerous posts have noted , the chemistry of that oil will require a special refinery , and after trying to sell the crude on the world market , Aramco have given in , and are now building their own refineries to deal with it .
As a result the oil from the field , projected at around 900,000 bd , will not come on line until 2011 , which is going to be a tad late .
Concurrently the volume of that flow is just about at the level at which , in the past , Aramco officials have said that the KSA fields are declining in production each year , so that when it arrives it may do no more than hold the levels of the then current production , rather than increment it .
Along which line , Leanan had a story the other day relating to the new water pumping station that has just been brought on line .
What is worthy of note is where all the water is going .
( See I did warn you ) .
And for those who have not followed this for very long , let me very quickly explain something again .
The oil field that we talk about as Ghawar , the world ’s largest , in often considered , not as a single field , but rather as different parts .
Some of the most productive regions have been the Ain Dar / Shedgum portions , which are to the north end of the main field .
These are the regions that have been producing at around 30 % water cut , and are some of the oldest of the producing regions of the Kingdom , with a current water injection rate of 2 mbd
It is thus interesting to see look at the new water pumping stations that are being installed .
The new construction for the Qurayyah Seawater Treatment Plant to be used to supply seawater for the Khurais expansion that has been put in and will provide the fields with 4.5 million barrels of water , to help in pressure maintenance and production .
The overall water capacity of the plant has , however , grown to 14 mbd .
Of this flow some 2.5 million will now go to the Ain Dar / Shedgum fields .
Wonder what that will do to the water cut ?
Which is , if I remember , how Paul Roberts started The End of Oil .
That title seems a bit closer these days .
This is a story about how I learned to cut an onion .
After college , when I finally starting cooking for myself , I decided to add more to my food than just crushed red pepper .
So I bought some onions and other stuff and started cutting them up and putting them in my food .
About six months later , I went to my parents ’ house one weekend , where I was helping my mom cook .
When she saw me cutting the onions , she laughed out loud and said , “ What are you doing ? ”
Indian parents do n’t care about being non-judgmental .
Anyway , she was right to ask .
She took the knife and showed me the proper way to cut an onion , and I realized I ’d been doing it all wrong .
The new way was easier and faster .
I also realized that –had I not been mocked by my own mom on that fateful Saturday – I probably would be cutting onions the wrong way for the rest of my life .
This happens a lot .
I ’ve heard middle managers being given a tip by their younger employees–really good advice that would save them a lot of time–but the manager snarled back , “ Do you know how long I ’ve been doing this ? ”
If I hear another person saying “ I ’ve been doing this for 15 years ” in a condescending tone , I am going to calmly duct - tape my eyes open and then invade a vulture ’s nest , sitting patiently until she begins her pecking attack to take me out of my misery .
Please !!!
Doing something for a long time does n’t automatically mean you ’re good at it .
Now , there is a lot to say about having deep expertise in a certain area :
Your intuition is better , you know shortcuts , and you ’ve seen many situations before .
But if you never learned the right way , there ’s a huge opportunity to become better at what you do .
Doing it alone = dumb
Doing it on your own can be expensive and disastrous .
Check out what Philip Greenspun had to say :
I once encountered a group of 6 people who called themselves “ engineers . ”
To solve what they thought was a new problem , they were going to build their own little database management system with their own query language that was SQL - like without being SQL .
I pointed them to some published research by a gang of PhD computer scientists from IBM Almaden , the same lab that developed the RDBMS and SQL to begin with in the 1970s .
The research had been done over a five - year period and yet they had n’t become aware of it during several months of planning .
I pointed them to the SQL - 99 standard wherein this IBM research approach of augmenting a standard RDBMS to solve the problem they were attacking was becoming an ISO standard .
They ignored it and spent another few months trying to build their enormously complex architecture .
Exasperated , I got a kid fresh out of school to code up some Java stored procedures to run inside Oracle .
After a week he had his system working and ready for open - source release , something that the team of 6 “ engineers ” had n’t been able to accomplish in 6 months of full - time work .
Yet they never accepted that they were going about things in the wrong way though eventually they did give up on the project .
As I was thinking about this , I kept coming back to an early small company I co-founded , an online education company called FuzzyOwl ( we liked the cute words ) .
The model was basically Google Answers for education :
If you were an ambitious high - school student choosing between Harvard and Stanford , we ’d connect you to students at all the top colleges .
You could price your own question and we , the company , would take a cut .
Well , one of the problems ( among many others ) was this : People rarely ask questions .
We rarely ask others for help–sometimes because we do n’t know there ’s a better way ( how would I have known I was cutting the onion wrongly ? ) –and sometimes for other reasons like preserving our ego .
I ’m not the only one to point this out : A survey asked corporate employees what the # 1 networking mistake was .
Guess what it was ?
Not asking for help .
People rarely ask for help .
For example , in my hometown , my group of friends got a lot of scholarships and college admissions , and it ’s a pretty small community .
But we can count on one hand the number of times other students have asked us for advice on how to do it themselves–advice we would be happy to give .
People who seek out advice are a good bet .
After sitting in on about a billion meetings with real - smart people and fake - smart people , I ’ve decided on a pretty good litmus test to tell them apart :
If someone asks questions , he ’s probably smarter .
Why ?
Because he ’s not afraid to admit that he does n’t know it all , and comfortable enough to ask questions .
That alone makes him smarter , plus the actual answer he gets from asking a question .
In other words , if someone actively seeks out advice , I ’d be willing to bet that they succeed more often than someone who tries to go at it alone .
K noticed the same thing .
She writes :
Yesterday , I offered help in a field that I am an expert in .
The response ?
“ Why do you think I need help ?
I do n’t , thank you very much .
I ’m handling everything perfectly well on my own . ”
I felt like she had slapped me in my face .
And even though she was responding from emotion ,
I wo n’t offer my assistance again .
At one point in my life ,
I was the same way .
I could n’t accept the help I needed .
I tried to struggle through it on my own .
Ironically , the more successful I am ,
the more I ask and accept help ,
which in turn ,
allows me to become more successful .
It ’s a circular thing .
The trick is to start the circle
and the way to start it
is to ask for help .
Successful people do n’t need to act like they know it .
Ironically , the more successful you get , the more questions you have .
Anyway , back to FuzzyOwl .
As you can imagine , a company based on answering questions that people do n’t ask probably did n’t last for long .
We did n’t .
But the lesson stuck with me : People rarely ask questions .
So I have a simple proposal .
Ask questions , jackasses
Asking questions of the right people does so many things :
You do n’t have to reinvent the wheel , you get your problem solved , and you can potentially learn unexpected cool nuggets .
But sometimes it ’s not obvious what we should ask questions about .
Start with the obvious .
I ’m always confused when I meet someone who spends a lot of time doing something but is n’t very good at it .
For example , do you know people who never respond to their email ?
Email , the tool we spend over 6 hours a day on .
I want to take them in a room , shake them upside down , and run off with all the money that falls out of their pockets .
But really , whether it ’s email , driving , cooking , or whatever , these are things we spend a lot of time on .
Would n’t it make sense to ask someone for their tips on how to do it better ?
For many people , it never occurs to ask someone else for a few tips on improvement .
Easy for me to say , right ?
I did n’t actively ask my mom how to cut an onion .
But I should have .
Think about the curious friends you have .
They ’re the ones who are always asking questions : “ How did you get your computer to run so fast ?
How did you get the rain to fly off your windshield without wipers ?
How do you like your job ? ”
Some of these questions are more important than others .
But being genuinely interested in how others do something can pay off big .
As renowned author Jim Collins notes ,
One day early in my faculty teaching career — I think it was 1988 or 1989 — [ my mentor John ]
Gardner sat me down .
“ It occurs to me , Jim , that you spend too much time trying to be interesting , ” he said .
“ Why do n’t you invest more time being interested ? ”
If you want to have an interesting dinner conversation , be interested .
If you want to have interesting things to write , be interested .
If you want to meet interesting people , be interested in the people you meet — their lives , their history , their story .
Where are they from ?
How did they get here ?
What have they learned ?
By practicing the art of being interested , the majority of people can become fascinating teachers ; nearly everyone has an interesting story to tell .
So think about the things you do a lot .
Can they be improved ?
You wo n’t know until you ask someone who does it better than you .
Pick 5 people and ask them each a question .
Who knows what will happen ?
What now ?

Longest Prison Sentences in History
About the longest prison sentences in history including a sentence for over 7,000 years in jail .
NORRIS AND ROSS MCWHIRTER'S 10 BEST ODDITIES The Longest Prison Sentences .
" The longest recorded prison sentences were ones of 7,109 years , awarded to 2 confidence tricksters in Iran ( formerly Persia ) on June 15 , 1969 .
The duration of sentences are proportional to the amount of the defalcations involved .
A sentence of 384,912 years was demanded at the prosecution of Gabriel March Grandos , 22 , at Palma de Mallorca , Spain , on March 11 , 1972 , for failing to deliver 42 , 768 letters .
" Richard Honeck was sentenced to life imprisonment in the U.S. in 1899 , after having murdered his former schoolteacher .
It was reported in November , 1963 , that Honeck , then aged 84 , who was in Menard Penitentiary , Chester , III . , was due to be paroled after 64 years in prison , during which time he had received one letter ( a 4 - line note from his brother in 1904 ) and 2 visitors , a friend in 1904 and a newspaper reporter in 1963 .
He was released on December 20 , 1963 .
" Juan Corona , a Mexican - American , was sentenced to 25 consecutive life terms for murdering 25 migrant farm workers he had hired , killed , and buried in 1970 - 1971 near Feather River , Yuba City , Calif. , on February 5 , 1973 , at Fairfield , Calif . "
( From the European Tribune .
an earlier " live " discussion thread by kcurie can be found here )
Somewhat predictably , the EC dutifully , and valiantly , focused on climate change as the main priority , and that garnered most of the coverage from the superficial media ( TV , press agency releases ) which have understood that climate change " sells . "
However , the real action ( identified , possibly , by the fact that the core documents are only available in English ) focuses on energy markets " reform " and in particular the need for unbundling and other trustbusting measures to ensure competition .
The more serious papers focus only on that aspect , ignoring the boring and expected climate change stuff - just like the stock market does not focus on the news of the day , but on how they were different from expectations .
And the business world could not care less about climate change ( except if it imposes financial costs on them ) but does care about the juicy opportunities to be provided by unbundling , corporate resturcturing and the like .
Now that the dust has settled and that the topic is already out of the news ( displaced by Iraq , Beckham going to LA or the fact that oil prices are at record lows ) , it 's time to revisit the EU energy proposals , by taking a look first at the original material ( their press release and their attempt at responding to expected questions or objections on their sector enquiry and on climate change goals ) and then at press commentary ( Google selection , summary articles from Le Monde and the Financial Times , other coverage collected by Fran in the Salon thread ) .
[ editor 's note , by Chris Vernon ]
We have two articles today on the EU energy plan .
Luís 's take on it can be found here : A New Energy Policy for Europe
Jerome also asks that folks please also read his most recent post on the topic :
The Economist on European energy : wishful thinking and outright lies
The press release :
Commission proposes an integrated energy and climate change package to cut emissions for the 21st Century The European Commission today proposes a comprehensive package of measures to establish a new Energy Policy for Europe to combat climate change and boost the EU 's energy security and competitiveness .
Climate change is mentioned explicitly in the title , and agian first in the measures .
Security and competitiveness seem like reasonable goals for an energy policy within the climate change combat .
So far , so good .
The package of proposals set a series of ambitious targets on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy and aim to create a true internal market for energy and strengthen effective regulation .
This is where the trouble begins : there are targets for climate change and renewable energy , but the action will be on the internal market , which shows up quite early on , unfortunately .
The real priorites show up a bit further down , with the list of the " 3 pillars " of policy .
The first one ( and , in practice , the only one ) is again the ( capitalised ) Internal Energy Market .
The package proposed by the Commission today seeks to provide solutions to these challenges based on three central pillars : 1 . A true Internal Energy Market
2. Accelerating the shift to low carbon energy
3. Energy efficiency
And that 's what the papers of record focus on :
FT : EU readies for energy battle
Brussels to crack down on national power groups
Kroes may resort to antitrust legislation Germany and France geared up for a battle to save their powerful integrated energy companies from being broken up after Brussels published plans on Wednesday to tackle “ serious competition problems ” in the sector .
The crackdown on the power giants is part of an energy policy aimed at boosting competition , fighting global warming and cutting Europe ’s “ addiction ” to oil and gas imports from countries such as Russia .
The European Commission wants to break the market grip of national energy incumbents , which it believes are stifling competition and deterring new market entrants , including suppliers of renewable energy .
Just a mention of climate change en passant : the focus is on the break up of the evil French and German utilities .
Same perspective in Le Monde , with a French angle :
Bruxelles veut obliger les géants de l'énergie à plus de concurrenceLa Commission européenne a jeté un pavé dans la mare , mercredi 10 janvier , afin de relancer le marché intérieur de l'énergie .
Pour lever les blocages qui entravent la diversification de l'offre et la production d'énergies nouvelles , le collège recommande aux Etats membres de dissocier les activités de production et de distribution de gaz et d'électricité détenues par les principaux groupes européens , comme EDF , GDF , en France , E.ON et RWE , en Allemagne .
Après de longues tractations , c'est l'option la plus radicale qui a été retenue en dépit des avertissements répétés de Paris et de Berlin .
Brussels wants to force more competition on the energy giants .
The European Commission threaw down the gauntlet , this Wednesday , in order to relaunch the internal energy market .
To eliminate the obstacles that prevent diversification of supply and investment in new supplies , the Commission recommends to government to unbundle production and distribution of gas and electricity and split the large European energy groups , lie EDF , GDF in France , or RWE and E.
On in Germany , accordingly .
After tense negotiations , it 's the most radical option that was chosen , despite repeated warnings against it from Paris and Berlin .
The whole article does not say a single time ' global warming ' or ' climate change ' , if you can believe it .
But , whereas the FT largely embraces the point of view of the Commission , Le Monde , of course , gives ( slightly ) more room to the French and German positions - not so much to support them , but at least to provide more context and more analysis of the conflict .
Neither newspaper , nor any other as far as I can ascertain , points out the contradictions in the stated goals of the EU , despite these being flagged by the EU itself !
Indeed , as I noted in the thread yesterday , the European Commission at least asks some of the right questions :
How is competition compatible with environmental goals ?
How is competition compatible with security of supply goals ?
I 'll get to their answers right below , but they at least point towards the direction of the serious debate that would be needed .
But nobody followed up - not that I could see anyway ( I 'll be happy to be contradicted by readers of other sources ) .
But let 's go back to our two questions , because they are at the heart of all the things we discuss here on ET :
How is competition compatible with environmental goals ?
Competitive energy markets will play a major role in developing and deploying new environmentally friendly technologies .
Strong competition in the electricity market has a positive effect on the efficiency of power generation , because market players want to minimise costs and invest in efficient technologies .
Renewable technologies would be better served by an increase in transparency , and by open , competitive markets .
The larger the internal market , the more economies of scale can be realised .
As I wrote yesterday , all the above is just incantations , and does not constitute an argument .
Two things are not addressed :
Renewable energy would not be served by " open , competitive markets " , it would be served by regulation that forces other forms of production to internalize externalities or , failing that , by support mechanisms .
These can be done within market mechanisms or outside them , but the pre-requisite is the internalisation / support , not the markets .
More fundamentally , as I 've said many times , the issue of the cost of financing is totally ignored .
Technologies that require lower initial investments but have higher running ( fuel ) costs will have lower needs for financing .
Conversely , those with high upfront investments will see the cost of their electricity be influenced most of all by the cost of financing .
Pushing for market solutions here structurally favors the first kind of technology , as private sector funding costs are higher than those of public sector , or at least public - supported financing .
And the first kind of technology includes gas - fired plants and coal - fired plants , whereas nuclear and most renewables are of the second kind .
Thus the market can be expected to build gas - fired power plants , or coal - fired ones .
and that 's exactly what it does .
The internal energy market does nothing to internalize externalities , in particular those associated with global warming , and it actually favors the wrong kind of technologies ( high carbon ) for structural financing - related reasons .
Thee points are addressed nowhere .
How is competition compatible with security of supply goals ?
Europe needs stable relationships with the main producers outside the EU .
But this does not and must not prevent us from ensuring an integrated competitive market inside the EU .
An open and competitive , liquid and interconnected , single EU market will guarantee a secure provision of energy in the future , as it will make the European market attractive for external suppliers .
Such a market will also be open to new energy mixes .
Again , incantations without arguments .
Two points again :
No commentary on the fact that open markets encourage ( as shown above ) the construction of gas - fired plants , thus naturally increasing the demand for gas , and the need to import gas , and the reliance on Russia .
The focus is absolutely on supply , and makes no mention of demand .
As always , demand is taken as given , driven by economic activity and growth ( and the perspective of lower energy prices which is dangled in front of us as the main justification for the Internal Energy Market ) , and not to be acted upon .
Despite energy efficiency being one of the 3 main goals ( with a target of 20 % lower primary energy use ) , the link is not made here , where it would matter .
Thus one is left with the impression that the goals are just for the show , while the only thing that matters in practice is to break up companies like EDF - despite the fact that France has by far the lowest wholesale electricity prices , according to the EU 's own statistics ...
The response of the French minister for industry , quoted in the FT , is nicely succinct : " our system works " .
And as Le Monde noted ( and as does the FT in one of its blogs ) the hostility of the two main countries of the EU ensures that these proposals are dead on arrival , and that this whole thing is just for show .
So we are left with grand announcements and somewhat ambitious targets that go in the right direction , but an absolute impasse on the implementation , with the business world and the European Commission stuck on their mantra of " improving the Internal Energy Market " and " competition " despite the fact that these will - and already - achieve the exact opposite of what 's targetted .
Nothing will happen with this Commission .
We 'll go on hearing the same arguments , I 'll spend more time deconstructing the same stupid articles , we 'll have more confrontations with Russia , with EDF or similar beasts that lead to nothing useful ( but do cause a slow erosion of what made the French model work ) , and we 'll keep on moving towards the abyss .
Sigh .
CBS : US troops rescue abused Iraqi orphans ; Iraqi minister calls story a lie David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday June 21 , 2007 Print This Email
This CBS
News reported this week on the rescue by US troops and local Iraqi leaders of two dozen naked , emaciated , and feces - covered mentally disabled children that they found tied to their cribs in a Baghdad orphanage .
The orphanage kitchen was packed with food and the shelves were filled with new clothing , which the soldiers believe was being sold at local markets instead of being used for the orphans .
The caretaker and two workers have since disappeared , while two security guards are under arrest .
The children are being well cared for in a a different orphanage , but that facility can not hold them permanently and their long - term situation is unresolved .
The Iraqi Ministries of Health and Labor initially promised to investigate the situation , which has caused shock in Iraq and throughout the world .
However , CBS reports in an update that instead of taking responsibility , the Labor and Social Affairs Minister has now lashed out at the US , calling it Iraq 's enemy and claiming the boys were perfectly healthy and the CBS story was a lie .
The following video is from CBS 's Evening News , broadcast on June 18 , 19 , and 20 .
A transcript of the first segment is available at CBS News .

WASHINGTON  As Attorney General Alberto Gonzales prepares to face Congress this month , his role in the dismissals of eight U.S. attorneys is n't the only issue under scrutiny .
There is also loyalty as defined by the Bush administration .
Democrats including Sen . Herb Kohl of Wisconsin have taken note of Justice Department e-mails referring to the U.S. attorneys who were retained as " loyal Bushies " and wondered whether that quality trumps fidelity to the law .
Loyalty with roots stretching back to Texas helps explain why Bush is standing behind Gonzales , analysts say .
It is also one reason Bush is willing to risk a constitutional confrontation over congressional efforts to compel testimony from two other top associates , also from Texas : Karl Rove , a deputy chief of staff and Bush 's top political adviser , and Harriet Miers , who was his chief counsel until January .
Some Republicans , including former Justice Department spokesman Mark Corallo , say Lone Star loyalty " is the only reason Gonzales is still around . "
He says Gonzales should step down over mismanagement of the U.S. attorneys flap .
" Alberto Gonzales ' loyalty to George Bush has got to trump George Bush 's loyalty to Alberto Gonzales , " Corallo says .
Bush said this week he regrets how the episode has played out , especially its effect on the reputations of dismissed U.S. attorneys .
He said there has been " no credible evidence of any wrongdoing . "
Asked how critical loyalty should be in selecting U.S. attorneys , Bush said the most important criterion is " somebody who is qualified , somebody who can get a job done . "
It 's no surprise that the latest battle between the White House and the Democratic Congress involves three prominent Texans .
Bruce Buchanan , a presidential specialist at the University of Texas in Austin , says , " These are the people he trusts the most , and he has put them in key positions . "
He says , " There is an excessive emphasis in this administration , perhaps , on loyalty , " and Bush is " reluctant to cashier people . "
Loyalty is one of the reasons Bush has been able to build a strong team over the years , says former White House spokesman Scott McClellan , also a Texan .
He calls it a " two - way street . "
" People are loyal to him and tend to stick with him , " McClellan says .
" He 's also very loyal to them , especially the Texas crowd . "
Democratic strategist Paul Begala , a Texan who is one of Bush 's most vociferous critics , says the president 's support for his aides is one of the things he admires about him , but " he seems to be loyal to a fault a lot lately . "
Bush has said Gonzales needs to explain the Justice Department 's actions to Congress .
Gonzales is scheduled to testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 17 .
Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vt. , also wants to hear from Rove and Miers about their roles in what he called efforts to politicize U.S. attorneys ' positions .
Leahy 's committee and its House counterpart have authorized subpoenas for the Bush advisers , but no one has been subpoenaed .
Bush has said he understands the congressional interest but has a duty to protect a president 's ability to receive candid advice from aides without fear that they would be " hauled before various committees to discuss internal deliberations . "
Through White House counsel Fred Fielding , Bush offered private interviews of Rove and Miers , but with no oaths taken and no transcripts kept .
Leahy and fellow Democrats rejected that offer , saying the public deserves to know the White House roles in this affair .
Leahy says , " U.S. attorneys serve at the pleasure of the president , but justice does not serve at the pleasure of this or any White House . "

When we discussed Spider - Man in the last post , many readers talked about their issues with the movie series .
I 'm a fan myself , but then again I try not to nitpick the differences in story when a character jumps between different forms of media .
Are we really that bothered by organic web - slingers ?
The answer is apparently yes .
The thing is , the filmmakers apparently did toy with the idea of giving Peter Parker a mechanical web - slinger .
At the 2001 E3 , Activision displayed the webslingers at their booth .
I 'm not sure what I think about them , but seeing the web - slingers as real objects and imagining them on my wrists is actually kind of cool .
I 'm not bothered by the organic web - slingers , however , these would have been just as good in the movie .
What do we think , guys ?
Hansel , who liked the taste of the roof , tore down a great piece of it , and Gretel pushed out the whole of one round window - pane , sat down , and enjoyed herself with it .
Suddenly the door opened , and a woman as old as the hills , who supported herself on crutches , came creeping out .
Hansel and Gretel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands .
The old woman , however , nodded her head , and said , " Oh , you dear children , who has brought you here .
Do come in , and stay with me .
No harm shall happen to you . "
She took them both by the hand , and led them into her little house .
Then good food was set before them , milk and pancakes , with sugar , apples , and nuts .
Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen , and Hansel and Gretel lay down in them , and thought they were in heaven .
The old woman had only pretended to be so kind .
She was in reality a wicked witch , who lay in wait for children , and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there .
When a child fell into her power , she killed it , cooked and ate it , and that was a feast day with her .
I know I promised I 'd blog once a week , but they killed Simone and now I 'm just incredibly distraught .
How could they ?
So I guess I 'll recycle some stuff from my internal Google blog , from my first few weeks there , about 20 months ago .
Blatant self - plagiarism .
What 's the blogosphere coming to ?
I figured I 'd publish it so you know what it was like for me as a newcomer at Google .
In case you were planning on sending me a resume .
You know .
Just in case .
If you want some real content , check out this funny rant about programming language names .
It 's a good read .
Free karma to the first taker !
Anyway , here are my first few entries in my Google internal blog .
Ah , to be a Noogler again ...( like , duh ) - I do n't speak for Google .
These opinions are my own .
Remember , this was written for a Google audience , so I left a bunch of obvious stuff out .
You 'll just have to come see for yourself , I guess .
Hope you like it .
Hiya .
This is my second day as a Noogler .
I figured I 'd keep a diary of the experience , so we can all look back and laugh .
Not at me , of course .
Towards me .
The first morning we got badged , and through a minor communications mishap , I wound up with an expression that looks exactly as if they 'd said : " one ... two ... ack , there 's a tarantula on your crotch !
* click * " HR has assured me that I can go get another picture taken if I want .
Unfortunately , today I am , for lack of a better word , fat .
As in , obese from eating waaaaaay too much on my first day .
Bloated .
Stuffed .
I almost yakked yesterday , actually .
They did n't prepare me adequately for the experience of being surrounded by yummy free food .
I had approximately the same reaction as the kids when they first got to Willy Wonka's .
" Everything 's edible , even the staircase ! " is I think what Willy said .
Roughly .
And that 's how it feels here at Google HQ .
I 'm sitting in a temp office with a temp office mate .
Both of us are heading up to Kirkland next week , aka the Land Where Everyone Appears to be from Microsoft .
My office has a big window , and outside the window there 's a printer with a red bull on it that says " Bull " .
It 's a popular printer , and people come by all the time and peer at us while they rifle through their print jobs .
We 're a regular Noogler Zoo , me and my officemate .
We have another officemate , a ghost , who evidently never arrived .
His big yellow welcome balloons are mostly deflated , their smiles wrinkled into expressions of concern or balloony dismay .
We hope he 's OK , wherever he is .
So far things have gone pretty well .
The only mishaps have been fairly minor .
One is that my officemate and I , who appear in most respects to be identical new hires , got slightly different equipment .
His desk had his name , some happy balloons , two 24 - inch flatscreen monitors , a fully - configured linux box , a set of office supplies , and misc equipment .
My desk had my name , some happy balloons , and a box of kleenex .
Fortunately , Tech Stops are almost as easy to find as the bathrooms ( meaning about 1/10th as easy to find as food and drink ) , and they were able to hook me up with a laptop that 's worked quite well so far .
It was supposed to be a Powerbook , according to my recruiter , and it 's actually an IBM stinkpad , but I guess I can wrap it in tinfoil and pretend it 's the x86 version .
At least I got a nice bag with it .
One large enough to hold the roughly 150 feet of cables and adapters that came with it , allowing the laptop to be powered by every conceivable power source , including hooking it up to your cat or dog , if I 'm interpreting this one strangely - shaped adapter correctly .
( Editor 's Note : I now have a spiffy 15 - inch Powerbook .
It rocks . ) I did do better than my officemate ( the real one , not the ghost ) in one respect : I got put up in the " Joie de Vivre " Hotel Avante , which is air conditioned and filled with toys and serves free beer and wine every day from 6 pm - 7:30 pm .
He evidently got placed in a 2 - bedroom apartment , one without air conditioning .
Someone generously saw fit to equip it with a roommate , though , and did n't tell either of them they'd be sharing .
So my officemate says he walked in to an apartment that was 20 degrees hotter than it was outside , to find his new roommate standing in the kitchen in his underwear , cooking dinner .
Imagine their surprise .
Anyway , that 's about it for days 1 and 2 of my Noogler experience .
I hope to be able to take advantage of some of the perks before I head to Kirkland next week , including jumping in the large vat of brightly - colored plastic balls and hoping nobody 's asleep under them .
If anything else interesting happens , I 'll be sure to post it .
The end of my second day as a Noogler ended in a mini-tragedy , as I floundered around in a big vat of plastic balls like a deranged baby elephant seal .
See , my Google mentor was nice enough to give me a tour of the facility , and he made it a point to show me the big pool of colored plastic balls in the corner of the 2nd floor in bldg 42 .
He said you could just jump in there any time , although you never knew if someone was actually down there .
You know , resting or something .
After the imagery of someone taking a nap down there as I did a cannonball , I decided I 'd hold off for a bit .
But oddly enough , just last week ( the week before I started ) , I 'd mentioned to a friend that I had never been in one of those big containers of plastic balls , the ones you find at fancy kids playgrounds , you know , like at McDonalds or something .
I guess I never ran into one until I was over the height limit .
I think they said height , although it sounded suspiciously like " weight " to my juvenile ears -- the cotton candy muffled what they were saying a bit .
So I 'd never gone in one .
And here was this big , pretty , free one sitting right on my floor .
Calling me , sort of .
I just * had * to give it a try .
So towards the end of the day , after most ( but by no means all ) folks had cleared out , I decided to give it a go .
I walked over trying to act casual , and just jumped in .
Whee !
It was every bit as gratifying as I 'd imagined .
You know how you always wonder whether you 'll be buoyant without water , or whether it 's easy to walk around , things like that ?
All my lifelong kiddie questions about vats of plastic balls were answered .
It turns out it 's really easy to sink like a stone , and kind of hard to get out .
And you look like a total dork in the process .
Kiddie quicksand .
After about 2 minutes , I 'd had my fill for a lifetime , and had finally made it back to the edge .
I think I only fatally crushed one ball ( um , from the vat ) during the excursion .
However , not all of me actually left the vat .
No , probably not what you 're thinking .
I was n't in there that long .
But I did discover I was short exactly one badge .
You know , my Google badge .
D'oh .
I did n't realize this until I was back in my office .
That 's when the nightmarish elements of this real - life story began .
I walked back , trying to look nonchalant , and saw there were about eight guys playing pool at the large pool table that 's located approximately 2 feet from the ball vat .
Ahem .
So , trying to stay casual , I walked around them and carefully got back into the vat .
They all stopped playing and just stared at me , as if I 'd decided to crawl in the refrigerator .
I waved .
They did n't wave back .
They were n't antagonistic or anything ; they were just sort of dumbfounded , and were all staring at me , this fully grown ( overly grown , actually ) adult standing up to his waist in a tub of plastic balls they 'd probably never seen anyone in before .
I squatted down and started thrashing around , and it dawned on one of the sharper ones that I was looking for something .
" Vat are you looking fer ? "
He had a nice accent , maybe Austrian or German .
Now everyone was really curious .
The pool game was pretty much dead .
I wished fervently that I was somewhere far away , maybe Austria or Germany .
" I 'll give you two guesses , " I said , pretending like I was some sort of career ball - vat guy .
No guesses emerged from the crowd .
" OK .
I 'm looking for my badge , which fell in here .
Happy ? "
They nodded , and half of them shook their heads sadly in the internationally recognized head gesture for " you poor dumb noogler " .
They went back to playing pool , a game which , if you 'll recall , only requires one person to be paying attention at a time .
The rest stood around just staring at me , wondering if I 'd find it .
" It should be near the bottom by now , do n't you think ? " said another smart - looking one .
" Gasp urf unk " said I , thrashing around with my hands and feet .
It turns out you can only brush the bottom of the vat ( which is only about 3 feet deep ) if you get yourself almost completely submerged .
Otherwise the balls are too heavy to move very far , and all you can do is poke a fingertip - sized area .
And the dude was right ; the badge was probably near the bottom .
Probably near an edge ( the math just kinda works out that way ) , and the balls are much harder to move around near the edges .
I spent a * long * time in there , maybe 15 minutes , during which time I became more tired of plastic balls than I 'd ever have thought possible .
I eventually emerged , miserable and defeated .
I 'd recovered 2 unopened packs of gum , several coins , some rubber bands and some binder clips , but no badge .
I was starting to think I 'd find Jimmy Hoffa 's badge before I ever found mine .
I *really * did n't want to be stared at anymore , although on the plus side , they all knew my face well enough by then to spot my badge from 100 paces .
So I went home , and got a new badge in the morning , and even a new badge picture .
The old one is deactivated , and will rest in peace , more secure than the Heart of the Ocean , lying at the bottom of that big plastic tub of balls .
You 're welcome to try to get it .
In fact , I dare you .
I 'll even come and stare .
Today I went to a tech talk .
It looked like it was going to be exciting , but evidently signing up to give a tech talk does not , as one might conjecture , automatically make one a good tech - talker .
The problem was that most of us were Nooglers , and the presenters did n't give us much context .
They jumped immediately down to the lowest implementation details of their project , and we did n't know what the hell it was for , let alone the other projects they constantly cited .
It was rough going .
After about 15 minutes , several people in the audience were visibly asleep .
Since nobody had started to snore audibly yet ( which would have livened things up ) , I " snuck " out .
I do have to quote " snuck " , though , because the act involved tripping over at least two people in the 3rd row back , so my exit could n't really have gone unnoticed to the presenters .
I tried the clever gimmick of glancing at my watch , as if I just happened to need to be somewhere else at exactly 12:47 pm .
Unfortunately I was n't wearing a watch , so it did n't go over exactly as planned .
Oh well .
I walked outside , and into a different world .
There was live music playing , with Googlers everywhere on the lawn , and it was a beautiful , sunny , breezy day .
There was a huge barbeque going , with juicy bratwursts and other delicious - smelling food .
The band appeared to be playing on some sort of period - instruments , and the music was great .
Well , I 'm a sucker for that kind of music .
It sure was nice to be outside , away from the slides and snores .
I ran into a guy I knew a little .
I 'd interviewed him a few months ago , for my old company , and he 'd turned us down to go to Google .
We were bummed , since he'd seemed to be the brightest person in his graduating class .
I remembered he 'd passed my interview in about 12 minutes , so I 'd spent the rest of the time chatting with him about how college hires are making their decisions these days .
His insights were really the beginning of the mini-investigation I did that wound up with me applying to Google .
That " investigation " started by chatting with college hires about why they were turning us down .
Then I looked a little further , and a little further , and discovered that Google has a sort of event horizon , beyond which you 're inevitably sucked in .
Anyone at another company who looks hard enough into why people choose Google will ultimately apply to Google , if they have the courage .
And it 's a scary thing , too -- Google 's recruiting - marketing has reached the point where a lot of smart , experienced people wonder whether they'd be able to get an offer .
Anyway , I said ' hi ' to the guy , who remembered me , and we laughed a little about the whole situation .
Then I headed back to my office .
Unfortunately , I have a remarkable propensity for getting lost on the campus , or at least disoriented .
I realized I 'd gone in the wrong direction ( towards the food , as if that outcome were anything but preordained ) , and to get to my office , I 'd have to walk back past the tech talk that I 'd " snuck " out of .
Oops .
So with as little chalance as I could muster , I walked quickly by the room .
As I went by , I glanced in , and as far as I could tell , they were on the same slide as when I left .
I bolted .
Right now I 'm sitting in a massage chair , looking out over what seems to be a big park or golf course .
Sun 's shining .
Campus is beautiful .
I 'm sad to be leaving .
Why ca n't Mountain View be in Seattle ?
Tune in next time for my exploration of the wonderful world of the Kirkland Design Center , which you should check out on Google Earth !
( The office looks taller in real life . )
Incidentally , a bit of good news : someone found my badge , the one I thought was lost forever in the tub of plastic balls in Building 42 .
I happened to be walking by the pool table nearby when some guy pointed it out to me .
The badge was sitting on a little table between the ball vat and the pool table .
I 'm not terribly surprised , in retrospect , since I 've noticed people evidently spend a lot of time in that tub -- talking on cell phones , or solving complex mathematical problems in their heads , or rooting around like starving boars in a full dumpster looking for lost wallets and wedding rings and so on .
I guess it was only a matter of time .
Well , I 've spent a few food - filled weeks in the Land Where Everyone 's From Microsoft , so I figured it was time to blog again .
They really are , you know .
From Microsoft .
You can walk up to anyone in the Kirkland Office , even a potted plant , and say : " So !
I 'll bet you a million dollars you 're not from Microsoft . "
And 80 % of the time , they get all dejected and say : " Yeah , I was there . "
They 're not even happy they won the bet .
So then I say : " Wow . Microsoft .
That must have been cool . "
I get this evil gleam in my eye when I say it , but they do n't notice since they 're all dejected and looking at their shoes .
( They 're $ 1000 shoes , but they 're still dejected .
I guess if you 're dejected , looking at your $ 1000 shoes can cheer you up a little . )
And they say : " Well , it was cool !
Except we never launched our project .
And we hated all the other teams .
And they hated us .
And each other .
And our customers kind of hated our project too .
And we could n't make any forward progress , because we were crushed under the weight of blah blah blah ... "
They tell me their whole , sad , shaggy - dog story , and it 's always the same .
Project was cool , never launched it , everyone hates each other .
( Editor 's Note : actual percentages and experiences may vary .
Some shoe prices inflated for dramatic effect . )
It 's really cheery around here , I tell ya .
Actually it is really cheery , because everyone knows they 're not at their old company anymore .
If you ask anyone : " are you glad you came to Google ? "
They always brighten up instantly and say : " oh , hell yeah !
I 'm actually writing code !
" I 'm actually editing these conversations down a bit , because what they really sound like is this :
Me : " Armph omph mmfph * gulp * So ! * chomp * * chew * * chew * * mrmph *
You from Microsoft ?
" Them : " ... mmmm * chew * * chew * mmmm * chew * * chew * .... mmmm * chew * mmm...
" Me : " Caught you with your mouth full , eh? Sorry .
* CHOMP * * chew * * chew* * chew * ... " Them : " ... * gulp * yeah .
sucked there .
* CHWOMPH * omph mmfph * chew* * chew * ...
" And so on .
I assume Google 's master plan is pretty much the same as the witch 's from Hansel and Gretel : I mean , come on , it 's pretty obvious they 're going to eat us .
Geez , we 've all read fairy tales before .
Nobody just gives you a bunch of free food for as long as you want without killing you and eating you .
Like , duh .
But I can vouch for Kirkland : when the Feasting Day OKR comes around , we 'll be ready .
I myself would probably go well with cranberry sauce .
Anyway , until then , the main pastime , other than researching how the Romans managed to eat several meals at one sitting , is Foosball .
This is a game I 've been introduced to since I came to Kirkland .
I 've seen it before , and always thought it looked kind of lame , but that just shows you what I know .
Foosball is a way of life around here .
Which makes it ... not lame , see ?
I can't quite figure out whether it 's popular because it 's the only thing to do other than stuff your face ( except on Mondays when you can poll the massage calendar hoping someone will cancel ) or if it 's actually fun in its own right .
You could do a scientific experiment , and bring some other game in and put it near the foosball table .
But if we ever had the space and the budget for another game , we 'd get another foosball table .
( Editor 's Note , Feb 19 2007 - we now have two tornado tables , air hockey , a pool table , darts , and other stuff .
But foosball is still by far the most popular . ) I think Google would probably approve another table , even though various academic studies have shown that on the Grand Scale of Calorie - Burning Activities , playing foosball falls somewhere between " comatose " and " deceased " .
Most of the calories burned playing foosball are spent contracting your stomach muscles , which happens when you 're laughing really really hard , because I just scored on myself again .
Believe me , it 's not possible to be worse at foosball than I am .
I think I 'm the only person who 's necessitated consulting the rules to see whether it counts if you serve , then score on yourself without the ball touching the other player 's men .
Other than eating and foosball , punctuated by the occasional multi- hour bout of intense programming , the major fun activities in Kirkland include :* having construction workers watch you go to the bathroom .
They sometimes offer helpful advice .
( " You missed a spot . "
" Thanks . " )
They 're putting in showers , and the workers use the toilet stalls as storage lockers .* sitting in one of the $ 5000 massage chairs and punching buttons randomly , since the instructions are all in Japanese .* uh , and other stuff that 's way too fun to tell you about .
Oh , who am I kidding .
All we do for fun is play foosball .
I do n't think the showers are going to add too many new fun new activities -- at least I seriously hope they do n't -- so it looks like foosball is the pastime of choice for now .
In the meantime , I think I 'll go see what 's in the fridge .
MMMMmmmmm , looks like milk and pancakes , with sugar , apples , and nuts .
They 're so nice to us !
Never had I fathomed , not even in my remotest imagination , that a day will come when God 's houses will be attacked and destroyed .
The way they are today , in Iraq . . .
Never .
This Red Line is now crossed . . .
Crossed , transgressed , trespassed into blasphemy .
Layla Anwar " A Red Line " from An Arab Woman ’s Blues
According to a recent UN report , the Green Zone is now coming under heavy fire on a daily basis .
The report said that the so - called " International Zone " -- which houses the U.S. embassy and Iraqi government offices -- is being pelted regularly with a " barrage of mortar bombs and missiles . . .
The attacks have become more frequent and more accurate . " ( Reuters )
The news of the mortar and missile attacks has been largely concealed from the American people .
The public already believes the war was a " mistake " and the persistent bombing of America ’s " last sanctuary " in Baghdad just adds to the nation ’s sinking morale .
The US is progressively losing its grip in Iraq and the fighting is degenerating into a vicious free - for - all .
The " surge " has failed to achieve its political objectives , and this is forcing the occupation to rely more and more on aerial bombardment and counterinsurgency operations .
The war is in its fifth year , and , still , Bush has not produced anything even vaguely resembling a political solution .
He is utterly clueless .
The world ’s oldest civilization is being destroyed before our eyes -- its cities laid to waste , its people slaughtered by the tens of thousands .
Saddam never could have dreamed of devastation on this scale .
We ’ve ruined everything .
Truckloads of dead men are delivered to the Baghdad morgue every morning where they are processed and then dumped in mass graves in abandoned soccer fields or schoolyards .
Twenty percent of the population has either been internally displaced or forced to flee into Jordan and Syria .
In Falluja alone , 65 percent of the buildings have been destroyed and tens of thousands of its citizens are left living in tent cities scattered across the desert -- exposed to the elements , living on crusts of bread and foul water .
The number of refugees has risen rapidly : 2 million in Amman , Damascus and Cairo .
They go wherever they can to avoid the bombing and find safety or shelter .
I will write for the refugees . . .
( with ) no homeland except
the wind of illusion
and no shelter except
the humiliation of tents
" For Whom do I write " by Musa Shu`ayb The Iraqi people are now facing what Juan Cole calls an " everyday apocalypse " -- a complete security meltdown in which crime and terror flourish in the seedbed of foreign occupation .
Bush ’s war has created the greatest humanitarian catastrophe of our time -- 700,000 dead , millions more maimed or traumatized for life , and an entire country reduced to rubble .
The dustbins overflow
with corpses
and human decay .
Where to now my enemy ?
Where to now my oppressor ?
Layla Anwar " Poem about America " Among those who follow the daily accounts of the war , the mood has grown increasingly dark and pessimistic .
It ’s clear that the Democrats are now as committed to the goals of the war as Bush .
They are both equally guilty .
The Iraq war is no accident .
It is the logical consequence of a corrupted system where all the protections for human rights and civil liberties have been abandoned .
All that ’s left is the voracity and bloodlust of an unelected oligarchy who dispense death and destruction with complete indifference .
Democracy has been subverted in America -- every part of the body - politic is diseased .
The war is just a reflection of America ’s moral degeneracy .
Am I being too harsh ?
Consider this article which appeared on Uruknet .
info last week .
It provides photos of 24 " special needs " children who were found naked , starving and lying on concrete floors , in their own excrement , their bodies covered with sores .
All of them were chained to their cribs .
Some of them were near death .
This is the Nazi - like terror we have unleashed on Iraq under the rubric of " democracy . "
This is what " neoconservatism " looks like when it is stripped of its ideological pretense and we can see its true face -- pure , unalloyed evil .
It is no different than Hitler ’s fascism .
We are starving and brutalizing children while we extol the " America ’s fallen " as if one life is more valuable than another .
What sort of sick joke is this ?
This is nothing more than cultural narcissism served up by pseudo - patriots in the political establishment who are drunk on death and power .
They worship violence like a god and they are pushing us all towards Armageddon .
I will not pray to a god who
made the usurpers victorious . . .
My God has been lost
among the conquerors
I will not pray to a God
who is lost among the conquerors .
" The Missing God " by Musa Shu`ayb True --
God has been lost among the conquerors , the occupiers and the foreign armies .
Why do n’t we hear the voices of the war ’s victims ?
Why do we never hear the stories of the people who are forced to live beneath America ’s bombs ?
For five years , the Western media have covered the war from the perspective of the struggling American GI and the hardships he faces in a foreign land .
That may be true , but what about the Iraqis who must endure the " everyday apocalypse , " do n’t they count ?
The US invasion has turned Iraq into a testing - ground for new theories on counterinsurgency .
One by one the cities in the Sunni region have been surrounded with razor - wire ; vital supplies have been cut off , check - points set up , snipers placed on rooftops , and the siege begins .
Civilian neighborhoods are branded as " terrorist strongholds " and pounded with heavy artillery and aerial bombardment .
We have declared war on some of the poorest people on earth -- ghetto warfare with the most sophisticated high - tech weaponry ever invented .
Who will tell these peoples ’ story ?
The New York Times ?
FOX News ?
Here ’s something you wo n’t read in the mainstream news :
The real disposition of the war changed more than two years ago when it became apparent that the Iraqi resistance would not simply throw down their weapons and give up .
That ’s when the assassination of teachers and intellectuals went into high gear .
That ’s when archeological sites , museums , and anything else connected to Iraqi cultural and historical identity -- began to come under relentless and withering attack .
The attacks on holy sites and mosques have persisted to this day .
There is a conscious effort to destroy all the religious symbols and monuments which bind the people together in the shared experience of a common faith .
The same sinister forces that are inciting the sectarian violence are trying to remove all sense of kinship , brotherhood , nationalism and spirituality .
Their objective is to " wipe the slate clean " and rebuild the entire society according to their neoliberal model .
If that is not genocide ; then what is ?
Here is the story of one victim of the US occupation .
It is a story of great personal loss and suffering .
It ’s really the tale about all of Iraq , a nation that never threatened the United States , but which has been crushed by evil , ambitious men who care nothing about the death and suffering they have produced .
The story is called " My Shrine " and it is by poet and author Layla Anwar :
As I was staring out of the window , I noticed the full moon .
I remember when I was a child ; I associated the full moon with my love for my grandmother .
I used to tell her : " Bibi , every time I see the full moon , I see you .
You are my moon . "
I absolutely adored my grandmother .
She loved me kindly , warmly , with no strings attached . . .
As benevolently and as gently as the moonlight .
So naturally on a full moon , I remember her .
As a matter of fact , I remember all my departed ones , members of my family , my great grand parents , my ancestors . . .
Everyone I have ever heard of , even those remotely related to me .
Remembering them gives me a sense of continuity . . .
A sense of belonging .
And now that Iraq is in pieces , their remembrance is even more of a priority for me .
As a matter of fact , I dream of them often , or more like they visit me in my dreams . . . rather too often , these days .
And true to our traditions , every time they visit me in my dreams , I make it a point to offer food or alms to any worship place ( be it mosque or church ) in their souls name .
Another thing that reminds me a lot of my departed ones is Sheikh al Gaylani ( Gilani ) mosque and shrine in downtown Baghdad .
Sheikh AbdelKader Al Gilani was a Sufi and a good number of my family followed his teachings .
Some even say that we are related to him and can trace our roots right back to 13th century Baghdad through the Gaylani school .
So when I heard that Al Gaylani mosque and shrine was bombed , something in me snapped .
I felt it physically , something around my heart . . .
I have often visited this mosque , with members of my family , one of which was my grandmother .
We would sometimes go in the morning and sometimes in the early evenings .
In the mornings , women ( Sunnis and Shias -- we never thought of these terms before the occupation ) would congregate , pray and pay their tributes .
Some would distribute candies because a secret vow or wish had come true .
So whilst praying , sweets would fall around me and it was always a good omen .
In the evenings , you could hear after the muezzin's call to prayer , the chanting -- Dhikr -- of the sacred Divine names , repeated over and over until they mingled with the sunset and became One .
This shrine is more than just a place of worship for me .
Every time I walked in there , I would draw strength , feeling it infusing my roots with a new breath . . .
Everytime I sat there , I connected with all those who sat there before me , all the way back to the 13th century . . .
This place symbolized for me , my sense of belonging , my sense of being .
In my mind , this place was my point of reference , like some lieu that my inner compass recognized , gravitated towards , affiliated and identified with . . .
An attachment beyond time , space and geography .
An attachment like some invisible rope handed down through generations of worshippers and contemplators .
All the way back . . .
When it got bombed , I asked Aziz who knows this mosque better than anyone else , who was behind it .
He replied matter of factly as if he knew it all along : " Mahdi of Iran , Mossad and the Americans . " . . .
And I believe Aziz for he knows .
And instead of sweets falling as a good omen , falling debris buried the wounded . . .
And instead of sacred chants uniting with the sunset , the cries of mourning . . .
What have you done ?
Not only have you smashed my country into tiny pieces .
Not only have you slaughtered my people .
Not only have you snatched my loved ones , my family , my friends , away from me .
Not only have you destroyed our homes .
Not only have you exiled thousands of us .
But you have also managed to shatter my memories , pull them out from their roots , like some unwanted weed .
You have managed to reach the only sacred place I had left .
The only place I had jealously safeguarded , secretly held in silence , lest you should find out about it .
But you even managed to penetrate that too .
Leaving me with nothing . . .
Leaving me with absolutely nothing but this pen and paper and a full moon staring coldly back at me .
We have destroyed Iraq and left the people with nothing .
The American people need to know this .
Mike Whitney lives in Washington state .
He can be reached at [ email protected ] .
The always - provocative Jonathan Rauch has a slightly curious column in The Atlanic praising the new front - loaded primary schedule .
Yes , he acknowledges some flaws , but he thinks a longer general election campaign would be a pretty good thing .
Finally , he writes this :
For me , though , what tips the scales in favor of early primaries , with the resulting long general - election campaign , is that they give U.S. politics an opportunity to mimic one of the best features of British - style parliamentary politics : the shadow government .
American commentators often observe , with envy , that political campaigns in parliamentary systems are much shorter .
In Britain , the formal campaign and election span weeks , not months or years .
But such commentators tend to overlook the fact that by the time a British election rolls around , voters have had months or years to get to know the candidates , parties , agendas , and even cabinets .
The party and prime minister in office are known quantities .
Typically , opposition leaders are familiar too , because the parties choose their leaders well in advance of most elections .
And these leaders choose shadow cabinets , the men and women who would ascend to ministerial portfolios if the party won .
In other words , the voters decide not just between two candidates or even two parties but , in effect , between two governments .
For me , I 'm all for the shadow cabinet concept .
It 's also even arguably true that " Until the modern era of front - loaded primaries , any similar arrangement in the United States would have been all but impossible . "
Still , just because it's now possible does n't mean it 's actually going to happen .
Indeed , the odds of it happening strike me as overwhelmingly small .
The reason is that it serves candidates interests just fine to leave as large a pool as possible of semi-important people looking for jobs .
Absent a shadow cabinet , you 'll probably have Richard Holbrooke telling everyone who might possibly care what Richard Holbrooke thinks that whichever person happens to have won the Democratic nomination is a brilliant individual with sound instincts guided by the greatest team ever assembled .
But if you do have a shadow cabinet and it does n't include Holbrooke well , then , here come the off - the - record quotes about how so - and - so's a bit of a softie , not really up the job , a bit of a left - wing nut , etc. , etc. , etc .
And that 's not to cast any particular aspersions on Holbrooke , I just do n't know off the top of my head the names of any likely candidates to be a Democratic Secretary of the Treasury .
The point is that candidates try to avoid sending clear signals about this kind of thing for a reason .

Cheney impeachment bill gets another co-sponsor Nick Juliano
Published : Friday May 11 , 2007 Print This Email This Rep. Dennis Kucinich's ( D - OH ) uphill battle to evict the Vice President from the White House has attracted another sponsor in the House , bringing to four the number of Congressmembers who have signed on to a bill aimed at impeaching Dick Cheney .
Rep. Albert R. Wynn ( D - MD ) has signed on as the latest cosponsor to Kucinich 's impeachment letter .
A Kucininch aide confirmed Wynn 's addition as co-sponsor in an interview with RAW STORY Friday but said the congressman was not commenting on the impeachment bill at this time .
" Vice President Dick Cheney is the architect of the Administration 's deception about the war , " Wynn said in a statement to RAW STORY .
" Cheney persistently and deliberately deceived the Congress and the American people about the existence of Weapons of Mass Destruction and the alleged link between Saddam Hussein and the attack on September 11th . "
Wynn 's addition as cosponsor was first reported by Atlanta Progressive News .
The other cosponsors of the legislation are Reps. Janice Schakowsky , D - Il. , and William Lacy Clay , D - Mo. Kucinich , who is renewing his quixotic bid for the White House this year , introduced articles of impeachment against Cheney last month because , he said , the vice president was " a driving force for taking us into war against Iraq under false pretenses , " as RAW STORY reported .
" There should be a serious dialogue about the conduct of this Administration , " Wynn said .
" Cheney should be held accountable for purposely misleading the American people .
Despite the obvious lack of success on the ground , Vice President Cheney continued a barrage of propaganda claiming that we were winning the war and successfully rebuilding Iraq which is patently false . "
The move appears to be almost entirely symbolic , and there is little chance Congress will actually consider impeaching Cheney .
The bill falls under the purview of the House Judiciary Committee , which has not placed impeachment proceedings on its agenda .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had said before the 2006 elections that impeachment would be off the table in a Democratic Congress .
As the Bush administration struggles through its last two years in office , it appears that the agenda of neoconservative ideologues has finally lost its appeal among strategic parts of the U.S. foreign policy apparatus .
But as their influence has waned at the Pentagon and State Department , neoconservative hawks have taken charge on the battlefield of public diplomacy .
Intent on fixing what American Enterprise Institute ( AEI ) fellow Joshua Muravchik termed Bush ’s " public diplomacy mess , " right - wing hawks have gained control of the weapons in the " war of ideas "  U.S. government - funded and supported media outlets such as Voice of America ( VOA ) , al - Hurra , and Radio Farda , which broadcast to the Middle East and aim to offer an alternative view of the news .
The recent appointment of Jeffrey Gedmin , a veteran neoconservative polemicist , as the director of Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty ( RFE ) , and a smear campaign that led to the recent resignation of Larry Register , al - Hurra ’s former news director , appear to herald a turn towards more ideologically rigid programming .
As a result , viewers and listeners of U.S. - supported media in the Middle East are being exposed to a tougher ideological line that endorses the hallmarks of the neoconservative agenda  regime change and interventionist policies in the region .
" No group other than neocons is likely to figure out how to do that , " wrote Muravchik , in a December 2006 article in Foreign Policy magazine entitled " Operation Comeback , " a reference to the declining influence of neoconservatives in the Bush administration .
" We are , after all , a movement whose raison d’être was combating anti-Americanism in the United States .
Who better then to combat it abroad ? "
In a widely - circulated e-mail memo sent to White House advisor Karl Rove in July 2006 and obtained by IPS , former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich also criticized the State Department ’s inability to manage the information campaign advocating U.S. foreign policy interests in the region .
He called on Karen Hughes , undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs at the State Department , to " run the information operation aimed at delegitimizing Syria , Iran , and Hezbollah every day . "
Earlier this year , a report authored by Ladan Archin , head of the Pentagon ’s Iran directorate , who , in the run-up to the Iraq War , worked in the agency ’s controversial Office of Special Plans , charged that both VOA ’s Persian TV service and Radio Farda , a Persian - language radio station that broadcasts from Prague and Washington , were too soft in the their criticism of Iran ’s regime .
Archin ’s report , which was obtained by the McClatchy Newspapers Washington bureau , complained that , while VOA ’s Persian TV service " often invites guests who defend the Islamic Republic ’s version of issues , it consistently fails to maintain a balance by inviting informed guests who represent another perspective on the same issue . "
With the neoconservative drums beating inside the Washington Beltway , the reshuffling of key positions at RFE and al - Hurra came as no surprise .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced in February a major initiative to promote democracy in Iran , including $ 50 million to increase Persian - language television broadcasts .
Congress also appropriated $ 21.4 million to expand VOA ’s Persian television programming to 12 hours a day , and $ 14.7 million more for Radio Farda ( which means " Tomorrow " in Farsi ) .
In early 2007 , the Broadcasting Board of Governor ’s chairman , Kenneth Tomlinson , named Gedmin , a former AEI fellow and a founding member , along with Vice President Dick Cheney and former Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld , of the Project for a New American Century , as RFE ’s director .
Gedmin ’s new job gave him control over Radio Farda and Voice of America .
Some listeners have since noted changes in the tone and content of their programming .
A June 14 VOA broadcast in Persian , for example , featured an original interview with AEI fellow and leading neoconservative Richard Perle on the future of democracy in Iran , as well as a roundtable discussion with Shahryar Ahi , chief organizer of a conference of Iranian opposition groups in Paris .
Ahi , an informal liaison during the 1970s between the shah of Iran , Mohammed Reza Pahlavi , and the White House , currently works with the shah ’s 45 - year - old , Washington - based son , Reza Pahlavi .
Radio Farda has featured three exclusive and well - publicized interviews with Perle , Michael Rubin , yet another AEI fellow , and Pahlavi , according to Hossein Derkhshan , an Iranian blogger whose weblog , www.hoder.com, is widely read .
As the Bush administration ramps up its offensive against Iran ’s regime through VOA and Radio Farda , neoconservatives have also taken aim at al - Hurra , a U.S. - sponsored Arabic - language satellite television station that broadcasts to 22 countries across the Middle East on an annual budget of more than $ 70 million .
In early June , Register resigned from al - Hurra after less than six months on the job , in the wake of a series of public attacks against him and the station ’s allegedly anti-U.S. content by neoconservative columnist Joel Mowbray in the opinion pages of the Wall Street Journal .
Mowbray complained that Register was directly responsible for most al - Hurra broadcasts that , among other things , carried Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah ’s December 2006 speech in its entirety , reported uncritically on last year ’s Holocaust conference in Iran , and referred to the establishment of Israel in 1948 as " al - Naqba , " which means " the catastrophe " in Arabic .
" Our taxpayer - financed Arabic network was set up to counter al - Jazeera , not echo it , " he wrote .
Since its launch in 2004 , Al - Hurra had served as the centerpiece of Washington ’s " aggressive post - 9/11 courtship of the Arab world " and was " fulfilling its mission " until it hired Register , according to another Mowbray column .
Yet Register ’s predecessor , Moufac Harb , resigned a month after a scathing report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) found that al - Hurra lacked " a comprehensive , long - term strategic plan " and criticized its reported audience statistics .
Register , a veteran producer and vice president who worked at CNN for 20 years , was supposed to boost the profile of the station , win audience share , and generate political debate .
But his attempts to appeal to an Arab audience ostensibly went against the goals of the neoconservative establishment in Washington .
" The conservative crusade against Register demonstrates one of the great difficulties facing any official American broadcasting in the Middle East , " wrote Marc Lynch , a professor at George Washington University whose blog , www.abuaardvark.com, on Arab media and politics is widely read in Washington , in Britain ’s Guardian newspaper .
" To be a free and credible media outlet means allowing critics of American policy to speak and covering news that might make America look bad , " he noted .
Much is being said about the excellent capabilities of Erlang to write distributed fault - tolerant programs , but little has been said about how easy and fun it is to write servers ( those programs at the other end of the line ) with it .
And by easy I do n’t just mean that you can put up a web server in two lines of code and hope it ’ll work , I mean it ’ll be easy to built robust servers .
One example of this is ejabberd , a free Jabber server .
One of the Erlang features that let us write servers is its binary pattern matching .
But to understand binary pattern matching first you have to understand pattern matching .
Let ’s start with a classic of functional programming : factorial .
This is factorial in Erlang
fac( N ) -> if N == 0 -> 1 ; true -> N * fac( N - 1 ) end .
A bit of explanation : fac is the name of the function , N is its only parameter .
What follows after the first -> is the body of the function .
The if has two clauses ; in them you see the predicate before the -> and the consequence after it .
The last predicate , true , is like the else of other programming languages ( think about “ if true then N … ” as the last thing is going to be checked ) .
Do n’t let recursion scare you , it is not that hard and you ’ll see it in lots of places in functional programming .
Something called tail - call optimization let us make it very efficient , although for clarity I have n’t done it in this case .
Now fac using pattern matching :
fac(0 ) -> 1 ; fac( N ) -> N * fac( N - 1 ) .
Half the amount of lines , simpler , easier to read and beautiful as a mathematic demonstration .
You can read it as :
Define fac for zero as being 1 and fac for N as being N multiplied by fac of N minus 1 .
When you call fac , Erlang will try your parameter against all the patterns until it finds one that matches , and when it does , it ’ll evaluate the body of that clause .
Pattern matching not only tries to match , it also assigns identifiers , that ’s how N comes to contain the parameter passed to the function .
Let ’s see another case … one we all love , the raise salary example :
raise ( {Name , Salary} , N ) -> { Name , Salary * N} .
This function , raise , gets two parameters ( “ hey !
I see three ! ” , hold on , keep reading ) .
The first , { Name , Salary} , is a tuple ( an structure containing various values , in this case Name and Salary ) and the second is the parameter N representing how much we are going to raise the salary by .
The function returns a new tuple with the new raised salary .
We could have written it in another way , like this :
raise ( Person , N ) -> { Name , Salary} = Person , { Name , Salary * N} .
There you see the parameter Person more clearly defined , but below it , I am using the same pattern matching to take each member of the Person tuple and assign it to Name and Salary .
The previous definition requires one less line , one less identifier and it is more versatile .
Thankfully , our Erlang shop does n’t have only one employee , we are so successful that there are fifty employees and the last year gave us so much profit that we are going to raise the salary of all of them .
But calling raise 50 times is tiring .
Ca n’t we just call it once over a list ?
Yes , we can .
One way is to add more clauses to the first definition :
raise ( {Name , Salary} , N ) -> { Name , Salary * N} ; raise ( [ ] , N ) -> [ ] ; raise ( [ Person| Persons ] , N ) -> [ raise ( Person , N ) |raise ( Persons , N ) ] .
Now there are three clauses in the definition of the function raise .
You already know the first clause , the second reads :
The result of rising the salary of an empty list ( of persons ) by N is an empty list ( of persons ) .
It may be obvious to us , but the computer needs it .
Not very interesting , just note that square brackets are used to define lists : [ 1,2,3,4 ] .
The third clause is really cryptic , let ’s interpret it :
The result of rising the salary of a list of persons , letting the identifier Person be the first person and Persons be the rest , by N is … the result of rising the salary of Person , the first person , as the first item of a list and the raise of the salary of the rest of the persons , Persons , as the rest of the list .
Long sentence .
Feel free to read it again , slowly .
See the piece of code and try to identify the parts .
OK , it ’s really cryptic .
The first parameter is a pattern : [ Person|Persons ] .
It matches a list with at least one item and identifies it as Person .
The rest of the list is identified as Persons ( the rest in a list containing one item is an empty list , like in Lisp and Haskell ) .
Take a look at the whole definition :
The first clause matches the structure alone .
The second matches the empty list .
The third matches the list with at least one item in it .
On the third clause I build another list , here I use the pipe | again , but this is not a pattern matching .
The pipe is for building a list .
For example : [ 1,2,3 ] , the list containing 1 , 2 and 3 , is the same as [ 1 | [ 2 | [ 3 | [ ] ] ] ] ( read that as the list having 1 in the head of the list having 2 in the head of the list having 3 in the head of the empty list ) .
To make things crystal clear let ’s watch an interaction :
> raise ( [ {" Mickaël " , 3000} , { " Yariv " , 3000} , { " Joe " , 3000} ] , 2 ) .
raise ( [ {" Mickaël " , 3000} | [ {" Yariv " , 3000} | [ { " Joe " , 3000} | [ ] ] ] ] , 2 ) . [ raise ( {" Mickaël " , 3000} , 2 ) |raise ( [ { " Yariv " , 3000} | [ { " Joe " , 3000} | [ ] ] ] , 2 ) ] . [ { " Mickaël " , 6000 }|raise ( [ { " Yariv " , 3000} | [ { " Joe " , 3000} | [ ] ] ] , 2 ) ] . [ { " Mickaël " , 6000 }| [ raise ( {" Yariv " , 3000} , 2 ) |raise ( [ { " Joe " , 3000} | [ ] ] , 2 ) ] ] . [ { " Mickaël " , 6000} | [ {" Yariv " , 6000 }|raise ( [ { " Joe " , 3000} | [ ] ] , 2 ) ] ] . [ { " Mickaël " , 6000} | [ {" Yariv " , 6000 } | [ raise ( { " Joe " , 3000} , 2 ) |raise ( [ ] , 2 ) ] ] ] . [ { " Mickaël " , 6000} | [ {" Yariv " , 6000} | [ { " Joe " , 6000 }|raise ( [ ] , 2 ) ] ] ] . [ { " Mickaël " , 6000} | [ {" Yariv " , 6000} | [ { " Joe " , 6000} | [ ] ] ] ] .
[ { " Mickaël " , 6000} | [ {" Yariv " , 6000 } | [ { " Joe " , 6000} ] ] ] .
[ { " Mickaël " , 6000} | [ {" Yariv " , 6000} , {" Joe " , 6000} ] ] .
[ { " Mickaël " , 6000} , {" Yariv " , 6000} , {" Joe " , 6000} ] .
Step 1 is just the same raise call but the list is expressed in the other way , as lists are built , using the pipe |.
On the second step it matched the third clause , raise ( [ Person| Persons ] , N ) , which calls raise two times .
And we can see that we have two new calls to raise .
These two calls match two different clauses , the first one matches the first clause , raise ( {Name , Salary} , N ) , and the second call matches the third clause , raise ( [ Person| Persons ] , N ) .
In the third step , we have used the first clause to raise { “ Mickaël , 3000} to { “ Mickaël , 6000} .
Now we proceed with the rest of the list in the same way we started ( using raise ( [ Person| Persons ] , N ) ) .
On step 4 we separate the head of the list , { “ Yariv ” , 3000} , from the rest to eventually raise it to { “ Yariv ” , 6000} in the fifth step .
Everything continues the same up to the seventh step , where we match the yet - unused second clause , raise ( [ ] , N ) , by passing the empty list [ ] .
From step 8 to 11 the list gets built to the point where it is the familiar comma-separated expression .
Feel free to re-read all the steps and see which pattern matches and which part is assigned what .
It is a daunting task when we came to functional programming for the first time because outside functional programming , recursion is hardly used at all .
If we compile fac we are going to get a warning :
raise.erl : 4 : Warning : variable ' N ' is unused
Oh !
the identifier N of the second definition is never used , and Erlang is so kind to let us know .
I hate warnings , I ca n’t continue to code until I get rid of them .
So , what can I do ?
We can define it so there can be anything in the second parameter but we do n’t really care what it is :
raise ( {Name , Salary} , N ) -> { Name , Salary * N} ; raise ( [ ] , _) -> [ ] ; raise ( [ Person| Persons ] , N ) -> [ raise ( Person , N ) |raise ( Persons , N ) ] .
And here we see how functional programming helps us make sense : if we are going to raise the salary of an empty list of persons , it does n’t matter how much we are going to raise it by , it ’ll be always an empty list of persons .
Was n’t this about network programming ?
keep tuned for the next issue to learn how binary pattern matching will help us build networked applications .
It is extremely disturbing that Don Siegelman , the former governor of Alabama , was hauled off to jail this week .
There is reason to believe his prosecution may have been a political hit , intended to take out the state ’s most prominent Democrat , a serious charge that has not been adequately investigated .
The appeals court that hears his case should demand answers , as should Congress .
The United States attorneys scandal has made clear that partisan politics is a driving force in the Bush Justice Department .
Top prosecutors were fired for refusing to prosecute Democrats or for not bringing baseless vote - fraud cases to help Republicans .
Lawyers were improperly hired based on party affiliation .
If the Justice Department was looking to help Republicans in Alabama , putting away Mr. Siegelman would be a shrewd move .
In a state short on popular Democrats , he was elected governor in 1998 .
He was defeated for re-election in 2002 by just a few thousand votes , in an election marred by suspicious vote tabulations .
The charges Mr. Siegelman was convicted of suggest that he may have been a victim of selective prosecution .
He was found to have named a prominent Alabama businessman to a state board in exchange for a contribution to a campaign fund for a state lottery , something Mr. Siegelman supported to raise money for his state ’s woefully inadequate public schools .
He was not found to have taken any money for himself and many elected officials name people who have given directly to their own campaigns to important positions .
The jury dismissed 25 of the original 32 counts against Mr. Siegelman .
Report : Cheney aide clearing path to bomb Iran RAW STORY
Published : Thursday May 24 , 2007 Print This Email
This A report published today reveals a growing game of tug - of - war between President Bush and his No. 2 regarding the US approach towards Iran .
Vice President Dick Cheney believes the US should not be pursuing a diplomatic path with Iran , and a senior aide to the vice president has been meeting with national security think tanks and consultants in Washington to " help establish the policy and political pathway to bombing Iran , " Steve Clemons reported Thursday on his blog , The Washington Note .
Cheney is the person in the Bush administration who most desires a " hot conflict " with Iran and believes the administrations pursuit of diplomacy , led by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , is a mistake , Clemons reports .
The Cheney aide , who has met with policy hands of the American Enterprise Institute along with other groups , " has stated to several Washington insiders that Cheney is planning to deploy an ' end run strategy ' around the President if he and his team lose the policy argument , " according to Clemons .
Cheney 's team wants to work with Israel , nudging the country at some key moment to mount a small - scale attack on the suspected site of Iran 's nuclear infrastructure , which could lead to an Iranian counter attack on US forces stationed in the Persian Gulf , Clemons reports .
The vice president has in recent weeks been ramping up his rhetoric against Iran .
Earlier this month , he spoke aboard a US aircraft carrier just 150 miles of Iran 's coast to warn the country against continuing to pursue a nuclear weapons program .
EXCERPTS FROM THE WASHINGTON NOTE #
This strategy would sidestep controversies over bomber aircraft and overflight rights over other Middle East nations and could be expected to trigger a sufficient Iranian counter - strike against US forces in the Gulf -- which just became significantly larger -- as to compel Bush to forgo the diplomatic track that the administration realists are advocating and engage in another war .
There are many other components of the complex game plan that this Cheney official has been kicking around Washington .
The official has offered this commentary to senior staff at AEI and in lunch and dinner gatherings which were to be considered strictly off - the - record , but there can be little doubt that the official actually hopes that hawkish conservatives and neoconservatives share this information and then rally to this point of view .
This official is beating the brush and doing what Joshua Muravchik has previously suggested -- which is to help establish the policy and political pathway to bombing Iran .
The zinger of this information is the admission by this Cheney aide that Cheney himself is frustrated with President Bush and believes , much like Richard Perle , that Bush is making a disastrous mistake by aligning himself with the policy course that Condoleezza Rice , Bob Gates , Michael Hayden and McConnell have sculpted .
According to this official , Cheney believes that Bush can not be counted on to make the " right decision " when it comes to dealing with Iran and thus Cheney believes that he must tie the President 's hands .

Chapter 0 :
SOFTWARE TIME
It was winter 1975 .
I hunched over the teletype in the terminal room , a hulking console that shook each time its typewriter head whammed leftward to begin a new line .
I stared at smudgy lines of black code .
I ’d lost track of the time several hours before ; it had to be after midnight .
The janitors had switched off the hall lights .
I did n’t have anyone ’s permission to hang out there in the NYU physics building , using the computer account that the university was giving away , for free , to high school students .
But then nobody was saying no , either .
I was fifteen years old and in love with a game called Sumer , which put me in charge of an ancient city - state in the Fertile Crescent .
Today ’s computer gamers might snicker at its crudity :
Its progress consisted of all - capital type pecked out line by line on a paper scroll .
You ’d make decisions , allocating bushels of grain for feeding and planting , and then the program would tell you how your city was doing year by year .
“ Hamurabi , ” it would announce , like an obsequious prime minister who feared beheading , “ I beg to report . . . ”
Within a couple of days of play I ’d exhausted the game ’s possibilities .
But unlike most of the games that captivate teenagers today , Sumer invited tinkering .
Anyone could inspect its insides :
The game was a set of simple instructions to the computer , stored on a paper tape coded with little rows of eight holes .
( The confetti that accumulated in a plastic tray on the teletype ’s side provided nearly as much fun as the game . )
It had somehow landed among my group of friends like a kind of frivolous samizdat , and we shared it without a second thought .
Modifying it was almost as easy as playing it if you took the couple of hours required to learn simple Basic :
You just loaded the tape ’s instructions into the computer and started adding lines to the program .
Sumer was a blank canvas — history in the raw , ready to be molded by teenage imaginations .
My friends and I took its simple structure and began building additions .
Let ’s have players choose different religions !
What if we throw in an occasional bubonic plague ?
Barbarian invaders would be cool .
Hey , what about catapults ?
That night I was obsessed with rebellion .
Sumer had always had a rough provision for popular uprising ; if you botched your stewardship badly enough , the people would rise up and remove you from power .
( Sumer ’s original author was an optimist . )
I thought there needed to be more variety in the game ’s insurrections , so I started inventing additions — new subroutines that would plunge Sumer into civil war or introduce rival governments competing for legitimacy .
I did n’t care how late it was .
The F train ran all night to take me home to Queens .
The revolution had to be customized !
A quarter century later , in May 2000 , I sat in an office in San Francisco and stared at a modern computer screen ( high resolution , millions of colors ) .
Wan ranks of half - guzzled paper coffee cups flanked my keyboard .
It was 5:00 A.M .
I was forty years old , a founder and now managing editor of the online magazine Salon , and in charge of a software development project .
It had taken us months of meticulous planning .
It promised to revolutionize our Web site with dynamic features .
And it was disintegrating in front of me .
The lead programmer , after working around the clock for weeks and finally announcing that his work was done , had taken off for Hawaii on a long - planned family vacation .
That left his boss , Chad Dickerson , our company ’s technology VP , to figure out why the database that stored all our Web site ’s articles would not talk to the programs that were supposed to assemble that data into published pages .
Chad had been up for two nights straight trying to fix the problem .
Otherwise , our two million readers would find nothing but old news on our site come Monday morning .
Had n’t we built software before ?
( Yes . )
Did n’t we test everything ?
( Not well enough , apparently . )
How could we have screwed up so badly ?
( No good answer . )
I ate the last bag of pretzels from our vending machine , paced , and waited .
Nothing helped .
There was too much time .
Time to read the email from a hapless colleague who ’d planned a champagne - and - cake celebration in honor of the new project , and to respond : “ Maybe we should hold off . ”
Time to feel alienated and trapped and wonder whether it had been a smart idea to give our system ’s central server the name Kafka .
We finally published the first edition of our new , “ improved ” site at around 9:00 A.M.
As my coworkers showed up at their desks in their usual Monday morning routines , it took them a while to realize that a half dozen of us had never gone home the night before .
Within a few weeks the software calmed down as our developers fixed the most pressing problems .
But every time I hear about a company preparing to “ upgrade its platform ” by introducing a big new software scheme , I cringe .
The 1990s technology - industry boom introduced us to the concept of “ Internet time . ”
The phrase meant different things to different people , but mostly it meant fast .
Under the digital age ’s new temporal dispensation , everything would happen — technologies would emerge , companies would rise , fortunes would be made — at gasp - inducing speed .
That meant you could n’t afford the time to perfect anything — but no need to worry , because nobody else could , either .
Internet time proved fleeting and was quickly displaced by newer coinages untainted by association with a closed - out decade ’s investment fads .
But the buzzword - mongers were onto something .
Time really does seem to behave differently around the act of making software .
When things go well , you can lose track of passing hours in the state psychologists call “ flow . ”
When things go badly , you get stuck , frozen between dimensions , unable to move or see a way forward .
Either way , you ’ve left the clock far behind .
You ’re on software time .
A novice programmer ’s first assignment in a new language , typically , is to write a routine known as “ Hello World ” — a bit of code that successfully conjures the computer ’s voice and orders it to greet its master by typing those words .
In Basic , the simple language of my Sumer game , it looks like this :
10 PRINT " HELLO WORLD ! " 20 STOP
“ Hello World ” programs are useless but cheerful exercises in ventriloquism ; they encourage beginners and speak to the optimist in every programmer .
If I can get it to talk to me , I can get it to do anything !
The Association for Computing Machinery , which is the ABA or AMA of the computer profession , maintains a Web page that lists versions of “ Hello World ” in nearly two hundred different languages .
It ’s a Rosetta stone for program code .
“ Hello World ” looks more forbidding in Java , one of the workhorse programming languages in today ’s business world :
class HelloWorld { public static void main ( String args [ ] ) { System.out.println ( " Hello World ! " ) ; } }
Public static void : gazillions of chunks of program code written in Java include that cryptic sequence .
The words carry specific technical meaning .
But I ’ve always heard them as a bit of machine poetry , evoking the desolate limbo where software projects that begin with high spirits too often end up .
It ’s difficult not to have a love / hate relationship with computer programming if you have any relationship with it at all .
As a teenage gamer , I had tasted the consuming pleasure of coding .
As a journalist , I would witness my share of the software world ’s inexhaustible disaster stories — multinational corporations and government agencies and military - industrial behemoths , all foundering on the iceberg of code .
And as a manager , I got to ride my very own desktop Titanic .
This discouraging trajectory of twenty - five years of software history may not be a representative experience , but it was mine .
Things were supposed to be headed in the opposite direction , according to Silicon Valley ’s digital utopianism .
In the months following our train wreck of a site launch at Salon , that discrepancy began to eat at me .
Programming is no longer in its infancy .
We now depend on unfathomably complex software to run our world .
Why , after a half century of study and practice , is it still so difficult to produce computer software on time and under budget ?
To make it reliable and secure ?
To shape it so that people can learn it easily , and to render it flexible so people can bend it to their needs ?
Is it just a matter of time and experience ?
Could some radical breakthrough be right around the corner ?
Or is there something at the root of what software is , its abstractness and intricateness and malleability , that dooms its makers to a world of intractable delays and ineradicable bugs — some instability or fickleness that will always let us down ?
“ Software is hard , ” wrote Donald Knuth , author of the programming field ’s most respected textbooks .
But why ?
Maybe you noticed that I ’ve called this Chapter 0 .
I did not mean to make an eccentric joke but , rather , to tip my hat to one small difference between computer programmers and the rest of us : Programmers count from zero , not from one .
The full explanation for this habit lies in the esoteric realm of the design of the registers inside a computer ’s central processing unit and the structure of data arrays .
But the most forthright explanation I ’ve found comes from a Web page that attempts to explain for the rest of us the ways of the hacker — hacker in the word ’s original sense of “ obsessive programming tinkerer ” rather than the later , tabloid sense of “ digital break - in artist . ”
Why do programmers count from zero ?
Because computers count from zero !
And so programmers train themselves to count that way , too , to avoid a misunderstanding between them and the machines they must instruct .
Which is all fine , except for the distressing fact that most of the human beings who use those machines habitually count from one .
And so , down in the guts of the system , where data is stored and manipulated — representations of our money and our work lives and our imaginative creations all translated into machine - readable symbols — computer programs and programming languages often include little offsets , translations of “ + 1 ” or “ - 1 , ” to make sure that the list of stuff the computer is counting from zero stays in sync with the list of stuff a human user is counting from one .
In the binary digital world of computers , all information is reduced to sequences of zeros and ones .
But there ’s a space between zero and one , between the way the machine counts and thinks and the way we count and think .
When you search for explanations for software ’s bugs and delays and stubborn resistance to human desires , that space is where you ’ll find them .
As this book began taking shape in my thoughts , I would drive to work every day over the San Francisco Bay Bridge .
One morning , as my car labored up the lengthy incline that connects the Oakland shore to the elevated center of the bridge ’s eastern span , I noticed , off to the right , a new object blocking the panorama of blue bay water and green Marin hill :
The tip of a high red crane peeked just over the bridge ’s deck level .
It was there the next day and the next , and soon it was joined by a line of a dozen cranes , arrayed along the bridge ’s north side like a rank of mechanical beasts at the trough , ready to feed on hapless commuters .
Work was beginning on a replacement for this half of the doubledecker bridge .
A fifty - foot chunk of its upper level had collapsed onto the lower roadway during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake .
Now a safer , more modern structure would rise next to the old .
In the weeks and months that followed , each of the 240 - foot - tall cranes began pounding rust - caked steel tubes , 8 feet in diameter and 300 feet long , into the bay floor .
In the early morning hours we could sometimes hear the thuds in my home in the Berkeley hills .
One hundred sixty of these enormous piles would be filled with concrete to support the new bridge ’s viaduct .
The whole process was choreographed with precision and executed without a hitch ; it felt inevitable , its unfolding infused with all the confidence we place in the word engineering .
If the subject of software ’s flaws is discussed for more than a few minutes at a time , it is a certainty that someone will eventually pound a fist on the table and say , “ Why ca n’t we build software the way we build bridges ? ”
Bridges are , with skyscrapers and dams and similar monumental structures , the visible representation of our technical mastery over the physical universe .
In the past half century , software has emerged as an invisible yet pervasive counterpart to such world - shaping human artifacts .
“ Our civilization runs on software , ” says Bjarne Stroustrup , who invented a widely used computer language called C++.
At first this sounds like an outlandish and self - serving claim .
civilization got along just fine without Microsoft Windows , right ?
But software is more than the program you use to send email or compose a report ; it has seeped into every cranny of our lives , without many of us noticing .
It is in our kitchen gadgets and cars , toys and buildings .
Our businesses and banks , our elections and our news media , our movies and our transportation networks , our health care and national defense , our scientific research and basic utility services — the stuff of our daily existence hangs from fragile threads of computer code .
And we pay for their fragility .
Software errors cost the U.S. economy about $ 59.5 billion annually , according to a 2002 study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology , as two out of three projects came in significantly late or over budget or had to be canceled outright .
Our civilization runs on software .
Yet the art of creating software continues to be a dark mystery , even to the experts .
Never in history have we depended so completely on a product that so few know how to make well .
There is a big and sometimes frightening gap between our accelerating dependence on software systems and the steady but slow progress in our knowledge of how to make them soundly .
The dependence has increased exponentially , while the skill — and the will to apply it — advances only along a plodding line .
If you talk with programmers about this , prepare for whiplash .
On the one hand , you may hear that things have never looked brighter :
We have better tools , better testing , better languages , and better methods than ever before !
On the other hand , you will also hear that we have n’t really made much headway since the dawn of the computer era .
In his memoirs , computing pioneer Maurice Wilkes wrote of the moment in 1949 when , hauling punch cards up the stairs to a primitive computer called EDSAC in Cambridge , England , he saw the future : “ The realization came over me with full force that a good part of the remainder of my life was going to be spent in finding errors in my own programs . ”
From Wilkes ’s epiphany to the present , despite a host of innovations , programmers have been stuck with the hard slog of debugging .
Their work is one percent inspiration , the rest sweat - drenched detective work ; their products are never finished or perfect , just varying degrees of “ less broken . ”
Software is a heap of trouble .
And yet we can’t , and wo n’t , simply power down our computers and walk away .
The software that frustrates and hogties us also captivates us with new capabilities and enthralls us with promises of faster , better ways to work and live .
There ’s no going back .
We need the stuff more than we hate it .
So we dream of new and better things .
The expert who in many ways founded the modern field of software studies , Frederick Brooks , wrote an influential essay in 1987 titled “ No Silver Bullet , ” declaring that , however frustrated we may be with the writing of computer programs , we will never find a magic , transformational breakthrough — we should only expect modest , incremental advances .
Brooks ’s message is hard to argue with but painful to accept , and you ca n’t attend a computer industry conference or browse a programmers ’
Web site today without bumping into someone who is determined to prove him wrong .
Some dream of ripping down the entire edifice of today ’s software and replacing it with something new and entirely different .
Others simply yearn for programs that will respond less rigidly and more fluidly to the flow of human wishes and actions , for software that does what we want and then gets out of our way , for code that we can count on .
We dream of it , then we try to write it — and all hell breaks loose .
Chapter 1 :
DOOMED
[ July 2003 ]
Michael
Toy places his palms on his cheeks , digs his chin into his wrists , squints into his PowerBook , and begins the litany .
“ John is doomed .
He has five hundred hours of work scheduled between now and the next release .
. . .
Katie ’s doomed .
She has way more hours than there are in the universe .
Brian is majorly doomed .
Plus he ’s only half time .
Andy —
Andy is the only one who does n’t look doomed .
There are no hundreds on his list . ”
They do n’t look doomed , these programmers sitting around a nondescript conference room table in Belmont , California , on a summer day .
They listen quietly to their manager .
Toy is a tall man with an impressive gut and a ponytail , but he seems to shrink into a space of dejection as he details how far behind schedule the programmers have fallen .
It ’s July 17 , 2003 , and he ’s beginning to feel doomed himself about getting everything done in the less than two months before they are supposed to finish another working version of their project .
“ Everybody who has a list with more time than there is in the universe needs to sit down with me and go over it . ”
These lists are the bug lists — rosters of unsolved or “ open ” problems or flaws .
Together they provide a full accounting of everything these software developers know must be fixed in their product .
The bug lists live inside a program called Bugzilla .
Toy ’s programmers are also using Bugzilla to track all the programming tasks that must be finished in order to complete a release of the project ; each one is responsible for entering his or her list into Bugzilla along with an estimate of how long each task will take to complete .
“ Now let ’s talk about why we ’re behind .
Does anyone have a story to tell ? ”
There ’s silence for a minute .
John Anderson , a lanky programming veteran whose title is systems architect and who is , in a de facto sort of way , the project ’s lead coder , finally speaks up , in a soft voice .
“ There ’s a bunch of reasons .
In order to build something , you have to have a blueprint .
And we do n’t always have one .
Then you hit unexpected problems .
It ’s hard to know how long something ’s going to take until you know for sure you can build it . ”
“ But you ca n’t just throw up your hands and say , I quit . ”
Toy usually prefers to check things off his agenda fast , running his developers ’ meetings with a brisk attitude of “ let ’s get out of here as fast as we can ” that ’s popular among programmers .
But today he ’s persistent .
He wo n’t let the scheduling problems drop .
“ We need to make guesses and then figure out what went wrong with our guesses . ”
Jed Burgess , one of the project ’s younger programmers , speaks up .
“ There ’s a compounding of uncertainty : Your estimates are based on someone else ’s estimates . ”
Toy begins reviewing Anderson ’s bugs .
“ The famous flicker - free window resizing problem .
What ’s up with that ? ”
Officially , this was bug number 44 in Bugzilla , originally entered on January 19 , 2003 , and labeled “ Flicker Free window display when resizing windows . ”
I had first heard of the flicker - free window resizing problem at a meeting in February 2003 when the Open Source Applications Foundation ( OSAF ) , whose programmers
Toy was managing , had completed the very earliest version of its project , Chandler — an internal release not for public unveiling that came even before the 0.1 edition .
Ultimately , Chandler was supposed to grow up into a powerful “ personal information manager ” ( PIM ) for organizing and sharing calendars , email , to - do lists , and all the other stray information in our lives .
Right now , the program remained barely embryonic .
At that February meeting , Anderson had briefly mentioned the flicker bug — when you changed the size of a window on the Chandler screen , everything flashed for a second — as a minor matter , something he wanted to investigate and resolve because , though it did not stop the program from working , it offended him aesthetically .
Now , nearly six months later , he still has n’t fixed it .
Today Anderson explains that the problem is thornier than he had realized .
It is n’t simply a matter of fixing code that he or his colleagues have written ; its roots lie in a body of software called wxWidgets that the Chandler team has adopted as one of the building blocks of their project .
Anderson must either wait for the programmers who run wxWidgets to fix their own code or find a way to work around their flaw .
“ So you originally estimated that this would take four hours of work , ” Toy says .
“ That seems to have been off by an order of magnitude . ”
“ It ’s like a treasure hunt , ” Anderson , unflappable , responded .
“ You have to find the first thing .
You have to get the first clue before you ’re on your way , and you do n’t know how long it will take . ”
“ So you originally estimated four hours on this bug .
You now have eight hours . ”
“ Sometimes , ” Anderson offers philosophically , “ you just wake up in the morning , an idea pops into your head , and it ’s done — like that . ”
Mitchell Kapor has been sitting quietly during the exchange .
Kapor is the founder and funder of the Open Source Applications Foundation , and Chandler is his baby .
Now he looks up from his black Thinkpad .
“ Would it be useful to identify issues that have this treasure - hunt aspect ?
Is there a certain class of task that has this uncertainty ? ”
“ Within the first hour of working on the bug , ” Burgess volunteers , “ you know which it ’s going to be . ”
So it is agreed : Bugs that have a black hole - like quality — bugs that you could n’t even begin to say for sure how long they would take to fix — would be tagged in Bugzilla with a special warning label .
Shortly after the meeting , Toy sits down at his desk , calls up the Bugzilla screen , and enters a new keyword for bug number 44 , “ Flicker Free window display when resizing windows ” : scary .
Toy ’s fatalistic language was n’t just a quirk of personality : Gallows humor is a part of programming culture , and he picked up his particular vocabulary during his time at Netscape .
Though today Netscape is remembered as the Web browser company whose software and stock touched off the Internet boom , its developers had always viewed themselves as a legion of the doomed , cursed with impossible deadlines and destined to fail .
There was , in truth , nothing especially doomed about OSAF ’s programmers : Several of them had just returned from a conference where they presented their work to an enthusiastic crowd of their peers — who told them that their vision could be “ crisper ” but who mostly looked at the blueprint for Chandler and said , “ I want it now ! ”
Though the software industry had been slumping for three straight years , they were working for a nonprofit organization funded by $ 5 million from Kapor .
Their project was ambitious , but their ranks included veteran programmers with estimable achievements under their belts .
Andy Hertzfeld had written central chunks of the original Macintosh operating system .
John Anderson had written one of the first word processors for the Macintosh and later managed the software team at Steve Jobs ’s Next .
Lou Montulli , another Chandler programmer who was not at the meeting , had written key parts of the Netscape browser .
They ’d all looked doom in the eye before .
Similarly , there was nothing especially scary about bug number 44 .
It was a routine sort of problem that programmers had accepted responsibility for ever since computer software had migrated from a text - only , one - line - at - a - time universe to today ’s graphic windowsâ€ “ and - mouse landscape .
What scared
Toy was not so much the nature of Bug 44 but the impossibility of knowing how long it would take to fix .
Take one such unknown , place it next to all the other similar unknowns in Chandler , multiply them by one another , and you have the development manager ’s nightmare : a “ black hole ” in the schedule , a time chasm of indeterminate and perhaps unknowable dimensions .
Two months before , the entire Chandler team of a dozen programmers had met for a week of back - to - back meetings to try to solve a set of problems that they had dubbed “ snakes ” — another word Toy had salvaged from Netscape ’s ruins .
A snake was n’t simply a difficult problem ; it was an “ important problem that we do n’t have consensus on how to attack . ”
Snake superseded a looser usage at OSAF of the word dragon to describe the same phenomenon .
Black holes , snakes , dragons — the metaphors all daubed a layer of mythopoetic heroism over the most mundane of issues : how to schedule multiple programmers so that work actually got done .
You could plug numbers into Bugzilla all day long ; you could hold one meeting after another about improving the process .
Software time remained a snake , and it seemed invincible .
This was hardly news to anyone in the room at OSAF .
The peculiar resistance of software projects to routine scheduling is both notorious and widely accepted .
In the software development world , lateness was so common that a new euphemism had to be invented for it : slippage .
Certainly , every field has its sagas of delay ; the snail ’s pace of lawsuits is legendary , and any building contractor who actually finishes a job on time is met with stares of disbelief .
But there ’s something stranger and more baffling about the way software time bends and twists back on itself like a Mobius strip .
Progress seems to move in great spasms and then halt for no reason .
You think you ’re almost done , and then you turn around and six months have passed with no measurable progress .
This is what it feels like : A wire is loose somewhere deep inside the workings .
When it ’s connected , work moves quickly .
When it ’s not , work halts .
Everyone on the inside tries painstakingly to figure out which wire is loose , where the outage is , while observers on the outside try to offer helpful suggestions and then , losing their patience , give the whole thing a sharp kick .
Every software project in history has had its loose wires .
Every effort to improve the making of software is an effort to keep them tight .
Dec. 3 , 2006  --
Many new game shows have appeared in recent years , among them " Who Wants To Be a Millionaire , " " Deal or No Deal , " and " Show Me the Money . "
So far none has aroused the mathematical interest of the quiz show , " Let 's Make a Deal . "
Having received so many emails over the years about the show 's so - called Monty Hall problem , I thought I 'd devote this holiday column to the famous problem , to a question about a new variant of it ( with answer at end ) , and to a more general question about its applicability .
" Let 's Make a Deal " was popular in the '60s and ' 70s and has been resurrected in various formats since then .
In its original version the game show contestant was presented with three doors , behind one of which is a new car .
The other two doors have booby prizes behind them .
The Original Problem
" The Let 's Make a Deal " host , Monty Hall , asks the contestant to pick one of the three doors .
Once the contestant has done so , Monty opens one of the two remaining doors to reveal what 's behind it , but is careful never to open the door hiding the car .
After Monty has opened one of these other two doors , he offers the contestant the chance to switch doors .
The question is : Should the contestant stay with his ( or her ) original choice and hope the car is behind it or switch to the remaining unopened door ?
Many people reason that it does n't make any difference since there are two possibilities , and thus the probability is 1/2 that the car is behind the original door .
The correct strategy , however , calls for the contestant to switch .
The probability he picked the correct door originally is 1/3 , and the probability the car is behind one of the other two unopened doors is 2/3 .
Since the host is required to open a door behind which there 's a booby prize , the 2/3 probability is now concentrated on the other unopened door .
Switching to it will increase the contestant 's chances of winning from 1/3 to 2/3 .
One common way to make the decision to switch more intuitive is to imagine that there are 100 doors behind one of which is a new car , behind the other 99 , booby prizes .
The host again asks the contestant to pick one of the doors .
Once the contestant has done so , the host opens 98 of the 99 remaining doors to reveal what 's behind them , but is careful never to open the door hiding the car .
After the host has opened 98 of these other 99 doors , he offers the contestant the chance to switch to the other unopened door .
The question again is : Should the contestant switch ?
That switching is the correct answer is clearer in this case .
The probability the contestant picked the correct door originally is 1/100 , and the probability the car is behind one of the other ninety - nine unopened doors is 99/100 .
Since the host is constrained to open 98 doors behind which there 's a booby prize , the 99/100 probability is now concentrated on the other unopened door .
Switching to it will increase the contestant 's chances of winning from 1/100 to 99/100 .
It 's interesting that even in the latter case many people refuse to switch .
One factor may be an extreme fear of the regret they 'd feel if they switched away from their original pick , and it happened to be correct .
The same fear of regret underlies people 's reluctance to trade lottery tickets with friends .
They imagine how bad they 'd feel if their original ticket were to win .
A New Question and a More General Question
If this is all clear , here 's a variation of the problem to test your understanding of the probability involved .
( The answer is at the end of this column . )
Let 's say that " Let 's Make a Deal " were to attempt a comeback .
The producers , fearing the audience would be small if the game were exactly the same , devise a variant game in which the contestant is presented with 10 doors .
Again behind one of them is a car , behind the others booby prizes .
After the contestant picks a door , Monty ( or his avatar ) opens just seven of the remaining nine unopened doors , but is careful never to open the door hiding the car .
There are now three unopened doors -- the one that the contestant originally picked and two others .
Which strategy works best , switching to one of the other two unopened doors or sticking with the original pick ?
Furthermore , what is the probability of winning by following these two strategies ?
One last question : Can you think of any real - world situations -- crime mysteries , world politics , administrative deceptions -- which might be modeled on some close variant of the Monty Hall problem ( and not simply by Bayes ' theorem ) ?
That is , are there situations in which the " contestant , " say a reporter , must choose among various alternatives and the " host , " say an official , knows the true answer , but is evasive about it and instead answers a question different from the one the contestant asks ?
Answer :
The chance the prize is behind the door originally chosen by the contestant is 1/10 and remains 1/10 .
The chance it 's behind one of the nine other unopened doors is 9/10 .
Since the host opens seven of these nine other unopened doors , the 9/10 probability that it 's behind one of them is divided between two of these nine doors .
So the contestant should switch to one of these two .
Doing so raises his probability of winning from 1/10 to one - half of 9/10 or 45 percent .

His " Who 's Counting ? " column on ABCNEWS.com appears the first weekend of every month .
The Federal Communications Commission is expected to reveal the first details about its upcoming spectrum auction .
Unlike recent auctions , this is one of the best bits of spectrum to ever hit the auctioneer 's podium : it 's a chunk of spectrum in the 700MHz band that 's about to be vacated by television broadcasters .
It also has the potential to influence the course of US broadband policy for years to come .
Currently used by UHF channels 52 through 69 , the spectrum reaches from 698MHz to 806MHz , and will be vacated once the transition from analog to digital television transmission takes place in February 2009 .
Small bits were auctioned off between 2000 and 2003 , and another 30 MHz will likely be reserved for public safety use , but there will still be 60 M Hz up for grabs .
There have been a number of proposals covering how the spectrum should be allocated , and not everyone is in favor of an auction .
One company , Cyren Call , has proposed devoting the bandwidth to a " nationwide , next - generation wireless broadband network " for public safety communications .
Some of that bandwidth could then also be used by the public for wireless broadband .
Some have argued that the traditional auction rules should n't apply here because of the importance of the 700MHz spectrum to US broadband strategy .
Because of the characteristics of signals in this slice of the electromagnetic spectrum , they have wide coverage and can easily pass through walls .
That makes it ideal for wireless broadband services that could provide inexpensive service to rural areas and competition to cable and DSL everywhere else .
Other potential uses for the spectrum include traditional cellular phone service , especially for rural areas , along with 4G wireless networks like the one Sprint has planned .
Although WiMAX is intended to operate in a different part of the spectrum , it could also be deployed in the 700MHz neighborhood .
Should the 700MHz spectrum ultimately be used for something other than wireless broadband , there is still some hope for the technology .
The White Spaces Coalition is pushing the FCC to approve a technology that would allow wireless broadband providers to use " white space " in the 2MHz to 698MHz range to provide Internet access at speeds of up to 80 Mbps .
The FCC has yet to set a date for the auction , but a 2005 law mandates that it begin by January 28 , 2008 .
Winners will be able to deploy their services once the digital television transition is complete .
Iraq , Iran , and WMDs
Scott Ritter interviewed by Foaad Khosmood ( source : ZNET
Foaad Khosmood : Let 's start with the Iraq war .
There is a very popular line in Washington that gets repeated to this day and that was that " everyone thought Saddam had WMDs " and " both Republicans and Democrats were convinced this was true . "
But you are actually on record prior to the 2003 invasion saying that Iraq did not possess WMDs .
So what can we conclude about the claims that were made about WMDs prior to the invasion ?
Scott Ritter : First , let 's be absolutely correct .
I 'm not on record saying Saddam did not have any WMD .
I'm on the record saying that no one has demonstrated that he has any WMD .
The weapons inspectors said clearly that we can account for 95 to 98 percent of the WMD and we could mitigate against the concerns of the unaccounted for portion by knowing that we had then in place , in Iraq , the most intrusive , technologically advanced inspection regime in the history of arms control .
Also whatever material that was unaccounted for has a definite shelf - life that has since passed .
We also discussed whether or not unaccounted - for material could possibly constitute a threat .
And we need to also understand that just because something is unaccounted for it does not mean that Saddam Hussein has retained it .
This is a point I made .
We still had a need for inspections to complete the mission of 100 % verification of the final disposition of Iraq 's WMD .
The point I made is that those who say Iraq retains weapons have failed to put forth anything other than politically motivated rhetoric to back up their assertion .
Saying something is not accounted for does not automatically translate into its retention .
I 'm also on the record as saying that the Bush administrations case that had been made was fundamentally flawed because the intelligence did not back up anything that Bush was saying , that it was purely speculative and this is the same argument that can be made against anyone who says " you know everybody believed it . "
I can't be accountable for what somebody believes .
I can tell you what the Intelligence communities of the world were saying .
And there was 100 % agreement that Iraq had been fundamentally disarmed by 1998 .
There was not a single intelligence agency out there saying we have hard data that Saddam retains huge stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction or that he has reconstituted a meaningful WMD program .
Not a single agency !
And the reason is that because we had weapons inspectors in place and we could bring facts to table to show that Iraq did not had these weapons , that we had accounted for the vast majority of its weapons and there was no evidence of a reconstituted program .
Now where there was some unanimity that there were concerns over unaccounted - for materials .
Not that these unaccounted - for materials presented a weapons threat as they were but that they might be part and parcel of an undeclared weapons program that had been dismantled and was in hiding and could be reconstituted at some later date .
This is where the world shared some concern .
But again the point I make , is that while you can be concerned , concern does not automatically translate to reality .
Not a single Senator , not a single Congressman was presented with viable intelligence that proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Iraq retained weapons of mass destruction .
Therefore you have to ask yourself :
What intelligence did they receive ?
If you 're talking about going to war - and they voted for war - they need to be shown incontrovertible proof that a situation exists that manifests itself as a threat that warrants the use of military force .
What I can tell you is that Senators and Congressmen may have believed Saddam had WMD , but that 's faith - based analysis not fact - based analysis .
And there is a singular failure across the board for anyone who voted in favor of this war void of any hard , irrefutable evidence .
I again re-iterate not a single one of them received such a briefing because frankly speaking such a briefing could not have existed .
buy from amazon
FKh : However , in the court of public opinion , essentially the fact that some of the material was unaccounted for was sold as proof of WMD existence .
The burden was shifted to Saddam Hussein having to " show " where all the material is ...
SR : You have a situation where Saddam was called upon to prove a negative .
FKh :
That 's right and this became the standard by which you judge weather or not someone has WMD .
SR : That was an argument put forward early on in the stages of the debate .
Yet if you advance the debate beyond the real of public opinion in the realm of policy makers , proving the negative might a cute debate trick that was put forward to try to sway public opinion .
But at the end of the day prior to taking action , you need to demonstrate that a threat exists .
You can't just speculate that the threat exists , you need to demonstrate it .
And this is something that no one was able to do .
FKh : Right .
Given all this , and the fact that it would be very irresponsible to go to war with no evidence , what do you believe was the real impetus to attack Iraq ?
SR : My belief has nothing to do with it .
We can assemble a case based on the statements of the proponents of this war .
The framers of this war were people who believed in a dominate American role in global affairs following the collapse of the Soviet Union .
These are people who believed that the US had a duty and the obligation to step into the power vacuum created by the collapse of the Soviet Union to ensure that no single power or group of power rose up to confront the United States decisively .
It 's basically the dividing of the world into strategic spheres of national interest where the United States could intervene unilaterally , preemptively , militarily , exploiting our economic , diplomatic , military advantages to our benefit .
Iraq was identified as one of these nations that was compatible with the American vision of how the world should operate , dominated by the United States .
What we saw is Iraq being taken care of according to this plan which goes well beyond Iraq .
This is inclusive of Iran and Syria and North Korea .
If you read any of the deeper analytical papers of these ideologues who were formulating policy , you will see that China and Russia are included as failed states , failed regimes that require dramatic change before they can be compatible with America .
This is what was happening .
This is about the new American Empire .
1/31/07
FKh : Let 's now turn to Iran and your new book Target Iran .
Who is the MEK ?
SR : MEK is the Mojahedin - e - Khalq [ 1 ] .
It 's an Iranian Marxist organization that came into being in the 1970's .
It was a force that was opposed to the rule of the Shah of Iran .
It was primarily a military opposition group to the Shah and it carried out a number of attacks against the governmental institutions and the military and American military advisors in Iran .
When the Islamic revolution took place in 1979 , the MEK initially allied with the Ayatollahs but soon fell out of favor with them .
MEK went into exile and they took root first in Europe and later in Iraq where it became a very powerful military wing of the Iraqi Mukhaberat or the intelligence service .
Today it 's funded by the CIA in their policy of using this organization to be a stick in the side of Iran .
Even now , the MEK continues to be listed by the State department as an international terrorist organization .
FKh : OK , so this is a terrorist organization that is responsible for attacks against American civilians .
There are many negative things against this group , especially in this political climate .
Yet it has managed to have favorable public relations in Washington .
Is this all because of CIA backing or are there other benefactors ?
SR : Well , if you 're dealing with a population that is pre-programmed to accept at face value anything that is put forth by the mainstream media or other punditry which opposes the Islamic Republic , as being good , then all these negatives go away .
The MEK also has the support of the state of Israel .
It has the support of the powerful pro-Israeli lobby here in the United States .
It has the support of many members of congress , whether they have arrived at their position independently or as a result of intensive lobbying .
The MEK does have a base of support among the anti-Tehran groups in Washington .
FKh :
In your new book , Target Iran you say that Israeli intelligence was the true source of the new information on Iran 's hidden nuclear facilities .
You also say that Michael Ledeen and some Washington neocons arranged for MEK to be the conduit of this information .
Why was it important for another organization to be the deliverer of this news ?
SR : The answer is twofold .
One , Israel has a PR problem if it comes out as the lead element in tackling Iran 's nuclear program .
Two , if your goal is regime change and one of the organizations that you 're backing is the MEK - you would also like to ...
As you say , there are a number of negatives to this organization , so you would position the MEK as an organization that is capable of getting quality information on Iran .
This was the same strategy that was used with the Iraqi National Congress and Ahmad Chalabi .
FKh : You also write that this information was known to George Tenet ahead of time .
Does this mean Washington is once again engaged in manipulation of intelligence by withholding and strategically releasing information ?
At nine o’clock on July 28th last year , Wendy Nissley carried her two - year - old daughter , Lacy , into O.R. 12 at Johns Hopkins Hospital to have half of her brain removed .
Lacy suffers from a rare malformation of the brain , known as hemimegalencephaly , in which one hemisphere grows larger than the other .
The condition causes seizures , and Lacy was having so many — up to forty in a day — that , at an age when other toddlers were trying out sentences , she could produce only a few language - like sounds .
As long as Lacy ’s malformed right hemisphere was attached to the rest of her brain , it would prevent her left hemisphere from functioning normally .
So Lacy ’s parents had brought her to Johns Hopkins for a hemispherectomy , which is probably the most radical procedure in neurosurgery .
Wendy laid her daughter on the operating table .
Because Lacy was so small , it took the anesthesiologist almost ninety minutes to insert her intravenous lines .
George Jallo , the attending neurosurgeon , spent a long time arranging her head on gel padding and then drew “ Cut here ” markings on her shaved scalp .
The rest of Lacy ’s head , including her face , was covered with a sterile drape .
Jallo made one long cut across the top of her head from the front to the back , and another at right angles to the first , which started midway along it and stopped just in front of her right ear .
He folded back the scalp and made small holes in her skull with a power drill , outlining a rough semicircle .
Then he used the drill to connect the dots and removed a portion of the skull .
He cut another T in the dura , a thin , leathery membrane covering the brain .
Gently , he peeled back two large flaps .
By half past one , Jallo and a resident had already removed the right frontal lobe .
David Lieberman , the pediatric neurologist who had examined Lacy when she first came to Johns Hopkins , looked on , shaking his head in wonderment .
“ It ’s so open , ” he said , turning to me .
“ Normally , with brain surgery , you make a hole about this big ” — he curled his thumb and index finger into a circle .
After removing the frontal lobe , Jallo embarked on the parietal lobe .
In case complications put a sudden stop to the surgery , it was important to take out the seizure hot spots first , gradually working through the hemisphere in descending order of priority : after the parietal lobe would come a small section of the occipital lobe , then the temporal lobe , then the rest of the occipital .
Finally , Jallo would cut the corpus callosum , the bundle of fibres that connect the two hemispheres of the brain .
The surgeons slowly worked around each side of the parietal lobe , making tiny pinches in the brain with electric cauterizing forceps .
There was a slight smell of burning in the bright , noisy operating room .
As the cut became deeper and wider , the tissue on either side browned and blackened , and the lobe started to move back and forth .
At the bottom of the parietal wedge , the clean white of nerve fibres was visible ; as the lobe was severed , they came apart like string cheese .
A surgical technician bent toward Jallo with a small plastic bowl in his hands .
Jallo picked the lobe out of the skull — it was the size of an infant ’s fist — and dropped it into the container .
As she led me out of the O.R. , Eileen Vining , the attending neurologist , said , “ Did you see how rigid it was ?
Normal brain sags in your hands . ”
Vining talked quickly , moving from one complicated idea to the next , punctuating each with “ O.K. ? ” and an expectant nod .
She had been in and out of the operating room all morning , and now she was off to find the Nissleys and tell them how Lacy was doing .
Four hours later , Vining took me back into the O.R.
Lacy ’s right hemisphere was gone , and her cranium looked like a wide , uneven bowl .
I could see the deep cavity where the frontal and parietal lobes had been , and the white - pink color inside the base of the skull .
In the middle of the remaining brain was a shallow mound where Jallo had left a layer of nerve fibres to protect the ventricle , a fluid - filled pocket that cushions the brain and the spinal cord .
The white matter there was now gray - black .
Jallo and his resident lightly touched their forceps to it , and the cauterizers fizzed , sealing the brain to prevent microhemorrhages .
Hemorrhaging is a constant concern in brain surgery , and at one point in the operation Jallo decided to leave in a small piece of the right occipital lobe which threatened to bleed dangerously .
Jallo glanced at Vining and Lieberman , and the doctors stretched forward to look at the severed corpus callosum .
Over and over , the surgical technician poured in saline , and Jallo and his resident drew it out again with a loud suction pump .
When he had finished removing brain tissue , Jallo tipped in small packets of Surgicel , a feathery white substance that helps blood to clot .
It melted onto the surface of the brain .
“ That was good .
There was not a lot of bleeding , ” Vining said .
“ You never know what you are going to get until you open it up .
Sometimes you just go in there and you hold your breath and pray . ”
In the final hour , Jallo sutured Lacy ’s dura , which had shrunk slightly from dehydration , and filled the right side of her head with saline .
The technician then brought the missing section of the skull back to Jallo , carrying it in a wide right angle over surgical carts rather than risk moving it over the floor .
Jallo reattached it , using four tiny dissolvable plates made of a sugarlike substance .
He then closed the scalp incision with a staple gun , leaving seventy - eight aluminum staples in Lacy ’s skin .
The hemispherectomy had taken nine hours .
The resident bandaged Lacy ’s head , gently turned her onto her right side , and stuck a piece of tape on her head that said “ This side up . ”
I first met the Nissleys three months before Lacy ’s surgery , at their home in Palmyra , Pennsylvania .
As I drove up , I could see Lacy ’s father , Mike , dangling a leg over the edge of the front porch .
He looked like a surfer , with a goatee beard and gold - lens Oakleys pushed back on his head .
Wendy sat on a chair near the front door , and Lacy ’s four - year - old sister , Lily , flitted around the adults .
Lacy , blond like her mother , lay across Wendy ’s lap .
“ She had a seizure just before you got here , so she ’s sleeping now , ” Wendy said .
They invited me inside .
Lacy had her first seizure on October 13 , 2003 , when she was four and a half months old .
Wendy had been doing laundry , and when she turned around she saw that Lacy ’s lips were blue and that she was shaking .
She called 911 , but by the time the ambulance arrived the seizures had ended .
In the following month , the family went to the hospital many times , but , on each occasion , by the time they got there the spell had ended and there did n’t seem to be anything wrong .
The doctors took an MRI but saw nothing unexpected , and they suggested that Lacy might have acid reflux or sleep apnea , or could even be doing it on purpose , out of anger .
“ But she was n’t angry , ” Mike said .
“ She was sitting there happy , and all of a sudden it hit her like a train . ”
One doctor put her on phenobarbital , increasing the dose each time there was another seizure .
“ It made her lethargic , like she was drunk , ” Wendy said .
That November , Lacy had a terrible attack .
“ Her arm went up in the air , ” Mike said , throwing his left arm straight up , stiff .
“ Her lips went blue .
She was having them in a row . ”
By the time the ambulance came , the seizures had subsided , but the attendants advised the Nissleys to get in their car and take Lacy to Johns Hopkins anyway .
The drive took two hours , and , just as Mike and Wendy walked over to the triage nurse , Lacy began another cluster of seizures .
The nurse said , “ We ’ve got to get you a room . ”
At Johns Hopkins , David Lieberman ordered another MRI .
The scan seemed normal , and after a week of further testing Lacy was sent home without a clear diagnosis .
Lieberman , in consultation with Eileen Vining and the Johns Hopkins epilepsy group , tried to control the convulsions with medication .
Lacy was weaned off the phenobarbital and put on Dilantin and Ativan .
They tried Diastat , Topamax , and , later , Tegretol and Keppra .
But the seizures continued .
When they hit , Mike and Wendy would lay Lacy on the floor and talk to her .
“ Every couple of minutes , she would moan and groan like she ’s in pain , ” Wendy told me .
Mike nodded .
“ They said that seizures do n’t hurt , ” he said .
“ I do n’t know that I believe that . ”
As we spoke , Lacy sat up a few times and turned to look at me .
When I waved and said , “ Hi , ” she said , “ Ba . ” Twice , she smiled ; once she looked completely terrified .
Each time , she turned her shaky head toward her mother and nestled down .
In April , 2004 , Lacy returned to Johns Hopkins for four days of continuous EEG monitoring , and again in November for another MRI .
The scan showed that she had an enlarged right hemisphere .
The bulge on the right made the midline between the two lobes bow slightly toward the smaller side , and there was a strange fogginess on the right side of the scan , whereas the left was clear .
Lieberman told the Nissleys about hemimegalencephaly .
“ We had a diagnosis , finally , and we were happy with that , ” Mike said .
“ It ’s not sleep apnea .
It ’s not acid reflux .
It is something .
We did n’t know if she was going to die . ”
Diana Pillas , who coördinates counselling at the Johns Hopkins epilepsy center , told Mike and Wendy about various possible treatments .
They could try a ketogenic diet — which is ninety per cent fat and has been shown to stop convulsions in some children — but Lacy would be restricted to a special liquid formula for two years .
She also told them about hemispherectomies .
“ I could n’t believe it .
I did n’t know people could do that and be alive , ” Mike said .
“ The first question I had was ‘ Well , what do they put in there ? ’ ”
After the initial shock , Mike and Wendy decided that the surgery was the best option .
Lacy ’s seizures had hindered her development to the point where she could n’t walk unless she was holding someone ’s hand , and she had n’t learned how to chew .
The seizures were also becoming more frequent , and they knew that children with her condition tended to live much shorter lives than their peers .
The Nissleys were concerned about the costs , though .
Mike worked as a butcher at a local supermarket , and Wendy , a doctor ’s receptionist , had had to quit working in order to look after Lacy ; no day - care program would take her .
Johns
Hopkins put them in touch with another family whose child had had the procedure , and who told the Nissleys about the financial aid that was available .
They finally made a date .
I bumped into Mike and Wendy as I came out of the O.R. with Vining .
They were smiling but tense .
“ We were really stressed , ” Mike said later .
“ We were all wondering if it was the right thing to do .
No one said it , but we all knew what we were thinking . ”
Neurosurgery began with trepanation , the prehistoric practice of scraping , sawing , or boring a hole in the skull .
Trepanned skulls , some as old as ten thousand years , have been unearthed in Europe , Africa , Asia , and the Pacific Islands .
Knowledge about the brain ’s anatomy has accumulated from the time of Galen , in the second century , but neurosurgery was not recognized as a distinct specialty until the early twentieth century .
Since then , neurosurgeons have saved many brains by selectively destroying some of their tissue .
They ’ve injected brains with pure alcohol , electrocuted them , and inserted wire loops and metal probes and wiggled them about .
They have frozen brain tissue , and they have burned it .
But no brain surgery is as dramatic as a hemispherectomy .
“ A hemispherectomy is the opposite of everything you are taught in neurosurgery , ” Jallo told me .
“ You are told throughout your residency training to preserve the brain , get what you have to get , do your work , and leave , but with this you have to take out everything along the way . ”
The first recorded hemispherectomy was performed , in 1888 , on a dog by Friedrich Goltz , a prominent German physiologist .
( Apparently , the post - op animal exhibited the same personality and a minimal reduction in intelligence . )
In humans , the operation was pioneered by Walter Dandy , a Johns Hopkins neurosurgeon , who , in 1923 , performed his first hemispherectomy on a patient with an aggressive brain tumor in the right hemisphere .
The patient lived for three and a half years , until the cancer invaded the remaining hemisphere .
Dandy performed another four hemispherectomies , all for patients who had brain cancer in their right hemispheres .
In 1938 , the Canadian neurosurgeon Kenneth McKenzie performed a hemispherectomy on a child suffering from seizures that could not be controlled with drugs .
The operation was a success , and hemispherectomies came to be more popular as a treatment for chronic seizures than for cancer .
But eventually the operation fell out of favor .
Doctors found that , around ten years after the surgery , some patients became paralyzed or comatose , and sometimes died .
This was caused by a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid , a saline - like substance that cushions the brain .
The fluid is produced at the rate of about one teaspoon per minute , and in normal brains it is reabsorbed — the total supply of fluid renews itself every five hours .
But in some cases the trauma of the operation seemed to prevent this , and the resultant pressure could distort the skull and push the remaining brain to one side , a condition known as hydrocephalus .
The hemispherectomy ’s resurgence in popularity is largely the work of John Freeman , a pediatric neurologist who has been at Johns Hopkins nearly his entire career .
Tall and charmingly gruff , Freeman is seventy - three and semi-retired , though when I visited him before Lacy ’s operation he was still putting in forty hours a week in his cluttered office .
“ Semi-retired for a workaholic , ” he said .
Freeman saw a few hemispherectomies while on a training fellowship at Columbia , and started ordering them for patients at Johns Hopkins in the early nineteen - seventies .
By then , hydrocephalus could be detected early , with scans , and the excess fluid drained to other parts of the body , where it was reabsorbed naturally .
In the early nineteen - eighties , he proposed the treatment , for the first time , for a patient with a diseased left hemisphere — a thirteen - year - old girl who suffered such uncontrollable seizures that she had spent several months in the intensive - care unit .
The prospect of removing a left hemisphere — rather than a right one , as had been the case in previous operations — was daunting .
It is generally thought that language is situated in the left half of the brain , and no one could say for certain what the effect of removing that hemisphere would be .
“ We worried about that , ” Freeman said .
“ What would your life be like if you could n’t talk , and you could n’t understand , and you were just there and aware ? ”
While a number of the hospital ’s faculty approved the operation , an outraged senior physician vetoed it .
But the only alternative , Freeman observed , was for the girl to remain in intensive care for the rest of her life , so the following week , when the doctor in question was away , Freeman went ahead and arranged the operation .
“ Can you imagine doing a hemispherectomy without the assurance that the patient would talk ? ” he asked .
The operation was a success , and the girl recovered the ability to speak .
“ Now , ” he said , “ I can tell the families : they all talk . ”
Russia warns US not to use nuclear issue to change Iran
MOSCOW , March 18 ( AFP ) Mar 18 , 2007
Russia 's security chief issued a veiled warning to Washington on Sunday not to use the Iranian nuclear issue to try to change Tehran 's political course .
" We oppose this question being used as an instrument of pressure , being used to interfere in Iran 's internal affairs , " said Igor Ivanov , the head of Russia 's Security Council , Interfax news agency reported .
At the same time Ivanov , who is Russia 's chief negotiator with Iran over its nuclear programme , called on Tehran to clarify unanswered questions about its uranium enrichment activities .
" For 18 years Iran conducted enrichment that was not under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
We insist that these questions be resolved , " Ivanov told the Council for International and Defence Policy , a club of Russian officials and foreign policy specialists .
" If this issue is closed , then Iran will have the right to develop peaceful atomic programmess . "
Washington accuses Iran of working to develop nuclear weapons , while Tehran insists its only goal is electricity generation .
A nuclear - armed Iran " would present a threat to Russia 's interests both directly and indirectly .
We will do everything to make sure this does n't happen , " Ivanov said .
He also said that Russia 's suspension last week of plans to launch a nuclear power plant it is building near the Iranian town of Bushehr was not linked to Iran 's possible pursuit of nuclear weapons .
" This is an independent question , and all the work that is done and continues there is under the strict control of the IAEA , " he said .
Washington has consistently pressed Moscow not to launch the plant , which it fears could cover weapons - related work .
The flip of a switch could become all it takes to get a good night 's sleep , according to a study released Monday .
Researchers at the University of Wisconsin - Madison have found a way to stimulate the slow waves typical of deep sleep by sending a harmless magnetic signal through the skulls of sleeping volunteers .
Sleep remains one of the big mysteries in biology .
All animals sleep , and people who are deprived of sleep suffer physically , emotionally and intellectually .
But nobody knows how sleep restores the brain .
Now , Giulio Tononi , a professor of psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin - Madison School of Medicine and Public Health , has discovered how to stimulate brain waves that characterize the deepest stage of sleep .
The discovery could open a new window into the role of sleep in keeping humans healthy , happy and able to learn .
The study was published in the April 30 edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
The brain function in question , called slow wave activity , is critical to the restoration of mood and the ability to learn , think and remember , Tononi says .
During slow wave activity , which occupies about 80 percent of sleeping hours , waves of electrical activity wash across the brain , roughly once a second , 1,000 times a night .
In a paper being published this week in the Early Edition of the scientific journal PNAS , Tononi and colleagues , including Marcello Massimini , also of the UW - Madison School of Medicine and Public Health , described the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) to initiate slow waves in sleeping volunteers .
The researchers recorded brain electrical activity with an electroencephalograph ( EEG ) .
A TMS instrument sends a harmless magnetic signal through the scalp and skull and into the brain , where it activates electrical impulses .
In response to each burst of magnetism , the subjects ' brains immediately produced slow waves typical of deep sleep , Tononi says .
" With a single pulse , we were able to induce a wave that looks identical to the waves the brain makes normally during sleep . "
The researchers have learned to locate the TMS device above a specific part of the brain , where it causes slow waves that travel throughout the brain .
" We do n't know why , but this is a very good place to evoke big waves that clearly travel through every part of the brain , " Tononi says .
Scientists ' interest in slow waves stems from a growing appreciation of their role in sleep , Tononi says .
" We have reasons to think the slow waves are not just something that happens , but that they may be important " in sleep 's restorative powers .
For example , a sleep - deprived person has larger and more numerous slow waves once asleep .
And as sleep proceeds , Tononi adds , the slow waves weaken , which may signal that the need for sleep is partially satisfied .
Creating slow waves on demand could someday lead to treatments for insomnia , where slow waves may be reduced .
Theoretically , it could also lead to a magnetically stimulated " power nap , " which might confer the benefit of eight hours sleep in just a few hours .
Before that happens , however , Tononi must go further and prove that artificial slow waves have restorative benefits to the brain .
Such an experiment would ask whether sleep with TMS leads to greater brain restoration than an equal amount of sleep without TMS .
Although an electronic power - napper sounds like a product whose time has come , Tononi is chasing a larger quarry : learning why sleep is necessary in the first place .
If all animals sleep , he says , it must play a critical role in survival , but that role remains elusive .
Based on the fact that sleep seems to " consolidate " memories , many neuroscientists believe that sleeping lets us rehearse the day 's events .
Tononi agrees that sleep improves memory , but he thinks this happens through a different process , one that involves a reduction in brain overload .
During sleep , he suggests , the synapses ( connections between nerve cells ) that were formed by the day 's learning can relax a little .
While awake , we " observe and learn much more than you think , " he observes .
" Tons of things are leaving traces , changing the synapses , mainly by making them stronger .
It is wonderful that you can have all these synaptic traces in the brain , but they come at a price .
Synapses require proteins , fats , space and energy .
At the end of a waking day , you have all these traces of memories left behind .
" During the slow waves , all the connections , step by step , are becoming a little weaker , " Tononi adds .
" By morning , the total connection strength is back to the way it was the morning before .
The trick is to downscale all the connections by the same percentage , so the ones that were stronger are still stronger .
That way you do n't lose the memory . "
Without this type of weakening , he says , we " would not be able to learn new things " because our brains would lack sufficient available energy , space and nutrients .
Although the explanation is still a hypothesis , Tononi hopes that the ability to artificially stimulate slow waves will allow him and other researchers to test the notion that sleep restores the brain by damping connectivity between neurons .
Slow waves , he suspects , " Clear out the noise to make sure your brain does not become too much of an energy hog , a space hog .
By morning , you have a brain that is energy efficient , space efficient and ready to learn again . "

Geometric Sculpture
As a sculptor of constructive geometric forms , my work deals with patterns and relationships derived from classical ideals of balance and symmetry .
Mathematical yet organic , these abstract forms invite the viewer to partake of the geometric aesthetic .
I use a variety of media , including paper , wood , plastic , metal , and assemblages of common household objects .
Classical forms are pushed in new directions , so viewers can take pleasure in their Platonic beauty yet recognize how they are updated for our complex high - tech times .
I share with many artists the idea that a pure form is a worthy object , and select for each piece the materials that best carry that form .
In one series of pieces , familiar objects are arranged in engaging configurations , displaying an essential tension between mundane individual components and the strikingly original totality .
Because my works invite contemplation , slowly revealing their content , some viewers see them as meditation objects .
A lively dancing energy moves within each piece and flows out to the viewer .
The integral wholeness of each self - contained sculpture presents a crystalline purity , a conundrum of complexity , and a stark simplicity .

Olbermann taps a well of discontent as the anti-O'Reilly
Keith Olbermann just needed to find his voice .
He 'd been a droll sportscaster , a serious news anchor and a bickering critic of Fox News host Bill O'Reilly .
But none of those personas really clicked .
Then he found one .
A little over a year ago , as the White House fumbled and botched the Hurricane Katrina recovery , Olbermann finally blew up .
He concluded a broadcast of his MSNBC cable news show , " Countdown , " with an indignant rant in the rat - a - tat - tat cadence of his idol , Edward R. Murrow .
He called it a " Special Comment . "
And just like that , Olbermann found his voice -- the angry everyman .
He became a liberal counterpoint to conservative media ranters like O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh , and an Internet star , too .
The result has been a cultural earthquake .
" Here 's what happened , " Olbermann said in a phone interview this week .
" Five years ago ( on Sept. 11 ) , 50 percent of the country went quiet .
There was this self - imposed censorship .
Suddenly it became unimaginable to criticize the administration .
And no one else was brave or stupid enough to say , ' I do n't remember signing that document . ' "
Today Olbermann is hot , in every sense of the word .
He likes to say that the first step to creating one of his blistering editorials is to " get pissed off , " and that 's certainly how he sounds .
But there 's something more to it , too .
Conservatives may hate his attacks , but no one doubts that he comes across as one of the smarter guys in the room .
When he laid into then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on Aug. 30 , he threw in references to Neville Chamberlain and the policy of appeasement .
Let 's see NBC network anchor Brian Williams pull that off .
Not that he would try it .
" Broadcast networks are not interested in the controversy , " Olbermann says .
Well , maybe they 'd better start thinking about it .
" I think , " says MSNBC General Manager Dan Abrams , " that Keith Olbermann may become a model for the newscast of the future . "
And sure , Abrams is going to say that because he 's Olbermann 's boss .
Besides , the MSNBC ratings have been on a roll lately -- helped by the 67 percent jump in viewership for Olbermann 's show in the year since he began channeling Howard ( " I 'm as mad as hell , and I 'm not going to take this any more ! " )
Beale from the movie " Network . "
But there 's something more at work here , a possible new model for the next age of electronic media .
Olbermann is n't just getting more viewers .
He 's getting more views -- lots and lots more .
It may have been the Rumsfeld piece that struck a nerve .
Captured on YouTube , it was e-mailed all over the country and watched again and again .
A month after it appeared on " Countdown , " it had been seen more than 100,000 times .
" I was told that this thing was flying all around to various places , " he says .
" To hear that as many , if not more , people were seeing it there than had seen it in the original was amazing . "
Not only was it a rock - solid indication that Olbermann was pulling younger viewers , but there was legitimate proof that he could move product as well .
The day the Rumsfeld piece aired , pre-orders for Olbermann 's new book , " The Worst Person in the World , " placed it 19,000th on Amazon.com 's best - seller list , according to mediabistro.com , a media news Web site .
After the commentary aired , the book moved to 19th .
It 's tangible evidence of what Olbermann calls the " proverbial ripples on the pond . "
Not that he needed the book sales to convince him .
Wherever he goes , people rush up to tell him that they 've seen one of his " Special Comments " and that he speaks for them .
" Six weeks ago , " Olbermann says , " a woman burst into tears .
I was at a restaurant with my girlfriend and she came up to me and started crying . "
Suddenly , everyone wants Olbermann .
Last week , he and political veteran Chris Matthews teamed up to anchor MSNBC 's midterm election coverage .
The result ?
Abrams called it " a major turning point for this network . "
Ratings were up across the board and the coveted 25 - to - 54 age demographic increased 111 percent from the 2002 midterm election .
What 's next ?
Expect to see Olbermann in even more mainstream settings .
The one thing he is resisting , however , is pressure to produce more " Special Comments . "
He has to feel them , he says .
" Otherwise I will turn into a cartoon of myself . "
Certainly it is the passion that carries the day .
As Abrams says , " Keith is n't faking this , and the viewers can see that . "
But now that he has everyone 's attention , everyone is asking Olbermann the same question :
With the result of the election and the resignation of Rumsfeld , where will he find targets ?
" I 'm giving the Democrats six months , " he says .
" And then they may be in for some ' Special Comments ' of their own . "
Do n't think he 's kidding .
He has found a point of view and he is n't afraid to use it .
Keith Olbermann reports
To watch his MSNBC show , " Countdown , " go to msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677 .
Initially , he was interested in replicating Herb Ritts ’s popular image of a group of nude supermodels clustered together on the floor , and a Helmut Newton diptych of women clothed and then unclothed in the identical pose .
Ms. MacAllister and some of her friends agreed to be his subjects .
He then posed the women to simulate Matisse ’s “ Dance ” and Marcel Duchamp ’s “ Nude Descending a Staircase . ”
The responses have ranged from joy to horror .
One formerly obese woman said the photos terrified her ; she said they recalled a picture she kept in her wallet as a reminder of her former self .
Other women have thanked Richard Michelson , the Northampton gallery owner , for displaying the images , and even asked if Mr. Nimoy wanted to photograph them .
“ I am actually amazed at how little negative reaction there has been , ” said Mr. Michelson .
“ I attribute this in part to the gallery setting , and the fact that Northampton , Massachusetts , is perhaps the most liberal city in the most liberal state in the nation . ”
“ We do overhear some reductive ‘ Is Nimoy into fat chicks ’ comments when the gallery room is first entered , ” he continued , “ but in fact the fun nature of the work and the quality seem to shut people up by the time they leave .
I ’ve had a few crank e-mails with snide remarks , but not a one from gallery visitors . ”
The Big Fat Blog , a Web site devoted to fat acceptance , wrote about Mr. Nimoy ’s photographs in 2005 .
A woman calling herself Nellicat wrote in response : “ I ’m 5 ’ 5 " and weigh between 130 and 135 .
But I do n’t feel as comfortable in my own skin as I should .
I look at those women strutting , posing , laughing , and I feel real envy towards them .
There they are , posing for a man (! ) knowing that the whole world will be able to see them naked (!! ) and they are LOVING it .
Oh , to be that free !
To be that comfortable and beautiful in your body — I truly envy them . ”
Though most people think of performers as naturally more unabashed than the rest of us , Ms. MacAllister said it is sometimes difficult for them , too .
“ We get scared and struggle w / self - acceptance and self - love just like you , ” she posted on the blog at the time .
“ Just want you to know that ‘ freedom is not free ’ ; the freedom you see us enjoying is the result of constant hard work and eternal vigilance against the ‘ tyranny of slenderness . ’ ”

Handy Homo Prevention Tips For Concerned Parents With Suspect Toddlers
A parent can never act too soon in taking precautionary measures to ensure that their child will never become intoxicated with mommy 's perfume and choose to devote his life to being a prancing homo .
By being both proactive and willing to inflict welts for Jesus , you can beat Satan at his own sick game and prevent him from turning your impressionable child into an ugly , rotting twig in the family tree crying out for brutal pruning .
Christian Doctors at Landover Baptist Hospital 's Homosexual Reparative Extreme - Psycho-Stabilization
Ward have put together a handy list of preventative tips for concerned parents with newborns or toddlers .
Please print out these Godly reminders and pop them in your purse the moment your water breaks for handy reference .
Early Child Development Homo Prevention Tips 1 . A boy must not sit on a toilet unless he is having a bowel movement .
Standing straight up , not hunched over while urinating , is a sign of manliness .
Squatting on a toilet seat ( especially if he hovers to avoid the urine of others or prissily wipes the seat with a square of toilet tissue ) to pee is not only effeminate but a sign of shame !
It is a secret hobby that homosexuals use in their daily lives .
It is a scientific fact that when needing to use the restroom , a male is called upon to engage in the unpleasant undertaking of extruding a poopy in only 1 out of every 3 visits .
But homosexuals use all three visits to practice squatting , to limber the cheeks of their bottom in preparation for even the most enormous ( Negro ) penises .
Such calisthenics are neither necessary nor advisable for men who have no intention of squatting over an engorged penis .
As soon as your child is able to walk on two feet , you must make that sure he is taught to stand proudly in front of a private or public toilet seat , and to speak not a word , especially in response to the coy whispers of Catholic priests in the next stall .
2 . A boy must eat everything on his plate .
But if your son pesters you to serve corn on the cob , hot dogs or sausages , that is your signal to change his diet .
Try serving meals that more effectively evoke a hankering for the fragrant delights of the female genitalia .
An artichoke stuffed with tuna fish will usually do the trick .
3 . A boy must always wear socks , except while swimming .
So - called , " flip - flops " and " sandals , " where the toes and ankles are exposed are products that were created during the ( homo ) sexual revolution .
Creation research indicates that these types of provocative " shoes , " were invented by homosexuals in San Fransissyco during the late 1960 's with fetishes for little boy ankles .
Thwart the perverted delight of these pedo - pedophiles with a thick pair of tube socks !
4 . A boy must not be allowed to watch cartoons of any kind .
He should spend Saturday mornings sitting quietly by his Father 's side ( with a respectful 3 " between the male bodies ) , watching sports that do n't involved male leotards .
He must watch Football , Basketball , Baseball and Boxing .
Soccer is not a sport for civilized people and often results in alarmingly long , uncut penises escaping from very alluring satin shorts .
Soccer appeals only to poor , uneducated halflings from underdeveloped countries where the women grow mustaches twice as fast as the men .
Make your child aware of this .
When there are no sports on TV , take your boy out in the backyard and throw the football or play catch with a very hard baseball .
Under no circumstances : wrestle in shorts , especially if your son is strapping , handsome and sporting a noticeably turgid crotch .
5 . A boy must not play with dolls .
If your boy has a young sister , forbid him from entering her room except for the purposes of the type of ordinary heterosexual experimentation that occurs in any Christian household .
If you catch your male child playing with dolls , Landover Baptist Child Psychologists recommended that you shave his head , and sit him out at the end of the driveway with a sign around his neck that says , " I 'm a Sissy Boy Who Plays With Dolls – Mailman :
Why do n't you just go ahead and stick something in my mouth ? . "
This method of prevention has a 99.5 % success rate ( unless your particular mailman is young and attractive ) .
6 . A boy must not refer to his parents as " Mommy " or " Daddy . "
As soon as your boy is old enough to speak , he must be taught to call his Mother , " Ma , " or " Momma " or " Mommie Dearest . "
When addressing his Father , he should refer to him as , " Sir , " " Dad , " or " Commander . " " Mommy " and " Daddy " are what fey , spoiled boys weaned on effeminacy coo , embarrassing you in front of the neighbors by never keeping the palms of their hands below their waists .
7 . A boy must always wear thick , white underwear .
White boxers , and / or briefs are acceptable .
Your child must be taught that men who wear colored underwear or undergarments that are cut within one inch of the outer periphery of their pubic region or the trough of the valley between the cheeks of their bottom are either European or Homosexual – and in America there is no difference between the two .
8 . A boy must never cry or pout .
Crying , pouting or showing feelings are weak and feminine traits .
After the natural tears of infancy , brought on by a child 's traumatic exit from the spiritual realm of Heaven , to the horrible shock every young man experiences in seeing his very own mother 's hairy , dilated vagina , and into this Devil run world we call , " Earth , " your boy must be taught to stop crying .
It usually takes a normal child several weeks to get over its birth – even when using daily submersions into ice - water .
If your child is still crying after three weeks , please drop him off at the Creation Science Laboratory for the remainder of the year and for a determination of whether he is worth having back .
9 . A boy must not use brightly colored crayons or any crayons from any colors of a rainbow .
Christian parents should remove and destroy any suspiciously colored crayons from their boy 's box of Crayolas .
This needs no explanation , as we here at Landover Baptist are all familiar with Mr. Crayola 's so - called " alternate lifestyle , " and his reason for putting " Pansy Pink " and " Engorged Penis Head Purple " into his boxes are quite obvious .
A boy must also draw in straight lines .
Some curves are fine , but if you suspect your child of " doodling , " and see that he is using more curves than straight lines , please call your Pastor immediately .
10 . A boy must not skip or prance .
You must not allow your boy to attend any school where they teach the children to " skip , " or play " hopscotch " in Physical Education class .
Creation Scientists have proved that such activities are the precursor to cross-dressing , appreciation for poetry , a sardonic display of irony and the rampant shoplifting of skin care products .

Cost - effective GPS mapping in real time
I have been doing a lot of exploring and surveying in the desert recently , and have been trying to find the right GPS mapping solution .
The solution I found incorporated stuff I already had ( laptop and GPS ) with the help of some excellent , nearly free software .
The best part is that it works even better than the $ 900 in - car GPS solutions as it uses always up - to - date satellite data , and is easily sharable .
Basically you run Google Earth and use some great donation - ware to link it in real time to a GPS .
This means that your mapping software and maps worldwide are not only free , but you also get hi-res satellite views and in some cases 3D buildings ( in downtown areas ) .
Only a year or so ago this would have cost tens of thousands of dollars in proprietary GPS mapping gear ; it would be difficult to share it once done ; each map and satellite shot would cost extra ; and it would have been an ordeal to get it all loaded up and working properly for each area you wanted to go .
What you need … ( my set up is listed below ) .
To get started you need a computer that can run Google Earth and you need a GPS .
If you want this setup to be mobile , it ’s of course best to use a laptop , and if you plan on using it as a primary navigation solution , I would suggest a tablet PC or UMPC with a daylight - readable screen .
I use a hand - me - down Fujitsu Stylistic 5000 tablet PC that I keep in a “ ruggedized , ” water - resistant case with drop protection by Otterbox .
Tablet PCs and UMPCs are great for in car use as they have daylight readable screens , and their touch screen interface and form factor are easier to use in a vehicle .
The Fujitsu ST 4000 and 5000 also happen to fit the Otterbox case for a very rugged combo .
To connect the GPS to Google Earth on a PC I recommend Goops ( there are a couple other options out there like Earth Bridge , but I have not tested them yet ) .
For Mac you will need GPS2geX ) .
The GPS I use is the tiny Globalsat BT 359 , which has a very long battery life and works wirelessly by Bluetooth to my Mac , PC and even my Treo ( there are also some GPS ’s that have data logging memory built in like the DG - 100 and TrackStick , though I have not used these yet ) .
This style of GPS is only meant to be used in conjunction with another device as it has no screen or memory .
So once you have a GPS and your laptop has the right software , you will need to pair your GPS to the laptop via Bluetooth and make sure it ’s recognized by Goops ( or whichever linking software you are using ) .
You are now able to track your real time position and history in Google Earth .
Goops can even color code your track history based on your speed ( red for fast ; blue for slow ) , and give you speed and altitude data on the fly .
You can also track multiple networked units as well .
Below , the red , levitated track is a plane .
The trick here is that Google Earth DOES work even when disconnected from the Internet .
You just need to be sure the cache is updated in the area you are going to ( you can set your cache to 2 gigabytes in the preferences to maximize this ) .
So before I go somewhere I just zoom in pretty close and “ fly ” over the area or route , and this loads all the hi-res satellite imagery into the cache for off - line viewing .
This solution is WAY easier than buying map CD ’s and downloading them into a GPS , and satellite imagery is way more useful for navigation .
My favorite part of this is that you can save your track and share it with others via Google Earth .
They can replay your track and even download it to their GPS ( with the $ 20 Google Earth Pro upgrade ) and follow your footsteps .
The following is my set up , but as I mentioned above , you can mix and match based on what gear you may already have or prefer .

Every Friday is Health Tip Day at Zen Habits .
You ’ve read and enjoyed the Top 20 Motivation Hacks and Top 10 Productivity Hacks … and now you want hacks to eat healthier and to get a flat tummy .
Well , Zen Habits has never been one to hold back on you , so at reader request , here are the best hacks I ’ve found for eating healthy .
Top Diet 15 Hacks
Do n’t diet .
Diets never work , because they are too restrictive and temporary .
Once you ’re off the diet , you let go , and all bets are off .
Aim for gradual change , something you can sustain for the rest of your life .
If you ’re about to make a change to your diet , ask yourself : “ Is this something I can do forever ? ”
If not , perhaps you should consider a smaller or different change .
Change one food at a time .
As a corollary to the above hack , just change one thing in your diet , and get used to it .
For example , instead of eating sugar cereal , try oatmeal or whole - grain cereal with low sugar .
Or instead of eating a burger , try a healthier sandwich .
Once you ’re used to that change ( give it at least 2 weeks , a month is better ) , change another food .
There ’s no need to change your entire diet overnight , and in fact that ’s not as sustainable .
Veggie Day .
Go vegetarian one day a week .
It ’ll reduce the fat you take in ( and thus the calories ) and also increase the fiber and nutrients you get .
Toss the junk .
The best way to ensure that you do n’t eat a bunch of junk food is to make sure it ’s not around .
Go through your fridge , your cabinets , and that secret drawer you have at work , and toss all the junk food .
Do n’t buy any more .
Now move on to the next tip .
Stock up on good snacks .
Instead of junk food , you need snacks that are good for you — fruits and veggies are my favorites , but whole - wheat crackers , nuts , and the like are also good .
Have your home stocked with it , take it on the road , and have it available at work .
Brown bag it .
Take a healthy lunch with you to work , instead of eating at a restaurant .
More on that here .
Atkins Hack .
I do n’t recommend the Atkins diet .
I ’ve tried it .
It literally makes you sick — that ’s what ketosis is .
And it ’s not something that is sustainable for very long — ask anyone who ’s tried it .
But one thing that Atkins did was bring to our consciousness the fact that not all carbs are created equal .
Replace white carbs with whole - grain carbs , and you ’ve made a good change .
Flax it up .
Often ignored are essential fatty acids , and ground flaxseeds are an excellent source .
I toss ground flaxseed in pancakes , cereal , anything I bake , and especially my oatmeal ( with some frozen blueberries – yum ! ) .
Forsake juice .
Juice is good fruit , with all the fiber removed .
What ’s left is mostly sugar .
Eat fruit instead .
Water powered .
Instead of juice or coffee or soda or tea , drink water .
It ’s really the best drink there is .
I drink water all day long .
Say nay -o to mayo .
Mayonnaise is filled with fat .
So is butter , and cream cheese and eggs and cream … find healthier replacements .
I like Veganaise for mayonnaise , “ better than cream cheese ” , canola - oil margarine , and I basically nix the eggs .
Olive you .
I think olives are magical .
But in any case , they ’re great additions to salads and home - made pizza and other dishes , and I use olive oil on just about anything .
Replace saturated fats with healthy fats .
Canola oil is great too .
Nuts to that .
Nuts are great sources of good oils and proteins .
Add some nuts to your diet for snacks , or on salads .
Raw is best — raw almonds are great .
Avoid ones that are too high in salt .
Berry good .
Berries are another magical food , and easy to add to any diet .
Blueberries are best , but any berries are great .
Eat them plain as a snack , or add them to cereal , yogurt , smoothies .
Mmmmm .
Baked , not fried .
Yeah , you know this one .
Basically , less fatty , and still tastes great .
What are your diet hacks ?

Rudy Giuliani , speaking about terrorism and the Iraq war , said last week , “ It is something I understand better than anyone else running for president . ”
How long will John McCain — a real - life war hero down seventeen points in the polls — stand for such bluster , considering the lengths Giuliani went to to stay out of Vietnam ?
He wo n’t mention Rudy ’s military history — yet .
It ’s too early in the primary cycle to go negative .
But opponents know this is the warrior - mayor ’s biggest weakness .
“ If Giuliani is the nominee , we ’re going to hammer him with ads , and it ’s going to be easy because the issue is simple :
He ’s a draft dodger , ” says Jon Soltz , an Iraq vet who served as a captain and runs VoteVets.org , a left - leaning version of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth .
“ Giuliani gets a zero- zero , ” says General Wesley Clark , an adviser to the group .
“ He was n’t willing to risk his life for his country , and he has no relevant experience that ’s in any way useful to be commander - in - chief .
He hosted the U.N. and had a large police force . ”
To recap :
After receiving several deferments as a student , Giuliani applied for an occupational deferment as a law clerk , but his application was rejected .
Giuliani appealed their decision , and asked the federal judge he was clerking for to petition the draft board for him .
Which the judge did .
When his deferment expired in 1970 , Giuliani became susceptible to the draft .
He received a high number and was never called .
Giuliani “ has made it clear that if he had been called up , he would have served , ” says Katie Levinson , Giuliani ’s spokesperson .
He was opposed to the war in Vietnam on “ strategic and tactical ” grounds , she says .
Asked to clarify what tactics Giuliani opposed , Levinson declined to offer specifics .
“ Voters will choose the next commander - in - chief based on their whole record , and we believe the mayor ’s record speaks for itself . ”

Dam impacts on greenhouse emissions are a contentious issue
The team at the country 's National Space Research Institute ( INPE ) is developing prototype equipment designed to stop the greenhouse gas from entering the atmosphere .
The technology will extract the methane from the water to supplement the energy produced by the dam turbines .
The scientists estimate that worldwide the technique could prevent emissions equivalent to more than the total annual burning of fossil fuels in the UK - and reduce the pressure to build new dams in sensitive areas such as the Amazon .
We cannot hide from this problem ; you have to address it
Fernando Ramos , INPE
Critics of the industry have claimed that in tropical areas of Brazil - which supplies more than 90 % of its electricity from large dams - some reservoirs emit so much methane that their contribution to climate change is greater than an equivalent power station burning fossil fuels like coal or gas .
' Soda ' factor
Methane is produced mainly by bacteria that break down organic matter where there is little or no oxygen , for example at the bottom of lakes and reservoirs .
Since intake pipes for hydroelectric turbines tend to be placed quite deep , methane - rich water is suddenly transferred from conditions of high - pressure to the open air .
The lead scientist of the INPE project , Fernando Ramos , told the BBC's Science In Action programme : " It 's like opening a bottle of soda .
A large part of the methane is dissolved in the water bubbles , and it's released to the atmosphere .
" That 's the reason big hydro - electric dams built in tropical areas are harmful to the environment . "
There is still great uncertainty about the precise amount of methane added to the atmosphere in this way , as each dam behaves in very different ways depending on the amount of vegetation in the water , the temperature , the shape of the reservoir and many other factors .
However , a statistical analysis carried out by the INPE scientists has estimated that large dams could be responsible for worldwide annual emissions equivalent to some 800 million tonnes of carbon dioxide .
To put that in perspective , last year 's total greenhouse gas emissions from the UK were around 660 million tonnes .
Partial waters
The impact of methane emissions is disproportionate to their actual quantity , since , tonne for tonne , the gas is estimated to be more than 20 times as powerful than CO2 in creating the human - induced greenhouse effect linked to climate change .
The INPE scientists are proposing that with relatively simple technology , this unwanted by - product of hydro- electric power generation could be turned into an extra source of clean , renewable electricity .
They have estimated that some dams with an especially heavy methane load in the Amazon could increase their output by up to 50 % .
The first stage of the plan is to prevent deep , methane - rich water from going directly into the turbines , reducing the " soda bottle " effect .
A submerged membrane or steel barrier close to the dam would channel surface water to the intake pipes - there is little or no methane at the higher level of a reservoir where oxygen is plentiful .
To tap the methane , a floating device would pump deep water to an enclosed rotor on the surface .
This would create small droplets that would liberate the dissolved gas , which could then be piped to a plant that would burn it to produce electricity .
Technology demonstrator
Burning methane does produce carbon dioxide , but since this carbon would have originally been taken out of the air by plants through photosynthesis before being locked into the sediments on the floor of the reservoir , the scientists argue there would be no net addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere .
It would also prevent the much stronger global warming impacts of direct methane emissions , they say .
But the process of extracting the methane would require considerable amounts of energy .
However , the team suggest this could be supplied by hydro - power at night when demand is much lower ; and in any case , they say , it would be far outweighed by the power generated by the thermal plant .
INPE hopes to develop prototype equipment to demonstrate the process later this year .
It is sure to be very controversial in Brazil where power companies have been strongly disputing claims that their dams are significant sources of greenhouse gases .
Dr Ramos told the BBC : " We can not hide from this problem ; you have to address it .
In fact , it 's better to recognise there is a problem today , and to use this methane that is there as a commodity , harvest it to produce energy .
" And most important , it will reduce the pressure for building new dams in sensitive areas like the Amazon region . "

( Fortune Magazine ) -- Did Steve Jobs backdate the options he got as Apple 's CEO ?
I doubt it , based on the evidence I 've seen , though the company admits it backdated some other employees ' options .
Seems to me what he really did with his options was probably legal - and incredibly dumb for a guy who was making Apple one of the all - time great business turnarounds and America 's seventh - most admired company .
The great seer of tech trends had no idea what was coming - indeed , no idea how much his company , or he himself , was really worth .
Larger question for investors :
If he did n't know , how could the rest of us ?
Here 's what happened .
When Fortune ran a 2001 cover story ( by yours truly ) called " The Great CEO Pay Heist " , we put Jobs on the cover because the previous year he had received a mammoth grant of stock options that we calculated was worth $ 872 million , making it the largest one - year pay package any CEO had ever received .
Jobs responded with a letter to the editor , which we published , saying we had made a " glaring error . "
Those options were n't worth anywhere near what we said .
" In fact , they are worth zero , " he stated , since they were underwater .
And he went further : " If I 'm in error , and you really do think my penniless stock options are worth $ 872 million , I will be pleased to offer you the deal of a lifetime and sell them to you for just half that amount .
And I also have a bridge you may be interested in buying . "
We answered that while his offer was " potentially a good deal , Fortune is n't sufficiently capitalized at present to take advantage . "
Jobs was n't ready to give up on Apple options , though ; he accepted another huge grant in 2001 .
Then , in 2003 , with Apple ( Charts ) stock deep in the doldrums , he finally abandoned hope and surrendered both options grants , accepting from the board in their place a big chunk of restricted stock .
And with that , the matter was largely forgotten until the recent backdating mess brought it all back .
Now , with benefit of hindsight , let 's get out the calculator and see how smart Jobs looks .
That bag of restricted stock he got in 2003 is today worth about $ 848 million .
Not bad .
But what about the options he gave up ?
His first mega - grant , the one that landed him on our cover , would today be in the money not by the $ 436 million for which he offered to sell it to us , or even by the $ 872 million we said it was worth , but by just over $ 2.5 billion .
The other option grant he gave up would today be in the money by just over $ 1.1 billion .
That 's more than $ 3.6 billion of gain that he traded away for shares that today are worth less than $ 1 billion .
( Apple declined to comment . )
Lessons from this tale of missed opportunity :
* The supremely self - confident are n't always what they seem .
Though Jobs is considered one of Silicon Valley 's leading egomaniacs , which is saying something , he had virtually no faith in his own abilities .
When he wrote us that letter , he knew something the rest of the world did n't : that in a few months he would stand on a stage and introduce a new product called the iPod .
Yet he not only insisted his options were worthless but put his money where his mouth was two years later and made a trade that will be immortalized as one of the worst ever .
* Rationally reading a CEO 's behavior is n't always the right investment strategy .
Jobs was sending the market powerfully negative signals .
After all , when he wrote us the letter , those options still had almost nine years to run .
It was easy to calculate that if Apple stock simply appreciated for the options ' ten - year term at the same moderate rate as over the previous ten years , the options would have been worth far more than we said .
Thus , Jobs was telling the world he did n't expect that to happen .
Exchanging his options for restricted stock sent the same message .
The rational response - to sell - would have been exactly wrong .
So be cautious in analyzing Jobs ' newest pay data , to be revealed in a proxy statement due out around the time you 're reading this or soon thereafter .
Remember that Jobs likes maverick pay deals .
His salary is $ 1 a year , and in 1999 his bonus was a Gulfstream V jet .
* Smart - aleck journalists are n't always smart .
" Fortune is n't sufficiently capitalized at present " was a lame excuse .
We should have hocked the office furniture , broken our kids ' piggy banks , and taken the deal .

UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) -
On the day before it is due to be shut down , the U.N. unit that found no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq but failed to stop the U.S. - led invasion said on Thursday time had justified its methods and work .
In a voluminous report detailing the history of Iraq ’s banned weapons programs and U.N. efforts to dismantle them , it said the episode had shown that on - the - ground inspections were better than intelligence assessments by individual countries .
The report by the U.N. Monitoring , Verification and Inspection Commission , or UNMOVIC , did not name its targets but several of its conclusions appeared aimed at the United States and Britain , which invaded Iraq in March 2003 .
Washington and London said despite UNMOVIC ’s inability to find evidence , they were acting in the belief that Iraq was pursuing chemical , biological and nuclear weapons programs begun in the 1970s .
No such weapons have been found .
“ Despite some skepticism from many areas within the international community , in hindsight , it has now become clear that the U.N. inspection system in Iraq was indeed successful to a large degree , in fulfilling its disarmament and monitoring obligations , ” said the unit ’s 1,160 - page summing - up report .
“ The UN ’s verification experience in Iraq also illustrates that in - country verification , especially on - site inspections , generate more timely and accurate information than other outside sources such as national assessments . ”
UNMOVIC was in Iraq only from November 2002 until it was pulled out on the eve of the invasion , but its predecessor , UNSCOM , spent seven years there scrapping Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and facilities after the first Gulf War of 1991 .
On Friday , a U.S. and British - backed Security Council resolution is due to wind up UNMOVIC , which in recent years has been studying satellite photos and reporting on contaminated wreckage being sold abroad from former weapons plants .
PROVING A NEGATIVE
Before the 2003 invasion , UNMOVIC reports said they could not account for all of Iraq ’s chemical and biological materials but could not prove that Baghdad resumed production of them .
The new report signed by UNMOVIC acting executive chairman Demetrius Perricos said it now seemed that much of what Iraq had said about its weapons in later years had been accurate .
But it said the government of late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had found itself trying to prove a negative , a situation it had brought on itself by previous years of lying .
“ With false and misleading information being supplied by Iraq , particularly during the early years of the inspection process , it became almost impossible for Iraq to provide convincing evidence that would remove doubt that even more evidence remained undisclosed , ” it said .
It said that during its brief stay in Iraq , UNMOVIC carried out 731 inspections covering 411 sites , but it implied that U.S. and British anxiety to invade Iraq had hampered its work .
“ Had UNMOVIC not been under such a stringent time constraint , the inspections could have been more detailed and thorough and many issues which emerged could have been pursued to a conclusion allowing greater confidence in the inspection process , ” it said .
Hans Blix , the Swede who headed UNMOVIC at the time , has been more outspoken .
“ The U.S. and the U.K. chose to ignore ( our reports ) and to base their action upon their intelligence , ” Blix said in a 2005 interview .
“ We did n’t want an invasion ; we wanted inspections . ”
In other sections , the report said UNMOVIC had found that from the mid-1970s to 1990 , more than 200 foreign suppliers had provided Iraq with critical technology , equipment , items and materials used in banned weapons programs .
U.N. officials said the report ’s authors had decided not to name the suppliers .

Many of the species on the islands are found nowhere else on Earth
Experts said the 19 islands and surrounding ocean were under threat from " invasive species " , increased tourism and growing immigration .
Isolated some 1,000 km ( 620 miles ) off of Ecuador 's coast , the islands contain much unique plant and animal life .
They were protected by Unesco 1978 , with the boundaries extended in 2001 .
The UN Environment , Scientific and Cultural Organisation ( Unesco ) , which administers the list of World Heritage sites , added the Galapagos Islands to a comparatively small list of sites facing clear dangers .
Ecological fear
In a statement , the organisation said increased international interest in the islands - which are Ecuador 's most popular tourist attraction - was effectively contributing to their gradual decline .
" This increase has fuelled a growth in immigration and the ensuing inter- island traffic has led to the introduction of more invasive species . "
Earlier this year Ecuador 's President Rafael Correa said the Galapagos were at risk and in need of urgent action to protect their unique ecology .
He said he was considering a range of measures designed to protect the islands ' environment .
The wide variety of unusual flora and fauna on the islands , much of it found nowhere else on the planet , inspired naturalist Charles Darwin and helped contribute to his theory of evolution .
Unesco also placed Niokolo - Koba National Park in Senegal on the endangered list because of the threat of poaching and a proposed dam on the Gambia river .
The committee is considering 45 applications to join the World Heritage list from 39 countries .
It currently contains 830 sites .
LOS ANGELES , June 12 — Hollywood has been circulating movie trailers on the Web for years , but only now is the film industry retrofitting its rating system to give the studios a chance to showcase their racier material online .
No matter what the rating of the film , nearly all the trailers shown in theaters — and on the Web — have come with a so - called green band , or tag , saying they are approved for all audiences by the Motion Picture Association of America .
For movies rated PG - 13 or stronger , that often meant watering down the violence , sex , language and overall intensity of a trailer .
But in April a teaser trailer for Rob Zombie ’s “ Halloween ” remake , set for release on Aug. 31 , became the first to display a new yellow tag signaling that it was “ approved only for age - appropriate Internet users ” — defined by the Motion Picture Association as visitors to sites either frequented mainly by grown - ups or accessible only between 9 p.m. and 4 a.m .
And two raunchy comedies — “ Knocked Up ” and this August ’s “ Superbad ” — are among a spate of recent films with R-rated , “ red-tag ” Internet trailers , which require viewers to pass an age - verification test , in which viewers 17 and older have to match their names , birthdays and ZIP codes against public records on file .
A 79 - year - old anti-Castro Cuban exile and former C.I.A. operative linked to the bombing of a Cuban airliner was released on bail yesterday and immediately returned to Miami to await trial on immigration fraud charges .
The man , Luis Posada Carriles , was released from the Otero County Prison in Chaparral , N.M. , after posting a $ 350,000 bond on the immigration charges .
His release infuriated the authorities in Cuba and Venezuela , who have been trying to extradite him to stand trial over the 1976 airliner bombing , which killed 73 people , including several teenage members of Cuba ’s national fencing team .
The United States Justice Department had tried unsuccessfully to prevent his release , arguing that his escape from a Venezuelan prison in 1985 increased the risk that he might flee before the scheduled start of his trial on immigration charges on May 11 .
For starters , I must give a hat tip to technopolitical for leading me to this document .
But it is simply amazing that , despite all of the talk about how much we can torture people before our “ leaders ” ca n’t actually call it torture anymore , there is actually an old CIA document from the 1960s that defines tactics not nearly as horrific as those we have been hearing about as “ torture and physical coercion and should never be considered otherwise ” .
Oh , yeah – I am serious ( and please stop calling me “ Shirley ” … . )
The originally classified and confidential Memorandum to J. Edgar Hoover from the CIA discusses brainwashing , mind control and interrogation – all from , as the report indicates , a “ psychological viewpoint ” .
Even more telling – especially in light of the time in history under which this document was prepared , is that the CIA view of “ torture ” is under the section dealing with Communist Control Techniques .
So can we compare the tactics approved of and pushed by Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , McCain , Rice , Hadley and any of the other war criminals who are responsible for dragging this country ’s name through the gutter ?
I ’ll give you a few passages because frankly , it is quite shocking how this document is used to talk about how the “ Communists ” can use mind control techniques and as stated on the very first page of the document ( even before the Table of Contents ) :
We know how that men can be made to do exactly anything ….. It ’s all a question of finding the right means .
If only we take enough trouble and go sufficiently slowly , we can make him kill his aged parents and eat them in a stew . ” ( Jules Romains .
VERDUN .
A.A. Knopf , 1939 , P. 156 )
In discussing the “ involuntary re-education ” of an individual , where he or she can be taught to believe , well , pretty much anything with enough pressure and tactics , the document said the following :
It is not necessary to use direct physical means to reduce a person to a state where involuntary re-education can take place .
Interestingly , the document also talks about propaganda , brainwashing and false confessions as well as the issues that go along with it .
In laying out reasons why it is important to understand the psychology of those who are brainwashed and how to deal with people who have become brainwashed , the document says the following :
The propaganda - value of false confessions and the public anxiety concerning brainwashing loom , however , as major preoccupations .
Statements of brainwashed individuals have been a sharp - edged tool in the Communist propaganda kit . — snip —
Another and even more effective propaganda goal may be the creation of a state of fear within the populace [ of western bloc nations ] .
There is a large amount of information relating to brainwashing and the “ result of a false confession ” , including the arrest , the collection of “ evidence ” the detention ( including isolation ) and other “ parts of the process ” .
And when discussing the interrogation techniques of Communist interrogators , there is the following ( and startling ) passage ( scroll down to page 25 ) :
Two of the most effective of these [ ways to apply pressure ] are creating fatigue and preventing the prisoner adequate sleep .
— snip — Continued loss of sleep produced clouding of consciousness and a loss of alertness , both of which impair the victim ’s ability to sustain isolation .
Another simple and effective type of pressure is that of maintaining the temperature of the cell at a level which is either too hot or too cold for comfort .
— snip —
Still another pressure is to reduce the food ration to the point to which the prisoner experiences constant hunger .
— snip —
The effects of isolation , anxiety , fatigue , lack of sleep , uncomfortable temperatures , and chronic hunger produce disturbances of mood , attitudes , and behavior in nearly all prisoners .
The living organism cannot entirely withstand such assaults .
The Communists do not look upon these assaults as “ torture ” .
Undoubtedly , they use the methods which they do in order to conform , in a typical legalistic manner , to Communist theory which demands that “ no force or torture be used in extracting information from prisoners . ”
But these methods do constitute torture and physical coercion and should never be considered otherwise .
Well , well , well .
So when it is others that are using these tactics ( and they are n’t nearly as bad as what we have heard of in Abu Ghraib , Afghanistan , other countries where to where many innocent people are “ rendered ” , or in Guantanamo ) , then it is most certainly torture and should never be considered otherwise ”
But when it is done and ordered by Rumsfeld , Bush or any others that represent the United States , then we have a stark similarity to that “ communist assertion ” that is noted above .
Kind of like this comment from our very own Senator Richard Grassley :
“ We do n’t have to draw a line against torture because America does n’t torture prisoners , ” he said .
“ The courts have said what we ’ve been doing is only unlawful because Congress has n’t given the president authority to do it . ”
Hell , even the CIA knew this was torture back in the 1960s .

Some " script kiddie " tricks still work after all :
Take the first 8 digits of a standard 16 - digit credit card number .
Search for them on Google in " " form .
Since the 8 - digit prefix of a given card number is often shared with many other cards , about 1 / 4 of credit card numbers in my random test , turned up pages that included other credit card numbers , and about 1 in 10 turned up a " treasure trove " of card numbers that were exposed through someone 's sloppily written Web app .
If the numbers were displayed along with people 's names and phone numbers , sometimes I would call the users to tell them that I 'd found their cards on the Internet , and many of them said that the cards were still active and that this was the first they'd heard that the numbers had been compromised .
Now , before this gets a lot of people mad , let me say that at first I was planning on holding off writing about this for months if necessary , to give the credit card companies time to do something about it .
In other words , I actually had the presumptuousness to think that I had been the first one to discover it , but only because the credit card numbers that I found were still active .
( If the trick had been widely known , I reasoned , surely the credit card companies would have found any credit card numbers listed in Google before I did , and gotten them cancelled . )
Then I found that the trick had been publicized about three years earlier in a C - Net article by Robert Lemos and was probably widely known even before that .
( The article stops just short of describing the actual technique , but one reader posted the full details in a follow - up comment .)
Another article from that year in CRM Daily describes an even more efficient trick :
Googling for number ranges like 4060000000000000..4060999999999999 to find Visa card numbers beginning with " 4060 " .
Google has now blocked that trick , so that trying that as a Google search leads to an error page .
But the basic technique of Googling for working credit card numbers , apparently still works .
In other words , credit card companies have apparently known about this technique for at least three years , probably longer , and presumably have hoped it would continue being swept under the rug .
At this point , I think the right thing to do is to shine a light on the problem and insist that they fix it as soon as possible .
It may result in a short - term spike in people using this technique , but if it results in the problem being fixed , then the total number of fraud incidents will probably be less in the long run .
It would be simple for companies like Visa , MasterCard , and Discover to take a list of the most common 8 - digit prefixes , query for them every day on Google , and de-activate any new credit card numbers that were found that way .
( American Express cards are apparently not vulnerable to this trick , because when their 15 - digit card numbers are written with spaces , they are usually written in the format " 3 " , and Googling for the first 10 digits as " 3 " did n't yield anything in my random test of ten AmEx numbers .
But this is still their problem too , since the searches that turn up " treasure troves " of card numbers usually include AmEx numbers as well . )
A Perl programmer could write a script in one afternoon that could run through all the known 8 - digit prefixes , parse the search results , and pick out any URLs that were n't listed as matches the day before .
From there , the search results would have to be reviewed by a human , in order to spot any situations where one credit card number was exposed at one URL , and a slight variation on the same URL ( such as varying an order ID number ) would expose other credit card numbers as well , which was the case with several of the hits that I found .
Simple , but time - consuming with so many different 8 - digit prefixes -- but every minute of effort expended on tracking down and canceling leaked credit card numbers , would save time and grief later by preventing the numbers from being used by criminals .
If it would save them time in the long run and help prevent fraud , then why do n't they do this ?
It 's considered good etiquette among security researchers , when finding a new security hole , to give the affected companies a chance to fix the issue before publicizing it .
When I first contacted the credit card companies and described exactly how the exploit worked and how to block it , after getting a polite " We can't comment " from each one , I figured I 'd give them a few months to get a system in place that could find leaked cards on a daily basis and de-activate them before they could be used .
But then I found the C - Net article from 2004 , and figured that if the card companies had n't taken action in three years , it was fair game to publicize the trick in order to increase the pressure on them to plug the gap .
Of course , it 's not the card companies ' fault that these card numbers are leaked onto the Web ; it 's the fault of the merchants that allowed them to get leaked .
But the credit card companies are the only ones who are in a position to do something about it .
I did try the " Good Samaritan " approach , calling the credit card companies when I found one of their customers ' card numbers on the Web .
For each of the four major card companies , I called their security departments and reported two of the cards that I had found compromised , and then a week later , called the cardholders themselves to see if the card companies had notified them .
Surprisingly , of the four companies , American Express was theone whose customers in this experiment , when I called them a week later , said that AmEx had contacted them and told them to change their numbers .
But even if all four credit card companies were more proactive about acting on reports of leaked numbers , the problems with scaling this approach are that ( a ) I usually had to wait on hold for a few minutes with each company and then spell out each card number that I 'd found , which does n't scale for a large number of stolen card numbers , and ( b ) if lots of people started doing this , then the credit card companies would be inundated with duplicate reports about the " low - hanging fruit " , card numbers with common prefixes that appear near the top of some Google search result .
Both problems could be avoided if the card companies simply ran their own script that queried Google and brought up a list of any indexed card numbers , whereupon an employee could copy and paste the numbers into an interface that would flag the cards instantly .
Google does have a feature where you can request the removal of pages that contain credit card numbers and other personal data such as Social Security Numbers .
Any pages that I found containing credit card data , I submitted for removal , and Google did handle each removal request within two days .
But this does n't guard against the possibility that someone might have found the credit card information before it was removed , and of course it does n't mean that other search engines like Alta Vista ( remember Alta Vista ? ) might not have indexed the same pages .
Running a sample of 8 - digit prefix searches on Alta Vista , I found about as many credit cards as I found through Google , including some pages that were not in the Google index ( maybe Google never indexed them , or maybe they had removed them already ) .
So removing a page from any engine 's search results is more like covering up a symptom of a problem than fixing the problem itself , which is the fact that the card number was leaked to the Web in the first place .
If nothing else , this is another reminder of how terrible the security model is for credit card numbers as a token of payment -- one universal piece of information shared with every merchant , that can be used for unlimited unauthorized charges if it gets compromised , until someone notices .
About the only desirable property of credit card numbers from a security point of view is that they can be changed , and most of your existing recurring billing relationships will carry over , but even that is a hassle .
Several credit card companies do provide the ability to generate single - use credit card numbers , each one authorized only for a limited purchase amount .
The problem with that is that as any security analyst will tell you , if it takes even one extra step , most people wo n't bother -- as long as all - purpose credit card numbers are the default , that 's what most people will use .
Perhaps incidents like this will push people towards more 21st - century - aware styles of payment ( like PayPal , but without all the horror stories ) , where you can pay a bill through a system that debits your card or your bank account , without sharing all your information with the merchant .
But in the short term , as long as credit card numbers are still with us , the card companies should make more proactive efforts to find and deactivate the ones that have been leaked on the Internet .
If the card numbers are found to be leaked by a clumsy Web interface on one company 's site , then that company should be chastised by the card companies that issued them a merchant account .
If the numbers are found together in a list posted on some third - party forum , then the companies can cross-reference the charge history against each card in the list , to narrow down which merchant may have been responsible for the leak .
I 'm sure the card companies do something like this already when they find a list of leaked cards ; what they do n't seem to be doing is acting aggressively enough to find the leaked numbers in the first place .
Maybe the real moral is not the insecurity of credit card numbers , but the value of transparency and online community relations .
If MasterCard had been a hip company like Wikia , some volunteer probably would have discovered this attack very early , and another volunteer would have written an open - source tool to find and deactivate leaked MasterCard numbers automatically , and the problem would have been solved ten years ago .
In fact many tech companies , if you report a security problem to them , will thank you and fix it immediately , and some of them will even offer you cash if you find any more , like Netscape used to do with their $ 1,000 Bugs Bounty program .
We get so used to big companies having obvious holes in their security practices and answering every question about security with a flat " No comment " , that we forget it does n't have to be that way -- transparency is not just trendy , it .
After years of having bug hunters poke at the Netscape browser , the security may not have been perfect , but it did n't have any security holes that were as simple and obvious as to be analogous to finding credit card numbers on Google .
" My name is Lina Massufi .
I 'm a 32 - year - old laboratory assistant who works 10 hours a day just to make enough money to raise my children .
" My life has been like hell over the past three months .
US and Iraqi soldiers have raided my house more than 12 times .
" My husband , Khalil , was killed during the US invasion in 2003 when he drove through a closed road and soldiers shot him dead .
" I live in Haifa Street , one of the most dangerous places to live in Baghdad today .
The area is infamous for its huge number of insurgents .
This is why Iraqi and US soldiers have increased their activity in the area , constantly raiding homes and arresting men for interrogation .
" Last month , they arrested my 23 - year - old brother Fae 'ek , who lives with me .
He is a pharmacy student but nonetheless they took him and kept him in prison for more than a week - even after knowing he was innocent .
He returned with signs of torture on his body and was crying like a baby because of the pain .
" I cannot stand the constant military raids in my home .
Every time they [ the soldiers ] raid my house , they break the door .
They do n't know how to knock at a door .
One day , when I asked them why they were entering like that instead of ringing the bell , they laughed at me and called me an idiot .
" My furniture is all broken into pieces because of the way they conduct their searches .
I no longer have dishes or glasses to speak of because they destroyed most of them during the raids .
" I have two children and for most of the time , they are scared .
Muhammad , a four - year - old , cannot sleep well at night .
He has nightmares every day and when he wakes up he cries , asking me not to let the soldiers take him as they took his uncle .
" Fadia , my daughter , who is only eight years old , does n't want to go to school because she says that if they raid our home and I 'm not around , they would do something bad to her brother .
But with her at home , she can help him not be afraid .
" Our neighbourhood is in the middle of a constant war .
It is not safe for us to leave or enter our houses .
Most of the shops around here are closed .
We have to walk about 5 km to buy food like vegetables and rice .
" Sometimes , when I return by taxi from my job , which is about 45 minutes from my home , I find the street closed and bullets flying around everywhere .
" I start to cry as I become afraid that something might have happened to my children even though I know that my brother is there .
I know that when I get home , I will find Muhammad crying and Fadia scared but I cannot stay all day at home because if I leave my job , there will be no one to feed them .
" It is common to see at least three corpses on Haifa Street each day and sometimes up to eight , as happened last week .
They are fighters , innocent civilians or soldiers .
No one takes care of them [ the bodies ] because if you tried to get closer , you could become the next victim .
" I have no where to run to .
I have to withstand this desperate situation hoping that one day we will live in peace again , even if it seems that it might take dozens of years for that to happen . "

Six months into the new Democratic Congress , lawmakers are still keeping their earmark requests secret :
( CNN ) — Despite the new Democratic congressional leadership ’s promise of “ openness and transparency ” in the budget process , a CNN survey of the House found it nearly impossible to get information on lawmakers ’ pet projects .
Staffers for only 31 of the 435 members of the House contacted by CNN between Wednesday and Friday of last week supplied a list of their earmark requests for Fiscal Year 2008 , which begins on October 1 , or pointed callers to Web sites where those earmark requests were posted .
Of the remainder , 68 declined to provide CNN with a list , and 329 either did n’t respond to requests or said they would get back to us , and did n’t .
( Find out how your representative responded )
“ As long as we are not required to release them , we ’re not going to , ” said Dan Turner , an aide to Rep. Jim McCrery , R- Louisiana .
Seven members of the House said they had no earmark requests .
Rep. Rahm Emanuel ( D - Illinois ) released a list of his earmark requests on Monday .
In 2006 , Congress approved a record $ 29 billion in earmarks –those spending requests derided as “ pork ” that fund everything from road construction and research grants to ski lifts and minor league baseball diamonds .
Legislators view these projects as important proof that they are serving their constituents back home .
The 2006 total was 6.2 percent more than 2005 ’s $ 27.3 billion .
When Democrats regained control of Congress last fall , they promised to create the most honest , open Congress in history .
“ We will bring transparency and openness to the budget process and to the use of earmarks , ” Speaker - elect Nancy Pelosi said in December 2006 , “ and we will give the American people the leadership they deserve . ”
If you have only one telephone with one phone number , this column wo n’t be of any interest to you .
Skip to another article , you eccentric you .
But first , count your blessings .
Millions of people have more than one phone number these days — home , work , cellular , hotel room , vacation home , yacht — and with great complexity comes great hassle .
You have to check multiple answering machines .
You miss calls when people try to reach you on your cell when you ’re at home ( or the other way around ) .
You send around e-mail messages at work that say , “ On Thursday from 5 to 8:30 , I ’ll be on my cell ; for the rest of the weekend , call me at home . ”
And when you switch your job , cellphone carrier or home city , you have to notify everyone you know that you have new phone numbers .
A new service called GrandCentral , now in its final weeks of public beta testing , solves all of these problems .
It ’s a rather brilliant melding of cellphone and the Internet .
of a legacy code library sunk into the muck in the labyrinthine of Upper Management Cost Saving Schemes , the unease he had felt since becoming lost in the Corporate wilderness turned to terror .
" I 'm going to die here . " he remembers thinking .
Alone and cold .
Dumb was catapulting into the third and most dangerous stage of the phenomenon psychologists call " Refactoring shock , " the confusion and fear that humans feel when they become lost in code .
As an experienced programmer , he knew that the wisest action was to shelter in the HR wreckage and signal for rescue , or at least rest awhile and gather his wits , But being lost caused so much stress on Dumb 's nervous system that he was not able to think logically .
The first symptom of Refactoring shock is denial .
If it seems to be taking too long to reach the code smell , or if a method that 's supposed to be familiar appears different , your brain tries to bend what you see to fit its mental map of the code .
In Dumb 's case , he started to believe that the main artery of the bug he wanted to fix was just beyond the next line of code , and then , when he crossed that line , the one after that .
At precisely the point when you should backtrack to the last known build , you press forward .
That 's when you become lost .
As you become progressively more confused , the tentacles of the spaghetti seem to close in .
Some people will feel claustrophobic or experience vertigo .
The silence becomes oppressive .
William G. Sucktruck — author of Analysis of Lost Refactoring Behavior — notes that as the feeling of being closed in increases , the impulse to act becomes overwhelming and people try to " break out " by coding faster .
In full - fledged panic , the victim becomes frantic , stumbling over rough lines of code , busting structure , often rewriting entire classes to get a vantage .
Sweating profusely , he may shed hair , skin follicles , and clothing in an effort to go faster .
For a programmer , the temper is the first to go .
A Google search - and - rescue coordinator told me that once rescuers begin to find discarded tempers , their mission becomes a body search , as the odds of survival plummet precipitously .
Exhausted and caffeine - overdosed , victims who survive the initial burst of panic without succumbing to insomnia or delirium may belatedly try to form a logical plan of escape , to return to a place of familiarity on the UML map .
For most , it 's an exercise in futility , for they are both too befuddled and too far off the track to find it again .
Dumb did n't stop to make a plan until he'd thrashed through code for several hours and realized he'd gone in a circle and was back at the original cvs entry .
The sight sobered him up .
Convinced then that the trail was on the far side of the classlib , he struck off in a straight line .
He soon found himself up to his chest in the first subclass he came to , with his fingers getting stuck in the sweat on his keyboard .
Failure of the plan is the straw that breaks the spirit .
Emotionally and physically devastated , often verging on hypothermia , victims finally admit to being lost with no chance of regaining familiar ground .
Many are so disheartened that they make no effort to build backup plans or excuses , even if they have the means to do so .
At this point , any hope of survival lies not around the next bend but in the character of the lost programmer .
Why does one person lie down and die , when another , poised just as precariously on the brink of despair , regains his composure and resolves to live ?
Case studies suggest that this depends on mental strengths that many survivors share : a sense of humor , the determination to see loved ones again , an ability to live in the moment rather than be engulfed by the seeming hopelessness of their situation .
Survivors set and accomplish small goals such as building to do lists , and then they do the next right thing .
In this manner , they stay busy and focused , right up until the moment of glory !
What course did Dumb take ?
He had the resolve to push through his fatigue and free himself from the spaghetti and keep going .
He never had to discover whether he had the reserve of will to overcome another setback , because his guess was right .
He managed to cross three deep bugs , and on the far side of them was the trail leading back to his business objectives , where he met some open source code which gave him aid .
Some luck saved him , for sure , but also a will to live .
a few unprepared nights in Spaghetti code .
The more times you build at nightfall , the more likely you are to succeed in a survival situation .
a photo of your wife , kids and PCMod in your wallet .
Many survivors have drawn strength from looking at a picture of someone they love .
Refactoring training .
Studies suggest that although an emotional response always precedes a logical response , the brain does draw upon experience to shape its initial reaction to stress .

It became official this morning :
HOUSTON — Ron Paul , a nine - term Texas congressman who describes himself as a lifelong libertarian , announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination Monday .
Appearing on C - SPAN ’s “ Washington Journal , ” Paul said he was at first reluctant to run , but that “ a lot of people want to hear my message and I ’m willing to deliver it . ”
Paul , who formed an exploratory committee in January , said he has raised more than $ 500,000 in the past month “ with very little effort . ”
“ So far , the amount of money raised is n’t competitive with those establishment candidates who will raise $ 100 million , but with the Internet and the amount of money and enthusiasm , I think we can become very competitive , ” he said .
Paul , who also ran for the White House as a Libertarian Party candidate in 1988 , recently spent three days campaigning in New Hampshire .
He is planning campaign trips to Arizona and Iowa , and said he expects to be included in any GOP debates .
An obstetrician - gynecologist from just south of Houston , Paul is ideologically far afield from the Republican mainstream .
He has acknowledged that he has been largely shunned by the national party .
Among other differences with his party ’s base , Paul has criticized President Bush for acting unconstitutionally in sending U.S. troops to Iraq and has said he would support an investigation into whether Bush “ deliberately misrepresented ” his reasons for doing so .
“ I ’m very confident the Republican party has gone in the wrong direction , ” Paul said in his C - SPAN appearance .
“ We used to be the party of small government .
Now we ’re the party of big government . ”

Scheme scheme - files ...
Jscheme is my implementation of Scheme in Java .
This page presents Jscheme version 1.4 , the last version that I released ( in April 1998 ) .
If you want a mercilessly small , easily modifiable version , this is it .
Since April 1998 , development has been picked up by others , notably Tim Hickey at Brandeis and Ken Anderson at BBN .
If you want the latest , full - featured version , look at :
Jscheme 1.4 Extensions
There are a few things that are in Jscheme 1.4 that are not in R4RS Scheme :
java jscheme .
Scheme files
Any arguments on the command line are interpreted as files to be loaded .
For example , you can test the system for compliance with the Scheme standard with :
java jscheme .
Scheme r4rstest.scm ( first list )
( second list )
( third list )
( rest list )
These are the same as in Common Lisp .
( macro ( args ) body )
This syntax is defined so that ( define name ( macro ( args ) body ) ) is just like Common Lisp 's ( defmacro name ( args ) body ) .
I realize I should add a mode where this syntax is not used .
( error x ...)
Prints an error mentioning all the arguments , and then throws out to the read - eval - print loop .
( time - call proc k )
( time - call proc ) calls the procedure proc and returns a three - element list of the result , the number of milliseconds and the number of bytes consumed by the call .
If k is given , it calls k times , and returns the result from the last call .
( time exp k )
( time exp )
This macro evaluates exp k times ( or once if k is not given ) .
It then returns the same statistics as time - call .
Example :
> ( time ( zero ? 0 ) 1000 )
( #t ( 53 msec ) ( 48000 bytes ) ) ( exit k )
( exit ) exits from Java , returning k as the exit code if it is present and is a number , otherwise the exit code is 0 . ( class string ) returns the Java class named by the string .
For example , ( class " java.awt. Frame " ) . ( new class ) creates a new instance of the Java class .
For example , ( new ( class " java.awt. Frame " ) ) ( method m o cs ... ) returns a procedure that invokes a Java method m on an object o .
The cs are names of classes ( or class objects ) for the arguments of the method .
For example :
( define show ( method " show " " java.awt. Frame " ) )
( show ( new " java.awt. Frame " ) )
Jscheme implements all of R4RS except that :
Continuations can only be used as escape procedures ; that is they can only be called while the surrounding try / catch is still in scope .
read does not handle all the lexical syntax for numbers ( e.g. # e123#.#F-3+#b1/#d4#i ) .
The language standard says " any particular implementation may support only some " of the written notations for numbers , so this does not appear to be a violation .
The distinction between exact and inexact is not right .
I represent all numbers as double precision floating point , and define both exact ?
and integer ? as ( lambda ( x ) ( and ( number ? x ) ( = x ( round x ) ) (< (- x 1 ) x (+ x 1 ) ) ) )
To Do
There are a few things on my " to do " list :
Better support for errors : catch some errors that kill the system , allow user to interrupt and get into a break loop or back to top level , provide for recovery from errors .
Better integration with Java methods .
Better way to use multi-threading .
Functions for web access .
A GUI .
An applet version available over the web .
Add BigInteger or BigDecimal numbers .
Or maybe a new LongRational class .
Make everything 10 to 50 times faster ( I hope ) by pre-treating expressions before evaluating .
R5RS support .
This requires hygienic macros ( which Dorai already did for me ) and fifteen new procedures : two - argument eval , scheme - report - environment , null - environment , interaction - environment , numerator , denominator , rationalize , string - copy , string - fill ! , vector - fill ! , port ? , char- ready ? , values , call - with - values , and dynamic - wind .
For dynamic - wind , I will probably have the same limitations as with call / cc .
I believe it is legal to do ( define values list ) ( define ( call - with - values producer consumer ) ( apply consumer ( producer ) ) )

In storm , N.O. wants no one left behind ; Number of people without cars makes evacuation difficult By Bruce Nolan , Staff writer , New Orleans Times - Picayne , July 24 , 2005 :
City , state and federal emergency officials are preparing to give the poorest of New Orleans ' poor a historically blunt message :
In the event of a major hurricane , you 're on your own .
In scripted appearances being recorded now , officials such as Mayor Ray Nagin , local Red Cross Executive Director Kay Wilkins and City Council President Oliver Thomas drive home the word that the city does not have the resources to move out of harm 's way an estimated 134,000 people without transportation .
In the video , made by the anti-poverty agency Total Community Action , they urge those people to make arrangements now by finding their own ways to leave the city in the event of an evacuation .
" You 're responsible for your safety , and you should be responsible for the person next to you , " Wilkins said in an interview .
" If you have some room to get that person out of town , the Red Cross will have a space for that person outside the area .
We can help you .
" But we do n't have the transportation . "
Officials are recording the evacuation message even as recent research by the University of New Orleans indicated that as many as 60 percent of the residents of most southeast Louisiana parishes would remain in their homes in the event of a Category 3 hurricane .
Their message will be distributed on hundreds of DVDs across the city .
The DVDs ' basic get - out - of - town message applies to all audiences , but the it is especially targeted to scores of churches and other groups heavily concentrated in Central City and other vulnerable , low - income neighborhoods , said the Rev. Marshall Truehill , head of Total Community Action .
" The primary message is that eachperson is primarilyresponsibleforthemselves , for their own family and friends , " Truehill said .
In addition to the plea from Nagin , Thomas and Wilkins , video exhortations to make evacuation plans come from representatives of State Police and the National Weather Service , and from local officials such as Sen .
Ann Duplessis , D - New Orleans , and State Rep. Arthur Morrell , D - New Orleans , said Allan Katz , whose advertising company is coordinating officials ' scripts and doing the recording .
The speakers explain what to bring and what to leave behind .
They advise viewers to bring personal medicines and critical legal documents , and tell them how to create a family communication plan .
Even a representative of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals weighs in with a message on how to make the best arrangements for pets left behind .
Production likely will continue through August .
Officials want to get the DVDs into the hands of pastors and community leaders as hurricane season reaches its height in September , Katz said .
Believing that the low - lying city is too dangerous a place to shelter refugees , the Red Cross positioned its storm shelters on higher ground north of Interstate 10 several years ago .
It dropped plans to care for storm victims in schools or other institutions in town .
Truehill , Wilkins and others said emergency preparedness officials still plan to deploy some Regional Transit Authority buses , school buses and perhaps even Amtrak trains to move some people before a storm .
An RTA emergency plan dedicates 64 buses and 10 lift vans to move people somewhere ; whether that means out of town or to local shelters of last resort would depend on emergency planners ' decision at that moment , RTA spokeswoman Rosalind Cook said .
But even the larger buses hold only about 60 people each , a rescue capacity that is dwarfed by the unmet need .
In an interview at the opening of this year 's hurricane season , New Orleans Emergency Preparedness Director Joseph Matthews acknowledged that the city is overmatched .
" It 's important to emphasize that we just do n't have the resources to take everybody out , " he said in a interview in late May .
In the absence of public transportation resources , Total Community Action and the Red Cross have been developing a private initiative called Operation Brother 's Keeper that , fully formed , would enlist churches in a vast , decentralized effort to make space for the poor and the infirm in church members ' cars when they evacuate .
However , the program is only in the first year of a three - year experiment and involves only four local churches so far .
The Red Cross and Total Community Action are trying to invent a program that would show churches how to inventory their members , match those with space in their cars with those needing a ride , and put all the information in a useful framework , Wilkins said .
But the complexities so far are daunting , she said .
The inventories go only at the pace of the volunteers doing them .
Where churches recruit partner churches out of the storm area to shelter them , volunteers in both places need to be trained in running shelters , she said .
People also have to think carefully about what makes good evacuation matches .
Wilkins said that when ride arrangements are made , the volunteers must be sure to tell their passengers where their planned destination is if they are evacuated .
Moreover , although the Archdiocese of New Orleans has endorsed the project in principle , it does n't want its 142 parishes to participate until insurance problems have been solved with new legislation that reduces liability risks , Wilkins said .
At the end of three years , organizers of Operation Brother 's Keeper hope to have trained 90 congregations how to develop evacuation plans for their own members .
Meanwhile , some churches appear to have moved on their own to create evacuation plans that assist members without cars .
Since the Hurricane Ivan evacuation of 2004 , Mormon churches have begun matching members who have empty seats in cars with those needing seats , said Scott Conlin , president of the church 's local stake .
Eleven local congregations of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints share a common evacuation plan , and many church members have three - day emergency kits packed and ready to go , he said .
Mormon churches in Jackson , Miss. , Hattiesburg , Miss. , and Alexandria , La. , have arranged to receive evacuees .
The denomination also maintains a toll - free telephone number that functions as a central information drop , where members on the road can leave information about their whereabouts that church leaders can pick up and relay as necessary , Conlin said .

The current episode of Star Wars is dynamite for the duplicitous Bush administration .
Palpatine , a Sith Lord masquerading as a galactic Republican , becomes Chancellor of the Galactic Republic through deception .
Palpatine uses wars that he instigates to elevate security over the power of the Senate and to become dictator .
In a moment of triumph , Palpatine tells the Senate : " In order to ensure our security and continuing stability , the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire , for a safe and secure society . "
The senators respond with sustained cheering and applause .
Padme says , " So this is how liberty dies , with thunderous applause . "
Sith lords use the powers of the dark side of the force .
Jedi knights use the power of the good side .
The Jedi are selfless and use their incredible powers to protect the Republic .
Sith are evil and crave absolute power .
Palpatine , who is really Darth Sidious , manipulates the Senate and enlists the Jedi Council ’s patriotism to " defend " the Republic against a " separatist " army that he secretly directs .
The purpose of the orchestrated war is to erode liberty in the name of security .
The naïve Jedi catch on too late and are decimated .
The Republic falls .
Bush ’s " war against terrorism " is no less orchestrated than Palpatine ’s war and has led to the same result : a society dominated by security concerns .
The top secret British government memo that was leaked to the London Times proves beyond all doubt that Bush invaded Iraq for none of the changing reasons that he has given a too - trusting public .
Bush did not invade Iraq because of weapons of mass destruction or because he wanted to bring democracy to Iraq .
Why did Bush invade Iraq ?
No one , least of all the Bush administration , has come up with a believable reason .
Yet , there is no shortage of patriotic Republicans who sincerely believe that Bush has made America safer by turning the Muslim world against us and stirring up a hornets nest of terrorists united by their hatred of America .
Moreover , like Palpatine ’s war , Bush ’s war in Iraq appears to be interminable .
US military commanders say the US will be fighting in Iraq for years to come .
Forecasts are that the war will have cost taxpayers $ 600 billion by 2010 .
Meanwhile , Bush , like Palpatine , has brought civil liberties to a crisis .
In the US civil liberties are everywhere biting the dust .
Not content with the Orwellian - named " Patriot Act , " the Bush administration is pushing for expanded secret police powers .
Even conservative Republican Bob Barr ( Washington Times , May 17 ) writes that provisions of the " Patriot Act " go far beyond fighting terrorism " and undermine our constitutional freedoms and Fourth Amendment rights . "
Barr is chairman of a coalition , Patriots to Restore Checks and Balances .
In other words , dear readers , the checks and balances are gone .
Bush has enabled the police to bypass the courts .
Executive power rules , and there are no Jedi knights .
The Sith , however , are everywhere .
In our day the Sith masquerade as neoconservatives .
Neocons deal in absolutes .
They believe the end justifies the means .
As the Jedi master Obi-Wan tells Anakin , who is turning to the dark side and emerging as Darth Vader , " only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes . "
Anakin to Obi-Wan : " If you ’re not with me , you ’re my enemy . "
Palpatine is able to manipulate the Galactic Senate with the clever use of words that play upon emotions .
People want to feel secure .
They want their side to prevail and will do whatever it takes to win , including trading their Republic for an Empire .
Palpatine prevails because people deceive themselves .
Republicans have become adept at self - deception .
They will believe any argument that justifies Bush and no news report that casts doubt on Bush ’s war .
The leaked British government memo is dismissed as just more anti-Bush propaganda from the liberal media , like Dan Rather and Newsweek .
Newsweek ’s retraction of its story that US soldiers flushed a Koran down a toilet proves to Republicans that the only problem is an anti-American liberal media .
The fact that Newsweek was absolutely correct in reporting desecration of the Koran by US troops — and only got wrong the particular way in which the holy book was desecrated — has been totally ignored by Republicans .
Republicans believe everything Bush says .
When he tells them he needs a police state to save them from terrorists , they believe him .
Who will save us from Bush ’s police state ?
Just as Child Protective Services has had to frame innocent parents and child care providers as child abusers in order to justify its budgets and a massive bureaucracy , the vast Homeland Security apparatus will have to " find " terrorists .
Otherwise , there is no point to all the expanded police powers and the huge budget .
Just as the indignities of Airport Security and its assorted searches fall on loyal American citizens , the police state measures will also fall on loyal American citizens .
With the courts bypassed , a terrorist is whoever the secret police say is a terrorist .
The US government is already committing the crime of kidnapping people mistakenly identified as terrorist suspects and flying them to brutal regimes to be tortured .
Police states have an insatiable need for enemies .
In Stalin ’s time , the secret police conducted " street sweeps . "
People waiting for buses and shopping for food were carted off to prison , where they were tortured until they implicated others .
Thus was the Gulag filled with innocents .
" It ca n’t happen here , " but the beginnings of it already have .
The US prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba is full of mistaken identities and people who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time — including , according to the Associated Press , a chicken farmer and an invalid .
Bush ’s brand of democracy — a regime that holds people in prison for three years without charges — does not have civil liberties at heart .
Republicans are cheering .
According to news reports Congress has passed — and Bush is about to sign — a law requiring a national identity card ( Real ID ) containing invasive digital information about the person .
How long will it be before the card specifies whether the person is a gun owner ?
If it is dangerous for air travel to permit a passenger to have a toothpick or nail clippers , how can a terrorist - threatened society permit mass gun ownership ?
If the constitutional protections of civil liberties can be suspended in order to better fight terrorism , the Second Amendment does n’t have a chance .
A government that spies on its citizens will not trust them with guns .
When gun control becomes an essential feature of Homeland Security , the National Rifle Association and talk radio conservatives will be as astounded as Bail Organa and Padme when they hear Palpatine declare " an empire . . . and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . "

Special
The incredible story of Tata Motors and the Rs 1 - lakh car
Robyn Meredith , Forbes | March 30 , 2007
A n Indian car may soon earn a parking place in history alongside Ford 's Model T , Volkswagen 's Beetle and the British Motor Corp .'s Mini , all of which put a set of wheels within reach of millions of customers after they rolled onto the scene .
Tata Motors is developing a car it aims to sell for about $ 2,500 - - the cheapest , by far , ever made .
There is a lot riding on its small wheels .
If the yet - to - be - named car is a success when it goes on sale next year , it would herald the emergence of Tata Motors on the global auto scene , mark the advent of India as a global center for small - car production and represent a victory for those who advocate making cheap goods for potential customers at the " bottom of the pyramid " in emerging markets .
Most of all , it would give millions of people now relegated to lesser means of transportation the chance to drive cars .
It is a hugely ambitious project -- rivals have called it impossible - - for any company .
But it is audacious for one that had n't even built cars a decade ago .
For decades Tata Motors has been India 's largest commercial vehicle maker -- the Tata logo appears on buses , dump trucks , ambulances and cement mixers .
Sturdy as elephants , they are a fixture of the Indian landscape .
Owners inevitably paint the exteriors in a cheerful riot of bright red , green , orange , blue and yellow and line the un-air - conditioned cabs with teakwood to keep them cooler in India 's searing heat .
However ubiquitous , Tata 's trucks faced a problem after the Indian government began reforms that opened the Indian economy in 1991 : the huge cyclical swings in demand typical for commercial vehicles .
To diversify , Tata would enter , at great expense , the less volatile passenger car market .
Before the reforms Indian customers had so few choices that Tata was sheltered .
When demand tailed off it just worked down a waiting list , and there was never a need to concern itself with customer desires .
Sure enough , after the economy slumped in the late 1990s -- just when expenses for developing the passenger car hit home -- Tata truck and bus sales plunged by 40 % , and Tata Motors lost $ 110 million in fiscal 2000 .
It was the first red ink seen since 1945 , when the company was founded to make locomotives .
Executives were stunned .
" It was corporate India 's biggest loss , " says Ravi Kant , managing director of Tata Motors .
" The crisis changed us .
We told ourselves , ' Never again . ' "
But Tata Motors , part of India 's largest conglomerate , first had to reset its ways .
Like many Indian companies protected for decades from foreign competition , Tata had gotten to 2000 still fat and slow .
Change started with a spring 2000 meeting at the Lakehouse , a bungalow across the street from the company 's main factory in Pune , a three - hour drive east of Mumbai .
Kant , then in charge of the commercial vehicle division , needed fresh ideas instead of rigid resistance , so in an experiment , he called a meeting of 20 of his most promising young managers -- all under 35 years old .
" I have a problem , " he said in his matter - of - fact tone .
" The company is bleeding . "
He asked for ideas on how to stop the gush of red ink .
Okay , they told him , trim costs .
Girish
Wagh was there , just 29 then .
He remembers the shock of what came next .
" Ravi Kant said that 1 % in cost cuts would be a rounding error .
He asked for 10 % ! " says Wagh .
" Never had we thought of such a target . "
Every single year until then costs had gone up , not down .
Kant told them to present a basic plan that very afternoon , in front of him and -- alarmingly - - all their bosses .
They worked frantically .
By the 3 p.m. meeting , their wildest ideas were on the table .
Taken together , they added up to 6.5 % .
" A breakthrough ! "
Kant remembers thinking .
But that 's not what he said .
" Please go back and think again , " he told them .
He needed 10 % , not 6.5 % .
" You 've got three weeks . "
The young team took some measures even as it scrounged for more .
In came benchmarking , purchasing from Internet auctions , outsourcing parts to more efficient suppliers and boosting revenue by selling Tata - made dies to other companies .
Meanwhile , the Pune factory 's veteran boss bought into the project .
The transformation of Tata Motors had begun with the searing loss in 2000 , but it continued with a return to profit in the fiscal year ending March 2003 .
By then it was producing two car models and selling a bit abroad .
Today , after buying or partnering , the company has vehicle projects around the globe and exports 11 % of output , mostly to South Africa .
Efficiency is way up :
It now takes between 12 and 15 minutes to change a die on the passenger car assembly line , down from two hours in 2000 .
The company 's break - even point for capacity utilization is one of the best in the industry worldwide .
Between 2000 and 2006 nearly 6,000 workers left the company with early - retirement deals .
Meanwhile , the once radical e-sourcing idea has become routine for Tata , which ran 750 reverse auctions on Ariba in the past year to bring down purchasing prices by an average of 7 % for everything from ball bearings to the milk served in the company cafeteria .
Tata Motors listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2004 .
After thousands of changes , in the quarter ending December 2006 Tata earned $ 116 million on revenue of $ 1.55 billion .
Annual revenue grew to $ 5.2 billion for the fiscal year ending in March 2006 .
Analysts worry that high product development costs and rising commodities prices could lower profit margins for the next few quarters .
The changes at Tata Motors are coming as India itself is transforming .
With economic growth charging along at 9 % last year , more and more Indians can afford cars .
But on the highway from Mumbai to Pune , the new cars zoom past wooden carts filled with construction materials .
Roadside markets offer chickens and geese -- those chosen are slaughtered on the spot and usually carried home on motor scooters .
Outside the Tata Motors gates in Pune , a woman in a flowing red sari balances a 3 - foot - wide basket on her head .
It holds snacks and drinks and serves as a roving roadside shop .
Inside the company gates is a modern factory complex .
In one building , just past a small statue of the beloved Hindu elephant god Ganesha , robots pick up pieces of sheet metal and feed them into a series of 30 - foot - tall stamping presses every ten seconds until the left - side door of a Tata Safari SUV is formed .
In a building nearby , workers in navy - blue uniforms use computer - aided designs from Tata engineers to create tools and dies used to make those sheet - metal stampings .
Tata Motors boosts its revenue by making dies for Jaguar , Ford , General Motors and Toyota , too , just as it does by allowing the made - in - India Mercedes to be run through its paint shop .
Workers at the Tata Motors factory have been trained in Japanese manufacturing techniques that call for continuous improvement .
A worker building Safaris noticed that each day on average , one front grille was ruined when a worker leaned over to work on the engine and accidentally scratched the grille with his belt buckle .
Cost : about Rs 2,500 -- $ 57 -- a day , or $ 17,000 a year .
Tata designed a simple protective cover for the grilles , plus a slip - on fabric cover for belts and watches that is now used to cut down on expensive waste at each of Tata Motors ' factories .
Cost : about 25 cents per vehicle .
That 's the sort of thing that Girish Wagh , one of the breakfast - meeting whiz kids , was working to foster when Kant called him in unexpectedly in December 2000 .
Kant needed someone to take on a risky project -- to extend the truck line beyond the sturdy Tata mainstays .
Kant wanted one cheap enough to compete with three - wheeled , motorized rickshaws and even considered building a small , three - wheeled truck .
Before starting the project , Wagh did something no one at Tata Motors ever had :
He talked to customers .
The three - wheeler men inevitably insisted on a cheap , dependable truck that could go from village to market carrying , say , 200 chickens , a ton of onions or potatoes , or 2,000 eggs .
One night , as sunset approached , Wagh stuck with one rickshaw driver .
" I kept asking the question .
Why ?
Why ?
Why do you want a four - wheeler ? "
Wagh remembered .
Finally , he got the real answer .
It turned out it was n't really a problem of chickens or eggs .
" If I had a four - wheeler , I would have better marriage prospects in my village , " the young man said .
Drivers of three - wheelers are looked down upon in India .
Wagh realized that four wheels had emotional , not just practical , appeal .
When Tata Motors brought out the bare - bones Ace truck in May 2005 for just $ 5,100 , it had a monster hit :
The company sold 100,000 in 20 months .
To try to keep up with demand , it offers the truck only in white to save the time it takes to change colors in the factory paint shop .
Tata is building a new factory that will be able to turn out 250,000 a year starting this month .
So when Tata Motors needed someone to take charge of the company 's most ambitious plan yet -- to build the world 's cheapest car ever -- Ravi Kant , who by then had become the company 's managing director , again turned to Wagh .
Wagh remembers what he learned marketing the little truck .
" People want to move from two - wheelers to four - wheelers , " he says .
" Today they can't afford it . "
More and more can , but Indian car buyers today represent a tiny slice of a potentially giant market -- India has just seven cars per 1,000 people .
India 's auto industry has grown an average of 12 % for the past decade , but just 1.3 million passenger vehicles were sold in India in the fiscal year ending March 2006 .
That means a billion Indians buy about the same number of cars in a year as 300 million Americans buy in a month .
If four wheels cost as little as two wheels , that could change fast .
About 7 million scooters and motorcycles were sold in India last year , typically for prices between 30,000 rupees and Rs 70,000 , about $ 675 to $ 1,600 .
Tata is targeting a price of Rs 100,000 -- Rs 1 lakh , in Indian terms of measurement -- or about $ 2,500 at current exchange rates , for its small car .
That sounds impossibly cheap in the West but remains three times higher than India 's annual per capita income .
The average pay for factory workers at Tata Motors is just $ 5,500 a year .
Within a few years 2 million of those motorcycle owners may trade up to buy the Tata car , figures McKinsey and Co. partner Ramesh Mangaleswaran in Mumbai .
Trying to build a car cheap enough for motorcycle buyers seems to make sense now but seemed crazy several years ago when Ratan Tata , longtime chairman of Tata Motors and scion of the nation 's giant Tata Group conglomerate , first mentioned his dream of building a one - lakh car in 2003 .
" They are still saying it can't be done , " he says , insisting that it can and will .
" Everybody is talking of small cars as $ 5,000 or $ 7,000 .
After we get done with it , there will hopefully be a new definition of low - cost . "
Many low - cost car producers have set up shop in India , and McKinsey believes it could become a global hub for small - car production the way the U.S. is for pickups .
Hyundai and Suzuki build their small cars in India , and Toyota is considering an India hub .
Passenger vehicle exports grew by 13 % last year to 192,000 , according to J.D. Power and Associates , with Hyundai exporting more than 110,000 .
A one - lakh car is unlikely to be sold in the U.S.
But it would n't be aimed only at India , either , Ratan Tata says .
Bottom - of - the - pyramid markets would be the best fit : places like Africa , Southeast Asia and maybe eastern Europe and Latin America , wherever income levels mirror India's .
The cost target is tough , but there are plenty of other hurdles at home .
India 's inadequate roads , for one .
Roads and highways are being built nationwide , but if India goes car crazy , maddeningly slow traffic is inevitable for several years .
By far the biggest struggle in India is political .
The People 's Car factory is already caught in the crossfire , as politicians and pressure groups squabble over forcing destitute farmers off their land for a project expected to bring 10,000 jobs to industry - hungry West Bengal .
The company signed the final deal with the state last month and has begun the property 's boundary walls , land leveling , and road and building plans .
" We 've lost four months , " says Ratan Tata .
So far .
He is still personally driving the People 's Car project .
It is a rear - engined , four - door , four - seat car that will get around on 33 hp - - more pep than the Model T or the VW Beetle had when they drove onto the scene .
The cheapest versions wo n't have air - conditioning or power steering , but Tata hopes its cute looks will make up for missing creature comforts -- just as happened with the VW Beetle and the Mini long before it .
Tata Motors has not released a photo of its prototypes , but Ratan Tata , a trained architect with a penchant for designing consumer goods , sketched its outlines for a reporter 's eyes only .
He drew an egg - shaped car with a ceiling high enough to handle his tall frame .
He pointed proudly to the air intake scoop in front of the rear tires and the vertical taillights similar to those found on the Tata Indica .
Under the front hood it will have a small storage space , " like an overhead bin " on an airplane , Tata says .
" It is not as small as a Smart , " he says .
" It is not a car with plastic curtains or no roof - - it 's a real car . "
The design was outsourced to Italy 's Institute of Development in Automotive Engineering , but Tata himself ordered changes along the way .
Most recently he vetoed the design of the windshield wipers .
His solution : a single wiper instead of two , giving the car a cleaner look .
And cutting the cost of windshield wipers for the People 's Car in half .
Tata in Tacoma ?
The cheapest new car available in the U.S. is the Korean - made Chevrolet Aveo .
It sports a sticker price of $ 10,560 , quadruple what Tata Motors is aiming to hit in India .
The consultants at Roland Berger argue the Aveo's not cheap enough , leaving an underserved American market .
They estimate sales of cars priced under $ 10,000 could grow by 65 % in the U.S. by 2012 .
So , will U.S. burger - flippers be able to run to a dealership anytime soon and roll home in a brand - new Tata ?
Not likely .
Roland Berger estimates it would cost as much as $ 4,000 on top of Tata 's $ 2,500 to engineer the car to meet U.S. safety and emissions regulations , transport it , pay tariffs , market it , pay lawyers and offer warranties .
The same would hold true to meet European or Japanese standards .
Meanwhile , the Tata would have to compete , too , with a used - car market that turns over 43 million cars a year .
A quick Web search shows that $ 6,500 could buy a 1998 Cadillac Seville with a V - 8 engine and a leather interior , or a 2002 Dodge Caravan that seats seven .
Would a little wagon with 30 hp really figure in that equation ?
" It would n't attract Western consumers ; it is designed for pure mobility needs , " says Erkut Uludag , an author of a recent Roland Berger study of low - cost cars .
" It may be cheaper to start from scratch and build a new car specifically for export . "
Indeed , Tata , though it says it has no plans to export the People 's Car beyond developing countries , may be able to leverage what it learns from designing and producing the world 's cheapest car .
For all the attention China attracts from those fearful of an auto onslaught , it may be India -- and Tata - - that lead the way .
" They are on a steep learning curve ; I am very impressed with the company , " says Jeffrey Liker , a lean - manufacturing expert and professor at the University of Michigan .
According to Roland Berger , Indian quality is superior to Chinese quality in general .
" Somewhere the next Hyundai is out there , working from a low - cost base , " Liker says .
Remember the sneers about Hyundai when it first arrived in the U.S. :
It could n't compete with used cars .
Hyundai now sells 450,000 autos a year here .

Yes , you read that correctly .
The Iraqi parliament - who our brave young men and women are fighting to protect and preserve - is planning on taking a two month vacation during the months of July and August .
This is wrong on so many levels .
Exactly what are we fighting for again ?
This does n't seem like a government committed to getting things done , despite our huge investment and sacrifice .
Absolutely shameful .
And we thought the 109th Congress was the " do - nothing " champion .
It should come as no surprise that Secretary Rice 's top priority is the having the Iraqis finish up the oil laws .

Senator Levin weighs in :
The committee considering amendments to the Iraqi Constitution appears to be as far from completing its work as it has always been .

Let me repeat that since it is so unbelievable - the Iraqi Council of Representatives is apparently planning to go on a two month recess at the end of June .
And incredibly , Hasan Suneid , a lawmaker and adviser to Prime Minister Maliki , was quoted in the paper the other day as saying that “ time is irrelevant . ”
Well time is plenty relevant to us , our troops and their families .
" Time is irrelevant , " huh ?

Transcript via CNN.com :
BLITZER : Because there 's a lot of concern right now that the Iraqis themselves are n't taking all of these benchmarks , all of these requirements that seriously .
Supposedly , they 're about to go on vacation , the Iraqi parliament , for two months , July and August , in the midst of their failure so far to disarm , disband the militias , deal with the oil resources , the revenue from that , deal with some other critical issues that you want them to deal with .
RICE : Well , certainly they need to keep working .
And we 've made that very clear to them .
I think that they will make some progress on the oil law .
They have made a lot of progress on it .
They need to close that and finish it .
They need to get the provincial elections set up .
And we 're continuing to tell them that our patience is n't limitless , but neither is the patience of the Iraqi people limitless on this issue -- these reconciliation issues .
[...]
ZEBARI : The government is also determined to launch a major political initiative to enhance national reconciliation , to do a constitutional review according to the agreed procedures .
The de- Baathification laws would be reviewed .
The militias have to be disarmed , disbanded , and reintegrated in the society .
So we have all of these objectives and goals .
And we are working ( inaudible ) .
We are not sitting idle .
In fact ...
( CROSSTALK )
BLITZER : Well , on that point ...
ZEBARI : ... political commission ...
BLITZER : Foreign Minister , excuse me for interrupting , but on that point , there 's concern here in Washington -- Carl Levin , the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , raised it -- that your parliament is about to take a two - month vacation in the midst of all of these challenges .
And that 's raising the frustration level , as you well know , on Capitol Hill .
Is that true ?
Is the parliament going to go away and take a break even as you fail to fulfill several of these major requirements ?
ZEBARI : Wolf , yesterday I was at a meeting , a very important meeting of Baghdad security plan .
In fact , I was the person who raised that issue that although the parliament is the key body that tried to work with us on legislations , on this political plan , their recess is coming for two weeks , and really we should ...
( CROSSTALK )
BLITZER : Hey , wait a minute , is it going to be -- is it a two - week recess or a two - month recess ?
ZEBARI : No , not two -- I 'm sorry , two - month .
In fact , the recess is two months .
And we discussed that issue .
That really this should be cut down to two weeks or one week because business is not as usual in our country .
And we have to rise up , let 's say , to these challenges , and the parliament or the council of representatives who has a key role here should be up to this new challenge .
And this recess has to be reviewed in consultation with the presidency of the council of representatives .
So I 'm hopeful .
I 'm optimistic , really , that we will be able to keep them her e working and not to go in two months ' recess .
SOUTHERN BERKSHIRE , Mass. , Feb. 25 , 2007  -- Susan
Witt is an unassuming middle - aged woman who drives a Volvo around her quaint Rockwell - esque town and has somehow managed to foment a small revolution .
After years of planning , Witt started printing her own money and spending it around town .
She is not a counterfeiter .
She is the founder of Berkshares , a local currency that was introduced last fall in Southern Berkshire , Mass .
( where Normal Rockwell lived out his later years ) .
" The Berkshares are pretty simple to operate , " she said .
" You walk into a local bank , put down $ 90 federal and get 100 Berkshares , and then those Berkshares are spent at full value at regional stores . "
$ 835,000 - worth of notes were printed on fine - grain paper and distributed to banks that agreed to participate .
The notes are now accepted at 225 businesses in the area , and the program continues to grow .
Berkshares were created to stimulate the local economy by giving people incentive to shop in their own neighborhood , rather than drive the distance to large chain stores .
" We want to encourage everybody to do their business locally rather than going to a mall or shopping online , " said Sharon Palma , executive director of the Southern Berkshire Chamber of Commerce .
" Using Berkshares , you have to do business locally , and the other really nice piece of that is it 's face - to - face business . "
Several communities across the U.S. , Canada and Europe have developed similar programs , but only Berkshares are fully - backed by the U.S. dollar .
Several banks in Southern Berkshire have agreed to exchange Berkshares for dollars .
Ursula Cliff was spotted using Berkshares at Guido 's grocery store , a 27 - year - old family business in the town of Great Barrington .
" I do n't think that whether or not a merchant accepts Berkshares really affects my decision if it 's something I really want to buy , " she said .
" On the other hand , almost everywhere I go the stores use Berkshares , and I do certainly have a warmer feeling for them when they do that . "
It is that warm , fuzzy feeling that makes a regional currency scheme operable .
Witt , who spent years dreaming up a local currency project , said it " takes a local population that understands and is committed to supporting the buildup of their own regional economies . "
That is certainly the case in this picture - perfect town with its Main Street lined with mom-and - pop shops .
It 's the type of community where people seek out locally - produced food , and where buying into a program such as Berkshares is , in itself , a sort of social currency .
Some business owners have reported an increase in foot traffic and customer loyalty .
Because the Berkshares users get a 10 percent discount at the point of exchange , merchants say customers have incentive to use them .
Steve Carlotta , the owner of Snap Shop , a photo store said , " We find that there are some people doing business with us at this point who are very , very loyal customers because we accept Berkshares … without any restrictions . "
But the system is far from perfect .
The discount may be difficult for businesses that have thin profit margins , such as Guido's , to absorb in the long term .
Witt said the Berkshares board will re-evaluate the program down the line and make necessary adjustments .
The individuals behind Berkshares have even higher hopes for the project .
The next step is developing Berkshares into an electronic debit - card system , to replace or supplement the cash notes .
In the long - term , the non-profit Berkshares , Inc. , would like the capability to offer loans in Berkshares to start - up businesses , thereby promoting small - scale manufacturing that has been lost to the global economy .
" We think that by strengthening the piece of the fabric of this country , this world , that you 're strengthening the whole , " said Asa Hardcastle , the young software engineer who heads Berkshares , Inc .
" We definitely hope that this grows and this becomes something that flourishes across the country and the world . "
Similar programs are in place in a handful of other American towns -- the most successful program being in Ithaca , N.Y. , where 900 businesses accept " Ithaca Hours . "
The Berkshares program caught the eye of Sam Anderson , a community activist and black history professor in Brooklyn , N.Y .
He thinks an alternative currency could be a tool for reviving black and Hispanic businesses , which he said have been " locked out of capitalistic development . "
Anderson suggested that a " Blackshares " experiment could start in a community such as Harlem or East Los Angeles , and eventually have a wider inter -state reach .
" In the slavery period , you had this economic relationship developing , " Anderson said .
" It was more bartering between enslaved Africans , between plantations . …
That tradition was carried on in the Reconstruction period , and during that period you had the most powerful economic development in the black community coordinated in the South . "
Anderson said the introduction of Jim Crow laws set black businesses back so far , they 've never adequately recovered to compete with mainstream white businesses .
" By the time [ of the Civil Rights movement ] , the economic development between white development and black development was so disparate … that by the 1960s , when black business folk were trying to do something , there was already a monopolistic structure in place , " he said .
Anderson explained that while a racially - based currency might appear to discriminate or isolate , " if you want to support black economic development , no matter what race you 're from , you 'd get Blackshares . "
Like Berkshares , the idea behind the still - theoretical Blackshares is to challenge the current tide of globalization .
It is , at its heart , a way for the disenfranchised communities who have missed out on the fruits of global capitalism to have their piece of the pie .
Regional currencies can also be seen as part of a larger environmental movement .
In many cases , local production and consumption makes more sense in terms of energy efficiency and with warnings about global warming and dependence on foreign oil ubiquitous these days , the argument for " local living " is especially relevant .
" By making sure we have a vibrant local economy with local production , then we are creating a more sustainable future for our region , " said Witt .
" If other regions do the same , then we are creating networks of more sustainable regional economies that certainly want to trade with each other outside , but have within them the resources to support their own economies in the future . "
It 's a big vision for such a modest person , but Witt is not too far off .
The chambers of commerce of three neighboring towns recently contacted Witt to see how they can bring Berkshares to their communities .
Army studying 1,700 U.S. soldier deaths From Barbara Starr
CNN
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Iraq Afghanistan or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Responding to complaints from families who say they were given inaccurate causes of death , the Army has begun investigating death reports for more than 1,700 U.S. soldiers who died in Afghanistan and Iraq since 2001 .
The Army initiated the move after family members said they were told months after a death that the circumstances were different than originally reported .
" We have made errors in the past with casualty notifications and are rectifying the process with compassion and enthusiasm , " the Army said in a written statement .
" We have initiated a complete review of the casualty notification process and are looking at it step by step from the battlefield to the return of remains to the family . "
Next week the Army will require that all units go back to the start of the war in October 2001 , locate every unit - level investigation and list them for the Army casualty office .
That way the office can ensure the reports are compared with others , such as criminal investigations and safety reports .
If reports differ , families will be notified of any changes in the circumstances of that soldier 's death , the Army said .

What exactly does that do , anyway ?
A caucus is a closed meeting of equals , the word probably derived from the Algonquin cau - cau- asu , translated as “ proponent ” or “ advisor . ”
At 6:30 pm on January 19th , Iowa ’s 1,993 precinct caucuses were called to order , beginning the first step of an elaborate six - month process :
In January , precinct caucuses choose precinct delegates to the county caucuses .
In March , county caucuses elect 3,000 state delegates to the state convention .
In June , the state delegates choose 16 delegates to the Democratic National Convention .
In July , Iowa ’s 16 delegates vote for a presidential nominee .
How many precinct delegates ?
To make things confusing , the Iowa Democratic Party does not release the number of precinct delegates chosen on the 19th .
Instead , the party releases a tally of state delegate equivalents , an estimate of the results of the county caucuses that will be held in March .
Although the count of state delegate equivalents is at least two steps removed from the actual votes cast by caucus attendees , the count is about as close as we can get to actual voting data , and deserves some study .
A checkerboard state
Iowa is an interesting state because its 99 counties are all roughly the same size and shape .
Published maps of the Iowa caucus results tend to use a county map marked with different colors for each candidate .
For example , the map at right shows the first place finisher in each county , with split fields of color indicating two - and three - way ties .
The overall visual impression is of a fairly even statewide split between Kerry ( light gray ) and Edwards ( light red ) , with Dean ( dark red ) winning only a small number of counties .
County maps can also be drawn for individual candidates .
At lower right , a map of county - by - county results for John Kerry shows the percentage of support he has received from each county .
Kerry appears to enjoy broad support across the middle of the state , with strong support along the west and east borders , and weak support in the south .
Although both of these maps display accurate county data , and each county has roughly the same visual weight , there is a catch : the overall impression of each map is accurate only if each county elects an equal number of state delegates .
Scaling counties
In other words , with 3,000 state delegate equivalents and 99 counties , displaying state results on a county map of Iowa only works well if every county chooses roughly 30 delegates , or 1 % of the state total .
In reality , the number of state delegates elected by each county varies widely .
Polk county elects 430 delegates ( a full 14 % of the state total ) , while Guthrie county elects only 12 delegates ( 0.4 % of the state total ) .
The two counties have similar surface areas , but a 35 - fold difference in their share of state delegates .
The reason for the difference is that state delegates are allocated according to population .
Iowa ’s estimated population in 2001 was just over 2.9 million , and with a population of only 11,323 , Guthrie county does indeed represent only 0.4 % of the state .
Polk county contains the state capital and has a population of 379,029 , or 13 % of the total state population .
Scaling each county relative to the number of delegates it elects produces a more accurate visual weighting ( at right ) , though Polk county has broken its boundaries relative to the rest of the state , and Guthrie county has shrunk to a fraction of its former size .
Although my previous attempts at mapping votes by county in the 2003 California Statewide Special Election scaled counties while maintaining most internal borders , Iowa ’s gridlike pattern of counties makes it difficult to maintain internal borders without massive distortion .
Another method of scaling is needed .
A framework of counties
One technique to reduce distortion is to modify the presentation of the county borders .
Plotting the midpoint of each county and then drawing connections through shared county borders creates a simple network diagram of counties :
Bank officials say that Mr. Wolfowitz has already been given an opportunity to make his case in testimony before the bank ’s special committee investigating him and that the committee and board members have reviewed hundreds of pages of testimony and documents .
Bank officials familiar with the process of drafting the resolution to be adopted next week said the language was being revised in order to secure support that would be as broad as possible .
At present , these officials said , support for the no-confidence resolution has come from Europe , most of Asia and Latin America .
Mr. Bennett has said that Mr. Wolfowitz would file a written statement by the end of this week countering the committee ’s conclusion that he violated conflict - of - interest rules and would appear before bank officials to defend himself next week .
He has been invited to do so on Tuesday .
But with an acceleration of discussions about Mr. Wolfowitz throughout the bank and between finance and development ministries and their counterparts in Washington , it appeared that time was running out for him .
The vote declaring him no longer able to function as president could come Wednesday , European and bank officials said .
There had been talk in recent weeks of an arrangement in which Mr. Wolfowitz would be offered the option of resigning in return for some kind of resolution saying he acted in good faith in the handling of a pay and promotion package for Shaha Ali Riza , his companion .
But on Thursday it appeared too late for such language to be included in any resolution to be adopted next week .
European officials have encouraged the United States to go along with Mr. Wolfowitz ’s ouster in return for a promise that President Bush could continue the tradition of the United States picking the next president .
But that possibility has not been seized by the administration in its talks with the bank .
There was no immediate response from the Bush administration on the possibility of a no- confidence vote , but officials said the dire situation for Mr. Wolfowitz had been discussed recently with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
Michele Davis , Mr. Paulson ’s spokeswoman , said Thursday that Mr. Paulson ’s talks had been confined to ensuring a fair process for Mr. Wolfowitz .
Ms. Rice ’s spokesman said she was not involved in any talks about whether Mr. Wolfowitz should resign .
The bank board committee found last week that Mr. Wolfowitz violated bank rules and the terms of his contract barring conflicts of interest when he ordered a pay and promotion package for Ms. Riza upon becoming president in 2005 .
After several hundred times of logging into your Mac you may be tired of looking at the same old login screen .
Maybe you ’d like to have a customized login screen for your school or employer ’s workstations .
Forget the $ 10 programs that automate the process , we ’ll show you how to customize the login screen entirely on your own , for free .
It ’s not as difficult as you might think , and it ’s a fun way to personalize your Mac a bit more .
Be sure to check out the screenshot below for an example of the results .
This tutorial details how customize the login screen on Mac OS X Tiger 10.4 , Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6 , Mac OS X Leopard 10.5 , and more .
Changing the Login Screen Apple Logo in 10.4 and before
Changing the default Apple logo is quite easy and you can put virtually any 90×90 tif image in it ’s place , here ’s how to do it through the GUI :
Hit command - shift - G to bring up the “ Go to Folder ” dialog and paste in the following path exactly :
/ System/Library/CoreServices/SecurityAgent.app/Contents/Resources/
In this directory you will find a file called applelogo .
tif .
Make a backup copy of the file ‘ applelogo .
tif ’ by holding down the option key and dragging it to your desktop .
this is very important if you want to revert to the default Apple logo Rename your custom tif logo file to ‘ applelogo .
tif ’ and move it to this same Resources / folder , you will be asked for the administrator password .
Note : it must be 90×90 and a tif file ( preferably transparent for best results )
That ’s it !
Now when you login , your new logo will appear .
To revert back to the default Apple logo , follow the same directions and replace the new logo with the original applelogo .
tif file that you backed up
Change the Login Screen Apple Logo in 10.5 Leopard
Follow the exact same directions as above , but use this directory instead :
/ System/Library/CoreServices/SecurityAgentPlugins/loginwindow.bundle/Contents/Resources
Everything else is the same !
Changing the Login Screen Background Image – 10.4 and before
This is even easier than changing the Apple logo , here ’s how to do it :
Hit command - shift - G to bring up the “ Go to Folder ” dialog and paste the following directory path in :
/ Library / Desktop Pictures /
( You can also just navigate here on your own through the root of your hard drive ) Find ‘ Aqua Blue.jpg ’ and rename it to ‘ Aqua Blue2.jpg ’
Move the JPG file you ’d like to be displayed as the login screen ’s background image to the Desktop Pictures directory , and rename the file to ‘ Aqua Blue.jpg ’
Close the folders and log out or reboot , your login screen will now display your new image as the background
This trick works easily because ‘ Aqua Blue.jpg ’ is the default for the background image , so by placing any JPG file as the same name in the Desktop Pictures directory , it will be displayed instead .
Cool huh ?
Change the Login Screen Wallpaper Image in Snow Leopard 10.6
Directions for Snow Leopard 10.6 are the same as Leopard 10.5 directly below …
Change the Login Screen Wallpaper Image in Leopard 10.5
Launch the terminal and issue the following commands :
cd / System / Library / CoreServices
sudo mv DefaultDesktop.jpg DefaultDesktop_org.jpg
sudo cp / path/of/image.jpg DefaultDesktop.jpg
Of course , change / path / of / image.jpg to the path of the image file you want to use .
Basically what you ’re doing here is moving to a folder , backing up the old “ DefaultDesktop.jpg ” by renaming it , and then copying in the new image and naming it “ DefaultDesktop.jpg ” instead .
This trick works the same as it did in 10.4 , just with a different file name and location to work with .
The screenshow below demonstrates the final effects of these tricks :
If you happened to have misplaced , deleted , or forgot to backup the ‘ applelogo .
tif ’ file , click here for a backup of it .
TWO years ago , a Danish environmentalist called Bjorn Lomborg had an idea .
We all want to make the world a better place but , given finite resources , we should look for the most cost - effective ways of doing so .
He persuaded a bunch of economists , including three Nobel laureates , to draw up a list of priorities .
They found that efforts to fight malnutrition and disease would save many lives at modest expense , whereas fighting global warming would cost a colossal amount and yield distant and uncertain rewards .
That conclusion upset a lot of environmentalists .
This week , another man who upsets a lot of people embraced it .
John Bolton , America 's ambassador to the United Nations , said that Mr Lomborg 's “ Copenhagen Consensus ” ( see articles ) provided a useful way for the world body to get its priorities straight .
Too often at the UN , said Mr Bolton , “ everything is a priority ” .
The secretary - general is charged with carrying out 9,000 mandates , he said , and when you have 9,000 priorities you have none .
So , over the weekend , Mr Bolton sat down with UN diplomats from seven other countries , including China and India but no Europeans , to rank 40 ways of tackling ten global crises .
The problems addressed were climate change , communicable diseases , war , education , financial instability , governance , malnutrition , migration , clean water and trade barriers .
Given a notional $ 50 billion , how would the ambassadors spend it to make the world a better place ?
Their conclusions were strikingly similar to the Copenhagen Consensus .
After hearing presentations from experts on each problem , they drew up a list of priorities .
The top four were basic health care , better water and sanitation , more schools and better nutrition for children .
Averting climate change came last .
The ambassadors thought it wiser to spend money on things they knew would work .
Promoting breast - feeding , for example , costs very little and is proven to save lives .
It also helps infants grow up stronger and more intelligent , which means they will earn more as adults .
Vitamin
A supplements cost as little as $ 1 , save lives and stop people from going blind .
And so on .
For climate change , the trouble is that though few dispute that it is occurring , no one knows how severe it will be or what damage it will cause .
And the proposed solutions are staggeringly expensive .
Mr Lomborg reckons that the benefits of implementing the Kyoto protocol would probably outweigh the costs , but not until 2100 .
This calculation will not please Al Gore .
Nipped at the post by George Bush in 2000 , Mr Gore calls global warming an “ onrushing catastrophe ” and argues vigorously that curbing it is the most urgent moral challenge facing mankind .
Mr Lomborg demurs .
“ We need to realise that there are many inconvenient truths , ” he says .
But whether he and Mr Bolton can persuade the UN of this remains to be seen .
Mark Malloch Brown , the UN 's deputy secretary - general , said on June 6th that : “ there is currently a perception among many otherwise quite moderate countries that anything the US supports must have a secret agenda ... and therefore , put crudely , should be opposed without any real discussion of whether [ it makes ] sense or not . ”
I went down to Google for an important meeting today ( I can't say what it was about , but it involved someone whose name rhymes with eBay Kwuckles ) .
I was treated to a free lunch in the distributed cafeteria peer network during what was apparently a lousy - salad - demand traffic spike , was promised a free Google sporting vest , and generally had a curious time .
Since most people will never get to enjoy the sprawling Mountain View campus of this Internet behemoth , I documented the affair with top secret , clandestinely snapped photos .
Photograph No. 1 : Before the meeting .
You can't enter a building at Google without plowing into a shelf laden with free water bottles , fresh apples , " Flee , Radical ! " berry trail mix , and high - gluten " grubble muffins . "
After you recover from your spill and swat the last grubble muffin from your chest , a nearby stack of unused 38 " Dell flat panel monitors , upset by the commotion , works itself loose and washes over you .
Once you have extricated yourself from the cords and displays , you totter over to the receptionist , who discreetly zaps you in the eye with a retina scanner .
( In the photo above , you see one of my many water bottles , adorned with the lapel sticker that shot out of the guest registration machine the instant I 'd been " logged in . " )
While I waited for my host , I was invited to take as much as I wanted from the " hundred dollar bar " ( a large stack of hundred - dollar bills on a disused SGI tower ) .
I felt like it was some sort of test , and only took one .
Soon , it was time for my meeting .
Photograph No. 2 : After the meeting .
This is the enormous tent where the Google workers dance and play and hug each other in big Nerf chipmunk suits ( " Money ! Money ! MMMMONEYYYY ! " ) .
No ...actually , it 's where I had to park : the nearby lot of the Shoreline Amphitheatre .
The main Google campus only has twenty - three parking spots for its 4,500 employees ( whoops ) so they operate a pretty swift system of shuttles out of this lot .
Google Fun Fact : they have two guys manning the twenty - three convenient spots , whose sole job seems to be to sit under umbrellas , look thoughtful for a moment , and then tell you there 's more parking down the road .
Google Sadden - U Fact : Google 's fully - loaded Useless Parking Lot Attendant budget is , perhaps , three times the annual revenue of my company .

The elusive Google Security Prius ( license plate : DOINOU ? ) .
Both times I tried to photograph the Google Security Prius , events transpired against me .
The first time , it ducked behind a tree , and the second time , my windshield wipers underperformed and I panicked a little .
Later , while pulling out of the parking lot , I got the sense that it knew I had been taking pictures of it , and suddenly I found it pulled up alongside me .
I quickly snapped a photo while driving past and trying to keep my eyes on the road .
Upon returning home , I was stricken with fear when I saw that the driver of the Prius was Lost 's Benjamin Linus .
I 'm too scared to post the image here .

Another instance of bad car style at Google .
I got a haircut , shaved , and bought new shoes to go down there , and then they throw this in my face .
Alright .
Look --
I 'm a man .
I 'm a person .
I know how ugly it is to see some crap like this .
We all do .
I consider this image the proverbial " do n't let the door bump you on the ass on the way out " type of goodbye .
Do I even want to work with these people ?
Photographs Nos. 7 and 8 : Stuff I Listened
To on the Radio .
On the way home , XM Radio treated me to some old cuts I had n't heard in a while .
It made me feel better about the bad cars I had been subjected to on the way out , and the salad with the whole coriander seeds in it , and the guy on the parking shuttle who was so plump that when he sat down thirty - two pagers , cell phones , USB memory sticks , Blackberries , Wiis , Mag - Lites , and Spread 'm - Slather 'm mayonnaise knives popped off of his belt and clattered to the floor like so many dreams deferred .
In Closing
Thank you , Google , for the neat time and the roasted pork loin in Calvados cream sauce .
The macaroni salad was also decent .
I urge you to hold your apple - raisin bread puddings at a higher temperature , and also to inspect your salad team for the requisite qualifications and trade certificates .
I shall watch your future career with considerable interest .
A group of think tanks , lead by the Pew Charitable Trusts , found that for the first time , men in their 30s are earning less than their parents .
For the first time ever , this generation will not be more well - off financially than their parents .
What should we make of this new finding ?
Does this mean the American Dream is no longer attainable ?
Probably not .
Because this statistic is just a magnified section of a much larger picture — of the great generational shift taking place in America since Generation X became adults .
The shift is in the definition of the American Dream .
Our dream is about time , not money .
No generation wants to live with financial instability .
And we are no exception .
But finances alone do not define someone ’s American Dream .
Especially when our dream is about how we spend our time .
Those who are magnifying a different part of the picture of this generational shift will tell you that what defines it is the inability of corporate American to keep generation Y from quitting their jobs .
The best of Generation X and Y are slow to move into the work force and quick to leave it .
According to the department of labor , people in their 20s change jobs , on average , every two years .
And Generation X is shifting in and out of the workplace in order to spend more time with kids .
It ’s costing companies a lot of money , and they ’re paying millions of dollars a year in consulting fees to figure out how to decrease turnover .
There are many reasons for high turnover , but the most fundamental one is that baby boomers have set up a work place that uses financial bribes to get people to give up their time :
Work sixty hours a week and we ’ll pay you six figures .
Generation Y will not have this .
To hold out money as a carrot is insulting to a generation raised to think personal development is the holy grail of time spent well .
Baby boomers are also baffled by women who grow large careers in their 20s and then dump them in order to spend time with kids .
Newsflash : Generation X values their family more than their money .
Our American Dream is not about buying a big house , our dream is about keeping a family together .
You can tell a lot about values by the terms that are coined .
When baby boomers were raising kids they invented the term latchkey kid and yuppie we invented the terms shared care and stay - at - home - dad .
The divorce rate for baby boomers was higher than any other generation .
We can afford to have less money because most of us do n’t need to fund two separate households .
The positive psychology movement has taken a large hold among those in generation X and Y .
We are convinced that money does not buy happiness , and this conviction is rooted in hard science .
More than 150 universities offer courses in positive psychology .
It ’s the most popular class among Harvard undergrads .
Our dreams are tied to time .
So it ’s no surprise that many of the most popular blogs offer tips for time management .
And topics like productivity are favorites among hipsters who know that “ getting things done ” ( GTD in blog - speak ) is the key to having a fulfilling life .
And believe me , GTD does n’t take money , it takes massive respect for one ’s time .
The new American dream is that we will have fulfilling work that leaves plenty of time for the other things in life we love .
In this respect , Generation X is doing better than our parents :
We are spending more time with our kids , and we are keeping our marriages together more than twice as effectively as our parents did .
And Generation Y is doing better than their parents , too :
They refuse to waste their time on meaningless entry level work because they value their time and their ability to grow more than that .
The new American dream is about time .
It ’s not a race to earn the most to buy the biggest .
It ’s a dream of personal growth and quality relationships .
And , despite the declarations coming from Pew about unreachable dreams , our dream is not about accumulating money to do what we love at the end .
We are hell - bent on doing what we love the whole way .
That ’s our dream , and we ’re doing it better than the baby boomers ever did .
" I wish I were a rat , " Frank Garofolo , a 56 - year - old investment banker in Boston , said recently .
Garofolo has diabetes , as do his mother , father , and brother ; his sister died of it .
He had just been told about an experiment at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City in which a plump lab rat lost more than half its intra-abdominal fat when it was exposed to a drug - and - light therapy usually used to kill tumors .
A couple of years earlier , Garofolo had submitted to experimental surgery himself at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston , during which a surgeon pulled chunks of ivory - colored fat out through small openings in his belly .
Although the loss of 4 ½ pounds of intra-abdominal fat allowed Garofolo to go from a tight size 44 belt to a loose one , it did n't have the effect he so fervently desired — boosting his insulin sensitivity and lessening the severity of his diabetes — leaving him desperate enough to envy a rat .
More than fat anywhere else in the body — even more than overall obesity — intra- abdominal , or visceral , fat is associated with pernicious health effects in humans .
A major effect is reduced sensitivity to insulin , the hormone that helps glucose enter the body 's cells .
Biologists lump visceral obesity ( having a large midsection ) with a cluster of other more obvious physiological abnormalities — high triglycerides , high blood pressure , high fasting blood sugar , and low HDLs ( high - density lipoproteins , the so - called good cholesterol ) — under the umbrella term metabolic syndrome ; people with this condition are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes .
Studies have shown visceral obesity to be a risk factor on its own as well , a strong predictor of , among other things , heart attacks in young men , chronic heart failure in older people , high blood pressure in Japanese Americans , heart attacks in " well functioning " elderly women , and — the clincher , the coup de grease , if you will — of " all - cause mortality " in men .
Having an excess of visceral fat has also been implicated in the development of Alzheimer 's disease , colon cancer , gallstones , ovarian cystic disease , breast cancer , and sleep apnea .
" Visceral obesity , " declares Philipp Scherer , a professor of cell biology and medicine at Albert Einstein and an expert on fat , " does seem to be truly evil . "
Yet most people have never even heard of visceral fat .
A survey released last year by the World Heart Federation concluded that most Americans are unaware that visceral fat is a leading risk factor for heart disease — even though , by one estimate , almost 46 percent of adult Americans have an excess of it .
Moreover , the majority of physicians do not regularly check their patients ' girth , which is the primary indicator of visceral obesity .
" We are where cholesterol was in 1970 or blood pressure was in 1960 , " says obesity researcher Steven Smith of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge .
Visceral fat lies deep inside the abdomen , surrounding vital organs like the liver , heart , intestines , and kidneys , as well as hanging , in a separate double flap , off the ends of the stomach like an apron .
In lean people , the flap , known as the omentum , is thin enough to be seen through ( by someone in a position to have a look , that is ) .
In obese people it may be inches thick , fused , and " hard like cake , " according to Edward Mun , now director of bariatric surgery at Faulkner Hospital in Boston ; he is the surgeon who removed part of Garofolo 's omentum .
Packed around the organs is another type of visceral fat , called mesenteric .
The abdominal region harbors still another kind of fat , which lies outside the abdominal wall , just under the skin .
This subcutaneous , or peripheral , fat tends to be soft and flabby ; you can pinch or grab it .
It has two compartments , the deeper of which is thought , like visceral fat , to have negative effects on health .
The superficial layer may cause cosmetic distress in women who get a buildup of it as they age , but from a medical perspective it is considered benign .
Subcutaneous fat also appears outside the abdominal area , on the lower body — the hips , buttocks , and upper thighs .
There it is not only benign but actually beneficial .
" Peripheral fat is , in reality , good fat , " explains Osama Hamdy , director of the obesity clinic at the Joslin Diabetic Center .
Before menopause , women tend to have more good fat than men do .
One interpretation holds that , through most of human evolution , visceral fat was useful for short - term storage — it accumulates quickly and is released quickly — for the benefit of male hunters who needed quick access to energy .
Subcutaneous fat , in contrast , was meant for long - term energy storage , for the benefit of the ( often female ) gatherers who had to wait a long time between meals .
Subcutaneous fat is less active metabolically than visceral fat .
" It 's like a big bucket , " Smith says .
" It locks the fat in . "
Put another way , it keeps accepting excess caloric energy that might otherwise end up in the abdomen .
Jean - Pierre Després , director of research in cardiology at the Laval Hospital Research Center in Quebec City , calls subcutaneous fat " an expandable metabolic sink . "
Compared with women , men not only have " a smaller gluteofemoral [ butt - thigh ] bucket , " notes Smith , but they also have twice as much visceral fat , the stereotypical beer belly .
( Approaching menopause , women start to catch up . )
The belly may feel hard to the touch instead of soft , the visceral fat pushing up against the muscles of the abdominal wall .
Health profiles reflect this sexual dimorphism :
Men tend to be less insulin sensitive than women .
One of the first to make this link was Jean Vague , a professor on the faculty of medicine at the University of Marseille .
In 1956 he recognized this male - pattern obesity — also called android obesity — and observed that it leads to " metabolic disturbances , " including diabetes .
Vague was far ahead of his time .
" Obesity was n't a big deal in the ' 50s , " Smith says .
" We were dealing with polio . "
Nowadays a person with android obesity would be called an " apple , " while a person with gynoid obesity ( " with lower - body predominance , " Vague wrote ) would be a " pear . "
As anyone who has read a fitness magazine knows , apples are bad , pears are good .
Story Highlights • Group analyzed millions of records obtained from immigration courts
• 12 of 814,073 charged in past three years faced terrorism charges
• Report also found DHS filed very few " national security " charges
• DHS spokesman calls report " ill- conceived "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Claims of terrorism represented less than 0.01 percent of charges filed in recent years in immigration courts by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security , according to a report issued Sunday by an independent research group .
This comes despite the fact the Bush administration has repeatedly asserted that fighting terrorism is the central mission of DHS .
The Transactional Records Action Clearinghouse said it analyzed millions of previously undisclosed records obtained from the immigration courts under the Freedom of Information Act .
Of the 814,073 people charged by DHS in immigration courts during the past three years , 12 faced charges of terrorism , TRAC said .
Those 12 cases represent 0.0015 percent of the total number of cases filed .
" The DHS claims it is focused on terrorism .
Well that 's just not true , " said David Burnham , a TRAC spokesman .
" Either there 's no terrorism , or they 're terrible at catching them .
Either way it 's bad for all of us . "
The TRAC analysis also found that DHS filed a minuscule number of what are called " national security " charges against people in the immigration courts .
The report stated that 114 , or 0.014 percent of the total of roughly 800,000 individuals charged were charged with national security violations .
TRAC reported more than 85 percent of the charges involved more common immigration violations such as not having a valid immigrant visa , overstaying a student visa or entering the United States without an inspection .
According to the report by TRAC , which is affiliated with Syracuse University , the results show that there is an " apparent gap between DHS rhetoric about its role in fighting terrorism and what it actually has been doing . "
DHS spokesman Russ Knocke called the TRAC report " ill - conceived " and said the group " lacked a grasp of the DHS mission . "
Knocke said that , by clamping down on all forms of immigration , DHS has made it difficult for terrorists to come to the United States .
What is the elephant in all our rooms ?
It is the global triumph of capitalism .
Democracy is fiercely disputed .
Freedom is under threat even in old - established democracies such as Britain .
Western supremacy is on the skids .
But everyone does capitalism .
Americans and Europeans do it .
Indians do it .
Russian oligarchs and Saudi princes do it .
Even Chinese communists do it .
And now the members of Israel 's oldest kibbutz , that last best hope of egalitarian socialism , have voted to introduce variable salaries based on individual performance .
Karl Marx would be turning in his grave .
Or perhaps not , since some of his writings eerily foreshadowed our era of globalised capitalism .
His prescription failed but his description was prescient .
Here is the great fact about the early 21st century , so big and taken for granted that we rarely stop to think how extraordinary it is .
It was not ever thus .
" Can capitalism survive ? " asked the British socialist thinker GDH Cole , in a book published in 1938 under the title Socialism in Evolution .
His answer was no .
Socialism would succeed it .
Most readers of this newspaper in 1938 would probably have agreed .
What are the big ideological alternatives being proposed today ?
Hugo Chávez 's " 21st century socialism " still looks like a local or at most a regional phenomenon , best practised in oil - rich states .
Islamism , sometimes billed as democratic capitalism 's great competitor in a new ideological struggle , does not offer an alternative economic system ( aside from the peculiarities of Islamic finance ) and anyway does not appeal beyond the Muslim umma .
Most anti-globalists , altermondialistes and , indeed , green activists , are much better at pointing out the failings of global capitalism than they are at suggesting systemic alternatives .
" Capitalism should be replaced by something nicer , " read a placard at a May Day demonstration in London a few years back .
Of course there 's a problem of definition here .
Is what Russian or Chinese state - owned companies do really capitalism ?
Is n't private ownership the essence of capitalism ?
One of America 's leading academic experts on capitalism , Edmund Phelps of Columbia University , has an even more restrictive definition .
For him , what we have in much of continental Europe , with multiple stakeholders , is not capitalism but corporatism .
Capitalism , he says , is " an economic system in which private capital is relatively free to innovate and invest without permission from the state , green lights from communities and regions , from workers , and other so - called social partners " .
In which case most of the world is not capitalist .
I find this much too restrictive .
Surely what we have across Europe are multiple varieties of capitalism , from more liberal market economies like Britain and Ireland to more coordinated stakeholder economies like Germany and Austria .
In Russia and China , there 's a spectrum from state to private ownership .
Other considerations than maximising profit play a large part in the decision - making of state - controlled companies , but they too operate as players in national and international markets and increasingly they also speak the language of global capitalism .
At this year 's World Economic Forum in Davos , I heard Gazprom 's Alexander Medvedev defend the company 's record by saying that it is one of the world 's top five in market capitalisation and constantly looking for value for its shareholders - who happen to include the Russian state .
At the very least , this suggests a hegemony of the discourse of global capitalism .
China 's " Leninist capitalism " is a very big borderline case , but the crab - like movement of its companies towards what we would recognise as more rather than less capitalist behaviour is far clearer than any movement of its state towards democracy .
Does this lack of any clear ideological alternative mean that capitalism is secure for years to come ?
Far from it .
With the unprecedented triumph of globalised capitalism over the last two decades come new threats to its own future .
They are not precisely the famous " contradictions " that Marx identified , but they may be even bigger .
For a start , the history of capitalism over the last hundred years hardly supports the view that it is an automatically self - correcting system .
As George Soros ( who should know ) points out , global markets are now more than ever constantly out of equilibrium - and teetering on the edge of a larger disequilibrium .
Again and again , it has needed the visible hands of political , fiscal and legal correction to complement the invisible hand of the market .
The bigger it gets , the harder it can fall .
An oil tanker is more stable than a sailing dinghy , but if the tanker 's internal bulkheads are breached and the oil starts swilling from side to side in a storm , you have the makings of a major disaster .
Increasingly , the world 's capital is like oil in the hold of one giant tanker , with ever fewer internal bulkheads to stop it swilling around .
Then there is inequality .
One feature of globalised capitalism seems to be that it rewards its high performers disproportionately , not just in the City of London but also in Shanghai , Moscow and Mumbai .
What will be the political effects of having a small group of super - rich people in countries where the majority are still super - poor ?
In more developed economies , such as Britain and America , a reasonably well - off middle - class with a slowly improving personal standard of living may be less bothered by a small group of the super - rich - whose antics also provide them with a regular diet of tabloid - style entertainment .
But if a lot of middle - class people begin to feel they are personally losing out to the same process of globalisation that is making those few fund managers stinking rich , while at the same time outsourcing their own middle - class jobs to India , then you may have a backlash .
Watch Lou Dobbs on CNN for a taste of the populist and protectionist rhetoric to come .
Above all , though , there is the inescapable dilemma that this planet cannot sustain six - and - a- half billion people living like today 's middle - class consumers in its rich north .
In just a few decades , we would use up the fossil fuels that took some 400 million years to accrete - and change the earth 's climate as a result .
Sustainability may be a grey and boring word , but it is the biggest single challenge to global capitalism today .
However ingenious modern capitalists are at finding alternative technologies - and they will be very ingenious - somewhere down the line this is going to mean richer consumers settling for less rather than more .
Marx thought capitalism would have a problem finding consumers for the goods that improving techniques of production enabled it to churn out .
Instead , it has become expert in a new branch of manufacturing : the manufacture of desires .
The genius of contemporary capitalism is not simply that it gives consumers what they want but that it makes them want what it has to give .
It 's that core logic of ever - expanding desires that is unsustainable on a global scale .
But are we prepared to abandon it ?
We may be happy to insulate our lofts , recycle our newspapers and cycle to work , but are we ready to settle for less so others can have more ?
Am I ? Are you ?

Judged by the height of the doorframes he built , medieval man was assumed to be vertically challenged .
But after examining the bones of those who lived in the Middle Ages , scientists have discovered a much bigger truth .
Evidence gathered from 3,000 skeletons reveals that human height has varied little over the past 1,000 years .
From the 10th century through to the 19th , the
average height of adult men was 5ft 7in or 170cm
- just 2in below today 's average .
Women were an average of 5ft 2in or 158 cm - just over an inch shorter than today .
All the bones in the study came from the medieval St Peter 's Church in Barton upon Humber , North East Lincolnshire .
English Heritage senior curator Kevin Booth said the £ 2 million project provided a " snapshot of England over the last 1,000 years " .
" This is a classic English parish church , it 's
a microcosm of what you get across the country , " he said .
Researchers from Bristol Royal Infirmary studied every skeleton in an attempt to identify its sex , age and size and analysed bones for evidence of disease , injury , and diet .
Sebastian Payne , chief scientist for English Heritage , said evidence from the remains and those from other cemeteries showed the heights of adults has remained " very stable " across the centuries .
" The idea that people were dwarflike is just not true , " he said .
" The perception comes partly from buildings having low doorways and partly from things like small bits of armour .
" The reason why you get small pieces of armour is they are the ones made for rich small kids which did n't get heavily used and so survived .
" Small doorways are more to do with heating efficiency than anything else . "
Some differences did emerge in the Barton bones when scientists examined the skeletons of children .
Ten - year - olds measured on average 18 cm or 7in shorter than today .
Puberty was delayed beyond 15 and they continued to grow later than today 's teenagers .
As well as being of similar height , our predecessors suffered similar physical ailments to ours today , such as back and joint problems .
Researchers were astonished that only two skeletons had evidence of tuberculosis and there were just four cases of polio .
Among the earliest remains is the skeleton of a man aged around 50 , probably born during the reign of King Canute ( 1016 - 1035 ) .
He lived during the Norman Conquest of 1066 and the subsequent " Harrying of the North " by William the Conqueror .
At 5ft 2in , he was short by the standards of his day , but had strong shoulder muscles .
His remains survived because he was buried in an oak coffin in unusual ground conditions which aided preservation .
Many of these findings form part of an exhibition , Buried Lives , which opens tomorrow at the restored medieval church .
The Tyranny of Email Saturday , 03/08/03 11:41 AM
In a hurry ?
Then please see the rules for avoiding email tyranny and the guidelines for being productive .
Email is one of the greatest things the computer revolution has done for personal productivity .
Used improperly , it can also hurt your productivity .
This article discusses ways to use email effectively .
Then it goes beyond that and talks about how to be productive , period .
When Email Goes Bad I 'm not going to list all the reasons email is good .
You know them already , I assume you are an avid email user .
( Anyone reading this is online , and just about anyone who goes online uses email . )
I 'm also not going to tell you email is evil , because it is n't .
The negative productivity impact of email comes from the way you use it , not the medium itself .
There are two ways email impairs your productivity :
It breaks your concentration .
It misleads you into inefficient problem solving .
Let 's take the concentration impact first .
I 'm a software engineer , and programming requires extended periods of concentration .
Actually this is n't unique to programming , a lot of fields require that you concentrate .
( Probably just about everything worth doing requires some concentration ! ) {
I maintain that programming cannot be done in less than three - hour windows .
It takes three hours to spin up to speed , gather your concentration , shift into " right brain mode " , and really focus on a problem .
Effective programmers organize their day to have at least one three - hour window , and hopefully two or three .
( This is why good programmers often work late at night .
They do n't get interrupted as much ... )
} One of the key attributes of email is that it queues messages .
Unlike face - to - face conversation and ' phone calls , people can communicate via email without both paying attention at the same time .
You pick the moments at which you pay attention to email .
But many people leave their email client running continuously .
This is the biggest baddest reason why email hurts your productivity .
If you leave your email client running , it means anyone anytime can interrupt what you 're doing .
Essentially they pick the moments at which you pay attention .
( Even some random spammer who is sending you a crappy ad for a get - rich scheme . )
This is bad .
There are three stages to this badness .
Stage one is configuring your email client to present alerts when you receive an email .
Do n't do this .
Stage two is configuring your email client to make noise when you receive an email .
Do n't do this .
Stage three is running your email client all the time .
Do n't do this , either .
To be effective , you must pick the moments at which you 're going to receive email .
I know this goes against common wisdom .
Just about everyone I know runs their client all the time , has it configured to make noise , and may even have it present alerts when an email is received .
Do n't do it .
Spam is the best kind of email to get , because you look at it quickly , see that it 's spam , and delete it .
Then you get back to work .
Personal email is the second best kind of email to get , because you either respond quickly ( " Hi Jane , great hearing from you .
See you at the club tonight . " ) or set it aside for later .
Task - oriented work email is the worst kind of email to get .
It often requires thought , and because it is work there is some immediacy to it .
But as soon as you take the time to respond , you 've interrupted yourself .
You 've shifted back to " left brain mode " , and you 've lost the thread of your concentration .
This does n't mean you should n't respond to emails promptly .
Check email whenever you 're interrupted anyway - before you start work , after a meeting , after lunch , before you go home , etc .
Set aside time to do this .
Just do n't let others dictate the timing .
Has this ever happened to you ? [
In the hallway at work ... ]
O : " Hi R , how 's it going ? "
R : " Great , how are you ? "
O : " Good .
Hey , did you see my email about the framitz ? "
R : " No , I have n't checked my email yet today , sorry . "
O : " WHAT ! "
It has happened to me .
Sometimes I can't believe it - I sent the email at 9:30 , and here it is 11:30 , and they have n't checked their email ?
What are they doing ?
They 're being efficient , that 's what .
They 're picking their moment to be interrupted , and that 's a good thing .
We 'll revisit this theme again below in the Three Hour Rule .
For now , here 's the takeaway : Turn your email client off .
You should pick the moment at which you 'll be interrupted .
Okay , now let 's look at the second productivity - sapping attribute of email , that it misleads you into inefficient problem solving .
Email is a communication medium .
You send messages to others , you receive messages from others .
Some of these messages are mere data transmission - FYIs so you know what 's going on .
Some are " noise " - ' thank you 's , ' I got it 's , jokes , etc .
And some - many - are problem solving .
You hear about a problem , and you respond with a possible solution , or a possible approach , or more questions .
Nothing wrong so far - email is a good medium for problem solving .
And it is so easy - you get an email , you think ( sometimes ) , and you respond .
Poof , you 're done .
Except when you 're not .
Because there are some kinds of problems which do n't get solved in email , ever .
And as soon as you have that kind of problem , you have to stop , immediately , before you make the problem worse .
First , never , ever , criticize someone in email .
For reasons which I have never fully grasped , any negative emotion is always amplified by communication through email .
Sometimes you intend to be critical - someone has done something dumb , or said something silly , or emailed something ridiculous .
Resist the urge to reply .
Sometimes you do n't mean to be critical - you 're just making an observation , or engaging in technical debate , or adding facts to a discussion .
But as soon as you sense that the recipient has taken your email as criticism , you must immediately switch media - a face - to - face meeting is best , but a ' phone call is also okay .
Second , do n't get into prolonged technical debates in email .
I 've seen threads lasting weeks with a whole series of kibitzers , with everyone restating their points of view and nothing getting settled .
Often email has the effect of polarizing the debate , and the combatants end up further apart in their views than when the debate began .
As soon as you sense this happening , you must immediately switch media .
A meeting with the core people involved is best , but a conference call is also okay .
Both of these kinds of problems which do n't get solved in email are exacerbated by copying others .
The bigger the audience , the worse things get .
As bad as it is to be critical in email , it is far worse if ten colleagues are copied .
Often the presence of an email audience is what makes for the polarization of technical debates - if the core people were the only ones involved , they would be less virulent and more willing to acknowledge other points of view and seek compromise .
Okay , so here 's the takeaway : Never criticize anyone in email , and avoid technical debates .
Use face - to - face meetings or ' phone calls instead .
Before I go on to talking about productivity in general , let me share some other thoughts about email .
First , be judicious in who you send email to , and who you copy on emails .
Every email recipient is going to lose a little time reading each email you send .
Simple emails which say " thanks " or " got it " or " see you at the meeting " are polite and part of normal human communication .
But there is a limit , no need to reply " you 're welcome " , or " glad you got it " , or " great , I 'll see you , too " .
In my career I 've run large teams , and sometimes people in those teams copied me on virtually every email they sent .
Maybe they wanted me to know what was going on , or maybe they were letting me know what a great job they were doing .
Either way , they were taking my time with stuff I did n't need to spend time on .
I have a high capacity for skimming email , but there is always the feeling that they did n't get it ; like " why did they copy me on this ? "
There should be a purpose to every addressee on each email .
It is okay to drop recipients from a reply - in fact , it is good ; less people are involved , and [ to reiterate the point ] the bigger the audience , the more any implied criticism or debate will be exacerbated . {
I have to digress for a pet peeve .
I send an email to S , and S replies , copying eight other people .
I reply back to S alone .
S replies , again copying eight other people .
This is bad .
If I 'm smart I will abandon email and continue the conversation with S face - to - face or over the ' phone .
If I 'm not smart I 'll flame S so badly his hair catches fire , copying everyone , and regret it later .
} Second , email is a very relaxed medium , but observing some formality is important .
Use an email client which spell checks .
Use normal capitalization .
Use correct grammar - complete sentences make email easier to read just like everything else .
Do n't use weird background colors and strange fonts .
Do n't append pictures of your dog .
You get the picture ...
I 've received emails from senior people which bordered on illiterate , with incorrect capitalization , grammar , incomplete sentences , etc .
The impression is not positive .
Third , email can be immediate , but do n't hesitate to review and revise important emails .
In many companies email has all but replaced paper memos .
In many business situations email has replaced letters .
When writing an email which has a wide distribution , or which affects a negotiation , or possible deal , or potential sale , take the time to write a draft , and reread it later .
You can almost always improve the wording , make a point more concisely , or otherwise improve the communication .
Finally , remember that email is a public and permanent record .
Email is plain text and goes out over public networks , and is often stored on servers for a long time and may be backed up for a longer time .
It might feel " throwaway " at the time , but it will not be thrown away , as senior executives at Microsoft , Enron , Worldcom , and others have discovered .
If you have something to say which wo n't bear the public light of day , it should n't be said in email .
And if you are sending something confidential or sensitive , consider sending it as an encrypted and / or password - protected attachment .
Okay , enough about email .
Here 's the six rules for avoiding email tyranny :
Turn your email client off .
Pick the moment at which you 'll be interrupted .
Never criticize anyone in email , and avoid technical debates .
Use face - to - face meetings or ' phone calls instead .
Be judicious in who you send email to , and who you copy on emails .
Observing some formality is important .
Do n't hesitate to review and revise important emails .
Remember that email is a public and permanent record .
Got it ?
Cool .
Thinking about email productivity led me to make some comments about productivity in general ...
The Three Hour Rule Programming is a right - brain activity .
It is very conceptual and spatial and [ gasp ! ] artistic .
Effective programming requires that you transition from your body 's normal " left brain " mode into a " right brain " zone .
As I mentioned above , programming cannot be done in less than three - hour windows .
Really .
And in talking to friends in other fields , I 'm convinced this applies to many other lines of work .
When you 're in a three - hour zone , you 've spun up to speed , gathered your concentration , shifted into " right brain mode " , and are focusing on a problem .
You 're being productive .
There are four things which can interrupt you , and you have to watch out for all of them : Receiving email or ' phone calls .
Personal contact with colleagues .
Meetings .
Warp - offs .
Let 's talk about each of these ...
First , emails or ' phone calls .
Email we 've talked about , this one is easy - just turn your email client off .
Done .
Most people receive far less ' phone calls than emails , so calls are n't nearly as much of a problem .
The solution is the same - put your phone in " do not disturb " mode .
Nowadays most everyone has a cell ' phone , leave that on , and if there is a genuine emergency your significant other or doctor or whomever will reach you there .
Most calls to your desk are colleagues or customers ; these are important , but as with email , you should pick the time to take them .
Second , there is personal contact with colleagues .
Most companies these days can't afford for everyone to have a private office , so it is pretty easy to get interrupted .
( If you have an office , close the door ! )
Distractions include ambient noise , questions ( " Hey , do you know how to invoke a framitz ? " ) , and other interruptions ( " Hey , you want to play foosball ? " ) .
These are really important ( especially foosball ) , but they are interruptions , and they will mess up your three - hour window .
Basically you want to isolate yourself from your colleagues , just like with email and ' phone calls .
To deal with ambient noise , get yourself some really good headphones and play music .
Cordless , if you want .
For $ 100 you will have the best - sounding music you can imagine , and a sure - fire way to eliminate background noise . {
The " office vs. cubicle " debate rages and has not been settled .
Some companies give every engineer their own office , and claim the productivity improvement is worth the cost .
Others feel the atmosphere is better in a cubicle farm , and the interaction between engineers leads to better problem solving .
Without taking a stand in this debate , the fact is that most engineers work in cubicles , and have little control over this .
So it is what it is - you have to make the best of it .
In 2000 I joined PayPal , a dot - com with an egalitarian work environment where everyone had a cubicle , even the CEO .
After many years of enjoying a private office , I was back in a cube .
I quickly found two things to be essential , first , I positioned my desk and computer so I was not distracted by traffic ( away from the cube opening ) , and second , I bought a great pair of cordless headphones .
With these adaptations I was able to work just as productively as I had in an office .
( Of course I used conference rooms for meetings . )
} Dealing with questions and interruptions from colleagues is more difficult .
The give - and - take between engineers in a team is important ; often one person will have the answer to another 's dilemma .
There is also the social aspect , it is enjoyable to interact with your colleagues .
However , you need to have those three - hour windows .
I recommend a simple sign you can hang on your cube : " I 'm in a zone " , " Do not disturb " , etc .
( This is a chance to be creative ... )
Essentially you want your colleagues to know you 're zoning .
If they have a technical question which can wait , they can put it in email , or wait until you emerge .
If they need immediate attention ( " hey , you want to play foosball ? " ) at least they know you were in a zone , and that they 're interrupting you .
Third , meetings ...
Ah yes .
An entire book can be written about meetings , and many have .
Let me make a few comments about meetings and then leave it .
Meetings interrupt everyone who attends , obviously , so they are " expensive " .
They are also often the best way to communicate team status and to problem - solve .
So there is tremendous leverage in having good meetings instead of bad ones .
Each meeting should have a well - defined purpose , and the organizer should keep the meeting on track .
It is good to have meetings " first thing " , bordering on lunch , or at the end of the day ; this way people 's three - hour windows are less affected .
Enough about meetings ... they are what they are .
Finally , warp - offs .
So , what 's a " warp - off " ?
Well , unlike the other three kinds of interruptions , in which other people interrupt you , a " warp - off " is when you interrupt yourself .
Generally this happens because you 're stuck - you do n't know what to do next - so you switch tasks and do something you know how to do .
My favorite warp - off is surfing the Internet .
Sometimes when I 'm working on a tough problem , I have to force myself not to do it .
Other possible warps include : reading email (! ) , working on " fun " stuff instead of " hard " stuff , bugging your colleagues ( " foosball , anyone ? " ) , and of course posting to your ' blog :)
Keeping yourself from warping off is really tough , and gets into what motivates people and a bunch of stuff I can't really tackle here , but the main thing is to be self - aware enough to realize that you do it ( everyone does ) , and strong enough to work on not doing it .
I tend to warp when I 'm stuck , so the best un - warp strategies for me are ways to un -stuck myself .
These include talking to others , taking a bike ride , thinking out of the box ( generally above the box - take a bigger picture view ) , trying to simplify the problem , and relentless application of W=UH ( " if something it is too ugly or too hard , it is wrong " ) . {
In re : working on " fun " stuff instead of " hard " stuff , it is interesting to think about what makes some tasks fun and others hard .
I think happiness comes from liking yourself , and fun things are things which make you like yourself .
Tasks which are fun are therefore tasks which you know how to do , and which demonstrate your proficiency .
Tasks which are hard are tasks which you do n't know how to do , or which reveal a lack of expertise .
There is often feedback involved - fun tasks will gain you recognition from customers or coworkers , but hard tasks may not .
When you get stuck and find yourself doing something " fun " instead of something " hard " , ask yourself what makes the hard thing hard ?
In a perfect world each person would always be assigned tasks which they 're good at , and which gain them recognition , so that everything they do is fun .
The world is n't perfect , but that 's the goal .
} Okay , that 's a lot of words , let 's see if we can summarize .
There is essentially one big rule and four guidelines : Big Rule :
It takes three hours to get anything done .
Guidelines :
Turn off your email client , put your ' phone in " do not disturb " .
Isolate yourself .
Get good headphones .
Warn colleagues when you 're " in the zone " , to minimize their interrupts .
Minimize meetings and schedule them to avoid three - hour windows .
Become self - aware about warping off and try to un -stuck yourself .
That 's it - thanks for your attention .
If you have comments about any of this , I 'd love to hear them ; please shoot me an email .
Do n't worry , it wo n't interrupt me :) [ Later - this article generated a terrific response - thank you ! - and I have summarized the most interesting observations and comments as Tyranny Revisited ... ]

Bush ' surge ' crafted by aide who wanted to nuke North Korea in 1995
RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday January 9 , 2007 Print This Email This Print page sponsored by Velvet Revolution .
President Bush 's new strategy for Iraq was crafted by a little known aide who is a strong advocate of escalating the troops and who alarmed Democrats over a decade ago when he proposed attacking North Korea with nuclear weapons to stop its nuclear programme , the Wall Street Journal reports .
" When President Bush addresses the nation tomorrow night , the strategies he offers for Iraq will represent months of work by J.D. Crouch , an academic turned deputy national security adviser , " Yochi J. Dreazen writes .
" Diplomacy in Pyongyang without military power is appeasement plain and simple , " Crouch wrote in 1995 .
Then , in May of 2005 , after becoming Bush 's new deputy national security adviser , Crouch found himself " in a position to do something about it ... but the solutions of Crouch 's youth in academia look more complicated from the seat of power , " The Washington Post reported .
Excerpts from WSJ article : # Mr. Crouch , who once led graduate students on hikes , now aims to chart a new path to stabilize Iraq .
He will see his belief in American military power reflected in the president 's expected call to send tens of thousands of additional U.S. combat personnel to Iraq .
The 48 - year - old volunteer sheriff has been an advocate of the so - called surge of new troops to Iraq , administration officials said .
In addition to the call for new troops , aides said tomorrow Mr. Bush also will seek a U.S. - funded effort to spur job creation and economic growth in Iraq .

The Democrats expressed alarm over an academic article he wrote in 1995 that called for dispatching more troops to South Korea , redeploying American tactical nuclear weapons to the country , and bombing North Korea if Pyongyang refused to abandon its nuclear program .
Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan , the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee , described Mr. Crouch 's North Korea proposals as " reckless . "
Mr. Van Cleave said the portrait painted by Democrats at the hearing was unfair .
" J.D. has principles about national security :
He recognizes that arms - control agreements have n't always worked well , that American strength depends on our military power , and that there are times when we need to use the military , " Mr. Van Cleave said .
" But those are n't ' radical ' positions .
The only thing he 's fanatical about is USC football . "

Andy Greenberg wrote an article for Forbes entitled “ Condemned To Google Hell ” about supplemental results .
I was getting ready to go on vacation , so I did n’t have a chance to talk to Andy , and now I wish that I had .
It ’s easy to read the article and come away with the impression that Google ’s supplemental results are some sort of search engine dungeon where bad pages go and sit in limbo forever , and that ’s just not true .
I did some quick searching , and this post from January includes a pretty good rebuttal of the “ you get into supplemental results for spamming or duplicate content , and then your pages stay there for a long time ” idea .
I ’ll quote the most relevant paragraph :
As a reminder , supplemental results are n’t something to be afraid of ; I ’ve got pages from my site in the supplemental results , for example .
A complete software rewrite of the infrastructure for supplemental results launched in Summer o’ 2005 , and the supplemental results continue to get fresher .
Having urls in the supplemental results does n’t mean that you have some sort of penalty at all ; the main determinant of whether a url is in our main web index or in the supplemental index is PageRank .
If you used to have pages in our main web index and now they ’re in the supplemental results , a good hypothesis is that we might not be counting links to your pages with the same weight as we have in the past .
The approach I ’d recommend in that case is to use solid white - hat SEO to get high - quality links ( e.g. editorially given by other sites on the basis of merit ) .
That statement still holds .
It ’s perfectly normal for a website to have pages in our main web index and our supplemental index .
If a page does n’t have enough PageRank to be included in our main web index , the supplemental results represent an additional chance for users to find that page , as opposed to Google not indexing the page .
Okay , so that ’s the general advice I ’d highlight .
It can also be the case that links that used to carry more weight for a website might not be counting as much .
Let ’s see if we can find an example of that in the article .
Here ’s a quote :
MySolitaire.com , another online diamond business , spent January to June of 2006 in the supplemental index .
Amit Jhalani , the site ’s vice president of search marketing , says he figures that cost his business $ 250,000 in sales , and he says he still does n’t know why the site ’s pages got Google ’s thumbs - down .
“ So many of the rules are vague , ” Jhalani says .
But he admits that he tried gray - area tactics like buying links from more established sites to juice his traffic .
Okay , so the VP of SEM for this site mentions that they tried buying links ; maybe those links started to count for less .
I decided to check into mysolitaire.com and see if I could find any other links that might have started counting for less .
I did find a spam report where someone forwarded an email that appeared to be from mysolitaire.com :

A quick Google search finds similar emails that were sent to mailing lists .
Reciprocal links by themselves are n’t automatically bad , but we ’ve communicated before that there is such a thing as excessive reciprocal linking .
Note that the email above does n’t say that they have less than 50 outgoing links ; nope , it says “ Currently , we have less than 50 outgoing links in each category . ”
I checked out http://www.mysolitaire.com/resources/
and by my count saw 329 different categories offered for link exchanging :
I know a lot about SEO , so I decided to check out the “ Search Engine Optimization ” category .
This was the first entry I saw :
Now I did n’t click through to check out that site ; it could be the best SEO site in the world .
But the entry does n’t give great experience for users ; heck , it ’s not even a complete sentence .
And it did n’t look really relevant for users for a diamond ring site to exchange links like this in potentially up to 329 different categories .
As Google changes algorithms over time , excessive reciprocal links will probably carry less weight .
That could also account for a site having more pages in supplemental results if excessive reciprocal links ( or other link - building techniques ) begin to be counted less .
As I said in January : “ The approach I ’d recommend in that case is to use solid white - hat SEO to get high - quality links ( e.g. editorially given by other sites on the basis of merit ) . ”
I thought Andy Beal had an interesting take on the Forbes piece as well .
Top Ten Psychology Studies
Ten studies that have changed psychology and the way we see humanity .
After being told about these psychology studies , generations of psychology students have wandered out into the world seeing themselves and other people in a new light .
In this series of posts I look at ten studies that have changed psychology and the way we see humanity :
“ What do babies understand about the world and how can you possibly find out , given that babies are not so hot on answering complex questions about their perceptual abilities ? ”
“ It ’s not just Miller who was persecuted by this number though , it ’s all of us .
What this magical number represents – 7 plus or minus 2 – is the number of items we can hold in our short - term memory . ”
“ It seems incredible that a successful form of psychological therapy could be based on telling people their thoughts are mistaken .
And yet that is partly how cognitive therapy works . ”
“ Imagine it ’s the 1960s and you ’re a first year psychology student at the University of Minnesota .
Being a brave soul , along with wanting a better final grade , you ’ve agreed to take part in a psychology experiment .
You ’ve heard that it involves testing a new vitamin injection but that has n’t put you off . ”
“ It was Fechner who , with the publication of his masterwork Elements of Psychophysics in 1860 , is often credited with helping to found experimental psychology ( Fechner , 1860 ) .
Strange , really , for a man who set out to prove plants have souls . ”
“ What psychological experiment could so be so powerful that simply taking part might change your view of yourself and human nature ?
What experimental procedure could provoke some people to profuse sweating and trembling , leaving 10 % extremely upset , while others broke into unexplained hysterical laughter ? ”
“ …we examine the quality of our memories , in particular the ways in which memory can be changed after the event we are remembering .
The work of Elizabeth Loftus has been extremely influential in this area as one of her early studies demonstrates . ”
“ … what can psychologists tell us about the systematic differences between people ?
To answer this question I have to break the pattern just this once and include two studies , from two apparently warring factions of personality psychology . ”
“ Would you bet £ 10 on the flip of a coin if you stood to win £ 20 ?
So you ’ve got a 50 % chance of losing £ 10 and a 50 % chance of winning £ 20 .
This seems like a good bet to take and yet studies show that people tend not to take it .
Why ? ”
“ To really understand the revolutionary nature of Freud ’s work you need to do something for me : to forget you ’ve every heard of him or his ideas .
Just lie back … relax …. ”

At 13 , Parimarjan Negi is currently the youngest Grandmaster in chess , and the second youngest in the history of the game .
He did it at the age of 13 years and 142 days , which is only surpassed by Sergey Karjakin , who was 12 years and seven months when he became the youngest GM in history .
In comparison Vishy Anand , the patriarch of Indian chess , reached this milestone at the age of 18 ( in 1987 ) , which was considered very young at the time .
The favourite toys of today 's young brigade are their laptops , since they prepare with the help of databases that have over three million games .
It is this preparation that has significantly narrowed the gap between the young and the not - so - young masters of the game .
Parimarjan is a product of this tech - savvy generation .
On August 17 , on his arrival from Europe , a huge press meeting in Delhi
With his parents and other dignitaries before the press conference
Talking to the media – there were 13 Indian television stations present ...
... and around 50 journalists from newspapers , magazines and agencies
One of Negi 's sponsors : Sanjay Singh , VP of the Tata Group
What sets the soft - spoken Parimarjan apart from the pack of other Indians , who have won age - group medals at the World , Asian and Commonwealth levels , is that he has been guided better .
The turning point in his career came when his first teacher , G. B. Joshi , realised it was time to use the services of better coaches .
And Parimarjan 's father , J. B. Singh , managed to bring Grandmaster Evgeny Vladimirov into the picture .
Negi 's trainers Vishal Sareen and G.B. Joshi
Working with Vladimirov and notebooks
This seasoned Kazakh trainer , once part of Gary Kasparov 's team of seconds , had earlier worked with GM Pentala Harikrishna , and was also the coach of the Indian Olympiad team in 2002 .
Known for his superior endgame techniques , Vladimirov was the one who taught young Parimarjan how to get started if he wanted to make it big .
With his school principal and some of his teachers
It is the intensity with which Parimarjan works on his chess that has encouraged coaches to happily work harder with him .
Russian trainer Ruslan Sherbakov puts it aptly , " Parimarjan has got everything required to become a top world player – a huge talent , outstanding working ability and a great passion for chess .
How many times his parents called us to finish classes and join for dinner but Parimarjan 's reply was always , ' one more position please ' . "
If Sherbakov works on the opening repertoire of Parimarjan , Ukrainian trainer Aleksander Goloshchapov has started guiding the youngster on sharpening his positional understanding .
At the press conference in Delhi Parimarjan made a speech , which was kindly placed at our disposal by his parents ( who also sent us the above pictures ) .
Parimarjan 's Speech
Respected Dignitaries on the dais , ladies and gentlemen ,
At the outset , I would like to thank the Delhi Chess Association for their support and setting up this function , which I see as an opportunity to share with you all in a nutshell , my journey to the grandmaster title .
I have had an eventful voyage in my chess career since I started in 1998 .
From playing in my first tournament to addressing you all as a Grandmaster , I have had a fair share of success and failure .
When I started playing chess , I had no idea of the masses of knowledge required to excel in the game .
And now it just seems to get bigger and bigger .
Though it has not yet dawned on me that I am a Grandmaster , I realise that I only stand on the first step of the long - winding , spiral staircase of my international career .
I fully understand that many important challenges lie ahead and that this is only the first step towards greater goals .
Here I would like to make a specific mention of the year so far .
Since the New Year Day , it has been a journey towards certain goals that I honestly did not perceive before .
The International Master title and the first GM norm came in the space of a week , and in the very next tournament here in Delhi came the second Grandmaster norm .
Honestly , I did not expect the second norm to follow so soon .
But once I had two norms – I wanted to chase the third and the final one in a hurry .
Thank god .
I did n’t have to wait too long .
On this day I feel truly humbled by the love , affection and blessings of my family , well wishers and also those from the media , and those who wished me well without even knowing me .
My parents have played the most crucial role in developing and shaping my chess .
When no sponsorship support was available , my parents made several sacrifices to keep me going .
I ca n’t thank them enough .
Equally , I owe a lot to the constant support and encouragement of my coaches and sponsors .
I would like to start by thanking SEBI chairman Mr. M. Damodran .
He is not only instrumental in helping my parents find sponsorship support for my chess , but also remains an encouraging guide to me .
My school Amity International , that has not only helped me in academics but also in my career .
I sincerely thank the Founder President of Amity International Dr. Ashok Kumar Chauhan , the Chairperson Mrs. Amita Chauhan , and my school ’s principal Mrs. Bharti Sharma , and all my teachers , and friends for helping me in my studies .
My idol , Vishwanathan Anand ’s words of encouragement have always been very inspiring for me to strive hard .
He is just the perfect idol for all of us aspiring youngsters .
Today the TATA group funds my expenditure .
I am grateful to Air India for inducting me in their scholarship scheme .
I would also like to thank Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports and Sports Authority of India for granting me scholarship for part of my training in the past couple of years .
I thank Mr. Pradeep Jain , chairman Parsvnath group and Vice President of the All India Chess Federation for his contribution .
I would like to thank Mr. GB Joshi , for helping me develop my chess skills in my formative years ,
And my other coaches since then – Evgeny Vladimirov , Ruslan Sherbakov , Alexander Goloshchapov and Vishal Sareen .
Recently I have also worked for short spans with Elizbar Ubilava , and Nigel Short .
I also owe a lot to V.S. Negi , Updesh Sharma and D.S. Negi who have been a great help .
And I am very grateful to Mr. Vaibhav Agashe – sports psychologist , who has helped me a lot in the psychological aspect of the game .
In the end I would like to mention Mr. Bharat Singh Chauhan who has been a consistent support for me for many years now and also Mr. Rakesh Rao who has guided me all through with his words of wisdom .
I thank you all ladies and gentleman .
Hoping to meet your expectations the next time around .
Thanks a lot .
Anand on Parimarajan
" I have met Parimarjan , quite a few times .
In Corus 2005 , I got to see him play .
In spite of the tough competition he held his own .
He seems a really cool kid , unfazed by results .
For a child it is quite impressive .
I think we spoke when he got his IM title , soon after Hastings , and he just seemed so calm .
Clearly he has a lot of talent and is working hard .
It is also very heartening to see that he has a good structure around him .
His school , family have been able to support him .
It is nice to see that he can enjoy being a kid and also be a prodigious talent .
I think a grandmaster title is a milestone .
When you cross it , you have this problem of what to aim for .
He should enjoy the title .
You can only earn it for the first time , once in your life .
Goals will always be there and records too .
Carpe Diem [ " seize the pleasures of the moment " ] and enjoy the events .
Clearly he seems to be working with a lot of Soviet coaches .
He has also played a few international events and , that has given him exposure and confidence .
At this age it is difficult to quantify improvement .
You will find a huge spurt in ratings and then a few years without much of a performance .
Just playing a lot of events , facing new players , different styles will be an excellent preparation .
Whatever theoretical preparation he does , will be able to give him confidence to play and also mould his intrinsic skills as a chess player .
Just play different events , formats and do n't start getting obsessed about ratings or GM title .
This is the fun time , as you grow your knowledge and worries double . "
Short on Negi
For a year Nigel Short has been training Stephen Moss , senior correspondent of The Guardian newspaper in Britain .
After 48 weekly lessons Stephen admits that after a year 's immersion his play was woefully inconsistent .
He got better at dispatching weak players , but rarely gave stronger players a good game .
In his latest column Nigel contrasts the effort with his training of an Indian chess prodigy :
I have worked with some extraordinarily gifted young players over the past three years and am currently coaching Parimarjan Negi , the 13 - year - old grandmaster from India .
One of the most striking differences between teaching a young prodigy and a mature rookie is the level of recall .
During the course of a day's work with Parimarjan , we examine many hundreds , if not thousands , of positions .
Most , if not all of that information , is committed easily to memory and in the correct sequence .
With Stephen , I can show him a simple line no more than a few moves deep which is forgotten half an hour later .
It is difficult to do much about this .

Previous ChessBase stories
Neurophilosopher has a great review of a recent study on how short naps help improve memory , and how this is supported by the brain .
Participants were asked to learn an action task and were split into two groups .
One group was allowed to have an afternoon nap , while the others remained awake .
Afterwards , those who had slept during the afternoon could perform the task better than those who had n’t .
EEG recordings of the brain suggested how the learning boost occurred :
This study confirms that the consolidation of motor memories is associated with a particluar stage of sleep ( NREM ) , and that this in turn is correlated with electrical activity in an anatomically discrete region of the brain ( the motor cortex ) .
One interpretation of the findings is that power naps trigger accelerated memory consolidation .
An alternative hypothesis is that a good night ’s sleep consists of multiple stages which are devoted to the consolidation of memories encoded during waking hours ; thus , a full night ’s sleep may not be necessary for this consolidation to take place ; as long as a sleep episode – be it a a short night ’s sleep or an afternoon power nap – includes the corresponding stages ( NREM ) , newly - encoded memories will be consolidated .

If you want to achieve a certain goal that cannot be accomplished without a considerable time investment , you should learn to harness the cumulative power of persistence .
Believe it or not , this was a lesson that I learned from playing the Massive Multiplayer Online Role - Playing Game “ Final Fantasy XI . ”
I played FFXI an average of four hours a day for three years .
The game kept track of the total “ playtime ” I collectively spent logged in .
After three years , my total playtime value amounted to over 180 days .
It ’s difficult to explain the significance of how I felt when I realized how much time I had invested playing a video game .
“ Invested ” is a sly word to use for this story — because a more accurate word would be “ wasted . ”
I wasted 180 days of my life playing this video game .
180 days !?
The things I could accomplish in that much time !
If I spent that much time exercising , I would be physically fit .
If I spent that much time learning a second language , I would be fluent in it .
If I spent that much time writing , I would have written a book .
If I spent that much time doing anything constructive , I would have improved my life .
Take a moment to imagine something you ’ve always wanted to do but never had the time .
If you can afford to spend only one hour a day working towards this goal , over time you will collectively spend enough time that you ’ll accomplish it .
Spending only one hour a day for a year adds up to over two entire weeks — this is “ the power of an hour . ”
In my case , something I ’ve always wanted to do but never had the time was to learn to play piano .
Thanks to this one - hour - every - day strategy , I taught myself to play piano using tutorial software on an electronic keyboard .
I spent the first half hour on a new lesson , and the last half hour playing songs I ’d learned previously .
When I received my electronic keyboard on Christmas 2005 , I could n’t even identify middle C. Through the power of an hour , after one year ’s time I was able to play :
Ach , Du Lieber Augustin America ( My Country , ‘ Tis of Thee ) Angels We Have Heard On High Bingo Camptown Races Chariots of Fire For He ’s A Jolly Good Fellow Frosty the Snowman Happy Birthday Hava Nagila Here , There , and Everywhere Mary Had A Little Lamb Minka Norwegian Wood Old MacDonald Puff The Magic Dragon Santa Lucia Silent Night The “ Star Wars ” Theme Tea For Two The Entertainer The First Noel Yesterday You ’ve Got To Hide Your Love Away
Forgive me for gloating about this accomplishment , but I am so incredibly proud of myself .
For too long , I allowed myself to be intimidated by the time commitment —
I never imagined I could succeed in reaching this goal , but then my attitude changed when I understood how much time I spent playing a silly video game .
If there ’s something you want to do but feel that you ca n’t without more time , then I encourage you to try this method .
Irrespective of how busy you are , you can surely afford one little hour out of your day .
Spend one less hour watching television , playing video games , or browsing the Internet so you can spend it working towards your goal — and if you ca n’t give up an hour from your entertainment , then spend one less hour sleeping !

The idea for this mission was submitted by a stranger via email .
Agent Slavinsky wrote in to suggest I get either a large group of people in blue polo shirts and khakis to enter a Best Buy or a group in red polo shirts and khakis to enter a Target .
Wearing clothing almost identical to the store ’s uniform , the agents would not claim to work at the store but would be friendly and helpful if anyone had a question .
There are n’t any Targets in Manhattan , so I decided to go with the two - story Best Buy on 23rd Street .
I staked out the Best Buy a few times leading up to the mission .
I wanted to figure out the exact shade of blue they used for their uniforms .
One detail I noticed is that all employees wore belts and black shoes .
I figured it would be against policy to film in the store , so any cameras we used would have to be somewhat hidden .
In addition cameras could also be “ hidden ” in plain sight by using Best Buy ’s demo cameras to document the mission .
All we would have to do is bring in blank tapes and memory cards to insert in their own video and still cameras .
I sent out an email to my mailing list to recruit agents .
I did n’t want to give away the exact nature of the prank for fear of word spreading to Best Buy employees ahead of time .
I had to be as vague as possible and still make sure everyone wore the correct clothing :
In order to participate you must arrive adhering to a very specific dress code :
1 ) Blue Polo Shirt .
Short sleeved .
Any brand .
Preferably with no logo .
As Close to Royal Blue as possible .
2) Khaki Pants .
Any shade of khaki is fine .
No shorts .
3 ) Belt .
Any belt is fine .
Other Instructions :
- If possible , please wear black shoes .
This is not required , but please wear them if you have them .
- You must also bring a NEWSPAPER ( Any newspaper is fine–just grab a free one on the street . )
- If possible , do not bring a backpack or any type of bag .
This is not a huge deal , but it will work better without bags .
- Do not bring any type of camera .
This mission is , as all IE Missions should be , participatory .
We are covering it with our own small staff of camera people and do not need any more cameras or journalists .
Only show up if you are wearing the proper dress and ready to participate and have fun !
We met at Union Square North at 3:30 PM .
Around 80 agents showed up , most them looking like wonderful Best Buy employees .
More than a few came dressed in navy or teal , but with the belt and the khakis they still looked employee - like .
After everyone arrived I explained the mission .
The first step was for everyone to throw their newspapers away .
The instruction to bring a newspaper was a red herring meant to throw people off the scent of the mission ’s true nature .
I then revealed the plan , “ We ’re heading up to the Best Buy on 23rd Street .
We ’ll enter the store one by one .
Once inside , spread out and stand near the end of an aisle , facing away from the merchandise .
Do n’t shop , but do n’t work either .
If a customer comes up to you and asks you a question , be polite and help them if you know the answer .
If anyone asks you if you work there , say no .
If an employee asks you what you ’re doing , respond ‘ I ’m waiting for my girlfriend / boyfriend who is shopping elsewhere in the store . ’
If they question you about your clothing , just explain that it ’s what you put on when you woke up this morning and you do n’t know any of the other people dressed like you . ”
Agents listening to the instructions
It had been a rainy morning , and I was worried that most agents would show up with rain jackets and umbrellas , something Best Buy employees surely would not have on their person while working .
Fortunately the rain stopped about an hour before our meet up time and most folks came empty handed .
One Agent had a car parked nearby and let folks store their backpacks in his trunk for the duration of the mission .
Agent Simmons was particularly resourceful , opting to check his bag at the Strand Bookstore on his way to the meeting point .
After everyone was briefed on the mission , we took a few group photos .
We must have looked like some type of church retreat group to anyone passing us in the park .
The group slowly started heading up towards the store .
I positioned myself on 22nd street , just one block south of the store and around the corner .
As agents started arriving , I had them wait out of view and sent people over individually in fifteen - second intervals .
An agent waits his turn
Our camera crew entered the store first with their hidden devices .
Agents EMartin and Reeves
Agents Shafer and Reeves stored their cameras in duffle bags .
Agent Shafer ’s camera
Agent EMartin hid his camera inside an Xbox 360 box , cutting a hole in the side for his lens .
The plan was for him to claim he was attempting to return his Xbox and get the security guard to tag it with a pink slip .
Once inside he could walk around freely with what looked liked store merchandise .
Agent Carlson entered the store with only a Mini - DV tape .
He went directly to the video camera section of the store , locating on the ground level right next to the front door , conveniently .
He found their best 3 - CCD camera , inserted his tape , and positioned it to film everyone entering the front door .
Agent Carlson inserting his tape
IE ’s favorite photographer Agent Nicholson was on board per usual to snap photos .
He brought a couple of cameras of his own , but he also brought a variety of memory cards to insert into Best Buy ’s own demo cameras .
Agent Nicholson with his memory cards
Using a demo camera he snapped a few photos on the upper level discreetly .
Agent Simmons and Rodgers are among the first to enter

After about fifteen minutes of staggered entrances , all 80 agents were in the store .
Not noticing the lack of Best Buy logo and nametag , customers immediately started asking our agents for help .
Agent Kinney helps a customer near the front door
Agent Rodgers helps someone find a router
Two agents cross each other on the escalators
Pretty soon there was an agent stationed at every aisle in every section of the store .
We had a pretty diverse crowd , men and women , young and old .
One agent brought his 9 and 11 year - old daughters with him .
“ Take your daughter to work day , ” he explained to me .
Their shirts were n’t quite the right color , but they made great employees nevertheless .
Some agents looked pretty close to a typical Best Buy employee .
Others , not so much .
Sound of Music
I spent much of my time wandering the store checking out other agents and making sure everything was going to plan .
Every now and then I would stay put for a bit on the end of an aisle .
I helped a few customers .
One woman wanted to know where she could find “ on DVD . ” I happily walked her over to the DVD section .
One employee passed me with a smile on his face and exclaimed , “ All you guys have GOT to get together for a photo , because no one is ever going to believe this ! ”
Another came up to me and said , “ Let me guess , you ’re waiting on your friend ?
Good answer . ”
I guess at that point he had heard that answer more than a few times .
The reaction from the employees was pretty typical as far as our missions go .
The lower level employees laughed and got a kick out of it while the managers and security guards freaked out .
Some employees speculated that we were a cult , or maybe protesters .
One employee tried to get a date out of the incident , informing one agent , “ Tell that girl in the computer section that ‘ Mike says hi . ' ”
Another employee after being told to go get some merchandise from the back , declared , “ You should ask one of these other 50 people to do it ! ”
A real employee with three fake employees in the background
Security guards and managers started talking to each other frantically on their walkie - talkies and headsets .
“ Thomas Crown Affair !
Thomas Crown Affair ! , ” one employee shouted .
They were worried that were using our fake uniforms to stage some type of elaborate heist .
“ I want every available employee out on the floor RIGHT NOW ! ”
Two managers confer ( right ) while a security guard looks on ( left )
Another manager meeting
Employees began asking our agents to leave the store if they were n’t shopping .
Most stuck to their “ I ’m waiting for my girlfriend ” story and refused to leave .
Others pretended to shop whenever employees were near by .
A few were escorted out by employees .
Agent EMartin’s
Xbox video camera rig was discovered when an employee approached him to offer advice on how to return his Xbox .
He was asked to leave , and then detained by security at the front door .
There a manager claimed it was “ illegal ” to film in Best Buy and instructed someone to call 911 .
She informed him that he had violated her “ civil rights ” by filming in her store .
Agent Nicholson , who had been taking photos at the hip to avoid detection was caught as well , but he was able to leave the store freely .
With our main photographer busted , I took out my camera and started taking covert snapshots .
One employee caught me in the act and rushed over .
As soon as he got to me , I caught him off guard with a question , “ Hey , do you know where I can find the right memory cards for my camera ? ”
He stammered for a second and then said , “ Sure .
They ’re right over there . ”
I thanked him and was on my way .
Another employee caught me moments later in the DVD section , but I disarmed him with a question as well , “ Do you know how much the Star Trek DS9 DVDs are ?
There is no price tag . ”
We chatted for a second about how expensive the set was , and by the time I walked away he forgot all about the camera .
The cops arrived and began questioning Agent EMartin about why he was filming .
He claimed he did n’t know us , but thought it was funny and started filming ( inexplicably out of his Xbox ) .
While filming this altercation , Agent Shafer ’s camera was also discovered and the cops began questioning him as well .
Already out of the store , Agent Nicholson was able to take photos through the window .
While the cops were questioning Agents Shafer and EMartin , we had two other cameramen filming the interaction .
Agent Carlson remained undetected filming from a Best Buy demo camera , and despite the fact that her camera was the least hidden , Agent Reeves was never discovered .
Perhaps being tall , blonde , and female had something to do with her camera not being noticed .
Agent Shafer confidently informed the cops that it was not , in fact , “ illegal ” to film in Best Buy and that they could n’t accuse him of trespassing until he had been asked to leave the store .
He pointed out that he was perfectly willing to leave .
A manger told Agent Shafer , “ I do n’t come to your house and film you , ” to which he replied , “ Who lives here ? ”
The cops argued for a bit , but finally realized there was nothing they could do .
They let the cameramen go and informed the manager , “ The worst you can do is ask them to leave . ”
We had been in the store for around 40 minutes , so I decided it was time to start leaving .
I also figured our departure would ease the heat off of the cameramen .
I walked around and gave agents the signal to leave .
Before heading out , I snapped a few more photos and was busted a third time by an employee .
He asked me to leave , and I informed him I was on my way out .
I soon found myself in the middle of about six other agents heading towards the escalators .
The guy who busted me decided he wanted to talk to me more about my camera , but could n’t remember which one I was .
As he walked with the six of us in our blue shirts , he started demanding , “ Which one of you had the camera ? ”
None of us answered .
Riding the escalator up I took one last glance backwards .
The employee saw my face and shouted , “ That ’s him ! ” I worried that he would make it to a security guard to radio in my description to the front door guys so they could intercept me .
I picked up the pace and hurried out the front door , undetected , camera safely in pocket .

Once on the street , we headed to a meet up point about five minutes away from the store .
One manager followed us outside with her walkie - talkie shouting , “ They ’re heading down 6th Avenue ! , ” as if she was going to get someone to trail us .

Another employee chased after us with a camera , hoping to get some group photos .
Agent EMartin , Hidden Camera
I created a hidden camera setup for this mission by making a smallish hole in an Xbox 360 box and crudely securing the camera inside .
I thought I was going to be pretty clever walking around the store with a camera in a large bright - ass green box .
I lasted about 5 minutes .
One employee started chatting me up about return options and another employee wearing a tie came from behind me and spotted the lens - hole .
They asked me if I was recording , I said yes , and he told me I had to leave the store .
I was escorted up the escalator , thinking that I was going to be kicked out .
Near the front door a manager stopped the employee with a tie and started asking me questions about “ what was going on . ” I said I had no idea .
She then lectured me about how I violated her civil rights and how I had endangered people in the store by distracting the employees .
Her exaggerated arguments did n’t make much sense , but she was set on doing this “ by the book ” and calling the police .
Two security guards made sure I did n’t leave .
It took the manager a while to find the correct precinct phone number in their manual , and eventually they just dialed 911 .
While I was waiting for the cops ( it took 15 - 20 minutes for them to show up ) I overheard some interesting exchanges .
Only a couple of employees interacted with me directly , but aside from the one manager accusing me of endangering the masses , everyone was very polite .
Both security guards loudly advanced their own theories about what was going on .
One security guard did n’t know who the group was , but suspected that it was some cult , because , “ They all have that zombie look in their eyes .
They just stand there staring at nothing . ”
They also argued about if the prank was funny or not .
One did not think it was funny at all and the other said he thought it was “ kinda funny , ” and tried to explain the humor , “ What if you went into Home Depot and there were all these people wearing orange aprons all over the store ? ”
“ That ’s completely different . ”
A few employees tried to get me to spill the secret on what the group was , and another employee came over twice and asked me in a hushed voice , “ Are YOU a police officer ? ”
Once the cops showed up everyone including me got a bit more tense .
They were obviously not happy about having to deal with the situation .
They did not think the prank was funny and they repeatedly asked me for everyone ’s names .
I did n’t say anything , but agreed to show them the tape .
One cop watched it while another spoke with store employees .
Every time it would show an agent on the tape he would ask me what his name was .
I would say I did n’t know ( which was the honest truth ) , but he kept saying , “ Bullshit , I do n’t believe you .
Why are you taping them if you do n’t know them . ”
“ Because , I think it ’s funny . ”
“ I do n’t think it ’s funny . ”
This whole time , agents were recording the event with Best Buy ’s own demo video cameras .
No employees noticed , even though they seemed to be pretty blatant .
Eventually , the cop angrily insisted that I was to go around and personally get all of the non-employees in blue shirts to leave the store .
I complied and went around the store relaying the message to any of the agents left in the store .
My favorite part of this was when an agent and his daughter refused to acknowledge me and did n’t break character , even though I was speaking directly to them .
Apparently , while I was walking around the store Agent Shafer was also discovered with a video camera .
They kept asking us for the names of everyone else involved , which we did n’t disclose .
They grew frustrated and at one point said that they would be writing both Agent Shafer and I summons for trespassing .
Fortunately , Agent Shafer knew the law and kept turning the officer ’s statements back on themselves :
“ I ’m not trespassing until you ask me to leave .
No one has asked me to leave yet . ”
“ Are you disobeying a lawful order ? ”
“ Are you asking me to leave ? ”
With most the agents now gone from the store , the cops gave up and we left the store .

I was excited to see so many people show up at Union Square in Blue polo ’s and Khaki pants .
When I got to Best Buy my job was to first stand outside and videotape the agents going in .
After the first five minutes , four employees came out and stood next to me as they smoked .
They knew something was up , one guy thought he was tripping on Acid , another said it was just like the Thomas Crown Affair .
Whenever a new agent walked by , the guys would say , “ Hey , Best Buy is right here , you might want to go in , your friends are in there . ”
Then they noticed agents were coming from every direction and this made them confused .
Audio clips of these employees :
Out of all the camera people , I was the most obvious .
The lens was sticking out of my bag but nobody ever said anything .
I caught up with Agent Kula as he helped some shoppers who were looking for a new TV .
I saw some other Agents talking with customers about which video game or cell phone to buy .
As everyone was leaving I stood downstairs in front of the escalators and spoke with two Black shirts about why they had so many employees working that day .
The guy said about 50 people just came in randomly dressed as Best Buy employees and they absolutely did not work there .
When I was leaving , I saw a police confrontation another cameraman , Agent Shafer .
I stood next to them and videotaped the whole thing .
That must have been the highlight for me .
I made it in and out with a camera videotaping the whole time and nobody asked me about it .
It ’s just too bad we did n’t walk down to Blockbuster afterwards .

This was my third mission , and the first time I had the opportunity to bring my daughters ( Agents Co and Bo ) .
For us , it was a HUGE success .
At one point on the way over to Best Buy , Agent Co said to me : “ My cheeks hurt I ’m smiling so much ! ”
We actually had other plans for Sunday –fortunately canceled by the rain–so we woke up uniform - less that morning .
A stop at Old Navy got Bo and Co as close as we could get , and Agent Todd hooked me up with the perfect royal blue shirt .
I must say that the anticipation , and the speculation about what we might be doing , was at least half the fun for the kids .
And spotting other people in their “ prank uniforms ” on the way to the meeting place provoked total giggles in all three of us !
I was actually surprised that my kids did n’t feel a little disappointed by the prank itself , because there was no , like , “ big moment . ”
Keeping on a game face and seeing their dad do something so … I do n’t know … ridiculous and silly and “ daring ” was obviously entertaining enough .
Some highlights of our time inside the store : the customers who would stop mid-question upon seeing no logo on my shirt and apologize , sometimes pretty profusely , that they thought I worked there ( wonder what gave them THAT idea ! ? ) ; watching my kids massage their cheeks in that classic “ don’tsmiledon’tsmiledon’tsmile ” maneuver ; the dude who seemed genuinely angry at me for wearing the shirt ( “ What are you guys doing ?!!
Why are you wearing these clothes !!?? ) ; and at one point about 45 minutes in , wandering from the video games all the way back to the TVs and seeing the scope of our “ invasion . ”
You know , though , having recently seen V for Vendetta and The Inside Man ( both of which feature robberies and / or escapes using lots of people in identical outfits , I could definitely identify with the growing anxiety of Best Buy ’s security and managerial staff .
All in all , though , we had a great , truly memorable day , which always seems to happen when I hang with the Improv Everywhere crew !
Agent Ace $ Thugg
When I entered the store , right off the bat , the employees pointed at my blue shirt and said , “ Look , here comes another one !
What ’s going on ? ”
So it did n’t take them long to be on to me .
I then walked to the most vacant open space I could find , which happened to be the speaker section .
It was there that I became the focal point of the manager Al ( yellow shirt ) , and his manager Rick ( white shirt . )
As I stood with my back to the display case and arms behind me , Al first approached me within 30 seconds and asked if I needed any help .
I asked him where the bathrooms were ( I was actually needing to go ) , but he told me they were out of order .
I said , “ Alright , I ’ll just wait for my girlfriend then .
She ’s looking for the bathroom .
I guess I might be here awhile . ”
Five minutes later Rick came by and asked me pointedly , “ What ’s going on ?
What are you and your buddies doing ? ” I , flabbergasted , told him kindly I was waiting for the bathrooms to be fixed .
And he , not believing me , asked me to leave and said he ’s calling the police and then stormed off .
I said ok and just went to another section .
In this section , Al approached me twice asking me if I needed help .
I assured him , if I did indeed need help , I knew to come find him .
And then he asked me if I had a child at home , and if I knew any children .
Curious about his line of questioning , I asked him what he was getting at .
He said he noticed that I was in the children ’s section for a long time and it was making him uncomfortable .
Not wanting to make him or any children uncomfortable , I went back to the speaker section .
Rick then came by again said , “ I ca n’t believe you guys are this bored ; you better not talk to any of my customers . ”
I just stared at him with a puzzled look on my face claiming I knew of no others here but my lost girlfriend who I was becoming concerned about .
He just walked away in a huff .
A customer did approach me soon after though and asked where the calculators were .
I , trying to be helpful , pointed and said I think they are on the other side of the store .
As soon as I finished my sentence , the couple says , “ Here they are ! ”
That was when I learned I was in the speaker and calculator section of Best Buy .
I would not have made a good employee .
About 10 minutes later , I saw Al walking towards me from across the store .
Trying to avoid him , I picked up a Best Buy brochure that was at the end of the aisle .
I picked it up thinking it was an employment application , and Al asked if I needed any assistance once again .
I asked him if they were hiring , nodding towards the brochures .
And then we got into an awkward discussion about how it was actually a Best Buy credit card application and I said “ it would be good for me if I actually did any shopping here . ”
He then said , “ It looks like a lot of people like you like to shop at this store ” as he pointed to all the other blue shirts .
All I could muster was , “ Yeah … that ’s weird . ”
Al and Rick finally approached me together towards the end of the mission .
Al asked me my name , and I told them it was Al too , and of course they did n’t believe me .
Al explained that he was still very uncomfortable with my presence in the store ( even in the speaker and calculator section ) and wanted to know what I was shopping for .
I said , “ I ’m not shopping for anything .
I ’m browsing . ”
And the two looked at me like I was the first person to ever browse a Best Buy aisle with my back to the display cases the whole time .
Rick , feeling defeated , said to Al .
“ You know what Al , just let them have their fun .
We ca n’t do anything . ”
And as he said that , I got the cue from Agent Todd to exit , and then we all left in a timely manner .
Agent Shelktone
I was lucky to score one of the regulation shirts from Agent Todd .
As such , I was one of the first of the blue shirts to enter the store .
I did n’t get five steps in before a dude asked me on the elevator , “ Where are your land line phones ?
Are they downstairs ? ” I said , “ Yeah , I think so . ”
He then asked , “ Oh and where are the bathrooms ? ” I said sheepishly , “ Oh I do n’t actually work here . ”
He pointed , “ The blue shirt . ” I shrugged and said , “ Oh right . ”
Then downstairs very quickly the real boys in blue started to notice the mass influx of recreational blue shirters .
They responded at first by very deliberately greeting me .
“ Hello ! ” “ How are you ? ”
Then , they grew more suspicious trying to suss out my level of craziness .
“ Can I help you with something ? ”
Then to , “ Hey , why are you wearing a blue shirt ?
It ’s confusing . ”
To finally flat out accusation from a yellow shirted higher up , “ Hey man , what ’s going on ?
What are you guys going to do ? ” I explained I was just browsing and had felt like wearing blue today .
He did n’t buy it .
Two minutes later , I heard one of the dudes say , “ I ca n’t deal with this , I ’m calling the police . ”
To be fair , I think I might have been a little freaked out too .
Still , if you were a manager you had to love what appeared to be wall - to - wall employee coverage of the store for every five feet .
Now , that ’s service !
Agent Montague
I arrive at Best Buy and immediately have the chance to hold the door for a few customers .
I step inside , cruise down the escalator , and quickly encounter an annoyed security guard .
“ May I help you sir ? ” he asks .
“ No thanks . ”
“ What ’s going on here ? ” “ What do you mean ? ” I respond .
“ Is this some sort of event ? ” “ I do n’t understand . ”
“ Why are you wearing that ? ” he presses .
“ Oh , ” I smile , “ These are just my clothes . ”
He shakes his head , and I wander off .
I tour the store and feel pretty good about landing a spot next to the vacuum cleaners .
There are no employees in sight .
I hover .
A 50 - something bearded Jewish man makes eye contact , walks toward me , my first customer .
“ Do you work here ? ” he asks .
“ No , I do n’t . ”
He starts looking at vacuum cleaners , not knowing where to start .
“ What are you looking for ? ” I ask .
“ I need a vacuum cleaner , ” he says .
“ I have a Dirt Devil .
It works really well , very powerful machine , ” I say .
“ A Dirt Devil .
Dirt Devil , OK . ” A real employee approaches .
“ May I help you sir ?
the employee asks .
“ Yes , I ’d like to buy a Dirt Devil , ” the man responds . ” I sold my first vacuum cleaner .
Damn , it feels good .
Shortly after that , I was asked to leave for not shopping .
Instead , I decide to stay .
I stroll around the store for awhile , until I overhear an employee say the cops had been called .
I casually make a daring escape up the escalator and out the front door .
Have a nice day , a large , bald bouncer says in a tough voice as I left .
Agent Jester
I searched frantically the day before the event for a shirt that was perfect color , that “ Best Buy Blue . ”
I found a decent approximation , but I was concerned it was off enough that I would n’t fit in well .
Nevertheless , I got into my role the second I walked into the store , I went to the video game section , ( the section I personally spend the most time in whenever I ’m actually shopping at a Best Buy ) .
I leaned against the “ discount games ” table , crossed my arms and patiently waited for any customers in need .
Within 5 minutes an older gentleman approached me , began asking me a question , then paused and looked carefully at my shirt .
“ Oh , I ’m sorry , you do n’t work here … ” Damn !
I was sure now that I was n’t fooling anyone .
I was just a guy who kinda sorta looked like a Best Buy employee .
But then , a person playing on the Xbox 360 on display looked over at me and asked me to change games on the system .
“ Sorry , ” I said , with an unusually large smile , “ I do n’t work here , but maybe I can find someone that can help you .
Also , may I recommend ` Burnout : Revenge ’ ? ”
The look on his face showed genuine surprise .
“ Damn !
You really do n’t work here ?!?
Shit , that ’s just … confusing . ”
That ’s all I wanted to hear .
After that I got asked three times by different people where to go to check out .
“ Oh , right over there , ” I told them , adding : “ they should really make that clearer for us , right ? ”
The rest of my tenure was spent watching other Best Buy employees freak out .
They walked past me , usually staring at me , occasionally asking if I needed any assistance .
But one guy , “ Mike ” was his name , made it a point to let us all know he A ) knew what was going on , and B ) was A.O.K. with it .
He walked over to at least five IE Agents and asked them their name , and how it was going , and if they were having a good time .
He would then turn to one of the other real Best Buy employees and give a grin , a laugh or a thumbs up to indicate that he had engaged with us , and recognized us as a non -threat .
I also saw another employee snapping photos of us with her camera phone .
Agent Wimpy
I was one of the last to enter the store .
As I approached I saw two employees smoking at the curb .
I glanced at the store door and heard from behind me , “ … another one ! ”
As I entered the upper level at least half the employees in the open display area there turned to look at me .
I was thinking , “ Wow , a Cheers moment ! ” I stepped forward intending to go down the escalator and found myself in the roped off area at the top of the up escalator and had to backtrack to get around to the down escalator .
I heard several people giggle .
As I came off the down escalator I heard an employee say , “ I do n’t know but they are stationed around and helping customers . ”
After about 15 minutes downstairs I went back up to see how things were on the street level section .
As I stood near the digital video cameras a young male employee walked round the display table touching and counting aloud the cameras and an older female employee walked around touching each of the associates on the upper arm and saying , “ Keep your cool , just keep your cool . ”
I went back downstairs and walked toward the CD section .
A short 40ish black woman with dreadlocks pulled back and tied behind her head started following me .
We walked the length of the classic music aisle and turned the corner starting back past the country western CDs .
She is walking about five feet behind me .
I stop and just look across the top of the display toward the escalators .
She stands there looking toward me for a few seconds then backtracks and walks up the next aisle directly through my field of vision .
She is walking very stiffly with eyes pointed forward avoiding eye contact .
At the end of the row she turns the corner back into my aisle again and starts toward me .
She takes about two steps directly toward me .
When I glance over in her direction I see that she has both her hands together at waist level .
From between her hands there is a camera flash .
She immediately turned and headed back toward customer service .
Agent Simmons
I was lingering near the audio equipment at one point when a middle - aged couple asked me if I knew the price of some speakers .
I looked for a price tag and then read $ 99.99 labeled on the shelf by the product .
I said “ $ 99.99 ? ” Unsure .
And they pointed out , “ No .
That is the price of the wireless speakers ” .
“ Oh ” , I said “ Maybe it ’s been labeled wrong . ”
The man said , “ Well , do you work here ? ” I said , “ No , ” but I thought they looked like good speakers .
They looked puzzled .
Just then an actual Best Buy floor clerk approached me :
Employee : “ You ca n’t talk to my customers ” .
Simmons : “ I ’m just having a friendly conversation with these people ”
Employee : “ But you do n’t work here . ”
Simmons : “ It ’s a free country I feel I can speak with anybody I choose . ”
Employee : “ You ’re playing some games . ”
Simmons : “ I ’m just here to shop with my wife . ”
Employee : “ Yeah , you and your 50 friends ? ”
Simmons : “ I do n’t know anybody else here . ”
Employee : “ Yeah , you ’re instigating ( sic ) our shirts . ”
Yes , he said INSTIGATING .
I told him , “ I ’m only wearing what I wore this morning , ” and walked away .
A little while later , an older woman with a handful of products walked past me at one point muttering to herself , “ Everyone in this goddamned store is wearing a blue shirt and nobody knows a thing ! ”
Agent Chadwick
Saturday : I entered Conway discount store and spotted a fellow agent surveying the royal blue polo shirts .
A funny side effect of this mission , I realized , would be a baffling increase in sales of royal blue polo shirts .
Sunday :
Once we got the logistics and the group photos out of the way , Agent Todd situated himself around the corner from the store and waved us in individually to avoid a conspicuous glut of agents entering the store .
As soon as I got inside , I overheard two blue - shirted Best Buy employees remark that this was something like “ Invasion of the Body Snatchers ” .
I meandered slowly through the downstairs , putting on a blank stare so as to avoid eye contact with anyone .
BB blue - shirts kept coming up to help me–apparently “ can I help you ? ” is the only icebreaker they know , and they just walk away dejectedly if you say no .
A customer in the big - screen TV section asked , redundantly , if he could ask me a question .
I admitted I did n’t work there , but offered to help anyway .
He wanted to buy a large , flat - screen TV , but did n’t know whether to look at plasma models or LCDs .
I told him that plasmas tend to be a lot more expensive and tend to have a limited lifespan ( both true , I think ? ) .
He thanked me and wandered off with his girlfriend .
A little later , when I was loitering near the computers , a female customer got kind of snappy with me when I could n’t tell her where the scanners were .
I politely let her know that I did n’t work there and she got totally apologetic , like she ’d insulted me by assuming I worked at Best Buy .
Then an employee approached and asked ( of course ) if I needed any help .
I said no , I was just waiting for my friend .
“ You mean all of your other friends you ’re here with ? ”
No , I said , just my one friend –I think she ’s over looking at CDs .
“ Well , it ’s hard to tell with everyone wearing these shirts . ”
Yeah , I told her , what a weird coincidence !
She asked that I refrain from helping any customers and rushed off to ask other IE agents if they needed any help .
As time wore on , I could sense the growing confusion of the BB people – the yellow - shirts were out in force , the black - shirts were on their walkie - talkies .
I imagine some off - duty regional manager was receiving a very confused call from BB personnel at this point .
Around 4:45 or so , Agent Todd signaled that it was time to go .
On the way out , I saw Agent Shafer getting a talking - to by a cop .
He was saying something about “ trespassing ” which I ’m sure was a load of crap , but I figured it was better to leave than test whether that would hold up in court .
Agent Kendall
I got mixed up when buying my polo shirt and bought a Navy Blue one , so I was n’t an exact match for an employee and was a little dejected when I showed up and was informed of the mission .
As I approached the store a passer - by said how he was freaking out about the number of people with blue shirts .
When I was cleared by Agent Todd to stagger in , I overheard employees outside smoking that they did n’t know what was going on but it was weird .
It seemed pretty immediate once I entered the store and took the escalator down that the management was freaking out .
I overheard a woman first asking an agent what was going on and then discussing it with an employee about how weird it was .
People were on their walkie - talkies asking what was going on , saying they were calling the cops , not to let them talk to the customers , etc .
After awhile I was glad that I was n’t a Royal Blue shirt , because although I ’m pretty sure the employees knew I was with the group , since I was n’t wearing the correct color , they could n’t be 100 % sure and I was able to blend in more to observe and listen .
At different times I tried to find a spot that was n’t around any other agents , but this was impossible .
So I mingled .
A couple of times it got a little busy around me with employees so I started shopping , picking up a DVD or CD and looking at it .
The most anyone said to me was to ask if I needed help , which I did n’t .
Later I tried to hang out more near other agents to hear what was going on .
Then it seems like every idling agent was being asked to leave so I again started shopping .
I then got the cue from Agent Todd to leave the store and meet up a block away to hear the other stories .
Now , I think it might be good to buy the right color shirt and go back on my own and shop to see if they think it ’s happening again .
Agent Goldman
Some of my favorite quotes when I was in Best Buy :
Lady on a headset : “ They ’re coming in droves –what do I do ? ”
A dude walked up to me and said : “ Are you guys demonstrating or protesting or something ? ” I said : “ Oh , I ’m just waiting for my girlfriend , she ’s somewhere around here . ”
And he says : “ So the shirts ….? ”
And I said : “ Shirts ? ” A security guard walked by and said to the dude , “ Sir , this man does not even work here , do not ask him questions . ”
And finally when I was “ escorted ” out by a large female manager :
Manager : “ What are you doing can I help you ? ” [ very sassy tone ]
Me : I ’m just waiting for a friend .
Manager : “ Oh yeah ?
Where is your friend ?
Let ’s go find your friend , I want to see him . ”
Me : I ’m not sure ; I think he ’s looking at flat - screen TV’s .
Manager : Okay .
Either you ’re shopping or you ’re leaving .
Me : I suppose I ’ll leave
Manager :
That ’s right .
And I ’m going to escort you out .
Agent Ciletti
I stopped in two stores to kill some time before heading to Best Buy .
In West Elm , a chic home furnishings store , a woman flagged me down .
“ Excuse miss , do you work here ? ” she said .
“ No , but did you need help with something ? ” I said .
She started laughing then said , “ Well , no , not if you do n’t work here . ”
I think she thought that I was crazy .
After that I went to Staples .
A young woman approached me .
“ Do you know where I can find those things that hold business cards ? ” she said .
I paused .
She waited .
“ I do n’t work here , ” I said .
“ Oh , I thought you did , ” she said , gesturing wildly to my outfit .
“ I ’m sorry . ”
I was about to leave when an old man and a young child approached me .
The man was carrying a newspaper .
He pointed to it and asked me if I could unlock the cabinet holding the item he needed .
We walked over to the cabinet .
I told him twice that I did n’t work there , but he just kept saying , “ We ’ll have to get the key . ”
Finally I just walked off and left the store .
I headed to Best Buy and once inside I took the escalator downstairs .
Several people asked me for help .
One man wanted to know about some software and started laughing when I said I did n’t work there .
After about 15 minutes I went upstairs and stood by the front door .
At this point the managers and security knew something was going on .
A girl walked in and approached me .
“ Do you know where I can find a USB port ? ” she said .
“ What is that ? ” I said .
“ It ’s a computer thing , ” she said .
“ What does USB stand for ? ” I asked .
She gave me a strange look .
“ I do n’t know , ” she said .
“ You just plug it in … ”
At that point a Best Buy employee wearing a black shirt came running over shouting “ She does n’t work here ! ” but the girl was already heading down the escalator .
He turned to me and said , “ You ca n’t help her ! ”
“ Oh , believe me , ” I said .
“ I was n’t helping her . ”
“ Who are you guys with ? ” he asked .
Shortly thereafter , I left the store .
Agent DLee
My favorite moment of the day happened within five minutes of entering the store .
When I took a very visible ( and helpful , I thought ! ) position near the base of the escalator , I was told by some yellow - shirted security tool with a corporate lackey by his side that I needed to leave the premises .
I said sure , and was on my way out , when I was stopped by a guest who needed help finding some PS2 game .
And with that , I was back on the job .
I walked the guest over to the game section , bullshitted my way through assisting her ( “ No , that game ’s got great graphics .
Me ?
I play it all the time .
Oh yeah .
Sure .
Why not ? ” ) , and then took up my new position there … where I remained , until the mass exodus of IE Agents .
Next time :
We need yellow shirts .
Agent Hamilton
My friend and I took a longer walking route to the Best Buy ( at 23rd and 7th ) so we could observe fellow agents entering the store .
From across the street , it was very funny to watch because anyone would have assumed that the gaggles we kept seeing were actual Best Buy employees and they were on break together or something .
We crossed the street and were instructed by Agent Todd when to enter the store .
Once we were downstairs on the sales floor , I started seeing more and more blue - shirted people coming down the escalator , to the point where there was an IE agent at the end of every aisle .
I decided I needed to walk around the store to get the full effect .
I passed a couple of real employees , one of whom was saying “ they must have NOTHING BETTER TO DO ” and another of whom was saying “ I ’ma smack them all upside the head , that ’ll make `em leave , ” which was my first indication that we were in trouble .
I started looking around for my friend , who I ’d gotten separated from , but could n’t find him , so finally I perched myself at the end of an aisle and waited .
A customer came up to me and asked me where the DVD ’s were .
I said I did n’t know , because I did n’t work here , and he looked at me weirdly and moved on .
I then realized that I was standing in the middle of the DVD section , so I have to think that my “ customer ” was another undercover IE Agent .
Then I started getting approached by managerial types .
One manager came up to me and said , “ I do n’t know what you and all your friends are doing here , but you need to leave . ”
I said , “ What ?
I ’m just waiting for someone , I do n’t know … ” and the guy goes , “ Yeah , yeah , all of you are just ‘ waiting for someone . ' ”
Then I was ambushed by two more managers who started barking “ Are you purchasing anything ma’am ?
Are you purchasing anything ma’am ? ” at me , and escorted me to the escalator , and amid my protests were telling me that I was causing a distraction by being dressed too much like them .
This was the rule that they determined I was breaking : causing a distraction by being dressed too much like them .
Hilarious .
Outside , I conferred with some other agents who ’d been kicked out , one of whom reported that she ’d overheard a manager saying , “ The police are on their way . ”
Two minutes later , the police car pulled up .
I feel guilty for wasting the time of New York ’s Finest with our silly prank where absolutely nothing untoward was going to happen , but I did n’t feel quite as guilty when one of the policemen came up and started being , predictably , a total dick : “ This is absolute nonsense .
If you go back in there , you ’re getting a summons and you ’ll be going to jail . ”
He walked away and an agent said “ Okay , so now we ’ve established where the line is .
You can go in once , but you ca n’t go in again . ”
I said , “ Are we banned from Best Buy for life ? ” Everyone shivered .
Then , someone else : “ Where ’s the nearest Blockbuster ? ”
I had to hang around for quite awhile waiting for my friend ( who did a better job of hiding than I did – he was hanging out by the calculators waiting to tell unsuspecting customers who asked him a question , any question : “ I ’m sorry , I ’m the calculator guy , and calculators are all I know about . ” ) , so I got to hear lots of other stories , including one who said a customer was carping about us to a manager because “ they wo n’t do anything and they wo n’t tell us what they ’re protesting ! ”
I also saw one guy who thought the gag was pretty funny , and on his way out of the store he said “ Well done , guys . ”
So all in all , I think a success !
Agent Gregor
An old man asked me to help him get down a big box from a top shelf for him .
I began to try to get the box , when I realized I was way too short to actually get it , and at best I ’d knock it off the shelf .
I then told him , “ You know I do n’t work here , sir ? ”
He was so confused , and just pointed at my shirt , began to laugh , and apologized .
He went to another nearby ACTUAL - Best Buy employee , and said , “ Looks like your twin ! ”
The Best Buy employee did not share a laugh with him .
Agent Sara
I really enjoyed selling a phone to a customer , recommending different products , talking a couple out of buying a particular washing machine , and referring a customer to a Best Buy employee when I could n’t quite help him with his question about a cord extension for his speakers .
It was also really fun talking to the other employees and calling them by name as if they knew me - “ Hey Randy this woman needs more help with … ”
Agent Steinberg
Here are some bullet points from my observations :
1 . I waited to enter the store so I ’d be toward the tail end of the group .
The first thing I heard was the manager walking rapidly through the store with her walkie .
She was saying , “ I want every available person on the floor right now… ! ”
2 . Shortly thereafter , several of the more official - looking employees were walking rapidly around the store saying , apparently for the benefit of the ears of all blue shirts they did not recognize , “ … the cops have been called … ”
They said this as they walked by me , as if in the middle of a conversation , and I understand they repeated this again for others to hear .
A clever strategy on their part , I thought .
Soon afterward some of our agents walked around passing this information along to their fellows in an under - the breath way .
( It was suggested afterward that one thing we could have done is informed the regular customers of this fact , as well : “ Just wanted you to know the cops have been called , so do n’t panic . ” )
3 . An employee , who seemed to dog me through the store , walked up beside me near the refrigerators .
“ So , you guys get bored or something ? ” he asked in an offhand , amiable way .
I looked blank : “ Huh ? ” He repeated it .
“ You guys all got bored and so you got blue shirts and came in here … ? ”
I said , “ I ’m sorry , but I do n’t understand what you mean .
If you mean , am I bored , it ’s true I ’m kind of bored because I ’m waiting for someone . ”
He then changed tactics .
“ It ’s really cold today , right , and raining like [ some off - color phrase ] , is n’t it ?
Is n’t it a bit cold for the shirts ?
I mean , short sleeves and all ? ” I assured him it was now sunny and warm and he should check it for himself .
As I was no help , he excused himself and went elsewhere .
4 . I was asked “ Can I help you ” by several people over time .
I found the best answer , besides my story that I was waiting for my wife shopping for baby supplies across the street at Burlington Coat Factory , was to actually ask some question about something in the store .
“ Is that a rear projection screen or is there a projector somewhere ? ”
“ Is that screen more or less effective in terms of glare if there ’s bright sunlight ? ”
That sort of thing .
They would answer me and I ’d say “ thanks ” and look off into the distance ; they must have felt that somehow I had just proven my right to be in the store , because in each case they then left me alone .
5 . For a bit I stationed myself at the foot of the escalator so the maximum number of store patrons would ask me for directions .
This worked not so very well .
Then I decided to freak out the fellow (s ) watching me a bit and for some time I would check my watch , then go up the escalator and hang out at the top .
After a few minutes , I checked the time again and went back down , as if there were some reason to be one place or the other .
( Later other agents and I thought it would have been more fun if I ’d touched my ear and looked like I was receiving instructions through an implant , nodded and proceeded to change position , rather than merely checking the watch . )
6 . As I hung out on the top floor , hoping to overhear something being said by the employees talking with the cops , a guy in a black jacket walked up and warned me , “ You ’re going to have to leave .
The police are going to start arresting people if you do n’t leave . ”
I had been talking with an employee at that moment , and as the man moved away I looked at the employee with a confused expression and asked “ Do we know him ? ”
The employee said nothing .
I asked , “ Does he work here ? ” but the employee moved away .
I still do n’t know if the man worked for the store .
He might have been an undercover agent of the store .
7 . Another employee — or the same one ; they all dress alike , I noticed — asked “ You guys all together ?
You come as a group ? ” I gave him my patented blank look .
“ What do you mean ?
I ’m just here by myself . ”
Like the other very confused employees , he was n’t sure how to follow up on this line of questioning and went away .
8. Being as I was near the very front door of the store at 4:45 , I was perhaps the first person told by the police to vacate .
“ Are you shopping ? ” said the policeman .
“ No , I ’m just waiting . ”
“ All the people wearing blue shirts who are not employees of Best Buy have to leave right now .
You have to leave right now . ”
I obliged , looking inconvenienced .
Agent Firth
I was one of the earlier entries into the store and as I walked around trying to get a feel for the layout I overheard some employees already on alert .
One of them was giving orders to the others , “ Eyes open .
Eyes open .
Anyone wearing a blue shirt .
Eyes open . ’
I found a comfortable spot by a pillar in front of a TV .
I hoped I could look like a bored employee to random customers and like a bored customer to random employees .
Almost immediately somebody asked me for help finding a certain Bose speaker system .
I told the customer I was n’t sure but I ’d get one of the women who work in this section to help him .
I found two female employees chatting and said , “ There ’s a customer who wants help finding Bose speakers .
Can you help him ? ”
They seemed reluctant to , maybe they thought I was trying to give them orders or something , but one of them came and I introduced her to the customer then went back to my post .
One of the male employees was particularly take charge .
He questioned me early on about what was going on .
The typical “ What are you up to ?
/ I have no idea what you ’re talking about ” conversation .
I did let him know that a customer had asked me about speakers and that I had found an employee to help and he said “ Thank you ” and stopped questioning me .
Another customer got my attention in a more rude way by snapping his fingers and saying hello then going into the aisle a few rows down before waiting for a response .
So I followed him to where he was with his wife looking at cordless phones .
He seemed to be ignoring me so I asked , “ Were you talking to me ? ” and he replied “ Yes ” very annoyed and asked me something about the frequencies .
So once again I hooked them up with an employee .
I continued to do that for the rest of the questions I received .
One customer got particularly annoyed .
She came up demanding , “ Do you work here ? ”
When I said I did n’t she said , “ Then why are you wearing a blue shirt ?
You should n’t come here in that shirt . ”
She too got taken care of by a real employee .
After some time the employee who had questioned and thanked me earlier came back really pissed .
We had a conversation that went something like :
“ I ’m going to have to ask you to leave . ”
“ You ’re kicking me out ? ”
“ No , I ’m not saying that . ”
“ Ok , then I can stay ? ”
“ You ’re not buying anything . ”
“ I ’m waiting for my friend , just watching TV while I wait . ”
“ I ’m asking you to leave . ”
“ Are you kicking me out ? ”
“ No . ”
This repeated in various versions until eventually he conceded with , “ Fine , just do what you have to do . ”
Agent Todd also overheard him add , “ Have fun , ” as he walked away .
A little while later a more managerial guy came by simply saying , “ You can stay there , but just do n’t help our customers . ”
Before I could respond he was already moving on to give the warning to the next blue shirt in sight .
I grew tired of my spot and walked around .
I went to a bathroom that I had seen on my initial scout of the store but when I got to it I noticed it had an Employees Only sign .
I considered it for a moment , but I did n’t want to push my trespassing luck so I moved on .
The last and best - overheard moment was two employees who were actually getting a kick out of the whole thing saying , “ These guys rock ! ”
They started discussing some part they needed .
“ You ’ve got to go to the warehouse and get it yourself … or send one of these guys to do it . ”
The other guy agreed he should send me .
Mission Accomplished .

Sources say no serious plot for NYC , just hate chatter Larisa Alexandrovna
Published : Friday July 7 , 2006 Print This | Email

One former intelligence field officer says , and two other CIA officials confirm , that the alleged plot by Muslim extremists to bomb the Holland Tunnel in New York City was nothing more than chatter by unaffiliated individuals with no financing or training in an open forum already monitored extensively by the United States Government , RAW STORY has learned .
 The so - called New York tunnel plot was a result of discussions held on an open Jihadi web site ,  said Philip Giraldi , a former CIA officer and contributor to American Conservative magazine , in a late Friday afternoon conversation .
Although Giraldi acknowledges that the persons involved  three of whom have already been arrested in Lebanon and elsewhere - are indeed extremists , " their online chatter is considerably overblown by allegations of an actual plot .
 They are not professionally trained terrorists , however , and had no resources with which to carry out the operation they discussed , " Giraldi added .
" Despite press reports that they had asked Abu Musab Zarqawi for assistance , there is no information to confirm that .
It is known that the members discussed the possibility of approaching Zarqawi but none of them knew him or had any access to him .
Two other intelligence officials with experience in the field on extremist operations concurred -- and expressed concern that what could have been an operation to eventually track known extremists ( should they eventually make actual contact with funds and training , ) seems to have been exposed for political gain .
Some see this latest ploy as a direct challenge to a New York Times report earlier this week of the disbandment of Alec Station , the CIA unit responsible for tracking Osama bin Laden since before the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
Moreover , the article contends that officials say the unit was disbanded late last year and its analysts reassigned within the C.I.A. Counterterrorist Center .
Some members of Congress have said that they were not informed of the units closure and expressed concern .
In response to reports that the unit was disbanded , Senator John Kerry ( D - MA ) , who ran against President Bush in the 2004 election , responded earlier this week with a demand for the immediate reinstatement of the unit .
 I fully support efforts to adapt our response to the evolving nature of the threat , " wrote Kerry in a letter to John Negroponte , Director of National Intelligence Office of the Director of National , " but this is not a compelling rationale for curtailing efforts to bring this mass murderer to justice . "
The alleged bomb plot , sources suggest , may have been to alleviate Bush administration concerns that the Alec Station story would make them appear to be " weak on terror . "
It is not clear this early on , however , how much of a real and immediate threat the bomb plot may have been .
Director of Homeland Security Michael Chertof seemed unconcerned earlier today , when the news first broke .
Chertoff said at a press conference Friday , " It was never a concern that this would actually be executed We were , as I say , all over this . "
The FBI , however , contends that the threat was very much real .
" This is a plot that involved martyrdom and explosives , " targeting the " tubes that connect Jersey and lower Manhattan , " Assistant Director Mark J. Mershon told the Associated Press today .
Special Agent Rich Kolko , a spokesperson for the FBI , told RAW STORY in a late Friday phone call that ,  Mr. Mershon clearly stated the position of the FBI in this case . 
 In sum , the plot , if that is what we would call it , was not well conceived , and there was no possibility of flooding Wall Street , " Giraldi added .
" There was no connection to a cell in the US .
Finally , professional terrorists generally do not discuss targeting on open channels .
As it was being monitored from the beginning of the open discussion , there was little chance anything concrete would have developed . "
Diethylene glycol , a poisonous ingredient in some antifreeze , has been found in 6,000 tubes of toothpaste in Panama , and customs officials there said yesterday that the product appeared to have originated in China .
“ Our preliminary information is that it came from China , but we do n’t know that with certainty yet , ” said Daniel Delgado Diamante , Panama ’s director of customs .
“ We are still checking all the possible imports to see if there could be other shipments . ”
Some of the toothpaste , which arrived several months ago in the free trade zone next to the Panama Canal , was re-exported to the Dominican Republic in seven shipments , customs officials said .
A newspaper in Australia reported yesterday that one brand of the toothpaste had been found on supermarket shelves there and had been recalled .
Diethylene glycol is the same poison that the Panamanian government inadvertently mixed into cold medicine last year , killing at least 100 people .
Records show that in that episode the poison , falsely labeled as glycerin , a harmless syrup , also originated in China .
Created by Viktor Zykov , this autonomous Starfish robot “ works out its own model of itself and can revise the model to adapt to injury : first , it teaches itself to walk ; then , when damaged , it teaches itself to limp . ”

The underlying algorithm , the researchers said , could be applied to much more complex machines and also could allow robots to adapt to changes in environment and repair themselves by replacing parts .
The work also could have other applications in computing and could lead to better understanding of animal cognition .
In a way , Bongard said , the robot is “ conscious ” on a primitive level , because it thinks to itself , “ What would happen if I do this ? ”

Mozilla continues to try and please the public by releasing even more updates to the default theme that will ship in Firefox 2 .
They have changed the Refresh button so that it looks more sleek than the previous one and how about that Home icon ?
I definitely do n’t think it fits in with the rest but I do love how it stands out .
Also , when you hover over buttons on the toolbars you will see a border appear around it .
In previous milestone builds it was difficult to tell when you were hovering over one of your bookmarks on the toolbar but now it is much better .
I also notice that the icons , especially the small ones , are much brighter .
I think the small ones are even brighter than the large ones which you can compare below .
New Home and Refresh buttons :
New folder icon :
Tabs ( background tab , background tab being hovered over , and current tab ) :
Mozilla is really pulling the new theme together and I think a lot of people are starting to warm up to it .
It does take a little getting used to but the whole glossy appearance fits in very well with Vista which is important .

Thanks for the tip “ C ” !

11 months ago I almost quit my IT support job with a large Accounting company .
Jay , the owner of Dumb Little Man , and my best friend , told me to list 25 things I could personally do to get ahead .
I was skeptical because I seriously hated this place but I made the list because I had nothing to lose but time and I did n’t want to start to job search .
I could n’t come up with 25 so we settled on 20 .
He then tweaked it a little saying that it was too easy to fulfill .
Anyway , I took the list and posted it on my cubicle wall .
I read that damn thing every morning when I got into the office .
To this day , I still have it practically memorized .
Last Friday , I was promoted and I actually moved up 2 spots so I am now earning an extra $ 15 K year .
Kind of nice if you ask me .
Here are the missions we put together : I will work and think as if I were the SVP of my IT group .
This will include how I interact in meetings , with co-workers in the hall , etc .
This will train me for the future .
If I ever decide I do n’t like the company I work for , I will still act like the SVP because that is the position I want .
I will not become a complaining , gossiping troll because my reputation will follow me .
I will look for areas that my company fails .
One day I will fix that failure by starting my own company .
I will be the guy to speak out with new ideas in meetings .
If it ’s going to save money or increase revenues , I will never be out of line .
I will lead others and show my strengths because someday I may want these people to work for me .
I will finish everything I start .
I am not going to mentally bail on a project .
I will shut up and listen when I do n’t know 110 % .
I will study new trends so I am the guy with the good idea .
Regardless of what my boss says , I will review myself each month and then ask for help where I need it .
My company can train me so that I can move on .
If they ask for 132 TPS reports , I will do them .
One day I may ask an employee of mine for similar reports ( even though it ’s repulsive to think ) .
I will speak my mind in the face of rejection when I am confident that my idea is a winner .
I will know how competitors do things so I can suggest better solutions in meetings .
I will not bend to process bureaucracy .
If the customer needs it , we have to figure it out .
I will learn as much as possible about the roles people play in my company .
One day I will have to fill those roles .
I am able to recite my 5 - year goal at any time .
Resume builders are nice but I am pushing for seminars that will train ME .
I will dress more professionally then the rest on casual Friday .
On internal conference calls , I will ask questions .
Not dumb annoying ones , but questions that pertain to the company ’s EPS or EBITDA .
I will be in the office before my boss ’ boss 90 % of the time .
I will leave the office after my boss 100 % of the time .
A lot of Jay ’s list irritated me but in 30 days things got a helluva lot better .
In retrospect , it was n’t the job making me upset , I just had an ego problem – I felt like I was better than everyone else .
After I followed through on my list , I proved I was better .
I know a lot of you may call some of this ass kissing but I was pretty blunt in these meetings and it was n’t my boss that promoted me – it was his boss .
The job was never even officially posted .
I am now a firm believer that leaders are winners .
This list is coming with me wherever I go .
Take it or leave it .

T his is the sound of a presidential boomlet .
Not that it seems like that at the moment .
It ’s Friday evening , January 12 , and America ’s Mayor , copyright pending , finds himself in Wilmington , Delaware , at the crusty Hotel du Pont , for what appears to be a routine stop on the rubber - sole - and - rice - pilaf circuit .
Tonight , Rudolph Giuliani is receiving an award at an annual gala held by former governor Pete du Pont , the preppy descendent of the hotel ’s founder who is best known for conducting an honorable pro-choice 1988 presidential campaign , which , as Rudy must surely know , resulted in zero delegates .
The 300 Republicans arriving for cocktails look desperately in need of them .
And with good reason .
It ’s just two days after the speech in which President Bush conceded , sort of , that mistakes were made in Iraq , then unveiled his plan to send 20,000 more troops there .
Congress has just reverted to the Democrats , and Hillarymania and Obamamania are sucking up all the political oxygen .
Rudy is cranky , too .
The year is barely two weeks old , and it ’s already off to an epically bad start .
Right after New Year ’s , a 126 - page confidential campaign memo concerning a potential Giuliani presidential run fell into the hands of the Daily News .
His campaign had n’t even begun , and there was already a crisis .
It was hard to tell which was more embarrassing : the cataloguing of Rudy ’s potential weaknesses or the battle plans outlining the courting of GOP moneymen already committed to John McCain .
It all suggested a kind of amateurism : My First Presidential Campaign brought to you by the folks at Playskool .
A few hours before his speech , Giuliani inadvertently wanders into a sparsely populated press room .
He looks older and wearier than the last time we saw him .
There ’s the same dark suit , but the undertaker hunch is a bit more pronounced .
When a reporter asks what he ’s doing here , Giuliani skips the friendly kibitzing .
Instead he snaps , “ I ’m calling my wife .
I need privacy . ”
It ’s been said that 9/11 softened Rudy ’s edges .
If there really is a kinder , gentler Giuliani , he ’s not showing it .
Right , 9/11 .
Out in the dining room , after the salads are served , Delaware congressman Mike Castle takes the microphone .
He talks about Rudy and the squeegee men .
BlackBerrys continue scrolling .
But then Castle tells of the ground - zero tour the mayor gave him and other congressmen in the days after the terror attacks .
People start to pay attention .
“ He attended most of the funerals ; he was there in every way possible , ” says Castle .
“ I do n’t think we can ever thank him enough for what he did . ”
Now Rudy strides to the podium .
The room rises .
Suits at the cheap tables stand and a banker type sticks his fingers in his mouth and gives a loud whistle .
Initially , Giuliani squanders the goodwill .
A bit on immigration lands with a thud .
He notes that China has built more than 30 nuclear reactors since we last built one .
“ Maybe we should copy China . ”
What ?
You can see the thought bubbles forming over people ’s heads :
Can this be the same guy we saw on television ?
The guy who was so presidential when our actual president was MIA ?
But then Rudy finds his comfort zone .
Along with McCain and Mitt Romney , his best - known fellow Republican presidential contenders , Giuliani is out on the thin , saggy pro-surge limb with the president .
But Rudy can spin the issue in a way McCain and Romney , not to mention Hillary and Barack Obama , cannot .
And now he does just that : Iraq leads to 9/11 , which leads to the sacred image of construction workers raising the flag over ground zero .
“ I knew what they were standing on top of , ” Giuliani says .
“ They were standing on top of a cauldron .
They were standing on top of fires 2,000 degrees that raged for a hundred days .
And they put their lives at risk raising that flag . ”
The room is silent .
Not a fork hits a plate , not one gold bracelet rattles .
“ They put the flag up to say , ‘ You ca n’t beat us , because we ’re Americans . ’ ”
The mayor pauses and , as if on cue , an old woman sniffles .
He continues .
“ And we do n’t say this with arrogance or in a militaristic way , but in a spiritual way : Our ideas are better than yours . ”
Applause reverberates off the chandeliers .
Millionaires pump fists .
Dowagers daub eyes .
This is what they came to see !
Seemingly every law - enforcement officer in Wilmington appears with a camera .
Over and over , Giuliani grips and grins .
It may sound preposterous to a Rudy - savvy New Yorker .
But in this ballroom full of lock - jawed Wasps , it sounds like presidential salvation .
Can Rudy Giuliani ride 9/11 all the way to the White House ?
That appears to be his game plan .
Beginning that night in Wilmington , Giuliani spent much of the first two months of the year barnstorming around the country — New Hampshire , South Carolina , California — on his unofficial presidential - campaign rollout tour ( unless you count his multiple pseudo - announcements , Giuliani has yet to formally declare his candidacy ) .
In many respects , it ’s been the standard early - season - campaign drill : Rudy has floated and discarded whole concepts , artfully repositioned his personal history , and studiously avoided all but the most friendly media .

On most issues , his spiel does n’t sound that different from those of McCain and Romney .
But there ’s one exception .
Over and over again , wherever he goes , America ’s Mayor evokes 9/11 .
And over and over again , wherever he goes , people cheer .
Whenever Rudy talks about anything other than the September 11 terror attacks , he ’s just another Republican presidential hopeful with his particular set of strengths and weaknesses .
When he talks about 9/11 , he becomes something else : a national hero .
New Yorkers may find that hard to believe .
Anyone who lived here at the time remembers the 9/10 Rudy : strong on crime and the economy , yes , but arrogant , bullying , and terrible on race and civil rights .
And while it ’s impossible not to respect what Giuliani did for the city on 9/11 and in the days afterward , New Yorkers have experienced an inevitable September 11 fatigue .
The 9/11 story has been told so many times that the Rudy - as - hero narrative , however moving , has lost much of its power .
Except for those who have a personal connection to the tragedy , people have generally moved on .
Besides , it ’s common knowledge that a pro-choice , pro-gun - control , pro-gay - rights , thrice - married Catholic northeastern Republican is unelectable , right ?
The rest of America sees a far different Rudy .
West of the Hudson , the 9/10 Rudy does n’t exist and never did .
For them , September 11 was never so much a real day as a distant televised drama .
It has more symbolic meaning than actual meaning :
It ’s equal parts Pearl Harbor and resurrection .
And guess who plays the role of national savior ?
Not George Bush .
Not John McCain .
Not Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton .
Once the rest of the country sees Giuliani up close , the conventional New York wisdom once held , his campaign will surely fold .
So far , exactly the opposite has happened .
The more Rudy has put himself out there , the higher his numbers have climbed .
Last week , a CBS poll showed Giuliani leading McCain by a whopping 21 points while a Quinnipiac survey found Giuliani running five points ahead of Hillary nationally , and dead even in blue states .
Yes , Rudy is the new horse in the race and thus , for now , the most compelling .
Much of his popularity comes from the fact that he ’s entered the race just as McCain ’s ties to George Bush ’s Iraq policy threaten to render his once inevitable nomination stillborn .
At the same time , an idea has taken root that the 70 - year - old Arizona senator , cancer survivor , and former POW , who would be the oldest person ever elected president , wo n’t be up to the job .
Giuliani ’s pro-war stance and his moderate social - issue positions may yet bury him .
So could a lack of money , a green campaign staff , his thin political résumé , his trifecta of marriages , and , not least of all , the fact that the 9/11 card , however powerful it is , could simply prove too flimsy to carry him all the way to the White House .
With 21 months to go before Election Day , there ’s still more than enough time for McCain to reassert himself — or any number of other scenarios to play out that do n’t involve Giuliani ’s becoming president .
Still , no Republican presidential candidate in modern history has held this big a lead a year out and not scored the GOP nomination .
Believe it or not , America ’s Mayor could be America ’s next president .
I t’s nine below zero in Bretton Woods , deep in New Hampshire ’s North Country .
The snow crackles under a cavalcade of SUVs creeping up the driveway of the mammoth Mount Washington Hotel .
The hotel once hosted FDR for a pivotal 1944 conference on postwar monetary policy .
Now here ’s Rudy speaking at the Littleton Chamber of Commerce ’s annual supper .
It makes sense , of course .
New Hampshire still holds the nation ’s first primary , and Rudy needs to test his material way , way out of town .
On this , Giuliani ’s first ’07 trip to the state , he has his third wife , Judi , in tow .
The would - be First Couple looks a bit mismatched as they say hello to a pack of Girl Scouts stationed near the door selling cookies .
Judi is all glamour in pearls and a black turtleneck .
Rudy is in need of an ear - hair trimmer .
But Giuliani proves he ’s no George Bush the Elder — he whips out a fist - size wad of cash and gives the girls $ 80 for $ 70 worth of cookies .
September 11 comes up even faster than Rudy could have expected .
One of the scouts tells Giuliani that she lost a cousin that day .
Rudy smiles a bit and touches her on the shoulder while Judi gives her a hug .
The girl asks how the mayor made it through that day .
“ With the help of loved ones , ” he replies .
The little girl smiles .
Afterward , I ask the girl what her cousin ’s name was .
“ I do n’t know , I never met him , ” she says .
By now , another blonde girl , maybe 11 , is tugging on the mayor ’s sleeve .
“ You ’ve been my hero since 9/11 . ”

There ’s more 9/11 bathos — New Hampshire seems awash in it .
Holding hands , Rudy and Judi are shuttled into a conference room for photos .
When Rudy emerges , Jan Mercieri , the wife of a local fire chief , asks him to autograph Portraits : 9/11/01 , the New York Times book of short biographies of the 9/11 dead .
Giuliani signs , Mercieri gets teary , and they embrace .
Mercieri is then deluged by the media pack .
What did he say ?
What did he write ?
What does she think about his stance on abortion ?
“ Those issues do n’t matter , ” said Mercieri .
“ After 9/11 , I ’d vote for him in a second . ”
Up on the dais , it ’s Rudy ’s turn to raise the subject of the terror attacks .
September 11 is proving to be a versatile tool .
In Delaware , he used it to invoke heroism .
Here , it ’s all about scaring the bejesus out of country folk .
Someone asks him what his management style would be as president if there was another Katrina or terrorist attack .
The secret is to be prepared for anything , Rudy says .
Terrorism can happen in New York or Boston or in Shanksville , Pennsylvania , “ one of the smallest towns in the United States . ”
The punchy good cheer of this small town is replaced with grave attention .
Rudy notes that he once spoke to the Shanksville high - school graduating class .
“ But for the grace of God and the bravery of the people who brought that plane down , ” he says , “ those kids would n’t be with us . ”
Tonight ’s attendees , of course , have a far greater chance of being killed on an icy road on the way home tonight than via a plane falling out of the sky .
But those are facts ; Giuliani is playing on emotion and fear .
After his speech , Rudy never gets a chance to eat .
There are too many people wanting pictures , too many people wanting a hug , too many people offering one variation or another of what one woman says : “ Thank you for keeping us safe . ”
Before 9/11 , the idea of Rudy Giuliani running for president would have been laughable .
That morning , Giuliani had breakfast at the Peninsula Hotel with Bill Simon , a longtime friend .
Simon , a business executive and the son of a former Treasury secretary , was contemplating a 2002 California gubernatorial bid .
Giuliani agreed to help , but was n’t sure he would be of much assistance .
“ I could endorse your opponent , ” joked Giuliani .
“ That might help you more . ”
A few minutes later , Giuliani ’s cell phone rang .
As the towers fell , President Bush read a children ’s story , and Dick Cheney disappeared into a bunker , Rudy Giuliani was in harm ’s way .
By 11 a.m. , he was on television asking for calm .
That night , he famously proclaimed , “ New York is still here .
We ’ve undergone tremendous losses and we ’re going to grieve for them horribly , but New York is going to be here tomorrow morning .
And it ’s going to be here forever . ”
By the end of that day , Rudy was no longer just a big - city mayor with a mixed record .
He was a legend .
September 11 has been Giuliani ’s alpha and omega ever since .
After leaving office , the mayor formed Giuliani Partners , an omnibus security - consulting firm .
Giuliani offered his clients his post - 9/11 expertise — and his gold - plated name ; in return , they paid handsomely and basked in his fame .
Mexico City paid Giuliani ’s firm more than $ 4 million to help make its city safe .
The makers of OxyContin hired Giuliani to beef up their security , and to help persuade the federal government not to curtail access to what came to be called “ hillbilly heroin . ”
( Giuliani recently moved to divest himself of the investment - banking arm of Giuliani Partners , Giuliani Capital Advisors , to avoid potential conflicts . )
Giuliani became a rock star on the speaking circuit .
At first , he did the events for free .
Eventually , he would charge $ 100,000 an outing .
Last year , Forbes estimates , Giuliani made $ 8 million from speaking gigs .
Since 2002 , Giuliani has also used his 9/11 fame to help his fellow Republicans , stumping for more than 200 of them , and collecting valuable political chits in return .
In a three - day period the weekend before the 2006 elections , as we learned from the leaked campaign memo , Giuliani appeared on behalf of GOP candidates in Florida , Virginia , Maryland , Michigan , Minnesota , New Hampshire , and Pennsylvania .
Everywhere he went , he played the 9/11 card , dismissing the Democrats as squishy on terror .
More often than not , it worked .
“ Ask anyone , and they will tell you that their Giuliani event raised the most money , ” says Ralph Reed .
( Last year , Giuliani campaigned for the former director of the Christian Coalition during his unsuccessful , scandal - marred run for Georgia lieutenant governor . )
“ People do n’t forget that . ”
On Meet the Press the Sunday before the 2004 election , Giuliani told Tim Russert that Osama bin Laden “ wants George Bush out of the White House . ”
It may have been crude , it may have been crass , but just about everyone allowed it was effective .

Why does 9/11 play so well for Rudy ?
Our Calvinist streak dictates that the greater the adversity a man overcomes , the more we worship him — and Rudy certainly overcame adversity on 9/11 .
“ Here on the coasts , we make fun of heroes , ” says presidential historian Douglas Brinkley .
“ We think it ’s hokey .
But the rest of America craves heroes .
To them , Rudy ’s like Eisenhower .
Mothers bring their sons to see him . ”
Post - 9/11 events have only made Giuliani more exalted .
The more the war on terror bogs down , the better he looks .
September 11 has spawned two wars , cost us 6,000 American lives here and abroad , and produced precious few heroes .
Those we got wilted under scrutiny .
Donald Rumsfeld turned out to be a nut job , Jessica Lynch may or may not have actually needed to be rescued , and Pat Tillman was killed by friendly fire .
There have been no Pattons , no MacArthurs , no Eisenhowers .
There is only Rudy .
Outside of New York , there is a still - unsatisfied appetite for revenge ( that hunger seems to get stronger , strangely enough , the farther one gets from ground zero ) .
Bin Laden is still at large .
Saddam Hussein , it ’s now tragically clear , had nothing to do with the terror attacks , however awful his other transgressions were .
People seem to believe — wish ? — that Rudy can somehow bring us justice .
Who else could at this point ?
To many Americans , Rudy fills the leadership vacuum created by Bush ’s bungling of the war and Katrina .
Joe Trippi , Howard Dean ’s former campaign manager , recalls running a Democratic focus group for a 2005 mayoral candidate in Los Angeles .
“ We were asking what they were looking for in a leader , ” Trippi says .
“ One guy said , ‘ Why ca n’t we have someone like Rudy ? ’
Then everyone joined in , saying ‘ Yeah , we need a Rudy .
We need a Rudy . ’ ” Those were Democrats , and this was 2005 .
“ It ’s still that forceful , ” says Trippi .
September 11 also gives Giuliani at least some credibility on the signature issue of the campaign : Iraq .
So what if Rudy does n’t have a shred of foreign - policy experience ?
The perception goes something like this : hero of 9/11 = expert in the war on terror = strong commander - in - chief .
September 11 could even help Rudy win over the hard right .
Evangelicals see the war on terror as nothing less than a metaphysical battle for the soul of Christianity , with Rudy the Lionheart as their crusader .
“ Rudy has created great brand equity on terrorism with Christians , ” says Reed .
“ They wo n’t give him a pass , but they ’ll listen on the other issues . ”
Rudy ’s comment suggests a broader point : 9/11 gives Rudy a kind of golden glow that makes all his positives seem a bit more positive and all his negatives a bit less negative .
Never mind the southern hospitality and softly swaying palmetto trees .
South Carolina is the killing fields of Republican presidential politics .
Just ask John McCain .
He arrived in 2000 , fresh from his win in New Hampshire , as the Republican front - runner .
Two weeks and a flurry of push - poll attacks later ( telephone polling suggesting McCain fathered a black child out of wedlock was the most notorious ) , he was finished .
Eight years later , on a February Saturday , Rudy Giuliani arrives in Columbia to address the South Carolina Republican Party .
Outside Seawell ’s conference center , there are rumors that a pro-life picket line is going to materialize .
It does n’t , another break in a month of breaks for Rudy .
Inside , it ’s a folksy affair .
Chairman Katon Dawson , an excitable auto - parts salesman , gavels the meeting to order .
He then asks the county chairs to introduce any guests .
Fishing buddies and dads stand up and wave .
This takes a while .
Finally , Dawson introduces Giuliani .
There ’s mention of Rudy ’s crime - busting , budget - balancing ways — and , of course , September 11 .
“ Rudy Giuliani , ” says Dawson , “ is known around the world as a symbol of the resilience of the American spirit . ”
In seven minutes and change , Giuliani goes to 9/11 .
“ Before September 11 , we were playing defense , ” he says .
“ President Bush said we ca n’t do that anymore .
We have to go on offense .
We have to go look for them and stop them before they come here and attack us . ”
This may be the only place in Christendom where Bush is still popular .
Everyone cheers .
“ The next president of the United State is going to have to continue to deal with this , ” says Giuliani .
“ If you do n’t think you ’re going to have to deal with it , you ’re not looking at the real world and you ’re not going to be able to keep this country safe . ”
There ’s more clapping ( although it ’s unclear which presidential candidate thinks the war on terror is about to end .
Dennis Kucinich ? ) .
Giuliani throws the crowd a few extra chocolates , parroting the White House line of Bush as Truman , a prophet who will be vindicated by history .
It ’s not until Giuliani has deposited as much 9/11 goodwill in the bank as possible that he addresses the real issue of the day .
Dawson solicits questions from friendly faces .
Eventually , someone asks Giuliani what his approach would be to judicial appointments .
“ On the federal judiciary , I would want judges who are strict constructionists , ” Giuliani answers .
“ I have a very , very strong view that for this country to work , for our freedoms to be protected , judges have to interpret , not invent , the Constitution . ”
Down here , of course , constructionist is code for pro-life .
Supporting constructionist judges while remaining pro-choice is a Clinton - quality triangulation :
It keeps the pro-lifers at bay without a Romney - esque flip on abortion .
Half the crowd whoops , half sit on their hands .
No one boos , perhaps out of deference to 9/11 .
But even 9/11 has its limits .
Later , I do a little push - polling of my own .
I ask Max Kaster , a local pastor and party chair for Calhoun County , a half - hour south of Columbia , what people down here would think of America ’s Mayor if they knew he had moved in with a gay couple after separating from his second wife .
“ Really ? ” Kaster says .
He fiddles with a lapel pin that combines an American flag and a cross .
“ I think that would roll a lot of people ’s socks down . ”
September 11 or no September 11 , Rudy ’s still vulnerable on social issues .
No matter how skillful his pandering , there are those on the right who simply wo n’t vote for a pro-choice , pro-gun - control , pro-gay - rights candidate .
Giuliani ’s supporters like to point out that the South is trending more moderate .
Still , Rudy is seeking an office that has been held by a centrist southern Democrat or right - leaning Republican southerner or westerner for four decades .
The last president from the northeast was JFK .
It ’s true that 9/11 gives Rudy credibility on Iraq , but not much .
If the war continues to go badly — as just about everyone believes it will — Rudy ’s pro-Bush , pro-surge stance , like McCain ’s or anyone else ’s , for that matter , could still derail him .
Rudy ’s lack of experience is a weakness as well .
The highest elected office Giuliani has ever held is mayor , and no one has ever made the leap straight from City Hall to the White House .
The chatter among political insiders is that even 9/11 ca n’t cover that up .
“ There ’s a reason Giuliani ’s using 9/11 as an asset , ” says Bob Shrum , political consultant to a half - dozen Democratic presidential candidates ( not to mention David Dinkins ) .
“ It ’s his only asset .
He ’s not even running on his mayoral record .
He ’s running on a few weeks .
September 11 does n’t change the fact that Rudy has no foreign - policy experience , and his foreign - policy record is limited to having the same position on Iraq as George Bush . ”
Rudy ’s campaign team is green in terms of national elections .
His inner circle remains the same as that of a decade ago : Peter Powers , a longtime Rudy friend and former chief deputy mayor , lawyer Dennison Young , aide de camp and former chief of staff Anthony Carbonetti , and spokeswoman Sunny Mindel .
Outsiders are viewed with skepticism , and Memogate , to their way of thinking , only justified that attitude .
( Fingers were quickly pointed at Anne Dickerson , the campaign ’s head fund - raiser and a former Bushie .
She was summarily demoted to consultant . )
Naming Mike DuHaime as campaign manager in December did n’t particularly impress political pros .
Although talented , the 33 - year - old DuHaime is not a proven winner .
In 2000 , he was deputy campaign manager of a failed New Jersey Senate run .
In 2004 , he ran Bush - Cheney ’s Northeast campaign , which resulted in no breakthroughs and the switching of New Hampshire from red to blue .
In the last cycle , DuHaime was the RNC political director in the year when the GOP gave back Congress .
On the policy side of the campaign , Giuliani insiders speak reverentially about the candidate being put through “ Simon University , ” a series of informal public - policy seminars chaired by Bill Simon .
Alas , Simon is perceived in his native California as something of a lightweight .
His 2002 California gubernatorial bid was essentially a series of train wrecks punctuated by the release of a photo purporting to show then - Governor Gray Davis receiving a campaign check in his office , an illegal act .
The only problem was , the image turned out to be from somebody ’s home .
In New Hampshire , Giuliani hired outgoing state party chairman Wayne Semprini as his state director .
Semprini was party chair for only one year , just long enough for his party to lose two congressional seats and the statehouse .
In Iowa , Giuliani has been slow out of the gate ; his biggest announcement was the support of Congressman Jim Nussle .
Like Simon , Nussle ’s claim to fame was a failed 2006 gubernatorial campaign .
Money - wise , Rudy has lined up some top - shelf donors , including Home Depot founder and former New York Stock Exchange director Kenneth Langone , whose Wall Street connections could bring millions .
He also has the support of Roy Bailey , a former finance chair of the Texas Republican Party who provided some of the seed money for Giuliani Partners .
Last month , Bailey organized a Houston fund - raiser for Rudy that raised hundreds of thousands of dollars .
In California , Bill Simon recently coordinated a series of well - attended fund - raising events as well .
But John McCain ’s alliance with Bush , reluctant though it may have been , locked up GOP rainmakers like Texan Robert Mosbacher and lobbyist Thomas Loeffler a long time ago .
And because Rudy was relatively late to the table , he may have missed landing the support of potentially sympathetic high rollers like Henry Kravis .
Still , it ’s early in the game for everyone — no one has yet raised anywhere near the money they ’ll eventually need — and money flows from poll numbers .
Anyone who can get and maintain a lead still has enough time to raise a fortune .
If all of those issues were n’t enough , there ’s also Rudy ’s temper .
Sooner or later , Giuliani will have to endure scrutiny — and lots of it — on issues he does n’t want to talk about .
September 11 may well have mellowed Rudy ( friends insist it genuinely has ) , but it remains to be seen if he can avoid being baited into exhibiting the kind of behavior that once made Jimmy Breslin call him “ a small man in search of a balcony . ”
Maybe not .
In California , I asked Giuliani if he has , in fact , softened .
He laughed dismissively , then said , “ Is there a mellower version of me ?
I do n’t know .
Other people are a much better judge of what versions there are of me .
I am who I am . ”
When you see Rudy and Judi together , it ’s clear the couple is in love ( a point they may have made too forcefully in an over - the - top March Harper ’s Bazaar photo spread ) .
And while some people see Judi as too slick for Middle America to embrace , others say she softens him .
Regardless , the Judi game is tricky .
One way or another , seeing her reminds people of the infamous Donna Hanover affair ( Rudy informed the mother of his two children that he was divorcing her via press conference ) , not to mention the fact that Rudy ’s first marriage was annulled on the grounds that he unwittingly married his second cousin ( his defense was that he thought she was his third cousin ) .
Even 9/11 , Rudy ’s alleged magic bullet , could prove problematic .
At some point , Rudy will inevitably air ads featuring heroic shots of him at ground zero with a voice - over that sounds something like , “ On America ’s darkest day , one man stood tall . ”
But overplaying 9/11 in any way is not without peril .
“ With most presidents , there ’s a modesty to their heroism , ” says Brown University historian and former Clinton speechwriter Ted Widmer .
“ George H.W. Bush was a war hero , but he did n’t talk about it .
Eisenhower never used it .
You have to be careful not to overinflate it . ”
Or September 11 could simply lose its power .
Right now , 9/11 is about all most voters know about Giuliani .
“ He ’s like McCain in 2000 , ” says Mark McKinnon , the former George W. Bush consultant who is now working with McCain .
“ He ’s a vessel people are pouring things into . ”
But in time , that could change .
“ Giuliani has legions of fans in the Republican Party , including President Bush , John McCain , and me , ” McKinnon is careful to note .
“ But I think the traditional physics of a presidential Republican primary will be difficult . ”
That ’s a savvy political pro’s way of saying his opponent will get creamed when the press starts looking more closely at him .
Then again , McKinnon allows , “ Conventional wisdom could go out the door , and the celebrity Rudy justly deserves will allow him to soar above the usual fray , and he ’ll be president . ”
In the end , of course , elections are about matchups .
Right now , Romney , mired in single digits , is not a factor , which means the bid for the Republican nomination for the moment appears to be a two - man race : Giuliani vs. McCain .
In certain respects , Rudy measures up well in that fight .
Yes , the two men hold essentially the same position on Iraq .
The difference is that Giuliani is linked with Bush at ground zero in all the macho swaggering ways .
McCain is linked to Bush as a bumbling quagmire creator .
McCain may have conducted the war better if he had been president and he may have been an articulate critic of the Bush - Rummy fiasco , but voters see him as part of the problem , not part of the solution ( assuming a solution exists ) .
To them , McCain is a Washington insider walking lockstep with a hugely unpopular president .
For the time being , anyway , Giuliani gets the 9/11 free pass .
In the battle for the hearts and minds of the religious right and social conservatives , neither Rudy nor McCain will ever be accused of being a movement conservative .
In 2000 , McCain called Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson “ agents of intolerance ” for their role in smearing him in South Carolina .
He ’s since made peace with both men , and even spoke at Falwell ’s Liberty University .
Last week , McCain announced that as president he would support the repeal of Roe v. Wade .
The move was viewed by some observers as the senator ’s first direct reaction to Giuliani , an explicit statement to the Christian right that he is on their side while Rudy , despite his constructionist - judges talk , is still officially pro-choice .
Still , true believers can carry a grudge , and they ’ve never liked McCain .
And Rudy can play the 9/11 - crusader angle to try to counter his morally wayward ways .
In the end , however , McCain may have the more meaningful advantages .
Not only do his fund - raising and campaign operations compare favorably with Giuliani’s , but McCain has done this before .
He ’s also got a heroic story of his own , and he can clobber Rudy on the experience issue ( four - term senator , ranking member of the Armed Services committee , champion of campaign - finance reform ) .
But let ’s say Iraq continues to implode , and McCain proves too tarnished by his association with Bush to survive the fallout .
No other credible candidate emerges , and Rudy somehow convinces Republican America that his handling of 9/11 and his stewardship of the country ’s bluest city qualify him to be their candidate for the highest office in the land .
Let ’s say Rudy wins the nomination .
Then what ?
Conventional wisdom suggests if a Democrat ca n’t get elected president in 2008 , the whole party should just pack it in .
Still , Rudy creates problems for all three of the current front - runners .
His weakness in the primaries — his centrism — would become a strength in a general election ( and he ’d only tack further to the middle at that point ) .
Rudy ’s lack of experience would be mitigated by Hillary ’s , Obama ’s , and Edwards ’s own relatively thin political résumés ( leaving aside her time as First Lady , Hillary ’s got just six years as a senator , while Edwards has only one term , and Obama is in his first term ) .
In some ways , all four candidates are running on image as much as anything .
And Rudy ’s 9/11 pitch is at least as appealing as anything Hillary , Obama , and Edwards are selling .
Still , the defining issue will again be Iraq .
If there ’s no turnaround , there ’s no Rudy victory , certainly not against Obama ( who has opposed the war all along ) or Edwards ( who now calls his war vote a mistake ) .
Ironically , it ’s Giuliani ’s erstwhile 2000 Senate opponent who gives Rudy his best shot .
Hillary Clinton ’s Bush - like refusal to say “ I made a mistake ” makes her somewhat more vulnerable on Iraq .
Rudy , meanwhile , has been careful to leave himself wiggle room on the issue by saying that he recognizes the troop surge may not work ( at the same time , to protect his right flank , he ’s careful to insist that whatever happens in Iraq , the broader war on terror must go on ) .
And despite the fact that she ’s not the demon she once was to the right , Hillary ’s very presence on the ballot will still drive many hard - right Republicans straight to the polling place .
Of course , there is a wild card .
George Will recently called Rudy the best answer to “ the seven - minute question ” :
Which candidate is most capable of analyzing and responding to a global crisis ?
It may be an awful stereotype , but if there ’s another terrorist attack in the summer of 2008 , a lot of suburban moms who may lean toward Hillary or Obama or Edwards will , in the privacy of the voting booth , pull the lever for Rudy .
It ’s a mid-February Tuesday , and Giuliani is in California ’s Central Valley for the opening ceremonies of the World Ag Expo in Tulare , a.k.a .
“ The Greatest Farm Show on Earth . ”
With the Golden State threatening to move up its presidential primary next year to early February , California suddenly looks a lot more important than it used to .
Rudy , in the midst of a weeklong trip , has already spoken to Silicon Valley tycoons , keynoted the state Republican convention , and smoked a cigar with Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Today dawns overcast , but eventually the sun pokes through , giving glimpses of an endless blue sky .
Amid the almond fields , overalls , and talk of irrigation reform , no place in America seems farther away from that gray , dark pit in lower Manhattan .
Still , five minutes into his speech , Rudy Giuliani , casually dressed in blue blazer , black loafers , and a V - neck sweater , finds his way to September 11 .
The mayor begins by admitting he does n’t know much about ag policy , but that he ’s a quick study .
What he does know , he says , he learned on 9/11 .
“ We depend on each other .
I always knew that , but that really got into my heart , my soul , in a way I ’ll never forget , on September 11 , 2001 , ” says Giuliani .
“ You realize how much we depend on each other .
We depend on you a lot for food for sustenance . ”
Rudy ’s taking 9/11 local again , and he keeps working it .
He tells the farmers what they could learn from that day .
“ We made a mistake on energy .
I just met two Marines who were wounded in Fallujah before I came in here .
It is very frustrating in a way that goes deep into our heart ; we got to send monies to our enemies to protect a lifestyle in America .
We ca n’t let it happen with food .
The American farmer is the most productive , most innovative farmer in the world . ”
The crowd cheers .
Giuliani continues with his standard “ They are at war with us ” speech .
But today , he adds a new wrinkle .
“ It was a very , very strange accident of fate or whatever , but I was in London , a half block away from the first bomb that went off a year and a half ago .
I was six miles away when the first plane hit the World Trade Center and one mile away when the second plane it .
I ’ve lived through these attacks . ”
This time , the crowd nods but does n’t clap .
The London addendum hit a bum note .
It ’s as if Rudy ’s trying to make himself out to be the Zelig of terrorism .
For the first time , he might have overplayed 9/11 .
By now , however , the 9/11 song is so familiar that Rudy quickly finds his way back to the beat .
“ They believe their perverted ideas are stronger than our belief in democracy , freedom , decency , and the rule of law . ”
He pauses and surveys the room full of fourth - generation Japanese farmers , tractor salesmen , and a lone bagpipe player .
“ And they ’re wrong .
Absolutely wrong . ”
There is a standing ovation .
After his speech , Giuliani is golf - carted to a nearby exhibition to try out some of the new farm gadgets .
He even screws in a few screws with a newfangled drill .
For no clear reason , a Marine in dress blue is never too far from the mayor ’s side .
“ You ’re gonna run , right ? ” asks a worried farmer .
“ Do n’t let us down . ”
“ I won’t , ” promises Giuliani .
Then the former mayor of New York , standing in a California farm field surrounded by tractors and a two - story - tall thresher , pulls out a Sharpie , and signs a few more autographs .
Many books on time management recommend the practice of thinking of each hour of your time as being worth a specific quantity of money .
It ’s an extension of the “ time is money ” concept .
First you figure out what your hourly rate is , and then you use that as a guide to determine where you should spend your time .
If you want to earn more money , then you must first mentally raise your hourly rate , so you can start doing activities that are worth more .
For example , if you currently earn $ 50 / hour and want to earn $ 75 / hour , then you have to do less and less $ 50 / hour work as you shift to doing $ 75 / hour work .
Brian
Tracy advocates this type of thinking in his time management programs , as do many other time management experts .
I ’ve used this model myself in the past .
I ’ve spent a lot of time considering this paradigm , and at present I have only one problem with it .
It ’s stupid !
It ’s possibly the stupidest paradigm you can use for income generation .
While it seems enticing on the surface , in the long run it will hurt you more than help you .
Let ’s take a look under the hood …
The Good
On the positive side , if you tell yourself that your time is worth $ 50 / hour , then that can help you focus .
It can make you aware of those activities that clearly are n’t worth $ 50 / hour that you might still be doing , especially if you track your time usage with a time log .
Once you become aware that you ’re wasting time on low payoff activities , then you can begin reducing , eliminating , or outsourcing those low payoff tasks .
For example , you could recruit a part - time personal assistant to offload much of the $ 10 / hour and $ 20 / hour work .
My wife runs an online vegetarian magazine , and she has a staff of people working for her including an assistant , editors , and writers to offload much of the work that can be done at a lower hourly rate than her own .
It works great .
This seems like good common sense if you want to improve your productivity .
If you can earn $ 50 / hour , then you should spend as much as your work time as possible doing $ 50 + / hour work , should n’t you ?
Recruit others to do any work that pays less .
The benefits of this particular optimization may be hidden in a large corporate environment where personal productivity is n’t strongly linked to pay , but it ’s very noticeable if you ’re self - employed .
The Bad
The big problem is that when you tell yourself your time is worth $ 50 / hour , you ’re simultaneously telling yourself that it is n’t worth $ 75 / hour or $ 200 / hour or $ 10,000 / hour .
You ’re programming your subconscious mind to limit the range of opportunities you will notice .
Because you wo n’t be on the lookout for $ 10,000 / hour ideas , you ’ll overlook them completely .
If you tell yourself you earn $ 50 / hour , you ’ll think in terms of $ 50 / hour opportunities .
Thinking in terms of an hourly rate may help limit your downside , but it also severely limits your upside .
And that ’s a really bad trade - off , bad enough that it requires me to dismiss this whole paradigm as utterly stupid .
There ’s no way the upside of turning some $ 20 hours into $ 50 hours can compensate for missing those $ 10,000 hours .
That ’s penny - wise , pound - foolish .
One $ 10,000 hour is worth 200 $ 50 hours .
That ’s more than a month of full - time work !
You do n’t need too many of those huge payoff hours to pick up the slack of some of those less productive $ 0 - 20 hours , but if you miss out on even one of those $ 10,000 hours , it ’s a crippling blow that overwhelms all other thoughts about financial productivity .
In the long run , your greatest financial risk is n’t whether you made the mistake of succumbing to doing $ 20 / hour work when you could have done $ 50 / hour work .
Your greatest risk is missing those $ 10,000 hours .
And most people miss out on them completely .
It ’s ironic that people think of being a salaried employee as being low - risk and being an entrepreneur as high - risk .
The reality is just the opposite .
One of the reasons I chose the entrepreneurial path is that it ’s just way too damned risky to be an employee .
I ’m not kidding .
It ’s easy to hit a good number of those $ 10,000 hours as an entrepreneur , but it ’s a lot harder to do so as an employee .
How many $ 10,000 hours did you enjoy this year ?
How rare is it for a $ 50 / hour salaried employee to experience even one of those $ 10,000 hours in the entire course of their career ?
Pretty rare I would say .
Certainly not a normal , expected occurrence .
But this is n’t because such opportunities do n’t exist — it ’s because your limiting beliefs about how much your time is worth prevent you from noticing them .
Simply choosing to believe that it is possible will open the door to allowing it to manifest .
You do n’t need anyone ’s permission to believe you can come up with an idea that you can implement in less than an hour that will earn you an extra $ 10,000 .
Such ideas are naturally plentiful , but you wo n’t notice them until you adopt the right mindset .
Right now as you ’re reading this , such an opportunity is practically staring you in the face , and you ’re completely oblivious to it .
It ’s just like how my colorblindness prevents me from ever seeing the color red as other people can ; it ’s beyond my ability to perceive .
Once you release the brakes and embrace the idea that a single hour of your time could be worth $ 10,000 or more , you ’ll almost immediately begin to notice such opportunities .
I suspect you ’ll uncover the first one in less than 48 hours .
The Ugly
What the heck is $ 50 / hour work anyway ?
Who determines what an hour of your time is worth ?
If you ’re self - employed , then you set your own hourly rate .
And that ’s fine if your work requires hourly billing .
But do n’t fall into the trap of thinking that all of your working time is worth that same hourly rate .
If you do that , you ’ll begin to tune out much more lucrative opportunities .
If you ’re an employee in a corporate environment , then your salary sets your hourly rate , depending on how many hours you typically work each week .
And in this high - risk situation you have a double problem .
First , you have the previously mentioned challenge of getting yourself to think outside the hourly rate box .
But secondly , in corporate environments it ’s rare to find fair incentives for employees to have such breakthroughs .
If you have one of those $ 10,000 hours on the job , you probably wo n’t share in the rewards .
You ’ll just enjoy your usual $ 50 pay for that hour , while the company keeps the other $ 9950 you ’ve created .
At least entrepreneurs and self - employed people get to keep the whole $ 10,000 .
Whom does the hourly rate mindset benefit ?
It benefits those who get to keep the extra value above and beyond that rate .
But because this paradigm suffers an imbalance between value creation and reward , I think it also cripples the will to generate those $ 10,000 ideas .
If you are n’t going to benefit from the extra value you create , then why bother to create it ?
The solution is to think like an entrepreneur , even if you ’re an employee .
If you can devise and implement an idea in one hour that ends up saving your company $ 25,000 a year , I ’d say you damn well deserve to be paid $ 10,000 for that hour of your time .
But too often employees do n’t bother to negotiate such terms with their employers .
They willingly submit themselves to the tyranny of the hourly rate .
Having been an employer myself though , I ’ll tell you that if an employee came to me and said she had a low - risk idea that would put $ 25,000 in my pocket and which could be implemented independently by her in an hour , and she asked to be paid $ 10,000 only if and when the idea proved itself , I ’d be pulling out my checkbook .
In fact , I ’d ask her if she had a twin I could hire too .
But if you do n’t negotiate such deals in advance , then by default the employer receives all the value above and beyond your normal hourly rate .
If I ever found myself an employee ( which I ca n’t imagine happening ) , I ’d be on the constant lookout for those $ 10,000 ideas .
I ’d befriend someone who had the authority to pay bonuses in the manner described above , even if I had to work my way up the chain of command a bit .
Then I ’d look for simple ways to increase the company ’s revenue or cut its costs that would produce tangible , measurable results .
And I ’d negotiate the ability to either be paid a fixed sum if the value can be determined in advance or to share in a certain percentage of whatever value was created .
If I found that my boss did n’t have the necessary authority or the will to authorize this sort of thing , then I ’d keep going up the chain of command until I found someone who did .
It ’s simply a matter of finding someone who will directly benefit from my extra value creation .
It could be a stock - owning VP , the CEO , or even an investor .
People who have a direct financial stake in the enterprise will not want to see profit - creating or cost - cutting ideas being squashed unreasonably , but beneath this level , you might run into a lot more closed - mindedness .
But fortunately those who share in the profits of your ideas will normally have the authority to overrule those who do n’t .
So do n’t let your boss get in your way .
If you develop the habit of implementing $ 10,000 ideas , you ’ll soon be the boss anyway .
If I found myself working for a company or organization where this level of flexibility was impossible , I ’d quit and go work in a less draconian environment .
There are enough progressive companies around now that it is n’t necessary to work for one of the unenlightened ones .
All Hours Are Not Created Equal
My income is n’t based on how much time I spend working .
It ’s a function of the value I create .
I can work a whole month and produce less monetary value than I do in one breakthrough hour .
Every hour is unique .
I stopped thinking in terms of a fixed hourly rate many years ago .
In practical terms an hour of my time could be worth $ 0 , or it could be worth $ 10,000 or more , depending on what I do with that particular hour .
Much of the time I pursue activities that do n’t generate any income at all , even though I still consider it to be productive work .
Answering email does n’t seem to pay too well , and I do n’t get paid an hourly rate for writing blog entries and articles .
But sometimes I ’ll get an idea which I can implement in just 30 - 60 minutes that will earn me an extra $ 10,000 over the course of a year , often continuing for many years thereafter .
So the concept of an hourly rate , even an average hourly rate , is meaningless to me .
A recent specific example was adding those Chitika eMiniMalls ads to this site .
As I previously reported , this took very little time to implement ( less than an hour ) , but it should ultimately generate thousands of dollars a year in extra revenue .
And it takes me virtually no work at all to maintain this income aside from depositing checks .
Edit 6/25/06 :
As it turns out , Chitika ’s performance declined as they “ improved ” their system , so I later dropped them and no longer recommend them ( along with many other bloggers ) .
Therefore , that turned out to be closer to a $ 1000 hour instead of the $ 10,000 one it initially seemed to be .
However , adding a donations page to the site , which took about an hour as well , has done much better than I expected and is easily a $ 10,000 + hour .
So the lesson is to keep experimenting .
In the normal course of my work , those $ 10,000 hours are becoming more common .
I normally have several a year , along with some $ 1000 hours , $ 5000 hours , and so on .
Usually the money does n’t come right away , but it still blows away the concept of an hourly rate .
It would n’t even be accurate to say that it ’s those other hours that make the $ 10,000 hour possible .
Sometimes the $ 10,000 is just a random idea from out of the blue , or maybe it ’s something that comes to me from a book or another person .
Almost always the $ 10,000 hour is the result of a great idea .
And great ideas can strike at any time .
When I get one of those $ 10,000 candidate ideas , I ’ll normally drop everything and implement it right away .
If it flops ( and usually it does ) , I ’ve lost an hour , but I still learned something .
Most of the time it is n’t a total loss .
I end up with a lot of $ 10 , $ 50 , and $ 250 ideas too .
But I can afford to endure dozens of those relative flops for the chance to hit just one more $ 10,000 idea .
And when it works , I must say it ’s pretty darn nice .
It ’s not that $ 10,000 is a lot of money per se .
The idea is n’t to make just $ 10,000 here and there .
It ’s to make $ 10,000 for only one hour ’s worth of work .
That ’s what makes the entrepreneurial game so much fun .
You never know when one of those $ 10,000 ideas will strike .
Imagine working each day with the very real possibility that you could earn an extra $ 10,000 that day , completely out of the blue .
If your normal hourly rate for a full - time job was $ 10,000 , you ’d be earning $ 20 million per year , and in that case $ 10,000 / hour would be no big deal .
But if you earn something closer to $ 50 / hour , then one of those $ 10,000 hours is a major breakthrough .
And the truth is that those $ 10,000 hours are a lot more accessible than you might think .
Regardless of whether you ’re an employee , self - employed , or otherwise entrepreneurial , do n’t cap your income by thinking in terms of an hourly rate .
Once you free yourself from this punishing paradigm , you ’ll invite the opportunity to enjoy some of those $ 10,000 hours .
It ’s really just a matter of giving yourself permission to experience them .
So , my worst nightmares are coming true in far too many ways ( more on that in the coming days ) .
The fact that the people at Sanrio have come to the conclusion it ’s time to release a dedicated Hello Kitty brand for men certainly is n’t making these nightmares any less frightening .
Apparently , they believe there ’s a body of men who still do n’t have a “ preconceived idea ” of the evil feline that associates it with little girls .
They also think an image with a male model with a huge cartoon bow across his face to advertise the new brand is somehow going to appeal to someone with even a bit of sanity ( granted , they are working with a customer base who will buy absolutely anything , so they really are n’t used to have to actually think about what they are creating … )
I have no doubt they are simply trying to push all those poor souls who have managed to survive the hell of a friend or family member being a Hello Kitty fanatic over the edge when that fanatic decides the men in her life need to wear Hello Kitty with her .
It ’s a win -win for Sanrio .
The fanatic buys more crap while those fighting the resistance are eliminated as they realize even the most horrific death is a lot less painful than having to wear a clothes line from the cat with no mouth .
The only good news here is that the actual new brand for men wo n’t be available until next year so we do n’t have to immediately suffer the consequences .
The bad news is that we now have confirmation things will continue to get worse …

I am sick and tired of pieces of code arbitrary put together when they do very different things , so I shout :
Coders , please , make libraries !
I see this happening in every language with the worst cases when they are related to web .
If you think you have n’t suffered from this , think again :
The code to make a graphical , or any kind , of interface to a program , does n’t have anything to do with the code to manage data in a database .
The code to handle web interaction , that is , parsing HTTP messages , handling sessions , and provide whatever other methods to easy the coding of web applications does n’t really have anything to do with templating libraries .
Let me give some examples ( without naming names - except in counter examples - ; you ’ll easy recognize if what you are working with has this problems or not ) :
You make an impressive web application , it has a web server and some data .
There ’s some data abstraction and tomorrow you have to build a desktop GUI around it , but oh !
your desktop program has to depend on the web framework because the functionality to make the data abstraction is in the web framework .
A counter example is Common Lisp clsql , an independent library that you may end up using with any application .
There are other cases .
Coders , please , make libraries !
Now the reverse example : you need to make a web - site around already existing data models , that means you have to keep a data abstraction layer around only because it comes bundled with the web framework .
Ack !
But here we see a deeper problem .
Are you sure you ’ll be able to do it at all ?
The web framework may depend on you using its own data abstraction mechanism , in the best case you ’ll just loose functionality , in the worst , it wo n’t work .
Coders , please , make libraries !
Same happens for template libraries .
I have already picked my favorite templating system , yet every web framework ones to make me use its own .
Why ?
my own is superior , I know it well , I want it !
In some cases , I just loose some functionality , like the form builder , because it is not really ready for different template systems , in some cases it is very painful to have to do lot of boilerplate code on the side and suppress the still - present template system .
The counter example here is Common Lisp tbnl , a web building library that does n’t ship any templating functionality .
Coders , please , make libraries !
An URL parser , sure that is part of a web framework , right ?
Yeah , because web browsers do n’t have anything to do with URL parsing ( I bet there ’s absolutly no url parsing library that is used in one web server and one web client at the same time ) .
Coders , please , make libraries !
But it is handy to have all on in one .
Ok , make a shell , a bundle , containing all the separate libraries and ship it .
Coders , please , make libraries !

Male assistants are being hired to help anxious lingerie shoppers
You can see them when you 're Christmas shopping .
Awkward , not quite sure where to look , not sure if touching is encouraged or downright prohibited , fiddling with labels at an embarrassed arm 's length ...
Yes , it 's men in the lingerie department , trying to guess what their partners would like for that special present .
Too much or too little ?
Too risky or too sensible ?
Even the word lingerie has a rustle of the exotic about it .
For many men , this area of the shop is unknown territory for the rest of the year , with its own code of styles and measurements .
And making this once a year trip to the underwear section , men shuffle through the shimmering shelves , trying not to catch the eye of the mannequins , looking like smugglers going through a tough customs checkpoint .
Of course there are assistants there to help - but what exactly are you going to ask for ?
How many questions can you ask before the sleaze alarm goes off ?
Mission impossible
So unable to ask - and trapped in the headlights of embarrassment - you grab the first approximation of what you think is wanted and head for the check out .
Job done .
Mission accomplished .
A mannequin appeals to Christmas shoppers
Or not , according to Marks & Spencer , which says that its research shows that only one in three recipients of these seasonal stocking fillers is happy with her partner 's choice .
So in an attempt to soothe the anxious male shopper , and to help women get something they might like , the retailer is hiring specialist male advisers to work in the lingerie departments in 50 of its stores .
These so - called " stocking fellas " will be able to step in with comradely advice .
Suits her , sir .
It really suits her .
Katy Pratt , spokesperson for the shop , says that its research showed that men buying underwear for women " did n't know basic things like sizes or what kind of lingerie she liked " .
In one case last Christmas , she says , a male shopper came to buy his wife 's underwear present armed only with her shoe size .
Shy shoppers
" Some men are quite confident about asking for help - but there are others who are embarrassed and would much rather talk to another man about it .
Male shoppers can feel out of their depth in the lingerie section
" Often you 'll get men who sidle up , grab the first thing they see , they 'll get to the till as quickly as they possibly can and get out as quickly as they can .
And what are the chances of getting something their partners actually like ? "
Sandra Boler , former underwear editor at Vogue , says that anyone shopping for Christmas lingerie should consider what the recipient is likely to want to wear .
" Before they even go into a shop , they should really think hard .
It 's pointless buying a push - up cleavage bra for someone for whom it 's wildly inappropriate , the head of the bridge club or whatever .
" You 've got to know vaguely what you 're doing , vaguely what they like , rather than imposing your own fantasy and I think most women have a horror of being given tarty underwear . "
Of course , if it still looks like a tricky operation , and many men secretly think about shopping as a time - sensitive military exercise , there 's always online shopping .
Add your comments on this story , using the form below .
Having been burned several times by buying clothes that do n't fit her , I now only buy clothes she has tried on .
Women 's sizing being wildly inconsistent works of fiction , online ordering is no better than trying to guess whether that item in the shop will fit her even though the tag says it will and she says she liked one just like it a couple of months ago .
Nicolai , Cambridge
You hit the nail on the head .
I did my Xmas shopping recently and was so apprehensive about entering the Lingerie Dept .
The nerves wore off once I discovered the place full of men , wondering around sheepishly and trying not to make eye contact with any female around .
Darren Smiles , Newcastle upon Tyne
Just been to town to buy some lingerie for the missuss .
Third time I 've been now , third time I 've come back empty - handed .
Guess it does n't help when I get so red in these shops I make Rudolph look like he needs a tan .
Mr. Red-faced Williams , North Wales
Shopping for lingerie would be a lot easier if the plastic mannequins were n't all size 6 with concave chests and breasts the size of thimbles .
Clothes do n't " hang " on my wife , they get " filled " .
Come on , retailers , recognise that your customers are n't all anorexic teenagers .
Mark , Bath
It 's true , this can be very difficult !
But I think that a man should always go for pretty lingerie , never the ' sexy ' ones .
If a woman feels good in her underwear , then she 's much more likely to feel sexy too .
And pretty underwear does not have to be boring , big knickers !
Come on , men , it 's not exactly rocket science !
As the article says , buy underwear with your loved one in mind , not what 's in your mind !
Keith , Derby
All sounds familiar , in my past efforts
Ive found myself fumbling about trying to find the size I need only for the whole rail of lingerie to fall down , drawing even more attention to my already embarassed self .
Then you find yourself trying to put everything back , and im convinced when at the till there is a cheeky smile from the sales assistant .
By the time you walk out the shop it feels like it has been mission impossible !
Simon , West Sussex
It 's ok for women .
Choosing slippers is easy !
Gerry T , Faringdon
I keep the vital statistics in my phone .
I usually find the female staff are more than willing to help and I enjoy buying underwear for my wife .
Guys , it 's not a problem , enjoy it .
Phil , West Yorks
Of course , once you 've picked out the perfect little something there is the matter of timing of delivery .
Witnessing my friend 's wife unwrap something made of barely enough cloth to cover a two pound coin in front of the entire extended family was not the most comfortable of experiences .
I laugh about it now though .
Andrew Rodgers , London
My husband dragged my sister around the shops to pick out underwear for me one year .
He knew my size , but just needed a woman to tell him what was suitable .
Having men help out men will probably not end up with them buying something the woman would like , but something that the man would like to see the woman in , which is something completely different .
Men just do n't understand underwear .
Sethaen , Kent
" Many men secretly think about shopping as a time - sensitive military exercise . "
What you mean it 's not ?
Men like to focus on the task at hand .
They usually know what they want and want to get the task done as quickly and painlessly as possible , so they can go sit down the pub .
There are many online stores for lingerie , and I personally prefer these because they have more of a selection and there 's no pressure to buy anything .
Jon , Leicester
Here is a bit of advice that may help overcome your anxiousness .
Just think :
If they have it on the shelf , they want you to buy it .
No need to be embarrassed about it .
And any shop assistant is most likely to have been there for a little while and to know the business .
They too want you to buy it and ask questions about it .
No reason to be embarrassed either .
Take a photo of your partner along .
That might help getting the right advice .

Si un travail de retouche s'avère nécessaire ( poids du fichier , orthographe ) que le traducteur ne fera pas lui- même je devrai le confier à quelqu'un qui empochera la moitié des 180 euros .
Le traducteur ne recevra plus que la moitié .
Rappelez vous que pour le moment Savoir sans Frontière c'est une personne : Jean - Pierre Petit , Gilles s'occupant de la comptabilité .

14 octobre février 2016 : Sonia a fini Le
Tour du monde en 80 jours , Le Spondyloscope et attaque l'Ambre et le Verre
( Diable , cette femme traduit plus vite que son ombre !
... Et le tandem Sonia de Costa - Juan Carlos Anduckia est sacrément efficace )
A travers cette collaboration entre une traductrice qui fournit son travail sous forme texte ( en .doc ) pour 100 euros , et un collaborateur qui , maniant bien Photoshop , fait la mise en page pour 50 euros , dans les pages TIF nous avons peut être une formule pleine d'avenir .
En effet pas mal de traducteurs potentiels sont rebutés par le travail de mise des textes sur les pages graphiques , très rapide par coupé - collé , quand on connait un peu les possibilité de Photoshop .
On trouvera les éléments pour traduire de cette façon dans le dossier TEXT ONLY .
Il faut seulement réussir à créer des tandems où l'un fait le texte et l'autre le met dans les pages TIF .
Collaboration entre ... le Portugal et la Colombie

Mon vieil ami Vladimir Golubev , qui a supervisé toutes les traductions en russe , est décédé en février 2011 .
Tous les albums en russe , de même que l'Ambre et le Verre , sont dédiés à cet homme au grand coeur , avec qui j'ai entretenu des relations d'amitié constante depuis 1965 et qui me manque beaucoup .
Cher Jean - Pierre , chere Nina , Après avoir vu " le Géométricon " en " free download " sur le website SSF , je me sens comme en fête !
Avec mes sentiments les meilleurs , et grand merci !
Vladimir .

Il y a eu Jadis une traduction ( sauvage ) de ma bande dessinée " Tout est Relatif " sur la Relativité Restreinte en persan ( Iran ) .
L'unique exemplaire de cette bande dessinée m'a été emprunté il y a 25 ans à mon domicile .
Si quelqu'un pouvait simplement m'en envoyer un fichier pdf portant les pages scannées cela me permettrait de mettre cet album à la disposition des lecteurs iraniens .
A titre de précision , l'album est en accord avec les prescriptions religieuses locales , Sophie ayant été dotée par l'éditeur - pirate d'un tchador , de pantalons flottants et d'habits cachant aux regards sa célèbre poitrine .
Ci aprés , personnage de droite , une image extraite d'une des rares pages photocopiées que j'ai pu garder .
Voir la nouvelle version , adaptée aux standards musulmans dans la version en persan
A titre indicatif , le seul pays qui ait rhabillé l'héroïne est l'Amérique .
Pour être donc précis , je devrais mettre en téléchargeable gratuit , en parallèle , les versions Anglaises et Américaines .
Ci-après un exemple des différences entre les deux :
Image de " The Flight of Fancy " dans la version anglaise
La même , dans la version Américaine
21 novembre 2005 : Nous avons une traductrice iranienne : Homeira Abrishami , qui vit à Téhéran , Iran .

Mohammed Alcadaoui a livré la traduction en arebe de la Loi de la Jungle moins de 24 heures après que j'aie mise en ligne la version française !
En un an il a traduit neuf BD , alors que nous avions eu tant de mal à trouver de bons traducteurs pour l'arabe , si demandé par les arabophones .
Grâce à lui , à Rym Zobiri et Samer Alssaraj cette liste s'est complétée , sauf le dernier album le Spondyloscope , qu'il est en train de finaliser .
Fantastique !
C'est un brillant ingénieur en techniques modernes de communication par l'informatique .

8 avril 2009 : Madame Nouzha Habbadi , littéraire , nous a envoyé le 7 avril 2009 sa traduction sous forme texte de l'album Energétiquement vôtre .
8 mai 2009 : Sa traduction a été examinée par un arabophone , scientifique de son état , qui y a décelé un grand nombre de fautes de frappe , d'erreurs et d'omissions .
La rétribution de 100 euros de cette traduction sous forme texte sera donc partagée entre cette traductrice et ce correcteur et l'ensemble corrigé sera mis sous forme graphique et installé sur le site de SSF .
Ceci étant , Gilles et moi gérons 100 traducteurs , en 33 langues .
Nous ne pouvons établir de collaborations avec des traducteurs dont les textes devraient être à chaque fois vérifiés et corrigés .
La démarche de cette dame partait très certainement des meilleurs sentiments du monde .
Mais nous demandons aux candidats traducteurs de ne nous proposer leurs services que quand ils possèdent les compétences requises .
Nous recherchons des traductions , pas des soucis supplémentaires
Mr. Miroud Fayçal a livré le 13 mai 2009 la traduction de l'album Les Mille et une Nuits Scientifiques .

Mr. Miroud Fayçal commence maintenant ( mai 2009 ) la traduction de Mille Milliards de Soleils
Madame Faiza Bouzina , littéraire , a traduit A quoi rêvent les robot , révisé par Mr Miroud Fayçal , qui conseille des ouvrages moins techniques .
22 avril 2009 C e jour , j'ai effacé les noms de sept traducteurs arabophones .
Certains étaient bardés de diplômes , de compétences .
D'autres m'avaient envoyé des pages parfaitement finalisées graphiquement .
Quant à moi je m'étais offert de refaire certains dessins , pour satisfaire les canons musulmans , comme je l'ai fait pour Tout est Relatif .
Ceux qui avaient " Photoshop ME , " Middle East " , pour l'écrtiture droite - gauche , étaient prêts à mettre sous forme graphique les travaux fournis par d'autres sous forme texte .
Une vraie usine ....
Eh puis , pendant plus d'une année ... rien .
Promesses non tenues , engagements non respectés .
C a n'est pas une nouveauté .
Ca fait trois ans que c'est comme ça .
Alors que la langue arabe est une des plus importante du monde je n'ai jamais réussi à mettre la main sur des gens sérieux .
Avec ces sept - là il y en avait eu sept autres , tous aussi fumistes que cette bande .
A lors , pour l'arabe , j'attendrai de voir arriver une traduction finalisée , complète , sans erreurs , sans oublis , mise sous forme graphique .
Pour le moment j'efface les noms de ces ces sept bonshommes qui m'ont fait perdre mon temps .

Gore : Special interests are ' out of control '
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday May 31 , 2007 Print This Email This
In an interview on CBS 's Early Show on Thursday , former Vice - President Al Gore was asked about pressure from coal interests to have the US government not only pay for the building of coal liquification plants but order 25 years worth of fuel in advance .
" That would be a horrible mistake , " Gore responded , insisting that we need to shift away from fossil fuels and towards renewables .
" In a democracy , we have always had power exerted by special interests -- but it 's out of control now , " Gore said .
" The special interests almost every time now outweigh the public interests , and that 's dangerous for our democracy . "
Asked further , " Do n't you have a greater obligation to make your views more public , " Gore laughed at length and replied , " Well , I have n't been a shrinking violet .
I have n't been shying away from making my views known .
... I do n't hold back , and do n't intend to . "

I know I 'm on vacation , but this seems important : for the first time , the Department of Homeland Security has deemed an entire state of matter to be a national security risk .
Cynical - C has more ( and more ) .
As you ’ll recall , we wrote earlier about how the Republican leader of the US House has now established a timetable for victory in Iraq .
He said this morning on FOX News that Bush has until the fall to show progress , and if he has n’t then Republicans will start to walk .
That ’s a timetable .
Cong .
Rahm Emanuel ( D - IL ) responds :
Emanuel Statement in Response to New Boehner Timetable for Iraq
This morning in an appearance on Fox News Sunday , Congressman John Boehner announced his plan for a new timetable for Iraq , saying that support for the war from Congressional Republicans will waver if President Bush ’s escalation policy has not succeeded by the fall .
Statement of House Democratic Caucus Chair Rahm Emanuel in response to Congressman John Boehner ’s newly announced timetable on Iraq and President Bush ’s escalation of troops into Iraq :
“ It ’s clear Congressman Boehner ’s new timetable for Iraq has less to do with the troops coming home , and has everything to do with his fear that House Republicans will be sent home . ”
TOKYO , March 22 ( Reuters ) - Blond , blue - eyed Westerners probably can’t be as successful at Middle East diplomacy as Japanese with their “ yellow faces ” , Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso was quoted by media as saying on Wednesday .
“ Japan is doing what Americans ca n’t do , ” the Nikkei business daily quoted the gaffe - prone Aso as saying in a speech .
“ Japanese are trusted .
If ( you have ) blue eyes and blond hair , it ’s probably no good , ” he said .
“ Luckily , we Japanese have yellow faces . ”
Foreign Ministry officials were unable to comment on the report , which said Aso elaborated by saying Japan had never exploited the Middle East , started a war there or fired a shot .
Aso , seen in some circles as a contender to succeed Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe if the Japanese leader runs into trouble in a July election for parliament ’s upper house , is known for verbal gaffes .
He offended South Korea with remarks in 2003 that were interpreted in Seoul as trying to justify some of Japan ’s actions during its 1910 - 1945 colonization of the Korean peninsula .
He also drew criticism in 2001 when , as economics minister , he said he hoped to make Japan the kind of country where “ rich Jews ” would want to live .
Aso said then he had not intended to be discriminatory .
Japan has long felt it has a special role to play in the Middle East because it lacks much of the political baggage of the United States , allowing for warmer ties with Arab nations .
Last week Tokyo hosted four - way talks aimed at working toward peace in the Middle East , involving Israel , Jordan and the Palestinian Territories as well as Japan .
Abe ’s government has been battered by a series of problematic remarks by cabinet ministers this year , including the health minister ’s reference to women as “ birth - giving machines ” and Aso ’s own description of Washington ’s occupation strategy in Iraq as “ immature ” .

RFC 4824 IP over SFSS April 2007 1 .
Introduction JCroft , Wikipedia ] .
Under the SFSS , each alphabetic character or control signal is indicated by a particular flag pattern , called a Semaphore Flag Signal ( SFS ) .
IP - SFS provides reliable transmission of IP datagrams over a half - duplex channel between two interfaces .
At the physical layer , SFSS uses optical transmission , normally through the atmosphere using solar illumination and line - of - sight photonics .
A control protocol ( Section 4 ) allows each interface to contend for transmission on the common channel .
This specification defines only unicast transmission .
Broadcast is theoretically possible , but there are some physical restrictions on channel direction dispersion .
This is a topic for future study .
The diagram in Figure 1 illustrates the place of the SFSS in the Internet protocol hierarchy .

I 'm too busy reading Bernie Pope and Russell O'Connor 's articles in the latest Monad Reader to think about much else right now , so I 'm only going to make a brief post .
I want to mention something pointed out by Nick Frisby over here .
Thefunction is in fact closely related to , the dual offor monads , defined by Dave Menendez .
( Nick Frisby 's statement is n't quite correct but it 's interest value outweighs its truthiness . )
In fact , I can borrow Russell 's language to say that whereassends data back in time , andread data from the future !
Think of it like this : when you usewith a comonad you provide some function that distills down a comonadic data structure into a single value and thenapplies this distillation repeatedly at every point in the comonadic structure to give you another comonadic structure .
My canonical example is the cellular automaton where you give a rule that defines how to compute each individual cell as a function of the whole grid , andapplies this throughout an entire input grid to give you back an entire output grid .
The functionsandallow you to give rules for each cell where you 're allowed to make reference to the entire output grid .
If you think of the output grid as something in the future that you have n't yet computed , thenandallow you to read from the future .
Here 's an example ofit in use ( where I makea comonad by interpreting it as a kind of one - sided zipper ) :
In the expressionwe can useandto refer to the sublist to the right of each element from within the list itself .
For example , in the subexpressiontheis being applied toNote how in this example ( 1 ) gives you back an entire list , not just one element and ( 2 ) respects the comonadic structure in the sense that you can only refer to elements to the right of the current one whereaslets you refer to the entire output list .
I think this helps to make clear the differences and similarities betweenand That was n't too brief .
But I did cheat by copying and pasting code from an old post .
Anyway , back to tinkering with my implementation of ...
Congress exercised its constitutional responsibility this week by appropriating more than $ 100 billion to fully support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Today , the President chose not to cash that check .
It is up to him to explain to the American people why .
We won this war four years ago .
The question is when we end the occupation .
This bill called for a much - needed shift in our approach to Iraq .
The United States military is not going to change the societal makeup of Iraq .
And the Malaki government is not going to bring peace among Iraq 's competing factions without the strong , overt , diplomatic cooperation of other countries in this region .
And this bill called for just an approach .
I have always said that we need to support the troops through leadership that is equal to the sacrifices we are asking them to make .
It is time for a new approach in Iraq , one that displays smart diplomatic leadership in the region .
We must bring this occupation to a proper conclusion that will increase our ability to focus on international terrorism , increase the stability in the region and allow us to focus on our strategic interests elsewhere in the world .
A large part of what got me interested in Jim Webb , as an early supporter back in early 2006 , was his ability to cut though the crap and get to the heart of the issue in Iraq , as he put it today in his response to President Bush 's veto of the Iraq supplemental appropriations bill , " The United States military is not going to change the societal makeup of Iraq . "
The US military did what is within its core competency during the first three weeks after the invasion -- it defeated the Iraqi military .
" Nation building " is not a military core competency .
We have very little ability to impose secular liberal values on a traditional and conservative Islamic society .
We have little ability to douse the flames of sectarian hatreds .
Yet that 's the phase we 're in now -- what in previous times would have been called " civilizing the natives " -- as futile in the neoconservative fantasy of benign empire as it was in the European version which existed a century ago .
The only way we are going to be able to make any progress is with the cooperation of the states in the region , which share culture and values with the various sects in Iraq .
If we do n't secure their cooperation , we could easily mess around for another five or ten years in Iraq , and still leave behind a mess .
Thank you , Senator Webb , for standing up on this .
We 've lost a round today with President Bush 's veto , but we wo n't lose the fight !
The consensus of several discussions at ICML is that the number of jobs for people knowing machine learning well substantially exceeds supply .
This is my experience as well .
Demand comes from many places , but I ’ve seen particularly strong demand from trading companies and internet startups .
Like all interest bursts , this one will probably pass because of economic recession or other distractions .
Nevertheless , the general outlook for machine learning in business seems to be good .
Machine learning is all about optimization when there is uncertainty and lots of data .
The quantity of data available is growing quickly as computer - run processes and sensors become more common , and the quality of the data is dropping since there is little editorial control in it ’s collection .
Machine Learning is a difficult subject to master ( * ) , so those who do should remain in demand over the long term .
(*)
In fact , it would be reasonable to claim that no one has mastered it — there are just some people who know a bit more than others .

Ethanol production inside carbon nanotubes
( Nanowerk Spotlight ) Ethanol is all the rage these days .
Although we have been drinking ethanol , an alcohol , for thousands of years ( fermented beverages such as beer and wine may contain up to 15  25 % ethanol by volume ) , the recent interest has been sparked by its use as a renewable fuel alternative to gasoline .
Indeed , the largest single use of ethanol is as a motor fuel and fuel additive .
Ethanol is produced by fermentation when certain species of yeast metabolize sugar .
The process works with all biological feedstocks that contain appreciable amounts of sugar or materials that can be converted into sugar such as starch or cellulose .
The primary feedstock for ethanol production in the U.S. is corn .
In Brazil , the world 's leading ethanol producer , it 's mostly derived from sugar cane .
While there is a heated controversy over the economic and ecological benefits of using biomass for producing ethanol fuel , it seems that nanotechnology 's jack - of - all - trades , the carbon nanotube ( CNT ) , might provide a solution here as well .
CNTs are increasingly recognized as promising materials for catalysis , either as catalysts themselves , as catalyst additives or as catalyst supports .
Researchers in China now have used CNTs loaded with rhodium ( Rh ) nanoparticles as reactors to convert a gas mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen into ethanol .
This appears to be the first example where the activity and selectivity of a metal - catalyzed gas - phase reaction benefits significantly from proceeding inside a nanosized CNT reaction vessel .
CNTs distinguish themselves from other carbon materials , e.g. activated carbon and carbon nanofibers , in that they have well graphitized graphene with semiconducting or metallic characteristics and a tubular morphology with well defined dimensions .
Earlier theoretical studies have shown that the electron density is shifted from the inside to the outside of CNT channels , and that inside gas molecules exhibit a binding energy different from those outside of the nanotubes .
" We were curious about what would happen if we combined these graphene tubes with metal nanoparticles , which have interesting redox and catalytic properties by themselves " Dr. Xinhe Bao tells Nanowerk .
" We previously found that the redox properties of iron and iron oxide particles are tunable via encapsulation within CNTs . "
Bao , a professor at the State Key Laboratory of Catalysis at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics , Chinese Academy of Sciences , and head of the institute 's Nano and Interfacial Catalysis Group , found that , for instance , iron oxide particles within 4 - 8 nm wide nanotubes are auto - reduced at 600 degrees Celsius while the particles located on the outer surface of the nanotubes need 800 degrees Celsius .
Furthermore , the auto- reduction temperature of inside particles decreases with the nanotube diameter .
On the other hand , the oxidation of metallic iron nanoparticles is retarded inside nanotubes compared to those particles located on the outer surface of nanotubes .
Both experiments indicate the modification of the redox properties of these particles inside CNTs and the stabilization of metallic
Fe inside nanotubes ( " Tuning of Redox Properties of Iron and Iron Oxides via Encapsulation within Carbon Nanotubes " ) .
" We suspected that the modification of the redox properties of metal particles inside CNTs is a general characteristic and that this could be exploited in catalysis " adds Dr. Xiulian Pan , a member of Bao 's group and first author of the team 's recent publication in Nature Materials , where they describe their CNT ethanol production method ( " Enhanced ethanol production inside carbon - nanotube reactors containing catalytic particles " ) .

The black spheres denote carbon atoms , which form the graphene layers of the carbon nanotubes .
The streams in light orange and green entering the nanotubes indicate the gas mixture of CO and H2 , respectively .
The three stacks of small spheres in rose , blue , green and red inside the tubes represent catalyst particles that may comprise more than one component .
The streams in light cyan tailing behind the catalyst particles along the axis of the nanotubes represent ethanol .

" Therefore , we introduced a promoted RhMn catalyst for syngas conversion into carbon nanotube channels " she says .
" Syngas is a 1:2 mixture of CO and H 2 .
This reaction is known to be very sensitive to the redox states of Rh and Mn. Oxygenates containing two carbon atoms such as ethanol , acetyldehyde and acetic acid were produced , and surprisingly , the yield over the CNT - encapsulated catalyst was extraordinarily high , clearly exceeding that of the very good silica - supported catalyst .
Furthermore , catalysts with metal particles confined inside CNTs were also significantly more active than those with the metal particles dispersed on the outer surface of the nanotubes , even though the latter are more easily accessible . "
The results of the Chinese scientists suggest a host - guest interaction between the confined metal particles and CNTs , which is different from that on the outside of the nanotubes .
Other effects may also play a role , like the stringent size restriction of metal particles inside CNTs and the high affinity of hydrogen to the inner surfaces of opened CNTs as exemplified in their extraordinary hydrogen adsorption capacity .
Pan says that she believes that other conversions could benefit in a similar way from taking place inside CNTs , in particular if they involve hydrogen .
" We also anticipate that the study of the host - guest interaction within CNTs will attract greater attention as a result . "

Bao points out that experimental study of the redox properties and the electronic host - guest interaction in these systems is still a challenge and might require refined characterization techniques .
" Other effects may also play a role in these catalysts " he says , " like the stronger size restriction of metal particles inside CNTs and the high affinity of hydrogen to the inner surfaces of opened CNTs .
The understanding and distinction between these contributions needs to be advanced by further experimental and theoretical studies .
Besides , we are currently looking at new experimental characterization techniques which provide deeper insight into the nature of these confined systems . "
Pan notes that , apart from the still considerable challenge of cost efficient , large - scale production of CNTs with precise diameter and chirality control , a further challenge pertaining to catalysis is the homogeneous dispersion of metal nanoparticles within the CNT channels , since this can strongly influences the activity of these catalysts .
BAGHDAD , Feb .
11 — After weeks of internal debate , senior United States military officials on Sunday literally put on the table their first public evidence of the contentious assertion that Iran supplies Shiite extremist groups in Iraq with some of the most lethal weapons in the war .
They said those weapons had been used to kill more than 170 Americans in the past three years .
Never before displayed in public , the weapons included squat canisters designed to explode and spit out molten balls of copper that cut through armor .
The canisters , called explosively formed penetrators or E.F.P.s , are perhaps the most feared weapon faced by American and Iraqi troops here .
In a news briefing held under strict security , the officials spread out on two small tables an E.F.P. and an array of mortar shells and rocket - propelled grenades with visible serial numbers that the officials said link the weapons directly to Iranian arms factories .
The officials also asserted , without providing direct evidence , that Iranian leaders had authorized smuggling those weapons into Iraq for use against the Americans .
The officials said such an assertion was an inference based on general intelligence assessments .
That inference , and the anonymity of the officials who made it , seemed likely to generate skepticism among those suspicious that the Bush administration is trying to find a scapegoat for its problems in Iraq , and perhaps even trying to lay the groundwork for war with Iran .
Sandwiched between temperate Europe and African heat , Italy is on the front line of climate change and is witnessing a rise in tropical diseases such as malaria and tick - borne encephalitis , a new report says .
Italy was declared free of malaria in 1970 , but it is making a comeback , said the Italian environmental organisation Legambiente .
Tick - borne encephalitis , a virus which attacks the nerve system , is also on the way back .
While only 18 cases had been reported before 1993 , 100 have been since , mostly around Venice .
" Illnesses are arriving from Africa , while tropical animals and plants are attacking our biodiversity , droughts and flooding are on the rise , and semi- desert areas are appearing , " said Legambiente 's director general , Francesco Ferrante .
A third ailment , visceral leishmaniasis , carried by sandflies and potentially fatal , is expanding rapidly , the report added .
Cases in Italy have risen to 150 a year from 50 before 2000 , with the southern region of Campania a hotspot .
Of six sustained droughts in Italy in the last 60 years four have occurred since 1990 .
The average temperature has increased by 0.4C in the north in 20 years and by 0.7C in the south .
Ten million hectares " are at risk of desertification " .
Twenty percent of the fish now swimming in the Mediterranean , including barracuda , are types that have migrated from the Red Sea as water temperatures rise .
Italy 's combination of sea coast , mountains , deep valleys and plains gives rise to a rich variety of food products but climate change could tip the balance , Mr Ferrante said .
" We are at the southern edge of the globe 's temperate area and that is why Italy is being particularly hit by the collapse of the climatic equilibrium . "
A brazen upstate Army chaplain made a British woman his sex toy to “ spice ” up his boring marriage and threatened to kill her when she wanted to break away , officials said yesterday .
Capt .
John Lau , 50 , told a military court he took Amanda Tyler into his Fort Drum home , turned her into his “ second wife , ” “ married ” her in a mock Niagara Falls service , and took her to live with his real wife and family .
But Tyler , 34 , described the ordained Southern Baptist minister as a sexual sadist who controlled and terrified her .
“ The price for objections is severe .
If you object , you pay , because he ’s ‘ The Master , ’ ” she told the Watertown Daily Times .
She charged he even wanted her to work as a prostitute to pay for schooling .
Lau , who was jailed yesterday , admitted that he met Tyler in 2004 while stationed in England and brought her to the United States .
“ My wife and I were in a lull in our relationship and looking for something to spice up our sexual relations , ” Lau told the court .
Tyler lived at his home as his “ second wife , ” Lau said , and took vacations with the family to Cyprus , the Caribbean and the Florida Keys .
Lau routinely took both women to official functions and introduced Tyler as his “ wife ’s friend , ” he testified during a general court - martial at the upstate base Thursday .
He said Tyler wanted to live with the couple indefinitely in an “ exclusive relationship . ”
But in September , while Lau was deployed in Iraq with the 10th Marine Division , Tyler told the rest of Lau ’s family that she planned to move out .
Lau admitted that he responded in three e-mails to Tyler , threatening to kill her .
Tyler said the sex was consensual but took place “ under duress . ”
She said Lau lured her into the relationship with promises of emotional stability and a life in the United States .
“ It was n’t like I just fell in love with them and decided to be ‘ the second wife , ’ ” Tyler said .
“ What I thought they were doing was putting me on the straight and narrow , restoring my confidence . ”
She said she did n’t try to complain to the Army or civilian authorities because she was “ petrified . ”
Ironically , Lau was featured in the base newspaper last June in an article about the virtues of a marriage retreat arranged by the Army at Lake Placid .
“ It is important to help them ease marital issues so they can better focus on the mission , ” he told The Fort Drum Blizzard .
At his court - martial Thursday , Lau was convicted of adultery and making a threat .
He was sentenced to 14 months in military prison , but under the terms of his plea bargain , he will serve only five months .
Lau was also stripped of his rank and dismissed from the Army , with all pay and allowances forfeited .

Mindfulness , while common in hospitals , corporations , professional sports and even prisons , is relatively new in the education of squirming children .
But a small but growing number of schools in places like Oakland and Lancaster , Pa. , are slowly embracing the concept  as they did yoga five years ago  and institutions , like the psychology department at Stanford University and the Mindfulness Awareness Research Center at the University of California , Los Angeles , are trying to measure the effects .
During a five - week pilot program at Piedmont Avenue Elementary , Miss Megan , the “ mindful ” coach , visited every classroom twice a week , leading 15 minute sessions on how to have “ gentle breaths and still bodies . ”
The sound of the Tibetan bowl reverberated at the start and finish of each lesson .
The techniques , among them focused breathing and concentrating on a single object , are loosely adapted from the work of Jon Kabat - Zinn , the molecular biologist who pioneered the secular use of mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts in 1979 to help medical patients cope with chronic pain , anxiety and depression .
Susan Kaiser Greenland , the founder of the InnerKids Foundation , which trains schoolchildren and teachers in the Los Angeles area , calls mindfulness “ the new ABC ’s  learning and leading a balanced life . ”
At Stanford , the psychology department is assessing the feasibility of teaching mindfulness to families .
“ Parents and teachers tell kids 100 times a day to pay attention , ” said Philippe R. Goldin , a researcher .
“ But we never teach them how . ”
The experiment at Piedmont , whose student body is roughly 65 percent black , 18 percent Latino and includes a large number of immigrants , is financed by Park Day School , a nearby private school ( prompting one teacher to grumble that it was “ Cloud Nine - groovy - hippie - liberals bringing ‘ enlightenment ’ to inner city schools ” ) .
The U.S. wind energy industry is on track to install over 3,000 megawatts ( MW ) of wind power generating capacity nationwide in 2007 , with Texas likely to account for about two thirds of the new installations , the American Wind Energy Association ( AWEA ) said today in its first quarter market report .
Over 100 MW have newly come online in the U.S. so far this year , and over 1,000 more are under construction in Texas alone , according to AWEA .
One megawatt of wind power produces enough electricity on average to serve 250 to 300 homes .
â€ œClean , cost - effective , inexhaustible , and readily available , wind power is an essential element of the solution to both climate change and Americaâ€™s increasing demand for electricity , â€ said AWEA executive director Randall Swisher .
â€œ Texas recognized this business opportunity and successfully spurred wind power development with a Renewables Portfolio Standard ( RPS ) and other forward - looking policies.â€ 
â€ œThe moment has come for the U.S. government to build on the example set by Texas and many other states , and enact a national RPS as part of any energy legislation it considers this year , â€ added Swisher .
Fifty U.S. Senators recently called for a â€œstrongâ€ national RPS and it is likely that the U.S. Congress will consider RPS legislation this summer .
A Renewables Portfolio Standard uses market mechanisms to ensure that a growing percentage of electricity is produced from renewable sources .
â€ Already one of our nationâ€™s top agricultural producers , Texas is now reaping the benefits of being a top wind producer , â€ said Ned Meister , director of Commodity and Regulatory Activities for the Texas Farm Bureau .
â€œ Texasâ€™ RPS is fueling new economic and environmental benefits for Texas farmers and ranchers.â€ 
Wind farms revitalize the economy of rural communities by providing steady income to farmers , ranchers , and other landowners .
Each wind turbine contributes $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 per year or more in farm income , while 95 % - 98 % of the farmâ€™s land remains free for crops or grazing .
As Governor of Texas , George Bush signed the stateâ€™s RPS into law in 1999 .
Texas is today the state with the largest amount of wind power in operation , providing income to rural communities , new business and jobs , as well as clean , renewable energy for its economy .
A report by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ( ERCOT ) suggests that the 2,000 MW of new wind power anticipated this year would avoid over 3 million tons of CO 2 , annually , at a rate of about 0.48 tons of CO 2 per MWh of wind — reducing the carbon footprint of every man , woman and child in Texas by more than 250 pounds per year .
Twenty - two states now have an RPS , and , given the economic success of the policy and the urgency of addressing global warming , several have recently moved to strengthen their requirements .
In the past few months alone , New Mexico and Colorado both increased their renewable energy requirement to 20 % by 2020 , and Minnesota adopted an RPS of 25 % by 2025 .
The first hundred megawatts installed this year were completed in Oklahoma ( 60 MW ) , Maine ( 33 MW ) , Texas ( 10 MW ) , and Hawaii ( 21 MW ) .
Cumulative wind power generating capacity in the U.S. now stands at 11,699 MW .
This capacity will generate an estimated 31 billion kilowatt - hours this year , enough to serve the equivalent of nearly 3 million average households .
Projects announced to be under construction in Texas include :

Ex-Reagan Associate Deputy Attorney General : Impeach Cheney Josh Catone
Published : Thursday June 28 , 2007 Print This Email This Bruce Fein , who served as the Associate Deputy Attorney General under Ronald Reagan , in a scathing editorial today called for the impeachment of Vice President Dick Cheney .
" Cheney has dulled political accountability and concocted theories for evading the law and Constitution that would have embarrassed King George III , " he writes .
This is not the first time that Fein has taken on the Bush administration .
In March 2006 , Fein appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify on Senate Resolution 398 , which called for the censure of George Bush over the warrantless wiretap program .
Fein said in his 2006 testimony that by authorizing the domestic spying program , President Bush sought to " cripple the Constitutions checks and balances and political accountability . "
In October 2006 , Fein ripped into Bush for his " alarming usurpations of legislative prerogatives , " and into the then - Republican controlled Congress for sitting idly by and " placing party loyalty above institutional loyalty , contrary to the expectations of the Founding Fathers . "
With the wiretap program back in the news following this week 's congressional subpoenas of the White House and the office of the Vice President , and a subsequent refusal to cooperate , Fein unleashed his highly critical philippic .
Fein details " multiple crimes against the Constitution " committed by Cheney , including the creation of military commissions , the " kidnappings , secret detentions , and torture in Eastern European prisons of suspected international terrorists , " the advocation of " signing statements " to ignore pieces of legislation , and the encouragement of the use of torture .
" The vice president has maintained that the entire world is a battlefield , " writes Fein , saying the vice president has used the bugaboo of terrorism to justify a shoot first , ask questions later approach to dealing with suspected terrorists , even when that includes American citizens .
Fein also touches on the hot - button warrantless wiretapping program , over which he has butted heads with the administration in the past .
He argues that Cheney engineered the program and has " orchestrated the invocation of executive privilege " to conceal information about it from Congress .
In the end , Fein makes the case that " Bush has ceded vast domains of his powers to Vice President Cheney , " in violation of the US Constitution .
" President Bush regularly is unable to explain or defend the policies of his own administration , and that is because the heavy intellectual labor has been performed in the office of the vice president , " he concludes .
" Cheney is impeachable for his overweening power and his sneering contempt of the Constitution and the rule of law . "

I have run across a few references to Paul Dietz 's Common Lisp test suite over the past few months , the latest being from Juho Snellman 's blog where he describes how the suite caught some errors in his new SBCL register allocator code .
Paul describes his work on the suite in his own blog , the 13 - September entry of which had this to say :
To go beyond simple ' does function FOO do X when called on arguments Y ' kinds of tests , I 've also started experimenting with a random tester .
I 've taken the approach of William McKeeman ( favorite quote : " Excellent testing can make you unpopular with almost everyone . " )
I generate random lisp forms that are guaranteed to be well - defined when a set of free variables have integer values .
The forms are wrapped in two lambda expressions , one with type declarations for the free variables and one in which optimizations are inhibited .
The functions are compiled and their outputs compared on a set of random inputs .
This approach is very simpleminded ( and a lot easier to do in Lisp than in C , as McKeeman did ) , but it immediately found new bugs in every lisp implementation on which I tried it .
The beauty of this approach is that it exploits increasingly cheap CPU cycles to save the increasingly relatively expensive programmer / tester cycles .
In my experience , random testing of just about anything is a really good thing .
I have always found it effective at finding those elusive corner cases that are so difficult for people to envision themselves .
The computer can generate such perverse test cases that it really makes you wonder why people do n't do this more often .
For instance , when I was at HP in the late 1980s working on the PA - RISC series 700 workstation products , I knew one of the engineers in the CPU group who was designing the next round of IEEE floating point co-processors for PA - RISC .
If you are n't fully aware , the IEEE FP spec is very precise , but has a number of very hairy corner cases .
In particular , things like rules for rounding in the last bit of precision are called out very clearly .
This engineer , who I always thought was pretty smart , built himself a software simulation of his chip design and proceeded to generate random test vectors for the new design .
Simultaneously , he ran those same vectors through his trusty Motorola 68 K FP copro and had the system stop and dump the vectors that produced any mismatches .
When he first fired up the simulation , it ran for only a few seconds before it found a problem .
He fixed the problem and restarted .
It ran for a minute .
He fixed the problem and restarted .
It ran for a few minutes .
He fixed the problem and restarted .
It ran for an hour or two .
He fixed the problem and restarted .
It ran for 24 hours .
He fixed the problem and restarted .
It then ran non -stop .
Note that if he had just done this , he actually could n't have been sure that his processor was bug - free , only that it had exactly the same bugs as his 68 K FPU .
To ensure that he did n't miss a bug , he also compared with earlier PA - RISC FPUs .
What is most interesting about this example is that if Intel had done the same basic testing on the original Pentium , they would not have suffered the massive FPU bug debacle in the 1990s .
I have used the same technique in testing network protocol implementations .
Protocol decoding is notoriously error - prone and bugs here can result in huge security holes .
In this case , I try to generate real data streams and then write a program to corrupt the data slightly .
Often , because protocols involve various packet integrity algorithms , you have to generate something that will make it all the way through different parts of the stack and not just get thrown out at the lowest levels , otherwise you are n't testing much other than the lowest layers of your system .
For instance , if you capture IP packets and corrupt them , recompute the IP and TCP checksums such that things do n't get bounced right at those checks but actually make it to different parts of the stack .
Others have successfully used the technique to test UNIX ( and here ) and Windows utilities .
In short , I do n't think I have ever seen a case where a random input tester did n't reveal a bug of some sort , unless the system had already been subjected to such a tester previously .
Update :
Here is a good description of William McKeeman 's work using random testing on the DEC C compiler .
I think that Paul 's blog referenced this but it dropped out when I did the cut / paste and I think Paul 's link was also stale .

A study in which teetotal Spanish nuns drank a regular half - liter of beer showed that beer may help reduce cholesterol levels , a group financed by the Spanish Beer Makers ' Association said on Thursday .
REUTERS / Sheng Li
MADRID ( Reuters ) - A study in which teetotal Spanish nuns drank a regular half - liter of beer showed that beer may help reduce cholesterol levels , a group financed by the Spanish Beer Makers ’ Association said on Thursday .
The study also showed that the beer did not need to contain alcohol or to be drunk in large quantities to be good for you .
The “ magic ” ingredient is hops .
“ Hops , one of the basic components of beer , may provide benefits ... in reducing levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides , ” the Centre for Information on Beer and Health said in a statement .
The experiment did not appear to have won many new beer fans among the teetotal Cistercian nuns who took part , chosen on the basis of their steady lifestyle and balanced diet .
“ To be honest , if I needed it to reduce cholesterol or whatever I ’d continue to drink it , but I would n’t just drink beer ( for itself ) because I do n’t like it , ” Sister Maria Jose told Spanish state television RTVE .
Fifty nuns drank half a liter of beer a day for 45 days , then stopped for six months .
Then they took 400 milligrams of hops daily for 40 days .
The result was a six percent reduction in total cholesterol among those with high levels , the Centre said .
“ We did it for the good of humanity , ” Sister Almerinda Alvarez told the newspaper El Pais .
If you were a totally crooked neo -con former CIA financier Republican who hangs with the corrupt Delay - Abramoff crowd , what would be the most unethical , diabolical way to funnel SO much money to the Republican Party and neo -con schemes that you could take back the government from the Democrats ?
Easy !
With your corrupt Republican buddies , form a slew of your own brand - new Defense Companies , submit bids on things the Pentagon never even asked for to the Delay / Cunningham network and Bingo !-- those contributions to the GOP and K Street will flow in like never before .
You can then even give to Presidential candidates like George W. Neo -Con .
Then you and your criminal gang take over the United States of America with your ill - gotten gains .
Once in power , you can use your connections to weasel your way iuto intelligence agency contracts so you can help said Neo - Cons cook up a case for the Iraq War by a phony analysis of some aluminum tubes .
The War on Terra is on !
Even more money for you and the GOP then .
It 's a simple plan - - one even the average American can understand .
Here 's how Wilkes and Wade , with the help of the Culture of Corruption , made all of themselves wealthy with taxpayer money .
Here 's
Wilkes former life as a CIA financier of black bag operations to introduce him , from Cannonfire :
Much evidence supports the contention that Wilkes became a Legitimate Businessman in one of the networks outlined above :
He was not of the Agency , in the sense of drawing a regular paycheck , but he became one of those " outside " businessmen who prospered by aiding the Agency , or a faction within it .
According to the San Diego Union Tribune , one of his early business ventures was very , very noteworthy : Wilkes had moved to Washington , D.C. , and opened a business named World Finance Corp. about three blocks away from the White House .
One of his chief activities , sources say , was to accompany congressmen -- including then - Rep.
Bill Lowery of San Diego , whom Wilkes met during his participation in the SDSU Young Republicans organization - to Central America to meet with Foggo and Contra leaders .
WFC still exists : http://www.downtownaugusta.com/...
ADCS , the company Wilkes headquartered in Poway , was founded on software designed by a German firm called VPMax .
I think we should see VPMax 's role in this as analogous to that of the Romanian concern which provided those wool uniforms to Saddam Hussein .
As I suggested earlier , Wilkes empire is largely a collection of false fronts built on a small foundation of " real " products , usually taken from other , smaller players .
And from there , we enter the current scandal .
About which , more to come soon .
Now Cannonfire on the current scandal :
Wilkes ' firms received millions of taxpayer dollars ; Daniel Hopsicker puts the amount at $ 700 million , although mainstream journalists speak of a much lower figure .
Regardless of the amount , sources agree that the Defense Department did not really like or need his document conversion services .
And Wilkes ' list of companies included obvious fakes .
Defense contracts are a matter of public record .
A reader named John Dean ( no , not the Watergate - related John Dean ) has been going through some of the records related to Wilkes -- a job which ought to be done by congressional investigators .
On one form , the given address does not relate to the massive Wilkes complex on Stowe Avenue in Poway .
Instead , the address is 15092 Avenue of Science , San Diego CA 92128 , That , we are told , is the address of a defense firm called Mirror Labs , allegedly a leading firm in the field of testing military equipment .
They are referenced in this edition of the Homeland Defense Journal .
Their website , we are told , is www.mirrorlabs.com.
That URL goes nowhere .
Google has no cache of anything ever being there .
However , this archive page reveals that they once did have a site up , from 2001 to early 2004 , at which point the firm , such as it was , seems to have become defunct .
The web pages speak of a company with branches in Virigina and Panama .
But the only satisfied customers mentioned are a couple of small - ish private companies ( real companies ) who had some software beta -tested .
Google presents no external evidence that a San Diego company named Mirror Labs has ever done anything related to defense , or that it had Virginia and Panama branches .
A background check on www.mirrorlabs.com shows that the URL address was registered by Group W Media , Wilkes ' fake ad agency .
The listed administrative contact is PerfectWave Techonologies , another fake company . )
I believe that , for all practical purposes , there is no Mirror Labs , although a firm by that name may well have performed an actual service at one time .
So where did the money go ?
When that nice fat check filled with taxpayer dollars was sent to 15092 Avenue of Science , who opened it ?
And what did they do with the money ?
Here is the organization that really has -- or had -- offices at that address : ADCS PAC !
That 's where the money went .
Apparently , Wilkes felt queasy about housing his PAC at the same address as ADCS proper , so he set up a small office in a San Diego business park .
Someone must have put down the wrong address on one of the applications .
So which candidates got chunks of that taxpayer money earmarked for " defense " ?
Henry Bonilla , Roy Brown , Rick Clayburgh , Duke Cunningham ( of course ! ) , John T. Doolittle , Maria Guadalupe Garcia , George W. Gekas , Lindsay Graham , Duncan Hunter , Darrell Issa , Samuel Johnson , Thaddeus G. McCotter , Constance Morella , Devin Nune , Steve Pearce , Bill Van de Weghe Jr. , Jerry Weller .
All Republicans , of course .
As the scandal unfolds , the pundits will try to convince us that " both sides do it . "
That simply is not true .
The donations amounted only to $ 5000 or so .
But ADCS Pac was hardly the only mechanism by which Wilkes could distribute the Christmas candy .
Remember , Perfect Wave Technologies , Pure Aqua Technologies , Group W. Advisors and other " subsidiaries " were also used as funding mechanisms .
By keeping the donations small , and by maintaining the illusion that the donors are numerous , the conspirators could line many a pocket with relative safety .
Clever , eh ?
Other recipients of Wilkes ' largesse : President Bush , Katherine Harris , Tom Delay , Virgil Goode Jr. and Elizabeth Dole ...
And then there 's Republican Appropriations Committee Chairman Jerry Lewis , who ordered continued funding of ADCS even after the DOD raised objections .
Obviously , Hunter and Lewis must go under the microscope .
Even so , you 're missing the point if you waste much time castigating the above - named politicians for receiving the money .
What is significant is the device itself -- using " false fronts " to translate IRS - collected revenues into Republican campaign commercials .
Much evidence indicates that Wilkes is but one of many villains involved with such schemes .
http://cannonfire.blogspot.com/
While I believe that the Wilkes Corporation ( also known as ADCS and Group W Advisors ) intended to hire enough people to give his firm a more convincing veneer of legitimacy , the available evidence indicates that Wilkes ' company existed primarily as a way - station for political pay - offs .
Remember the go - go days of the internet ?
Remember when a snazzy web page could make a tiny , under - financed company appear to be a massive conglomerate -- even when the firm conducted little actual business ?
Update that scenario to the post - 9/11 era , and you have the Wilkes corporation .
Apparently , they did provide the military with document services -- which means , basically , that they scanned a lot of hard - copy pages that had been yellowing in file drawers .
For example -- and this may be the only example -- ADCS worked on a project involving digitizing documents related to the building of the Panama Canal .
...
Is the Pentagon truly willing to pay three - quarters of a billion dollars to anyone who wants to run some old docs through a scanner ?
I know quite a few people who would volunteer to take that gig ...
I still have yet to discover any evidence that the other " defense - related " enterprises operating under the Wilkes umbrella were genuine businesses .
" Group W Media , " the advertising agency with no discernable clients , was a front for something -- I do n't yet know what .
" Group W Transportation " amounted to a time - share arrangement involving a Lear jet .
" Al Dust Properties " and " Group W Holdings " supposedly owned properties -- but I can't trace any holdings beyond the impressive building which the Wilkes Corporation called home .
( It 's now up for auction , by the way . )
MailSafe Inc. supposedly offers " mail decontamination , digital capture , and electronic distribution to government and commercial entities . "
But the web site has disappeared , and the company seems to have left zero imprint on corporate America .
Where is the evidence that it actually provided any services to clients ?
" PerfectWave Technologies " has ( or had ) what seems , at first , to be an impressive web page advertising speech recognition devices for the military .
( That page is really little more than a ghost , since the official Wilkes Corp. site no longer points to it . )
Look closer :
The site does not specify any PerfectWave products .
Neither do we encounter any named personnel or development teams .
No order information .
If this company makes battlefield - ready high - tech equipment , why does n't the the web site mention any departments , managers or employees ?
All we get is a single phone number and a fax number .
Now conduct a Google search : Aside from channeling funds to politicians , PerfectWave has n't done anything to warrant a mention .
" Pure Aqua Technologies " another Wilkes operation , seems to be pure snake oil .
No address , no telephone number , no nothing -- except this stupid web page , which is a joke .
This from a Kossak , LieparDestin
And thats when things start to get interesting for me .
Take a look at the Group W Media site again .
For an advertising firm , thats like ... no substance .
No nothing .
Just a single phone number and a mysterious login form .
Then take a look at another site owned by Wilkes , this time a company by the name of Archer Logistics .
Noting any similarities ?
A little substance , a smokescreen mostly .
No employee names , ceo names , nothing .
On to Acoustical Communication Systems .
A bit more substance to this company on first glance , but after a mere look around you 'll notice its all filler .
No news , no employee names , no nothing .
A Google or two will turn up that this and other companies listed , apparently never did anything of substance at all .
Notice the address of 13970 Stowe Drive
Poway , CA 92064 , the same as that Group W Media and ADCS .
How about Liberty Defense Tech .
AkamaiInfo
Tech thanks to archive.org is a bit interesting merely for the fact that the name is so similar to that of Akamai Tech , who 's CEO was on one of the flights that crashed into the WTC .
Now my favorite so far is PerfectWave Technologies Look at that site !
Fancy Smancy , at first glance you think you have something .
Second glance even .
But try one more time , notice the address : LOCATION
13970 Stowe Drive , Poway , CA 92064 .
Notice the lack ways to contact them .
Lack of employee information or any media releases , etc. Google and Yahoo turn up nothing from this company except donations to the GOP .
All these high - level companies , all in this 11 million dollar building , but at the same time this article says that only 100 people work at the building .
But anyhow , more on PerfectWave .

Try using the same site to search for ADCS , Wilkes ( Brent and Regina ) , MZM etc .
Now I dont know if Im misinterpreting all this but to me it looks like : Wilkes and Co payoff Cunningham to get them DOD contracts .
Wilkes and Co ( guessing ) subcontract these to whomever it is they subcontract them to , and skim a load off the top , funneling it into dummy business 's to turn around and donate it to the GOP & GOP related causes .
Oh almost forgot the oddest for last The Poway Mafia .
Another site owned by Wilkes .
Definately creepy .
Most of Wilkes Companies , when you go into those sites above , HAVE THE SAME ADDRESS AND EVEN HAVE THE SAME FAX NUMBER : 858-848-0400 !!
They are obviously fake fronts for laundering taxpayer money into GOP TV ads .
Now Mitchell Wade , from Cannonfire :
unlike Wilkes , kept the MZM Pac housed in the very same office .
( We must presume that they did n't have a great deal of office space , since unrelated tenants are in the same building . )
When we look at the data on MZM Pac and its activities in 2003 - 2004 , we learn that the population of this company has grown by leaps and bounds .
The PAC now lists roughly 100 names .
A close scan of the names indicates that wives and children were recruited to the cause -- the cause being , of course , donations to G.O.P. candidates .
( One of the named donors is " Joe Dollar . "
That can't be real -- can it ? )
Nearly all the donors are listed as employees of MZM Inc. , and many have grandiose titles -- Chairman of this , VP of that .
MZM employees , we learn , were told they had to make the donations or be fired .
I believe there are laws against that sort of thing .
Frankly , I 'm not at all sure how MZM transformed itself from a two - man law office into a go - go defense and intelligence firm .
For that , it would seem , is the final incarnation of MZM .
According to the Center for Public Integrity MZM Inc. is a high - tech national security firm based in Washington , D.C.
The private firm provides intelligence gathering , technology and homeland security analysis and consulting for both international and domestic governments and private - sector clients .
The firm also provides consulting on political and public message strategies .
Its government clients include Congress , the White House , the Defense Department , the U.S. intelligence community , the Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force and state and local governments , according to the company 's Web site .
MZM refused to provide any information , however , about its corporate structure , including names of other principals .
In addition to its D.C. headquarters , MZM has field offices in Miami , Tampa , San Antonio , San Diego and Suffolk , Va .
The company employs about 70 people .
Following the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , MZM expanded its counterintelligence and national security efforts .
It soon experienced an influx of government contracts .
The company now predicts a growth rate of more than 35 percent in the 2003 fiscal year .
Mitchell Wade , president and CEO , reportedly expects to increase sales from $ 25 million to $ 120 million and to hire 230 more employees over the next five years .
Wade told the Richmond Times - Dispatch that recently the company has " come out of a flat period " with defense industry contracts .
In September 2003 , MZM collaborated with 16 other organizations , called the General Dynamics team , as part of a five - year , $ 252 million contract to provide engineering and information warfare services to the Air Force Information Warfare Center at Lackland Airforce Base in Texas .
In November 2002 , MZM opened a computer center in Charlottesville , Va. , to house classified engineering intelligence in a digital mapping and architecture analysis system .
Twelve employees in that office are developing the program for the Pentagon .
It is designed to provide digital maps of thousands of buildings worldwide .
The Richmond Times - Dispatch reported that the mapping system will help soldiers and planners know details of buildings -- even which way doors open and close .
At least we are given some indication of what the firm actually does .
The data page goes on to name a number of individuals involved with this work -- intelligence analysts , generals , the kind of people whom we would expect to be involved with such an enterprise .
Cornelison seems to have disappeared .
But how much of this data is on the level ?
One would think that so august a firm would have a web site .
However , the listed URL -- www.mzinc.com -- is blank , as is Google 's cache for that page .
Interestingly , Dean found an MZM contract with the DOD dated February 13 , 2003 in which MZM states that it has zero employees and zero revenue .
The contract is for a mere $ 12,740,000 .

Update [ 2005-12-10 12:47:8 by Sherlock Google ] :
Found out more about MZM being investigated for intelligence work for the agency that cooked the aluminum tubes story , used as an excuse to invade Iraq .
From the Washington Post :
The NGIC is a critical Army intelligence center with a staff of 900 , three - quarters of whom are civilian scientists , engineers and intelligence analysts .
The other one - quarter are active military .
Most NGIC employees work at a relatively new facility near Charlottesville , where they produce the Army 's primary intelligence analyses of foreign armies , their force structures and capabilities .
Others conduct scientific and technical studies on foreign weapons and technologies .
The NGIC , which is facing an inquiry by the director of national intelligence for its prewar mistakes in analyzing Iraq 's weapons programs , has been drawn into the federal investigations of MZM , according to Army and Justice Department spokesmen .
The NGIC was criticized in March by the Silberman - Robb presidential commission for " gross failure " in its analysis of Iraqi arms .
The commission said the center was " completely wrong " when it found in September 2002 that the aluminum tubes Iraq was purchasing were " highly unlikely " to be used for rocket motor cases .
That inaccurate finding bolstered a CIA contention that the tubes were meant for nuclear centrifuges and were evidence that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was reconstituting a nuclear weapons program .
Two NGIC analysts who produced the inaccurate finding have received annual performance awards each year since 2002 .
Officials said the bonuses were for their overall activities .
Gen. Michael V. Hayden , the deputy director of national intelligence , told reporters June 29 that his office would conduct its own inquiry into the Silberman - Robb finding .
When Parker , the center spokeswoman , was asked last week about Rich , his son and NGIC personnel going to work for MZM or MZM employees working at the NGIC , she said in a statement that " due to the ongoing investigation on MZM , we must refer all questions concerning MZM , its employees and activities " to the Justice Department .
The MZM investigation is being carried out by the FBI , the Defense Criminal Investigative Service , the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. attorney 's offices in the District of Columbia and San Diego , according to one law enforcement official .
That official would not say where the intelligence center may fit in .
MZM Involvement in Aluminum Tubes LIE !
Update [ 2005-12-10 16:54:41 by Sherlock Google ] : Found by Rockmoonwater downthread , here is a look at the Group W / Perfect Wave Lobbying Report in which they report less than $ 10,000 income for Group W. Looks fishy , less than $ 10,000 .
Also shows how they split everything up at Group W to no doubt avoid certain disclosure .
Group W Lobby Reports and Registrations
These Wilkes and MZM companies were mostly frauds , bull , a sham , counterfeit , simulated , false .
They were fronts to collect quid pro quo contracts from fellow GOP wingnuts .
The taxpayer money went straight from the US Treasury to the Wilkes and MZM PACS and from there cycled back to the GOP campaigns and the GOP K Street Cartel .
All the while , DoD never asked for these contracts and even complained about ADCS and was ignored !
Kudos to LieparDestin on this one , whose diary scrolled off before we could realize what Cannonfire and this John Dean fellow had uncovered .
Oh and RECOMMEND like you 've never recommended before .
Read it out loud to your family and friends for fun and enjoyment .

Update [ 2005-12-11 17:14:40 by Sherlock Google ] : A house staffer , Eric Massa , said this is what is going on and explained further when asked if the phony front companies were true : " This has been going on since " K Street "
Yep , the scam works just the way that the San Diego union has been reporting it in the Cunningham case .
First , a member of Congress slips a " member add " into the budget ( wether appropriations or authorization ) and then once that money comes through for the company - the pay offs begin .
It has now been laid bare by Cunningham and I suspect that there will be others involved .
The interesting point is that this will be a Republican issue in that they control both Houses of Congress and therefore have total and complete control over the budget process .
In fact , the Republican leadership under Delay have told companies that if the talk to Members on both the sides of the isle then they cannot request anything from the Republicans - and since they are calling the shots 100 % of the time in the budget process then they write out any company that even talks to a Democrat .
It 's all very public and very out there and will only be more so now that Cunningham has admitted to the entire scam .
Stand by for more from that case
Massa added another comment that Rumsfeld could be taken down too by all this .
Rumsfeld is Fungible
Update [ 2005-12-11 19:12:36 by Sherlock Google ] : Delay got Wilkes ' money :

Sally damage estimates surge to $ 309 million in Escambia County
" I do n't know how you could look at the photos and videos that our citizens have provided and not think that we absolutely deserve the assistance , " Escambia County Administrator Janice Gilley said .
“ After the July 7 attacks , this is not the time to be antagonizing Britain by presenting Muslims as something sinister , ” said Imran Ahmad , the author of “ Unimagined , ” an autobiography about growing up Muslim in Britain , and the leader of British Muslims for Secular Democracy .
“ The veil is so steeped in subjugation , I find it so offensive someone would want to create such barriers .
It ’s retrograde . ”
Image Faatema Mayata , a 24 - year - old teacher , said her veil was linked to her identity as a Muslim .
Credit ... Hazel Thompson for The New York Times
Since South Asians started coming to Britain in large numbers in the 1960s , a small group of usually older , undereducated women have worn the niqab .
It was most often seen as a sign of subjugation .
Many more Muslim women wear the head scarf , called the hijab , covering all or some of their hair .
Unlike in France , Turkey and Tunisia , where students in state schools and civil servants are banned from covering their hair , in Britain , Muslim women can wear the head scarf , and indeed the niqab , almost anywhere , for now .
But that tolerance is slowly eroding .
Even some who wear the niqab , like Faatema Mayata , a 24 - year - old psychology and religious studies teacher , agreed there were limits .
“ How can you teach when you are covering your face ? ” she said , sitting with a cup of tea in her living room in Blackburn , a northern English town , her niqab tucked away because she was within the confines of her home .
She has worn the niqab since she was 12 , when she was sent by her parents to an all - girl boarding school .
The niqab was not , as many Britons seemed to think , a sign of extremism , she said .
She condemned Britain ’s involvement in Iraq , and she described the departure of Mr. Blair at the end of this month as “ good riddance of bad rubbish . ”
But , she added , “ there are many Muslims like this sitting at home having tea , and not taking any interest in jihad . ”

All Things Pythonic
Python Sprint Report
by Guido van van Rossum
August 25 , 2006
For reference , here are the URLs for the sprint 's wiki page and the py3 k wiki page .
I 'll start with the results of the Py3 k part of the sprint , since I was most directly involved in it .
Warming Up
In the weeks before the sprint , I had made a number of pervasive changes to the interpreter , such as completely removing classic classes , and mostly removing has_key ( ) .
This had some fall - out ; a half dozen or so unit tests were failing as the sprint started .
Three of these failures were attacked by several sprinters and quickly fixed .
As another warm - up exercise , Alex Martelli and I tackled the problem of __hash__ overloading .
The issue is too subtle to explain here in much detail .
The problem is that object .
__hash__ exists while e.g. list .__hash__ should ideally not exist ; the solution is to set __hash__ to None in the metaclass whenever a class overrides comparison without also defining __hash__ .
We were quickly victorious ; we probably spent more time reading the old code trying to understand it , and discussing the various alternative ways to fix the problem , than we spent actually implementing it .
At this point ( late the first day ) all unit tests were passing in the py3 k branch .
This was an important milestone : we could now trust that any new test failures were introduced by recent changes , and insist that developers make all tests pass before checking in changes .
Anna Ravenscroft went through the standard library looking for places where file ( ) is called to construct a file object -- the most future - proof , and hence recommended , practice is to call open ( ) , not file ( ) .
After getting through the modules starting with ' a ' through ' g ' without finding a single occurrence of file ( ) , she asked me if I was playing a cruel joke on her .
But no , it just turned out that all the offending calls occurred much later in the alphabet !
( I wonder if someone else did the same for the 2.5 library and gave up after fixing the first half of the alphabet ? )
Int / Long Unification Martin von Löwis decided to tackle the unification of int and long .
He did this in a separate branch , which was probably a good idea from a software development point of view , but got him a bit of unnecessary attention from core developers who are n't on the Python 3000 mailing list but are on the python checkins list , and started criticizing Martin 's unfinished work without understanding the plan or its context .
As of this writing , Martin 's work is not yet completed .
Allocating of a unified int object ( which at this point is essentially a Python 2.5 long , i.e. an arbitrary precision integer ) takes about 2 times as long as allocating a Python 2.5 " short " int ( which can only hold a C long , i.e. 32 or 64 bits depending on the platform ) .
Martin is n't sure how to speed things up further .
Pystone dropped by about 10 % , which is n't so bad .
See also Martin 's complete report .
Reinventing Comparison Neal Norwitz continued for a while on a project on which he had embarked before the sprint started : ripping out the last remains of coerce ( ) .
He nearly completed this , and then ran into a snag : a call to PyNumber_CoerceEx ( ) deep down in the implementation of comparisons which caused everything to fall down if removed .
So he checked in his work up to that point ( leaving that one crucial call in ) and passed the baton to me .
Looking at the issue , I realized that the only way to fix this would be to implement the revision of comparisons that I had been planning for Py3k .
So I ended up spending at least two days , with Alex helping on and off , reworking the guts of comparisons , making them comply with my vision for comparisons in Python 3000 .
This turned out to be a real can of worms !
The plan has two parts : ( a ) no default mixed - type orderings , so e.g. ' a ' < 1 would raise a TypeError ( but ' a '= =1 should return False ) ; and ( b ) do n't use __cmp__ as a fallback for rich comparisons .
I started by implementing a super - strict interpretation of these rules , which also removed falling back on rich comparisons when __cmp__ was requested .
Once it compiled , it would n't even start up , because some code in site .py was broken as a result .
It turned out that ints and longs did n't implement rich comparisons !
That was quickly fixed , and now we could at least start the interpreter .
But running the test suite would always eventually end with a segfault .
Much later , I discovered that this was due to a failing error check on a dict lookup call in the bytecode compiler ( quickly fixed the next day by Jeremy ) which was triggered by code objects not having a proper comparison any more .
Removing all comparison code from the code object made it default to the default comparison ( and hash ) implementation , which was good enough to stop the compiler from malfunctioning .
At this point we had about 70 failing unit tests .
I spent about a day fixing these , one by one .
Fairly early during this process I realized that if neither object knows how to compare itself to the other , for == and != , we should n't fail , but return the default ( pointer ) comparison instead .
A bit later I decided that there were too many uses of cmp ( ) in the library and the test suite to rip out , so I had to compromise : when cmp does n't find a tp_compare implementation , it falls back to using the tp_richcompare implementation .
But ( and this is still a big departure from 2.5 ) not the other way around !
Slowly but surely more and more unit tests got fixed .
I checked in a checkpoint with only four failing tests .
Two of these expected to compare code objects by value , and I eventually implemented this again ( but no ordering on code objects ! ) .
The last two failing tests required a consultation with Tim Peters : datetime had some extrelemy convoluted code to avoid hitting the default ordering , which no longer is a problem in Py3k , and so got ripped out ; and the last hold - out was test_mutants .
py .
After Tim explained why it was there and how to fix it , it discovered a reference counting bug !
That is its job , but the interesting part was that the same reference counting bug also exists in 2.5 and was n't found there , because in 2.5 test_mutants only exercises three - way comparison but not rich comparison ( and 2.5 dictionaries implement both separately ! ) .
This was fun ( in some extreme geek way :) but meant I did n't get to the project I had really wanted to do : the new I /O library .
A few people ( especially Charles Merriam and Hasan Diwan ) looked into the design issues there but not all that much concrete work was done .
