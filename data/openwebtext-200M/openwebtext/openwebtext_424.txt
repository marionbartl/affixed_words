Blizzard Entertainment reported Friday that its game World of Warcraft : The Burning Crusade recently surpassed one million concurrent users in China .
That 's the highest concurrency since the game was launched in China in 2005 .
World of Warcraft is a massively multiplayer online role playing game available for Mac OS X and Windows .
The game was released in the United States in late 2004 and spawned an expansion pack , the Burning Crusade .
Blizzard is presently working on a second expansion pack for World of Warcraft , the Wrath of the Lich King .
Blizzard works with The9 Limited in mainland China .
The9 Limited operates online games in China , primarily licensed from other companies like Blizzard , but has also developed its own proprietary MMO .

You name it , and somewhere there ’s a place where you can buy it right out of a machine !
Let ’s take a look at some of the weirder vending machines you can stick your money into .
Medical marijuana can be purchased from a vending machine in California .
Yes , you have to have a prescription .
In order to use the machines , you have to have an ID card , and you ’ll be fingerprinted and photographed by a security guard at the machine site .
See a video report here Nathan 's Famous hot dogs in Coney Island is the site of the annual July 4th hot dog eating contest .
Soon , New Yorkers will be able to get the famous dogs from a vending machine !
They ’ll be kosher , as the machines are run by Kosher Vending Industries , which already makes kosher pizza and other items available by machine .
Only selected Nathan ’s locations currently sell dogs with rabbinical oversight .
The Atlanta airport is home to a Zoom Shop machine that sells iPod Minis and Shuffles , along with batteries and digital cameras .
There are similar machines at other airports .
Have your credit card ready , this probably does n’t take quarters !

company makes vending machines that sell dog supplies , such as dog food , leashes , flea collars , chew toys , treats , waste bag holders and refills , and purified water .
Check for a location near you .
Fishermen get up and go earlier than bait shop owners prefer , so the idea of a live bait vending machine makes sense , even if it seems weird .
In 1993 , fisherman Joe Meyer converted an old sandwich machine to a bait machine and sold it to a shop owner , who now has 30 machines and sells 10,000 night crawlers every week !
Bait machines are refrigerated , and the bait is sealed in plastic bags with an oxygen tablet added .
They do n’t expect you to buy food for crows ; this machine is for the crows to use !
The point of the experiment is to create a device that will train crows to pick up change dropped on the ground and exchange it for peanuts , using this specially - designed vending machine .
See a video here Japan is vending machine heaven .
You can get pretty much anything you like from vending machines .
Sometimes a row of vending machines will replace an entire store !
There are vending machines that sell pornography bread in a can , and even fresh eggs .
There are reports of fetish items still for sale in Japanese vending machines , if you know where to look .
Cigarette machines are only seen in antique stores in America these days , but they are still used in Japan , where the legal age to buy tobacco is twenty .
New technology is being developed to keep underage smokers from using the machines .
New machines require a “ taspo ” ( tobacco passport ) card , an ID issued by the Tobacco Institute of Japan .
Manufacturer Fujitaka has another machine in development that uses face - recognition software to “ see ” how old the buyer is .
The face recognition is around 90 % accurate in judging a person ’s age .
It has yet to be approved for public use .
No , you do n’t get to go for free everywhere .
Some places still have coin -operated toilets .
In Japan , you can use the facilities , but you ’ll have to pay for the paper , at least in some public areas .
But you might get lucky : Japanese businesses often hand out free samples as part of their advertising budget , since the individual packets have advertising printed on them .
This machine in Osaka is not exactly a vending machine - it ’s a claw game !
You pay your money and test your skills at catching a live lobster , which is also the prize .
Have fun carrying it home !
Vending machines are so popular in Japan that they ’ve been made into a popular toy , which in turn was the inspiration for these life size Coke Bots !
Congress : Stop Drug Testing on Vets Now and Investigate Veterans groups are also calling for an immediate suspension of the tests .
June 18 , 2008  --
At least three more members of Congress are calling for an immediate suspension of government tests on veterans involving an anti-smoking drug that has been linked to suicide .
" Nearly 40 suicides and more than 400 incidents of suicidal behavior have been linked to Chantix , yet the VA has chosen to continue the study and administer Chantix to veterans with PTSD , " said Congressman Bob Filner ( D - CA ) .
" The VA must immediately suspend this study until a comprehensive review of the safety of the protocol is conducted , " said Rep. Filner .
Rep. Filner along with Rep. Ed Markey ( D - MA ) and Rep. Paul Hodes ( D - NH ) sent a letter to the Secretary of Veterans '
Affairs today expressing their concern over the ABC News report and asking , among other things , for copies of consent and notification forms related to the study .
" Allowing , even encouraging , military veterans who have already made enormous sacrifices for our country to participate in drug studies that may cause serious , long - lasting health effects is tantamount to breaking our national promise to honor and support our veterans , " said Rep .
Markey today .
Yesterday , a report on Good Morning America revealed that mentally distressed veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are being recruited for government tests on pharmaceutical drugs linked to suicide and other violent side effects .
The report was the result of a joint investigation by ABC News and The Washington Times .
In one of the human experiments , involving the anti-smoking drug Chantix , Veterans Administration doctors waited more than three months before warning veterans about the possible serious side effects of Chantix , including suicide and neuropsychiatric behavior .
" Lab rat , guinea pig , disposable hero , " said former US Army sniper James Elliott in describing how he felt he was betrayed by the Veterans Administration .
Elliott , 38 , of suburban Washington , D.C. , was recruited , at $ 30 a month , for the Chantix anti-smoking study three years after being diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder .
He served a 15 - month tour of duty in Iraq from 2003 - 2004 .
Months after he began taking the drug , Elliott suffered a mental breakdown , experiencing a relapse of Iraq combat nightmares he blames on Chantix .
Veterans groups are also expressing their anger over the study .
Veterans groups are also expressing their anger over the study and are also calling for the studies to be ceased and for an investigation .
" Our nation 's veterans are not guinea pigs , " said Paul Rieckhoff , executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America .
" It is unacceptable for even one veteran to have been misled about the possible side effects of Chantix . "
The executive director of Veterans for Commons Sense said that this is yet another example of the VA failing America 's veterans .
" VA should have done a better job protecting the human rights of our veterans , " said Paul Sullivan of VCS .
" While VCS supports research to assist veterans , VA must bear a heavy burden of responsibility with these experiments on veterans diagnosed with PTSD , " said Sullivan , who is also calling for an immediate suspension of the study .
Meanwhile , the VA is calling the ABC News / Washington Times report " inaccurate and misleading " .
" In our PTSD and smoking cessation study , our research is to learn if it is easier to stop smoking when smoking cessation treatment is combined with PTSD therapy , or whether the two therapies are more effective if they are provided separately , " said a statement posted on the VA website .
" In either case , patients are receiving treatment recommended by their own doctors using counseling with or without FDA approved medication that includes Varenicline ( Chantix ) .
Participation in this program is voluntary , and all participants are closely monitored clinically by mental health professionals who provide smoking cessation methods patients agree to use , " the VA statement said .
The VA also said that it passed on warning about Chantix in a timely manner in November of last year after the FDA issued a statement on Chantix .
' VA immediately passed along that concern to practitioners at all of our medical centers .
On February 1 , FDA issued a ' Public Health Advisory , ' to providers , providing more information on potential side effects of which clinicians and patients should be aware .
VA distributed this alert to pharmacists in its system on that same day , and to researchers on February 5 , " said the statement .
The VA also said that it wrote a letter to participants that while not specifically warning of the suicide links , requested that they discuss possible side - effects with their doctors .
The VA said the team that wrote the letter " felt that the issue of suicide should be discussed in a clinical setting , not in a mailing to a group of patients . "
Chantix is one of the drugs being used in an estimated 25 clinical studies using veterans by the VA .
Pfizer maintains that ' the benefits of Chantix outweigh the risks " and that it continues to do further studies on the drug .

Joe Lieberman , the senator from Tel Aviv , has told “ right - winger , ” as the “ left - wingers ” at Think Progress deem him , Bill Bennett on his radio show that splattering toddlers and grandmothers in Iran has an “ appeal to it . ”
All this dementia and psychopathy came up during a discussion of Hillary Clinton , who has promised to “ obliterate ” Iran if it nukes Israel , something Iran will never do because it would be mass suicide , but never mind .
BENNETT : Listen , I give her credit .
She has found her …three things .
She ’s found her voice .
He is very much in the background now , it ’s not this , you know , ventriloquial thing , it ’s definitely her voice .
LIEBERMAN : That ’s true .
BENNETT : And Joe , you know , this is my style .
This is a girl who puts on her pearls , goes down , throws down a shot of liquor and bombs Iran , you know .
This is …lookout Mrs. Bennett , this is my kind of girl .
LIEBERMAN : Hehehe , it does have an appeal to it .
“ Neither Lieberman nor Bennett is shy about his willingness to militarily strike Iran , ” comments Think Progress , sort of like Think Democrat .
Um , excuse me , the comments transcend “ willingness ” and demonstrate a psychotic obsession with killing Persians , Muslims , and Arabs .
If you want to listen to this bit of mental illness , surf over to the Think Progress page .
Joe Lieberman is no different than Charlie Manson .
Charlie did n’t actually kill anybody , he had his brainwashed minions do it , same as George Bush and his neocon minions did n’t actually kill any Iraqis , they had their brainwashed troops do it .
Charlie ’s killers , jacked up on LSD , killed maybe a dozen or so people while Bush ’s troops have thus far killed around a million .
Add to that the two plus million killed by George Bush Senior and his “ son , ” Bill Clinton .
As a reward , our rulers have bestowed upon Bush Senior and Bill Clinton the title of “ elder statesman , ” showered them with book deals and lucrative speaking engagements .
Horrifically , the masses fawn over these “ celebrities , ” as they have since time immemorial .

Call / Recall has announced it is developing a 1TB optical drive and disk , backwards compatible with Blu-ray , in partnership with with the Nichia Corporation of Japan .
Call / Recall began synthesizing 1TB materials for Nichia ’s blue - violet laser diodes in December 2007 , with first initial testing successfully completed in March 2008 .
InPhase has just this year announced its revolutionary 300 GB holographic disk and here is another optical format with more than three times the capacity .
How realistic is this ?
Call / Recall and Nichia will jointly develop the ultra high - capacity optical disc recording and playback system .
It is designed around Nichia 's commercially available violet and blue laser diodes and Call / Recall ’s one terabyte media .
Understanding Nichia is simple : it co-developed blue - violet laser diodes in conjunction with Sony and they are used in Blu-ray drives .
Understanding Call / Recall is not so simple .
It is privately funded and was founded in 1987 to provide advanced research into optical storage technologies and ultra- high storage solutions for military and commercial customers .
The company ’s patented , 2 - photon 3D optical technology is based on optical storage technology invented by company co-founder Dr. Peter Rentzepis .
He is an optical scientist whose work is at the core of many of the world ’s top optical technology providers .
This is not fluff .
Rentzepis is a former head of Bell Laboratories who has authored approximately 85 patents .
These are referenced as existing technology by 45 optical technology providers , who number IBM , Panasonic and Hitachi in their ranks .
One secret sauce is the use of a Rhodamine - type dye in a recording layer .
It is excited by laser light and reacts to give off light when excited by another laser at a different wavelength .
Such light emission or its absence can be used to indicate binary ones and zeroes .
The dye spots are tiny and can exist in 200 - 250 layers thus providing the 1TB capacity .
The use of a single lens to read multiple layers is enabled by having a fluid - filled lens and increasing / reducing the fluid content and thus the lens ' profile and its focal length .
The I/O rate is said to be around 100MB / sec , five times faster than InPhase 's holographic drives .
The process is not reversible and produces write - once - read - many ( WORM ) media .
Reversibility is being worked on and there is a generalised roadmap out to 5TB , still on CD - sized 120 mm platters .
The use of pretty standard components apart from the lens and recording layer should make for a more affordable drive than InPhase 's Tapestry drive which is priced around $ 12,000 .
Call / Recall received an outside capital injection in 2005 and Wayne Yamamoto became its CEO with the goal of commercialising its technology .
This deal with Nichia is a first public milestone of its progress toweards that goal .
What about potential markets ?
Here 's what the company says : ' The demand for blue - violet laser - based recording and playback is expected to grow as the US market approaches the hard shut - off of standard analog broadcast on February 17 , 2009 .
Digital High Definition requires more bandwidth and greater storage capacity .
Call / Recall anticipates being able to release a Blu-ray compatible disk as well as a backwards - compatible player able to read Blu-ray disks as well as Call / Recall ’s higher capacity formats .
Call / Recall also intends to use the technology for the enterprise market for the archiving of corporate information . '
Nothing has been said about product availability .
Guesstimation suggests 2010 or 2011 but there are plenty of potential obstacles to be dealt with .

Two large studies involving more than 21,000 people found that people with Type 2 diabetes had no reduction in their risk of heart attacks and strokes and no reduction in their death rate if they rigorously controlled their blood sugar levels .
The results provide more details and bolster findings reported in February , when one of the studies , by the National Institutes of Health , ended prematurely .
At that time , researchers surprised diabetes experts with the announcement that study participants who were rigorously controlling their blood sugar actually had a higher death rate than those whose blood sugar control was less stringent .
Now the federal researchers are publishing detailed data from that study for the first time .
Researchers in the second study , from Australia and involving participants from 20 countries , are also publishing their results on blood sugar and cardiovascular disease .
That study did not find an increase in deaths , but neither did it find any protection from cardiovascular disease with rigorous blood sugar control .
Thus both studies failed to confirm a dearly held hypothesis that people with Type 2 diabetes could be protected from cardiovascular disease if they strictly controlled their blood sugar .
LONDON  Fix the gravesite .
But do n't touch the bones .
That 's the work order , in a nutshell , for brave architects contemplating a fixup job for the deteriorating gravesite of William Shakespeare inside the Holy Trinity Church in his hometown of Stratford - upon - Avon .
The illustrious bard is believed by many to have personally penned the threat on a stone marker above his grave .
" Blest be the man that spares these stones , " it reads .
" And curst be he that moves my bones . "
That 's all well and good , but the stones above his grave are starting to flake and fall apart .
Clergymen have trod on the stones for nearly four centuries , and the foot traffic is taking its inevitable toll .
People who love the church and its place in British literary history want to fix it — provided they can do so without digging up Shakespeare 's remains and facing the mysterious threat .
" We 're avoiding the curse , " said Josephine Walker , a spokeswoman for the Friends of Shakespeare 's Church group .
" We are not lifting the stones , we are not looking underneath , and the curse is for the bones underneath , so the curse is irrelevant for this work . "
" It 's our wish that we conserve this without anyone knowing we were there , " said architect Ian Stainburn , who is working on the project .
" We want to conserve it as it is and slow down the natural process of decay but we do n't want to recut it .
It 's really a challenge . "
The restoration work is delicate because the church , 100 miles northwest of London , is not only a functional house of worship where Shakespeare was baptized in 1564 but also a treasure popular with visitors from around the globe .
" We get 100,000 tourists a year , but they do n't walk on the stones , " Walker said .
" But the clergy have to when they give communion , and the stones are flaking away , the surfaces are coming off .
We want to clean the surfaces and then very gradually ease in some transparent grout and hold the surfaces together .
Then we want to move the altar rail so that when the clergy give communion they do n't have to walk over the stones . "
The planned work on the gravesite , which has not yet been approved by the various agencies that oversee historic sites , is part of a much larger restoration of the church that began two years ago , Walker said .
The group is trying to raise an additional $ 8 million for the entire project , she said .
One of the most urgent tasks is to repair the main nave windows , which are in very poor shape .
" The metal work is eroding and disintegrating , " she said .
" That 's a really big , major job that has to be done , hopefully next year . "
At least they do n't face a centuries - old curse if they repair the windows .
If they get the money and the approvals , they can do the work without worrying about angering the Bard 's ghost .

Was the new finger a ' natural ' miracle ?
By Caroline Parkinson
Health reporter , BBC News
The fingertip has ' amazing ' healing powers
The story of the man who re-grew a finger using " pixie - dust " has captured the imagination of many this week .
But a number of scientists have cast cold - water over the claims - and said it may have been a " natural " miracle .
Lee Spievak , 69 , chopped off part of his finger - said to be almost down to the first joint - in a model aeroplane accident in 2005 .
His brother was working in the field of regenerative medicine , with Dr Stephen Badylak at the University of Pittsburgh .
They provided Mr Spievak , who lives in Cincinnati , Ohio , with the " pixie - dust " - more accurately called extracellular matrix , which he sprinkled on his finger .
Extracellular matrix is , essentially , the support structure for cells which is present in all animal and human tissue .
In this case it was taken from an extract of pig bladder .
Within weeks , it is said the tip of the finger - including bone , tissue , skin and nail grew back .
' A common - or - garden injury ' Dr Badylak 's team had previously been working on regenerating much simpler biological structures using the extracellular matrix .
That is something that numerous teams of scientists across the world have been pursuing for decades .
Extracellular matrix is just one of the " scaffolds " for supporting new cell growth .
But re-growing a fingertip would be a significant step forward .
Please turn on JavaScript .

Professor Stephen Minger , an expert in stem cell and regenerative medicine at Kings College London , said : " This is where my scepticism comes in .
It would be a really complex task .
" At the moment people are trying to figure out how to make heart , brain and liver cells .
" I do n't see how they could re-grow a fingertip by sprinkling on extracellular matrix . "
Mr Spievak says he has regained feeling in his finger .
But Professor Minger said : " When people have a fingertip reattached , the nerves do n't re-grow and people have no sense of pressure , or of pain . "
' A remarkable process ' Scientists say they want to see research by Dr Badylak published in peer - reviewed journals - which means work has been assessed by other experts - rather than simply hearing anecdotal reports .
Simon Kay , professor of hand surgery at the University of Leeds said he suspected that Mr Spievak had sustained a " very common - or - garden , mundane fingertip injury " which had not affected the bone or led to the loss of the nail .

He said that the tip of the finger had amazing natural healing powers , which may not be universally recognised .
" It appears to regenerate because new skin grows over the end of the finger - that 's a normal recovery . "
If there is any tissue remaining on top of the bone , the person will even retain a " tip " .
" It 's quite a remarkable process .
" It can be utterly surprising how well it repairs after what appears to be a ghastly injury but it's what you might expect from the most peripheral part of the body . "

Last week a rather important event occurred .
The Ford F - Series trucks were overthrown from their throne of number one best selling vehicle after decades of sales dominance .
In another sign of the times the cars that replaced the empty chair are fuel efficient vehicles .
This is rather important since it appears that we are reaching a tipping point in terms of fuel prices .
Every year we hear consumers complain about fuel costs but rarely do anything to change their behavior .
It appears the biggest motivator for changing behavior is simply making people go flat broke :
“ ( Ford ) After decades of sales domination , the Ford F - Series was outdone as the best - selling vehicle in America in May by four Japanese cars — a development that symbolizes the difficulty Ford Motor Co. ’s turnaround now faces .
The F - Series , which is built at factories in Dearborn , Kansas City , Mo. , and Louisville , Ky. , represents about one - fourth of the company ’s total sales .
In May , F - Series sales plummeted 30.6 % , to 42,973 , as customers continued to reject trucks in favor of more affordable , fuel - efficient cars .
“ It is a sign of the times , ” said Jim Farley , Ford ’s group vice president for marketing and communications .
“ But it is not surprising , given the fuel price .
We have never seen $ 4.20 - a- gallon gas . ”
With the additional announcement that the Hummer line may be sold or discontinued , it seems like we are heading to a new landscape in the automotive industry .
In today ’s article we are going to examine this trend on how higher fuel prices are hurting places in the suburbs and the trend of buying bigger places in the boonies simply to own a piece of real estate in Southern California .
This may be a thing of the past .
Commuting from Temecula to Costa Mesa
Temecula is a city in southwestern Riverside County .
In recent years , it has been booming with new home construction .
The population has been growing as well over this time :
Much of this population boom was also based on those in surrounding high priced areas that wanted the ability to purchase a nice large sized home , but were not able to afford it in expensive San Diego and Orange Counties .
In fact , I know a few folks that make the commute from Costa Mesa and Irvine to Temecula everyday .
Their desire was to purchase a new home for their growing family .
They were willing to brave the arduous commute each day for the dream of having a large home .
Although these folks are doing well , many others are not .
In our case example today we are going to examine how the commute from Temecula to Costa Mesa will cost someone who may have purchased a F - 150 in previous years .
Here are our basic assumptions :
Auto and Driving Details :
Year : 1999
F -150 XLT supercab
27 Gallon tank
Average MPG : 14
Full Tank Range : 378
Total Commute distance : 69 Miles One-way ( 138 Roundtrip )
Many of you not from the area may think this is absurd but this is actually a rather common occurrence .
Since many folks were in the construction industry ( and many simply like trucks ) the F - 150 is a very common auto here in Southern California .
Some bought for necessity and others simply bought because they like the idea of having a truck .
Yet this is another example on how people are learning to separate their wants and needs and that is why the F - Series is no longer the top selling line in the United States .
Now let us run the numbers for how much money is spent on fuel each month :
5 - day miles driven : 690 miles
Weekend driving : 75 miles
Total Monthly miles driven : ( 690 + 75 ) * 4 = 3,060
Current Cost per gallon Riverside County : $ 4.40
Total Fuel Cost per month : ( 3,060 / 14 ) = 218 gallons needed per month
218 * $ 4.4 = $ 961 per month on fuel
Compare this number to one year ago when fuel averaged $ 3.14
218 * $ 3.14 = $ 684 per month one year ago
The cost to commute the same distance went up a stunning 40 percent in one year .
At the same time , many of these folks were tied to the real estate industry so you have a double hit .
First , more money is going out of the budget for fuel while income is quickly decreasing .
This is why it should n’t come as a surprise to you that 15 percent of homes in this area may be bank owned or in some stage of foreclosure :
“ ( LA Times )
From the start — Temecula was incorporated in 1989 — the city was protective of its image .
Residents are prohibited from working on their cars , in most cases , in front of their own houses .
Stores that sell spray paint are required to keep it under lock , though graffiti is almost nonexistent .
Behind City Hall , there is a “ sign jail ” full of political ads and business ads that were yanked because they violated Temecula ’s strict sign rules .
Based largely on that image , the population has nearly doubled again this decade , rising from about 57,000 in 2000 to 101,000 today — 14 new residents a day .
Today , said Rich Johnston , Temecula ’s deputy director of building and safety and code enforcement , as many as 15 % of Temecula ’s 22,500 single - family homes are bank - owned or in some stage of foreclosure . ”
Now you understand why Temecula is down nearly 30 percent on a year over year basis :
Median Price April 2007 : $ 459,000
Median Price April 2008 : $ 329,000
Suddenly a nice new home construction can be seen as an albatross and a Real Home of Genius once you factor the brutal commute .
Let us run a quick expense budget for someone that bought a nice home at the peak for $ 500,000 and is making this commute :
PITI : $ 3,517 ( zero down at 6 percent fixed )
Fuel Cost : $ 961 per month
Auto Insurance : $ 120 per month
Housing upkeep ( pool , landscaping , minor touch ups ) : $ 100 per month
Food : $ 500 per month
Utilities : $ 100 per month
Total : $ 5,298 per month
We ’ll leave this budget at a very basic level .
I ’m sure you can add additional things like cable , cell phones , internet access , and all other items but even at this basic level , we have a budget that consumes $ 63,576 per year .
This budget leaves no room for savings either .
Keep in mind that total auto costs take up 20 percent of the entire budget even though our government BLS friends like it to make up a smaller number .
Also , we are not assuming an auto payment which if you look around , many new cars are simply leased or under a loan which means folks have another monthly drain on their budget .
Now you see why ridiculously long commutes may be a thing of the past .
You can forget about these areas if fuel hits $ 5 or $ 6 per gallon .
California itself is still trying to reconcile high unemployment and these areas are the hardest hit .
It may be time to rethink how city planners organize cities and the cultural obsessions with big cars may be reaching its end .

A couple of weeks ago , John McCain talked about the importance of increasing the size of the U.S. military .
To entice more volunteers , he said , the government should focus on incentives : “ [ O ] ne of the things we ought to do is provide [ the troops with ] significant educational benefits in return for serving . ”
A few days later , McCain announced that he ’ll oppose a bipartisan measure to renew and expand the GI Bill for a new generation of veterans .
Sen. Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) , the leading proponent of the modernized GI Bill , is calling McCain out and creating an interesting battle .
From Annapolis to Vietnam and back to the Pentagon , John McCain and Jim Webb trod the same paths before coming to the Senate .
Iraq divides them today , but there ’s also the new kinship of being anxious fathers watching their sons come and go with Marine units in the war .
So what does it say about Washington that two such men , with so much in common , are locked in an increasingly intense debate over a shared value : education benefits for veterans ? [...]
McCain has all but locked up the Republican presidential nomination and is preparing for a fall campaign in which his support of the Iraq war is sure to be a major issue .
Yet the former Navy pilot and Vietnam POW makes himself a target by refusing to endorse Webb ’s new GI education bill and instead signing on to a Republican alternative that focuses more on career soldiers than on the great majority who leave after their first four years .
McCain concedes he has n’t tended to his day job in a while , but said his Senate office staff told him that Webb “ has not been eager to negotiate . ”
“ He ’s so full of it , ” Webb said in response .
“ I have personally talked to John three times .
I made a personal call to [ McCain aide ] Mark Salter months ago asking that they look at this . ”
For Webb , this seems to have far less to do with campaign politics , and far more to do with a deep desire to get a bill through the chamber : “ I do n’t want this to become a political issue .
I want to get a bill done . ”
For the troops ' sake , it'd be great if McCain agreed .

While Sharepod was one of the first and best to make this happen , it 's no secret that during the last couple years Sharepod updates slowed down and have n't kept pace with some of the changes being made by Apple to iOS devices and iTunes , but now that 's all going to change .
On March 20 , 2013 , Sharepod was acquired by Macroplant , the creators of iExplorer and the leaders in software development of iOS transfer apps .
The entire Macroplant development team is committed to improving and maintaining Sharepod and has released the all new Sharepod 4 for Mac and Windows .
Erik B’s First Day : 8:30 AM . The Olive Garden .
By the Roller Coas …
Erik Bjorlund had a fairly unusual first day on the job at Orthogonal .
Unusual for him , and for us as well .
A good day , but definitely unusu …
Fox 's E.D. Hill , noting Michelle and Barack Obama 's much - buzzed - about fist pound , describes it as , among other things , " a terrorist fist jab . "
And " some interesting body communication . "
Yeah , I 'm not sure OBL and the evil - doers are pounding it out in the caves .
There is a bit of a generational disconnect here — and one that is fairly amusing — but how did Hill get to " terrorist fist jab " ?
Have people not watched any sporting event in , say , the last five years and seen athletes of all backgrounds pounding fists ?
One can only imagine the connotation should Obama deliver a mysterious " body communication " that was known in the ' 80s as the " high - five . "

Emerging Applications of P2P Technologies
Why peer - to - peer is efficient
When a user wishes to download a file from a website , the submit a HTTP GET request .
This request for the file uses a single TCP socket , and communicates with a single server which transfers the entire file .
By contrast , a P2P protocol creates TCP connections with multiple hosts and makes many small data requests to each .
The P2P client then combines the chunks to recreate the file .
A single file host will usually have limited upload capacity , but connecting to many servers simultaneously allows for higher file transfers , and disperses the costs associated with data transfers amongst many peers .
Moreover , a client mid-way through downloading the file also acts as a server , hosting the bits to others which they have already downloaded .
These differences from traditional HTTP GET requests allow for lower costs and higher redundancy since many people are sharing the files .
Fault Tolerance
The Internet evolved from the Arpanet , which , by design , was created to link the valuable computer assets possesed by various DARPA research sites by creating a physically decentralized computer network .
By following the Internet 's historical design , peer - to - peer technologies can be utilized for fault tolerant decentralized logical networks .
These logical networks can and could support any type of data , such as Internet DNS information , scientific information , or large distributed and redundant information databases .
The internationally , and potentially universally , distributed nature of these peer - to - peer logical networks can enable critical data to survive natural and human disasters .
Peer - to - peer networks represent a valuable technological tool for the preservation of human knowledge .
BitTorrent
BitTorrent is one of the most popular peer - to - peer file sharing protocols used on the Internet and it accounts for a significant amount of traffic on the Internet .
Implementations of BitTorrent
Film
Video
Many so - called “ new media ” content publishers on the Internet have chosen BitTorrent as their distribution mechanism to save costs :
On the Revision3 Internet Television Network users can view16 different shows straight from the website .
But to offload some of their bandwidth costs , Revision3 has set up their own BitTorrent tracker , and viewers can subscribe to a show 's RSS feed and automatically download new shows via BitTorrent .
Music & Audio
Television
The CBC offered an episode of its television show Canada 's Next Great Prime Minister via BitTorrent .
The torrent file was hosted on Mininova.org , one of the largest BitTorrent portals in the world .
The full - resolution version has been downloaded over 10,000 times , and over 4,700 users have downloaded a smaller file tailored for portable video players .
Computer Applications
Application & Desktop Deployment
DistriBrute
DistriBrute is the world ’s first peer - to - peer ( P2P ) desktop deployment product especially developed for business use .
Using the P2P protocol , DistriBrute maximizes the speed of the network and eliminates the need and expense of decentralized distribution servers .
Using DistriBrute it is possible to simultaneously migrate thousands of desktops to a new OS and quickly install new applications and drivers .
DistriBrute can do the entire job in less than an hour !
DistriBrute provides a secure centralized , efficient , very scalable deployment environment .
The benefits using P2P for desktop maintenance are enormous .
DistriBrute is developed by 4M88 .
File Sharing
Tribler
Tribler , developed at the Delft University of Technology and the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam , is an open source social interactive Peer - to - Peer client with integrated search engine , video and audio player .
Private File Sharing
Pando
Pando is a personal P2P program , much like BitTorrent but geared toward those looking for a simple and secure means of file transfer .
Users may email , IM , or post to their website a . pando file .
When the intended recipient downloads the . pando file , the Pando software contacts an secure Pando server ( much like the “ tracker ” in the BitTorrent system ) and allows the sender to initiate a direct P2P transfer to the recipient .
Peercasting
Like broadcasting , peercasting is a method of streaming content to consumers .
But it differs from traditional broadcasting because the consumers of peercasted content are simultaneously broadcasters .
Freecast
Freecast is a peer - to - peer streaming audio broadcasting program .
Typically , residential Internet connections have a much lower upload capacity than download capacity .
Thus , it was impossible in the past for residential users to broadcast personal audio streams ( such as talk - radio , or music ) to more than one user at a time .
Freecast relies on P2P to allow these users to stream their broadcast to a much , much larger audience .
The software 's collaborative approach to sharing the bandwidth requirements of streaming audio provides a way for " small organizations to diffuse over Internet radio broadcasting , musical events , etc. without a financial and technical dependency with a web host .
Content Distribution
Babelgum
Babelgum is similar to Joost , but uses a proprietary P2P protocol with an encrypted data stream to prevent piracy .
This free service only airs professionally produced content but will cater to independent producers .
Babelgum will offer Independents compensation for uploading their content , and promise a world - wide audience with a safe and efficient content delivery scheme .
Like Joost , Babelgum is supported by advertising .
Blinkx BBTV
Blinkx BBTV fuses TV and other video from the web using “ hybrid peer - to - peer streaming [ which ] enables [ content providers ] to disperse the burden of content delivery through the blinkx network and peer - to - peer distribution ” .
As the content gains in popularity , the audience base becomes large enough to sustain the bandwidth requests on its own , thereby reducing overall distribution costs of penny - pinching content owners .
BBC iPlayer
Last December BBC launched a content distribution service through their website , a P2P client , and cable television .
The iPlayer download service relies on peer - to - peer technology designed by Kontiki which allows the distribution of massive video files to be enjoyed without significant delays .
Users can download and keep content for up to seven days , and have access to an electronic program guide to schedule automatic downloads .
Statistics from April 2008 show that an average of 1.4 million people per week used the iPlayer , making 21 million requests for program downloads .
Sky Anytime and 4 oD both offer a similar video - on - demand service using the same Kontiki peer - to - peer technology .
GridNetworks
GridNetworks aims to combine the traditional notion of content delivery networks ( CDNs ) , like Akami , with P2P technology .
Grid is openly courting cable networks to use its content delivery infrastructure , and embed their proprietary P2P protocol into “ network devices , set - top boxes and even consumer devices . ”
The company says this “ GridCasting managed Interent television service ” can be offered at a fraction of the cost of traditional content delivery networks , and will allow higher quality video ( HD ) to be enjoyed by consumers .
Jaman
Jamen distributes international independent movies .
Using its Jaman Player , the user downloads the movies through their " Jaman Cascade Network " .
The " Jaman Cascade Network " provides pieces of the movie via their server and via P2P .
Some films are free , some are available for a small cost .
By utilizing P2P technology , Jayman claims this is how they can provide some of the content for free or low cost .
Joost
Joost distributes TV and other video shows for free over the web using P2P and has major contracts with Viacom ( which includes MTV , BET , and Paramount Pictures ) , Fox , Warner Music , Indiapolis Speedway Productions , Ministry of Sound TV , Aardman Animation , Warner Music , CBS , CNN , Sony Pictures , and even has signed a deal to redistribute NHL content such as the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals .
Joost is an advertising supported business .
LiveStation
LiveStation runs on peer - to - peer software originally created by Microsoft in its Cabridge , UK location .
The free service delivers live TV and radio news as it happens from reputable world - wide sources .
It works by splitting a video stream into many parts which are distribtued amongst the peer cloud .
Similar to other P2P content delivery services , the Livestation Player reduces the need for a central server and slashes operating costs .
Mashboxx
While currently unreleased , Mashboxx promises to be the first peer - to - peer software authorized by major record labels , Sony BMG Music , and EMI Music .
The Masboxx software is a P2P client which allows users to search existing P2P networks for audio tracks .
To appease the record labels , the results are filtered through a digital catalogue fingerprinted by SNOCAP .
Users then have the ability to download and play a full - length song up to five times , or purchase it .
Chairman and CEO of EMI Music North America and Vice Chairman of EMI Music world wide had this to say about P2P technology : " Legal peer - to - peer services which offer consumers a great user experience and which compensate creators appropriately are good for music fans , good for artists , and good for the digital music market as a whole , " said David Munns , Chairman and CEO of EMI Music North America and Vice Chairman of EMI Music worldwide ”
Open Media Network
Open Media Network hosts content from educational , community , and non-profit organization .
The software aims to offer socially - conscious programming through an easy TV Guide experience .
They specialize in content which is not well distributed by traditional media outlets , for example , audio and video from non-profit organizations .
The software , OMN's Secure Grid Network ( P2P ) uses the popular Kontiki delivery system as used by BBC's iPlayer .
Pando Networks
In addition to Pando 's personal P2P software , Pando Networks offers Pando Publisher for companies who wish to stream full - screen HD content , accelerate downloadable media , or reduce bandwidth bills “ by up to 90 % ” .
Their “ Pando Content Delivery Suite ” offers companies all they need to publish , distribute , track , and monetize their content .
Similar to GridCasting , Pando's Media Booster is a client installed on user 's computers which runs in the background and leverages the user 's bandwidth .
“ The more viewers a video has , the faster and more cost effectively it can be delivered ” .
NBC is currently working with Pando Networks in a beta project on a platform to deliver its “ true ” 720 HD video downloads to customers .
RedSwoosh
Red Swoosh is a networking client owned by the popular Content Delivery Network , Akami Technologies .
Red Swoosh is a peercasting tool that is offered as a browser plugin .
The software relies on a proprietary peer - to - peer protocol which allows servers to offload their bandwidth demands to the consumers of their content .
Reeltime Rentals
ReelTime Rentals is a low cost TV and movie content distribution company providing the most efficient , secure and economic delivery of high bit-rate content , P2P powered by GridNetworks .
Tribler Video Streaming
This software uses Peer - 2 - Peer technology for streaming live video feeds across the Internet to millions of users .
The University developers are currently involved in the European Union 's 19 M € R&D project into P2P - Next .
Privacy Protection
Tor
Tor is an application that shields its user 's identities by sending their traffic through a network of relays set up by volunteers around the world .
In other words “ it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit , and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location . ”
Tor is used by everyday ordinary Internet users who wish to avoid advertiser 's behavioural targeting , citizen journalists in countries without safe access to media , law enforcement setting up anonymous tip lines , activists , and whistleblowers .
To accomplish this , the Tor network relies on people to volunteer their Internet connection as a “ relay ” .
These relays send user 's content privately to other volunteer relays with the aim of obfuscating the user 's location or identity .
Those who volunteer their Internet connection as a relay are committing to allowing a certain level of bandwidth usage flow through their pipe ( 20 KB /sec minimum ) .
Real - time communication
Skype
Skype , the popular VoIP application does not run the traditional client - server model .
Rather , Skype is entirely decentralized and distributed to each Skype user 's connection .
This has allowed Skype to start up business without investing in complex and costly infrastructure to support their over 240 million users .
Adobe Flash Player
The next version of Flash Player ( version 10 ) will include the Real Time Media Flow Protocol ( RTMFP ) which enables peer - to - peer communication .
This implementation relies on an Adobe server which maintains a list of peers , much like a BitTorrent tracker .
The technology will allow end users to stream microphone or webcam media to other Flash Player clients when connected as peers .
Web Search Engines
YaCy
YaCy is a peer - to - peer search engine and web crawler .
Users install the software and become a “ YaCy - peer ” , volunteering their computer to independently crawl through the web , analyzing and indexing websites into a database shared by all Yacy peers .
More than 400 million websites have been indexed by YaCy .
There is no central server ; the database is shared and upheld by the YaCy peers .
There are a few distinct advantages of a decentralized peer - to - peer search engine : since there is no central server or company who owns the service , the search results cannot be censored , and no incentives to prioritize results based on prospective contracts or advertising dollars .
FAROO
FAROO offers a similar P2P search product to YaCy , but also has “ distributed ranking ” which lists the websites according to anonymized usage statistics of the websites visited by users of FAROO .
This democratic method of ranking avoids so - called “ search engine optimization ” techniques that firms use to game popular search engines like Google in hopes of moving their site higher up on the list of search results .
FAROO states that “ [t ] he searcher becomes a part of FAROO .
All users connect their computers to a huge collective search engine .
Whose architecture is decentralized like the Internet itself . ” FAROO was one of the 2007 TechCrunch40 : “ Forty of the hottest new startups from around the world will announce and demo their products over a two day period at TechCrunch40 .
And they do n't pay a cent to do this .
They will be selected to participate based on merit alone ” .
TechCrunch40 was set up to help start - ups find funding to launch their product .
Government
European Union offers 14 M € grant for 14 P2P research
The European Union will pay 14 M € to P2P - Next , which is a 4 - year technical trial of a content delivery platform for new media which would run on a wide range of consumer devices .
Their mandate is to develop an “ open source , efficient , trusted , personalized , user - centric , and participatory television plus media delivery mechanism with social and collaborative connotation using the emerging Peer - to - Peer ( P2P ) paradigm , which takes into account the existing EU legal framework . ”
P2P - Next is gathering of industrial partners , media content providers , and universities , which include the BBC , Delft University of Technology , the European Broadcasting Union , Lancaster University , Markenfilm , Pioneer and the VTT technical Research Centre of Finland .
The conglomerate aims , inter alia , to help P2P shed it 's dubious reputation as an illegal file sharing mechanism , claiming that “ today [ P2P ] is considered by many as an efficient , reliable , and low cost mechanism for distributing any media file or live stream ...[ b] roadcasters and content providers consider P2P as a future - proof , universal , and ubiquitous two - way ( interactive ) distribution mechanism . ”
Business
Collanos Workplace
Colonos Workplace is a cross-platform P2P system for collaborative teams to work on projects and transmit their work amongst their work group .
This P2P based product fills the gap for small and medium size businesses who do n't have the IT budget for the elaborate collaborative software found in larger businesses .
Currently out in Beta phase , is its open source integrated VOIP technology , so team members can talk in real time , conduct conference calls and to communicate through its integrated multiplatform , multiprotocol instant messaging features while collaborating on work projects .
WithGTA IVdue out on April 29a fewof our esteemed magazine friends in the Games Radar network have been granted access to review the game already .
That 's right - one of the perks of being permanently slagged off on forums and two - bit blogs is that games writers get the opportunity to play games before they 're in the shops .
The first of our colleagues to actually finish the game is Rob Taylor , deputy editor of Xbox World 360 magazine , and below he tells us ( as best he can ) what it feels like to be the first person to finish GTA in the world .
Lucky bastard .
You 're the first games writer to have finished GTA IV , how does that feel ?
Pretty darn sweet to be honest , I allowed myself a quick smug grin when the Rockstar guys told me !
It 's funny ; I did n't actually really get to play as much as – say – the Benelux journos we met while up in Chelsea ( we were based in Rockstar 's actual offices and I think I racked up 25 hours at the final count , while they were ensconced in their hotel rooms playing up to 11 hours a day ! ) and I also had to write down some fairly comprehensive tips for the first batch of missions so actually I got off to a slow start .
On day two though , I flew through a major batch of the story missions without messing up once and then on the final day a Rockstar PR sidled up to me pretty late on while I was swearing my head off at getting stuck during a mission called ' A D*** B*** S**** C***' ( edited to avoid spoiler ) and said " Keep pushing on , you 're actually nearly there .
The missions are meant to be tough near the end ! " .
It 's true ; the final couple of missions are rock , but after a couple of retries I finally made the breakthrough .
And boy did I feel relieved ; to have missed out that late on after all that , ahem ... ' hard work ' would have been hard to take .
How hard has it been to keep it all a secret ?
Well , I 've been threatened with physical violence more than a few times by mag colleagues after my constant stream of GTA enthusiasm threatened to get a bit too spoiler - intensive !
Generally though , it'd be a shame to ruin the surprises for anyone else ; GTA IV single player simply has to be played on your lonesome to be fully appreciate it for what it is : a true milestone in videogames .
Likewise , my review inXbox World 360 ( out Wednesday 23rd April ) talks more in general terms rather than getting into specifics ...
I can tell people why they have to buy this game , but I 'd rather not tell them everything that transpires while doing so .
How did it all pan out then ?
Where did you play it ?
So we got the call from Rockstar to come up on the March 26 and play for three straight days in a row – including a Saturday !
We 'd usually kick off at 9 or 10ish in the moring , play until 8 or 9 at night , then go eat , then crash before getting up the next morning and do it all over again .
Sat in front of a 60 " LCD screen in a dark room for nigh on 30 hours – now that 's hardcore !
Every GTA fan 's dream though , huh ?
How hard did you find it , playing it under so much pressure ?
Did you die a lot ?
Definitely .
It 's funny , I actually had another colleague in the room with me , who also got real close to finishing .
We were always comparing stats though , and I think I 'd died 40 - odd more times than he had by the end of the game .
And failed , like , 50 missions !
So I think in my rush to get through the game my skills let me down once or twice ( !)
The pressure to plough through as much as humanly possible did get irritating at times – especially when you get stuck on a certain mission – but you want to soak in as much atmosphere for your readers , cover as much ground as possible ... all while taking over 4000 words worth of notes on a nearby laptop !
It was the ultimate mix of fun and high pressure .
Description
" In 2008 , the largest particle accelerator ever created , the LHC at CERN 's particle physics lab in Switzerland , was activated for the first time .
The research obtained from this experiment has revolutionized the way we think about science .
Un- answered questions that have puzzled man since the dawn of humanity are finally being answered .
Are there extra dimensions ?
What is dark matter ?
Is time travel possible ?
Epsilon Experimental Sciences Research Facility aims to discover the potential of this whole new world of science , and you have been appointed as the primary test participant . "
Going with what seems to be the current trend , I 've made my version of a portal game .
The challenges are based around solving tasks using various fictional technologies discovered as a result of the LHC experiment , primarily wormhole manipulation .
Other methods include gravity shift , time reversal , and general cognitive dexterity .
I started this a while back and planned on coinciding it with the release of Valve 's Portal , which coincidentally was around the same time CERN was planning to activate the particle accelerator .
Unfortunately Epsilon still was n't ready by the time Portal came out and the LHC still has n't been switched on , so I decided to leave it until now .
Thanks to Geier Arnold for the original soundtrack , and for tirelessly helping out in the beta testing process .
The state Legislature is looking to hire a few good polar bear scientists .
The conclusions have already been agreed upon -- researchers just have to fill in the science part .
A $ 2 million program funded with little debate by the Legislature last month calls for using state money to fund an " academic based " conference that highlights contrarian scientific research on global warming .
Legislators hope to undermine the public perception of a widespread consensus among polar bear researchers that warming global temperatures and melting Arctic ice threaten the polar bears ' survival .
Republican legislative leaders say a federal decision to declare the polar bears " threatened " by climate change would have troubling effects on Arctic oil development and the state 's economic future .
Last week a federal judge ordered the Bush administration to release its already - tardy decision under the Endangered Species Act by May 15 .
By law , such a decision must be based strictly on science , not on possible economic consequences .
Legislative leaders said they are frustrated that researchers skeptical of the doomsday scenario get marginalized as crackpots or industry shills by the media and scientific agencies .
" We want to have the money to hire scientists to answer the Interior ( Department ) scientists , " House Speaker John Harris , R - Valdez , said last week .
The $ 2 million is also to be used for a national public relations campaign to promote the findings of the conference .
Critics say it 's a waste of state money because all the hard scientific research points in the other direction .
" This truly is the conference to nowhere , " said University of Alaska researcher Rick Steiner , who has pressed the Palin administration unsuccessfully for five months to release any scientific backup for its position opposing the federal polar bear listing .
The time for debate is over , especially when the opposition is using " junk science , " said Melanie Duchin with Greenpeace in Alaska .
" This is clearly the same sort of ' question , deny and delay ' tactic used by Exxon Mobil and the Bush administration to confuse the public over the severity of global warming and stall any meaningful action to deal with the problem . "
POLAR BEAR QUESTION 'TRICKY '
Nothing is scheduled yet .
The $ 2 million expenditure must still get past the veto pen of Gov. Sarah Palin , who has until May 26 to approve items in the capital budget .
Such a conference would seem to be in line with the state 's official comments , which argued that government scientists went too far using climate models to predict the polar bears ' demise .
But Harris and others say they are not confident Palin will go along with their plan .
Palin 's office had no comment last week , saying review of the budget is continuing .
The $ 2 million was sought jointly by Harris and Senate President Lyda Green , R - Wasilla .
It would go to the Legislative Council , a panel of elected leaders who can administer programs between legislative sessions .
The federal government has been considering the evidence for listing the polar bear for several years , initiating a formal proceeding in December 2006 .
Studies generated by the federal government concluded the summer sea ice is disappearing and predicted polar bears in Alaska could be gone by 2050 .
Even if an endangered - species decision is made in the coming weeks , such a conference will be useful because the issue is n't going away , Harris said .
The polar bear question is a tricky one for the state .
Both the Palin administration and the Legislature have made efforts lately to show they take climate change seriously .
They are putting money into protecting threatened coastal villages and have issued reports outlining other threats to the state 's infrastructure .
Studies are being made of Alaska 's energy consumption and carbon " footprint . "

But when it comes to polar bears , skepticism about warming trends is the order of the day .
A " threatened " listing could have real consequences for Alaska , depending on the management plan drawn up to protect the bears .
Foremost on legislators ' minds was the potential for new obstacles to oil development .
Opponents of the listing say it could also affect gas - emitting developments around the country , since those emissions are credited with heating the atmosphere .
The Bush administration recently referred to such a use of the Endangered Species Act as a " regulatory train wreck . "
FLAT EARTH SOCIETY ?
Environmental groups say they do indeed hope to use the law as a greenhouse - gas tool , especially given the lack of effort from the Bush administration to support new emission - control efforts .
The state - funded conference will focus on science , according to a budget justification introduced with the original request .
" Research shall be non-biased to specific groups ' opinion and shall present scientifically fact based outcomes , " the statement said .
But the point is not to seek some non-biased measure of scientific truth .
The point , said Harris , is to provide a forum for scientists whose views back Alaska 's interests .
" You know as well as I do that scientists are like lawyers , " Harris said .
Such a conference and public relations effort would push the state deeper into a national debate over the science of global warming -- one in which most scientific opinion is on the other side .
Indeed , many climate scientists contend there is no longer serious disagreement on the main points .
Environmentalists accuse opponents of trying to create the illusion of a debate to slow new regulatory action .
Alaska officials may feel boosted , however , by the decision last week of a Canadian scientific panel to recommend the polar bear remain a " special concern species " -- rather than elevate it to the more drastic designations of threatened or endangered .
The committee chose not to consider climate change effects in its population projections , though it expressed " considerable concern " about the bears ' future .
U.S. law does not provide for the lesser " special concern " option .
Even so , a high - profile conference of climate skeptics held recently in New York by a privately funded free - market group called the Heartland Institute demonstrated the difficult task in front of the state .
The March conference received little press coverage .
Outside of ideologically conservative news outlets , the scant coverage was also fairly acid , noting the small number of real scientists and their paid positions with industry - funded groups .
Stories prominently quoted critics who likened participants to the Flat Earth Society .
' STUNNINGLY HYPOCRITICAL '
The state 's own polar bear science is already being assailed .
Steiner , the University of Alaska professor , has been trying since December to find out if the state 's own marine mammal experts supported the state 's endangered - species stance , which Palin said publicly was based on sound science .
On Friday , Steiner released a long chain of e-mail correspondence , saying the state first promised to send internal documents and then refused .
The state Department of Law is now reviewing the internal memos from scientists to see if they can be released under the state 's open records laws .
" It is stunningly hypocritical that the state will spend $ 2 million to convene a scientific conference on this issue , but they will not release their own scientific analysis , " Steiner said .
Deputy Fish and Game Commissioner Ken Taylor said Friday he erred when he first promised the documents to Steiner , not realizing they were subject to legal review .
One legislator who opposed the polar bear appropriation dismissed it as a " $ 2 million sound bite " ginned up by legislators for the campaign year .
Rep. Les Gara , D - Anchorage , predicted the money would have no impact on the larger polar bear policy debate .
Gara raised the issue nevertheless on the House floor in April , saying it was ironic that the state would resist polar bear protections to hasten offshore oil leasing in federal waters of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas .
He said the state does not currently share in federal offshore - oil revenues like other coastal states , and said it made more sense to slow down the process until Congress can assure a royalty share for the state .

The absolute queen of teasing – Dita von Teese !
Why tease ?
well , because she almost never shows her vagina spread open but prefers it in a pin-up way .
And she is really great , Dita has a body of a goddess , and the look of both innocent school girl and a vixen in her eyes .
We cant even imagine why on earth Marilyn Manson divorced her .
Maybe she fucked him to death ?
Anyhow , please meet this special tribute for the queen of pin-up , and dont forget that Andrew Blake has recently launched a new fetish movie starring Dita .
deficiency
Buried in this month 's issue of the journal Diabetes is a study that , properly understood , suggests that most of what doctors " know " about Type 2 diabetes is wrong .
The study is titled β- Cell Dysfunction in Subjects With Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Early Type 2 Diabetes : Comparison of Surrogate Markers With First - Phase Insulin Secretion From an Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test .
To understand why this study is important , you have to know that for decades scientists have evaluated insulin resistance using something called HOMA or homeostasis model assessment .
HOMA is nothing more than a formula that computes insulin resistance from fasting C - peptide , fasting insulin and blood sugar .
If you have had a fasting insulin or C - peptide test , you can compute your own HOMA using the Oxford University HOMA calculator
What the scientists did in this latest study was something blindingly simple .
They hooked up people who had been recently diagnosed with pre-diabetes or diabetes to an intravenous glucose tolerance test and measured their insulin and preinsulin levels .
Then then compared what they found with the HOMA calculations .
What they found was " HOMA - B markedly underestimated the magnitude of the β - cell defect across declining glucose tolerance . "
They went on to conclude , " Subjects with IGT and early - stage , asymptomatic type 2 diabetic patients have more pronounced β- cell defects than previously estimated from epidemiological studies using homeostasis model assessment .
" What this means in plain English is that contrary to what you have been reading for decades , prediabetes and early Type 2 diabetes are NOT primarily caused by insulin resistance .
Instead , this study found these people had an unexpectedly high deree of insulinwhich was NOT apparent when they calculated HOMA using the cheap fasting tests .
This should be a shocker , but like most of the truly important research about Type 2 diabetes it probably wo n't even get noticed because no drug company is going to talk it up at the big ADA dog and pony show this week .
Instead the medical news will be full of reports of how wonderful Drug A is and how all people with Type 2 should be taking Drug B--even if Drug B only lowers A1 c from 7.5 % to 7.0 % and costs $ 200 a month .
The finding that people with pre-diabetes already show insulin secretion defects points to several things .
1 .
It emphasizes that there are genetic defects involved in blood sugar deterioration that have nothing to do with overeating or obesity .
No one has ever found anything that connected overeating with the failure of beta cells to secrete properly .
2 .
It calls into question huge amounts of diabetes research done over the past decades because the HOMA formula has been used almost universally to determine if people had IR or beta cell deficiency .
This study suggests that the HOMA result is wrong and so any research about insulin resistance based on HOMA is wrong .
That 's almost ALL large group research .
3 .
It makes it all the more clear why people with early diabetes diagnoses should consider a trial of insulin when lowering insulin resistance with diet or drugs like metformin does not give normal blood sugars .
If your beta cells can't produce insulin , you need insulin .
End of story .
4 . It makes me wonder how much of the IR that doctors believe to be the sole cause of Type 2 diabetes is actually being caused by abnormally high blood sugars .
it is possible that IR increases dramatically when blood sugars go over a much lower threshold than previously believed .
Possibly as low as 130 mg / dl .
If so , much of the IR found in Type 2 diabetes may be caused by high blood sugars caused by insulin deficiency .
If that is n't a mind blower , what is ?
Now mind you many people with Type 2 diabetes do have insulin resistance that is independent of their blood sugars .
But they also may have decades of functioning with higher than normal blood sugars due to insulin deficiency .
What the impact of that on their metabolisms may have been is unknown .
But one thing is for sure , this is a major blow to the idea that type 2 is caused by insulin resistance caused by obesity and that people with Type 2 secrete higher than normal levels of insulin which their body can't use .
That belief came from studies based on HOMA calculations , but this study that measured the actual insulin secreted found that simply was n't true .
P.S. My own HOMA calculation showed that I was twice as insulin resistant as normal .
However , when I started to inject insulin I learned that I have normal insulin sensitivity in that one unit of insulin lowers my blood sugar the same amount that it would for a normal person .
I use about 1/10 the total daily dose of insulin that an insulin resistant person my size would use .
I thought that this discrepancy was because I have an oddball form of diabetes .
But it is more likely that it is an example of just how badly this HOMA formula works for people whose fasting blood sugar has not yet reached the 200 mg / dl level which was typical of the population in which the formula was first computed .
What the FISA Debate is Not About

彼は老害の恐ろしさを知らない。老害とはもっとアンヴィヴァレントなもので、若い者には負けてたまるかという自尊心、世の中って表面的には日進月歩だけど本質は変わらないだろという思い込み、経験に裏打ちされた様々な思考回路の短絡、そして上下関係でフィルタリングされてしまう情報、そういった諸々が絡み合って形成される。雑誌やネットで情報を読み漁ればキャッチアップできる訳じゃない。
だからわれわれは老害と呼ばれる存在にならないようにしないといけない。どうやって？自分の中の情報の鮮度を新鮮に保つことで。じゃぁどうやって鮮度を保つのか。インターネットや雑誌には新鮮極まりない情報がぴちぴちしてます。そこから情報を得ればいいんじゃない？その時間をどうやって割く？意外と難しい気がする。
実は若いうちから人間には認知の歪みってのがある訳だが、若いうちは現実に適応した結果としての歪みだから環境を変えない限りは顕在化しないことが多い。老害の多くは文脈を間違えた短絡とか、権力につきものな組織による情報の取捨選択とか、不安を押し隠す自尊心に起因する頑固さとかが絡むので、拗らせると勉強しても直らないんだよね。分からないより、分かったふりされた方が性質悪い。
ところで、老害って勝ち組なんだぜ。若いのから頼られて憎まれっ子として世にはばからなきゃ老害でさえいられないんだから。で、勝ち上がっていこう、居座り続けようという気概や執念も、彼の社会的地位を老害たらしめるほど押し上げ、そして老害を老害たらしめる。
だから老害と呼ばれる存在になる心配はあまりしないでいい。老害と呼ばれるところまでくれば、立派な成功者なのだから。その手前で悩むべきことが山ほどある。けれどもすごく禁欲的に、もし老害といわれるほど成功したとき、若い連中を萎縮させないようにするには、どうすればいいんだろうね。
周りの功成し名を遂げた割に老害っぽくないおじいさま方をみていると、まず基礎がしっかりしている。つまり老害の多くが若いうちに獲得した認知の歪みを異なる文脈に当てはめて生じているのだから、若い時期に裾野が広く深めの世界観を持っているほど、年を食ってからも間違いがない。次に人を見る目があって気負いがない。優秀な若い人を可愛がり、若者の前で知ったかぶりはせず、彼らから積極的に最新の知識を吸い上げる。そしてメタファーを用いた対話を通じて、自分の世界観のずれを頻繁に補正して、深い洞察を行う。もちろん本は山ほど読むが、流行りものの雑誌解説記事は程々に、論文とか記事といった一次情報に接し、実物をみたり関係者と話して実感を得ることを怠らない。そして目は子どものように輝き、いつまでも知的好奇心に満ちている。
そういう訳で、まず老害と呼ばれるくらい成功し続けるだけで大変だし、それだけの成功を遂げてなお、虚心坦懐に知的好奇心を保ち続け、優秀な若者を見極めて育て周囲から慕われ続けるのは、そうそう簡単にできるものじゃない。インターネットや雑誌で聞きかじった知識で知ったかぶりしているようじゃ、恐らく老害にさえなれないんじゃないだろうか。
The Moon , Earth 's Nearest Neighbor
Greg Diesel Walck
The moon is Earth 's nearest cosmic neighbor , but it is more than just a big pretty light in the sky .
Here are 10 cool , and sometimes surprising , facts about Earth 's nearest neighbor : the moon .
FIRST STOP : How the Moon was Made
Making of the Moon
NASA / JPL - Caltech
The moon was created when a rock the size of Mars slammed into Earth , shortly after the solar system began forming about 4.5 billion years ago , according to the leading theory .
NEXT : Locked in Orbit
Locked in Orbit
Japan 's National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology .
Perhaps the coolest thing about the moon is that it always shows us the same face .
Since both the Earth and moon are rotating and orbiting , how can this be ?
Long ago , the Earth 's gravitational effects slowed the moon 's rotation about its axis .
Once the moon 's rotation slowed enough to match its orbital period ( the time it takes the moon to go around Earth ) the effect stabilized .
Many of the moons around other planets behave similarly .
What about phases ?
Here 's how they work :
As the moon orbits Earth , it spends part of its time between us and the Sun , and the lighted half faces away from us .
This is called a new moon .
( So there 's no such thing as a " dark side of the moon , " just a side that we never see . )
As the moon swings around on its orbit , a thin sliver of reflected sunlight is seen on Earth as a crescent moon .
Once the Moon is opposite the Sun , it becomes fully lit from our view — a full moon .
NEXT : Moon ... trees ?
Apollo Moon Trees
NASA
More than 400 trees on Earth came from the moon .
Well , okay :
They came from lunar orbit .
Okay , the truth :
In 1971 , Apollo 14 astronaut Stuart Roosa took a bunch of seeds with him and , while Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell were busy sauntering around on the surface , Roosa guarded his seeds .
Later , the seeds were germinated on Earth , planted at various sites around the country , and came to be called the moon trees .
Most of them are doing just fine .
NEXT : More Than One Moon ?
Earth 's Sister Moons
Tim McCord
The moon is Earth 's only natural satellite .
Right ?
Maybe not .
In 1999 , scientists found that a 3 - mile - ( 5 - kilometer - ) wide asteroid may be caught in Earth 's gravitational grip , thereby becoming a satellite of our planet .
Cruithne , as it is called , takes 770 years to complete a horseshoe - shaped orbit around Earth , the scientists say , and it will remain in a suspended state around Earth for at least 5,000 years .
NEXT : A Cosmic Punching Bag
Space Rock Punching Bag
NASA / GFSC / ASU
The moon 's heavily cratered surface is the result of intense pummeling by space rocks between 4.1 billion and 3.8 billion years ago .
The scars of this war , seen as craters , have not eroded much for two main reasons :
The moon is not geologically very active , so earthquakes , volcanoes and mountain - building do n't destroy the landscape as they do on Earth ; and with virtually no atmosphere there is no wind or rain , so very little surface erosion occurs .
NEXT : The Moon is an Egghead
A Lunar Egghead

The moon is not round ( or spherical ) .
Instead , it 's shaped like an egg .
If you go outside and look up , one of the small ends is pointing right at you .
And the moon 's center of mass is not at the geometric center of the satellite ; it 's about 1.2 miles ( 2 kilometers ) off - center .
NEXT : The Moon Shakes
Moonquakes
NASA
Apollo astronauts used seismometers during their visits to the moon and discovered that the gray orb is n't a totally dead place , geologically speaking .
Small moonquakes , originating several miles ( kilometers ) below the surface , are thought to be caused by the gravitational pull of Earth .
Sometimes tiny fractures appear at the surface , and gas escapes .
Scientists say they think the moon probably has a core that is hot and perhaps partially molten , as is Earth 's core .
But data from NASA 's Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed in 1999 that the moon 's core is small — probably between 2 percent and 4 percent of its mass .
This is tiny compared with Earth , in which the iron core makes up about 30 percent of the planet 's mass .
NEXT : Is the Moon a Planet ?
The Moon Is a Planet ?
Gemini Observatory / NSF / NASA / AURA
Our moon is bigger than Pluto .
And at roughly one - fourth the diameter of Earth , some scientists think the moon is more like a planet .
They refer to the Earth - moon system as a " double planet . "
Pluto and its moon Charon are also called a double - planet system by some .
NEXT : Origin of Earth's Tides
Moon 's Ocean Tug
Tides on Earth are caused mostly by the moon ( the Sun has a smaller effect ) .
Here 's how it works :
The moon 's gravity pulls on Earth 's oceans .
High tide aligns with the Moon as Earth spins underneath .
Another high tide occurs on the opposite side of the planet because gravity pulls Earth toward the moon more than it pulls the water .
At full moon and new moon , the Sun , Earth and moon are lined up , producing the higher than normal tides ( called spring tides , for the way they spring up ) .
When the moon is at first or last quarter , smallerneap tides form .
The Moon 's 29.5 - day orbit around Earth is not quite circular .
When the moon is closest to Earth ( called its perigee ) , spring tides are even higher , and they 're called perigean spring tides .
All this tugging has another interesting effect : Some of Earth 's rotational energy is stolen by the moon , causing our planet to slow down by about 1.5 milliseconds every century .
NEXT : One Day , the Moon Will Leave
Bye - Bye , Moon
Scott Tully
As you read this , the moon is moving away from us .
Each year , the moon steals some of Earth 's rotational energy , and uses it to propel itself about 3.8 centimeters higher in its orbit .
Researchers say that when it formed , the moon was about 14,000 miles ( 22,530 kilometers ) from Earth .
It 's now an average of 239,000 miles , or 385,000 kilometers away .

Crossing the platform divide
Trolltech has announced the official release of Qt 4.4 , a much - anticipated update to their popular , cross- platform software development framework .
Qt is distributed under a dual - licensing model that enables open - source as well as proprietary commercial development , and it is widely used on the Linux platform , where it provides the underlying widget toolkit used by the KDE desktop environment .
It is also used in a variety of commercial applications such as Skype , Google Earth , and Adobe Photoshop Elements .
Some of the most significant features added in Qt 4.4 include a multimedia abstraction layer , an HTML rendering widget based on WebKit , a new concurrency framework , and support for rendering widgets on the toolkit 's drawing canvas .
This is also the first Qt release to include support for Windows CE and Windows Mobile .
We gave you an early glimpse of Qt 4.4 last year when we tested a prerelease .
Now that development is complete and the functionality has been finalized , we can take a closer look .
To that end , we conducted extensive testing to see how the new features perform .
We also discussed the release with Trolltech CTO Benoit Schillings , who shared some insights about Qt 4.4 and gave us some hints about what we might see in future versions .
Bridging the gap between desktop and mobile development
Qt is supported on all major desktop operating systems , including Linux , Mac OS X , and Windows .
It uses native APIs to render widgets , which means that most Qt applications are visually consistent with the underlying operating system .
Trolltech also offers a Linux - based mobile operating system stack called Qtopia that is used on a wide range of devices , including the Sony Mylo and some Motorola mobile phone handsets .
Qt 4.4 extends the toolkit 's portability by bringing full support to Windows CE .
Developers can now use
Qt to write a single application code base that can be ported trivially to any of the supported operating systems .
Qt has a lot to offer on Windows CE and is well suited for creating graphically rich touchscreen user interfaces .
Developers say that it offers good performance and strong support for the native look and feel of the platform .
Trolltech 's tools support tight integration with Visual Studio , which means that it will be easy for existing Windows CE developers to adopt the framework .
An impressive demo video created by Trolltech shows a series of Qt demo applications running on a Windows Mobile touchscreen device and then on FIC's Linux - based Neo1973 .
The applications show off some of the most sophisticated graphical capabilities offered by Qt and also demonstrate the toolkit 's robust touch - screen support .
An intriguing benefit of Qt support for Windows CE is that it will expand the ecosystem of open source software available for the operating system by enabling developers to port over existing KDE and Qt applications .
I know I 'd love to be able to run Qtopia applications like FBReader on my Windows Mobile device .
Trolltech developers have already experimentally ported some relatively complex KDE 4 applications and gotten them to work on Windows Mobile .
For instance , Thomas Hartmann wrote a blog entry last month demonstrating a port of the KDE 4 program Marble , a mapping application with sophisticated drawing .
It works seamlessly across several Windows devices .
The high level of portability offered by Qt attracted mobile giant Nokia , which is in the process of acquiring Trolltech .
The deal is still pending while it faces regulatory scrutiny in Europe .
In an announcement issued earlier this year , Nokia said that it intends to leverage Qt to provide a cross- platform development layer that will work across a broad spectrum of mobile and desktop platforms .
Nokia has already announced plans to bring Qt to its S60 and Maemo mobile operating systems .
Abstract
The honeybee waggle dance , through which foragers advertise the existence and location of a food source to their hive mates , is acknowledged as the only known form of symbolic communication in an invertebrate .
However , the suggestion , that different species of honeybee might possess distinct ‘ dialects ’ of the waggle dance , remains controversial .
Furthermore , it remains unclear whether different species of honeybee can learn from and communicate with each other .
This study reports experiments using a mixed - species colony that is composed of the Asiatic bee Apis cerana cerana ( Acc ) , and the European bee Apis mellifera ligustica ( Aml ) .
Using video recordings made at an observation hive , we first confirm that Acc and Aml have significantly different dance dialects , even when made to forage in identical environments .
When reared in the same colony , these two species are able to communicate with each other :
Acc foragers could decode the dances of Aml to successfully locate an indicated food source .
We believe that this is the first report of successful symbolic communication between two honeybee species ; our study hints at the possibility of social learning between the two honeybee species , and at the existence of a learning component in the honeybee dance language .

Introduction
When foraging honeybees find an attractive food source , they can perform a special communicative behaviour called the dance language , which was first discovered by Karl von Frisch [ 1 ] .
Dances can be classified into three broad forms [ 1 ] which depend on the distance of the food source .
For sources close to the colony , a simple round dance is performed .
For larger distances , a sickle dance is performed .
Finally , at the furthest distances from the nest , a waggle dance is performed .
The waggle dance is the most sophisticated of these three forms as it encodes direction and distance of the food source [ 1 ] .
Each iteration of the honeybee waggle dance consists of a straight waggle phase , whose duration indicates distance to the food source , and whose direction relative to gravity encodes the direction of food relative to the sun 's azimuth [ 1 ] – [ 3 ] .
Distance to a food source is gauged through the optic flow experienced on the outbound foraging trip [ 4 ] – [ 6 ] .
Recently , the waggle phase , instead of the entire circuit of the dance , was confirmed as a reliable indicator of the distance to the food source [ 3 ] , [ 7 ] – [ 9 ] .
By eavesdropping on this communication system , scientists have obtained a unique perspective into the perceptual world of insects [ 10 ] .
Honeybee colonies achieve fitness through dancing to share food - location information among their nest mates [ 11 ] .
The dance language of the honeybee is thought to have evolved from a more primitive form of communication , perhaps similar to that of extant bumblebees [ 12 ] .
Moreover , various honeybee species may have evolved distinct ‘ dialects ’ during their long evolutionary history [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] .
Dance ‘ dialect ’ describes the distances at which foragers of each Apis subspecies make the transition between dance types .
According to older published distance communication curves [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] , Apis florea and Apis mellifera carnica display striking differences in their dialects .
Further research has shown that the dance language could be influenced and affected by both genetic factors [ 17 ] – [ 19 ] and environmental parameters [ 4 ] – [ 6 ] .
Some comparative studies , based on these later findings , have shown that Apis mellifera carnica and Apis florea do not differ significantly from each other in the waggle phases performed as a function of distance [ 20 ] .
However , these published waggle curves of different honeybee species were neither obtained from the same spatial route , nor at the same time .
Thus , the question of whether these differences are real , or simply the result of flying through dissimilar visual environments , remains unanswered .
It is therefore necessary to obtain waggle curves of different species made to forage in the same location and at the same time .
A mixed - species study on dance language communication is one possible way to investigate this issue .
In general , individual honeybees from different species cannot be put together in one colony , because they have their own special odour , and are likely to attack and kill each other quickly [ 21 ] .
This is the main obstacle to the study of social learning and communication between different species of Apis .
Although honeybee workers and queens can be reared in any single - species colony , interspecific reciprocal introductions of female larvae between Apis mellifera and Apis cerana have usually failed [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] , because of species - specific brood pheromones [ 23 ] , [ 24 ] and / or differences in royal jelly [ 25 ] , [ 26 ] .
However , encouraged by the reports that young European Apis mellifera workers are accepted into Asian Apis cerana colonies [ 27 ] – [ 29 ] , we assembled a harmonious mixed - species colony of Apis cerana cerana and Apis mellifera ligustica .
Using this mixed - species colony , we were able to investigate the communication and learning of the dance language between individuals of different honeybee species .
Discussion
This is the first report of the successful establishment of a mixed - species honeybee colony , with individuals of Apis cerana cerana and Apis mellifera ligustica cohabiting , foraging and carrying out normal hive functions , for the greater part harmoniously , for over 50 days .
Several cross-species interactions , such as dance following , trophallaxis and queen tending were observed during this period , indicating that ours was a normally functioning hive .
We believe that this is an important breakthrough in the study of honeybees , and that such mixed - species hives will open exciting new avenues of research into various aspects of this social insect 's biology .
We studied details of the dance communication ( dance angle , waggle duration and recruitment success ) of Acc and Aml in the mixed - species hive .
The dance angles were not significantly different between Acc and Aml in the mixed - species hive , which means that both dance dialects indicated the same food source direction .
However , the distance - dependent waggle durations were significantly different between Acc and Aml honeybees , regardless of whether they were in a pure colony or the mixed - species colony .
The dialect differences of honeybee species are therefore encoded in the difference in waggle duration .
Environmental variables , such as wind velocity , temperature and the surrounding landscape can be ruled out , as all bees were made to forage along the same flight path , and all dances for a given experiment , whose waggle durations were analysed , were recorded within a short period of time .
An early study on dance communication between two subspecies of Apis mellifera in a mixed hive similar to ours commented on the ‘ misunderstandings ’ that occur when workers of one subspecies follow the dancers of another [ 16 ] .
However , the foragers in that study were still able to locate feeders in the vicinity of the food source , even after having followed dances in a different dialect .
While the subspecies of Apis mellifera may have diverged around 0.67 million years ago [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] , our study confirms that the ability to use the information encoded in an unfamiliar dance extends even across species separated by six to eight million years of evolution [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] .
The Acc bees in our mixed - species colony were almost as successful as the Aml bees in locating a feeder advertised by more experienced Aml dancers , as indicated by our accuracy experiments .
The Acc bees following Aml dances were not only recruited to the experimental feeder , but also preferentially chose the one at the correct distance ( as indicated by Aml dances ) , when two unscented dummy feeders were presented at nearer and farther locations .
These results highlight the highly conserved nature of not only the dance itself , but also the mechanisms by which the dance is interpreted by follower bees .
In the accuracy experiments , we also noticed that more recruited foragers , regardless of species , visited the nearer feeder at 400 m than the farther one at 600 m .
This indicates that some of the recruited foragers perceived the exact directional , but approximate distance , information regarding the rewarded feeder site , and then searched for their final location after exploring the nearer feeder at 400 m .
When comparing the visit frequency of foragers recruited by the same species or by a different species , we find that the number of recruited foragers in intraspecific recruitment is always greater than that of interspecific recruitment , although not in a statistically significant manner .
Honeybee waggle dancers produce and release behaviourally active chemicals , which attract new foragers to follow dancers , and excite the followers to fly out of the hive [ 34 ] .
From the results of dance - following behaviour in the mixed - species colony , we hypothesise that both Acc and Aml dancers might produce active chemicals to attract new Acc and Aml foragers , although new Acc foragers seem more sensitive to the active chemical than do Aml foragers .
This is consistent with our observation that Acc honeybees are more likely to follow dances ( in absolute terms ) than Aml honeybees .
Social learning is classically defined as “ learning that is influenced by observation of , or interaction with , another animal ( typically a conspecific ) or its products ” [ 35 ] – [ 39 ] .
The possible interspecific chemical communication and dance - related interactions observed between Acc and Aml workers in the mixed - species colony are indicative of just this kind of social learning .
There has been a considerable amount of research on the sensory basis of the dance language [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 40 ] , [ 41 ] .
Although progress has been made recently in elucidating the underlying neural mechanisms of these remarkable abilities [ 42 ] – [ 45 ] , the honeybee dance is still rarely discussed in the context of social learning [ 39 ] .
Social learning might well be the mechanism by which bees of one species come to decode the dances of another , and locate the indicated food source ; further studies will be required to investigate this possibility .
For instance , do Acc bees become more proficient at decoding Aml dances with increasing foraging experience ?
In other words , do the kinds of ‘ misunderstandings ’ reported by Boch [ 16 ] manifest themselves early in a mixed - species colony 's life , and then gradually disappear with time ?
If so , does the rate of improvement in ‘ fluency ’ in another species ' code differ significantly from any ontogenetic improvements in the fluency in the code of one 's own species for bees in a ‘ pure ’ colony ?
Particularly exciting is the possibility that naïve Acc bees , whose dances contain longer waggle runs , might , after a period of time , learn to perform shorter dances after following only Aml dances , and searching for the advertised resources .
The mixed - species colony used in the present study has paved the way for investigating such questions relating to the learning component of the dance language .
We now know that honeybees have a variety of impressive cognitive skills and an amazing learning ability [ 39 ] , [ 46 ] – [ 51 ] .
Owing to the small brain size of the subjects , the study of honeybee learning has a good tradition of deconstructing seemingly complex phenomena , and explaining them in terms of simple processes .
This provides an ideal perspective to study the mechanisms of social learning , too .
The mixed - species colonies of Acc and Aml have paved a new way to study communication and learning between individuals of different species , which will be helpful in understanding the neural mechanisms of the striking dance language of honeybees .
Materials and Methods Bees and the organization of mixed - species colony Six colonies of Apis mellifera ligustica ( 4–6 frames ) and Apis cerana cerana ( 3 –4 frames ) were kept at the apiary of Huajiachi Campus , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , China .
We organized three mixed colonies consisting of an Apis cerana cerana ( Acc ) queen , Acc workers and Apis mellifera ligustica ( Aml ) workers ( Figure 1 ) , and two other mixed colonies consisting of an Aml queen , Aml workers and Acc workers .
In the former colonies , the workers cohabited well for more than 20 days , while in the latter colonies , the Acc workers were killed and cleaned up by Aml workers after 2 – 3 days .
Thus , we were only able to use the former mixed - species colony to carry out our experiments .
We put the mixed colonies into observation hives after transporting them to the experimental location .
Experimental site and standard training procedure
We set up two mixed honeybee colonies and transported them to the Agricultural School of Zhangzhou , Fujian province , China .
The mixed colonies were put into an observation hive consisting of an Acc queen and equal numbers ( 1500 individuals ) of Aml and Acc workers .
In order to investigate whether Acc foragers in a mixed - species colony could be recruited by Aml dancers to a particular feeder , we designed two experiments .
Firstly , eight to ten Aml workers were trained and marked to collect sugar syrup from an artificial feeder placed at different distances ( 50 , 100 , 150 and 200 m away ) in a south - west direction from the observation hive on the campus of Agricultural School of Zhangzhou .
A hive containing only Acc bees was placed five metres away from the mixed hive as a control for the possibility that stray Acc foragers might accidentally find the feeder during their normal foraging activities .
When an Acc forager landed at the feeder , it was marked on the thorax with a paint mark ; its appearance back at the experimental hive ensured that it came from the mixed - species colony .
In this manner , we were able to confirm whether all Acc bees spotted at the feeder were from the mixed - species colony or not .
In addition , any marked Acc forager arriving at the feeder a second time was caught and held for the duration of the experiment .
This ensured that all the dances advertising the feeder location at the experimental hive were performed by Aml dancers .
In a second experiment , the observation hive was equipped with a moveable glass cover .
Another mixed - species colony was put into this observation hive , and only Aml workers were trained and marked to collect sugar syrup from an artificial feeder placed at different distances ( 50 , 100 , 150 or 200 m away ) in a south - west direction from the observation hive .
We were able to mark Acc workers , who were following Aml dances , on the thorax and abdomen with paint .
Then we monitored the feeder , where we caught any newly - recruited Acc foragers , and held them in a bottle for the duration of the experiment .
Accuracy of recruitment between Aml and Acc During December 2007 to February 2008 we carried out complementary experiments to assess the accuracy of Acc foragers recruited by Aml dancers and vice versa .
We set up an observation hive with a mixed - species colony of an Acc queen , Acc workers and Aml workers on the banks of the Da-Mei-canal in Zhangzhou , Fujian province , China ( Figure 6 ) .
In the first experiment , three identical , unscented feeder - stations [ 9 ] were located along the Da - Mei canal , in the south - west direction from the hive , at 400 m , 500 m and 600 m respectively .
Then , more than 50 Aml foragers were collected from the entrance of the observation hive , and directly carried to the 500 m feeder - station to collect sugar syrup ( 2.0 M sugar ) .
Only Aml foragers were trained to collect sugar syrup at the 500 m feeder .
After three days ' training , around 13 Aml foragers had learnt to visit the 500 m station regularly .
They were marked with paint , and after a few visits , they started to dance to recruit other foragers at the mixed - species colony .
In the tests , the previously used feeders were replaced with fresh unscented feeders .
The feeders at the 400 m and 600 m stations were unrewarded .
The visit frequency of the newly - recruited foragers was monitored at each feeder - station from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. , and from 12:30 p.m. to 16:30 p.m. PPT PowerPoint slide

The experiments were carried out on the banks of the Da-Mei-canal in Zhangzhou , Fujian province , China .
In the first experiment , three identical feeder - stations were located along the Da - Mei canal , in the south - west direction from the hive , at 400 m , 500 m and 600 m respectively .
In the second experiment , three identical feeder - stations were located along the Da -Mei canal , in the north - east direction from the hive , at 400 m , 500 m and 600 m respectively ( The photo was downloaded from Google earth ) .
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002365.g006
We monitored the feeders at all three positions , noting the presence of new foragers at the feeders .
To be sure that all new foragers came from our experimental hive , any new recruits arriving at the 500 m feeder was marked with a unique colour combination .
All such bees were seen to arrive at the observation hive .
We only counted the newly recruited foragers .
When the marked recruited foragers visited the 500 m feeder , we did not count them again .
Waggle duration comparison
To study the effect of a mixed - species colony on the waggle dance , we set up an observation hive with a mixed - species colony of an Acc queen , Acc workers and Aml workers on the banks of the Da-Mei-canal in Zhangzhou , Fujian province , China .
The road that ran along one bank of the canal was mostly deserted .
The weather was warm enough for foragers to collect syrup , and the natural food sources were limited .
The artificial feeders were set in the south direction at 100 m , 200 m , 300 m and 400 m away from the observation hive , respectively .
We carried out the experiments from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. , and from 12:30 p.m. to 16:30 p.m.
During these experiments , the weather was sunny ( we stopped the experiments during times of heavy cloud cover and rain ) , and the air temperature ranged between 18 – 25° Celsius .
We made digital video recordings , at the observation hive , of the dances of Acc and Aml foragers who had been marked at the feeder .
As controls , we also recorded the dances of foragers from single - species Acc and Aml colonies , who had been trained to feeders at equivalent distances along the same flight path as the mixed - species colony .
The waggle durations of at least ten dancers , with five foraging trips per individual from each species , were recorded and analysed using Ulead VideoStudio 9.0 SE DVD software ( http://www.ulead.com/vs/) for feeder distances of 100 m , 200 m , 300 m and 400 m .
Dance angle comparison
The dance angle , corresponding to the angle between the sun 's azimuth and the indicated food source outside the hive , is the direction of the waggle run relative to the direction of gravity .
Ten pairs of Acc and Aml dancers were analysed in the digital video records using Ulead VideoStudio 9.0 SE DVD software ( http://www.ulead.com/vs/).
Five waggle phases of each individual were measured , and the average was regarded as the dance angle .
To ensure the comparability of dances from each species , we recorded and analysed pairs of individual dances occurring within ten minutes of each other for feeder distances of 100 m , 200 m , 300 m and 400 m. Acc and Aml workers following dancers
When we analysed the waggle duration data of the dancers , we also counted the number of Acc and Aml workers following a dancer in the pure and mixed - species colonies .
The number of workers following at least ten dancers from each species was recorded and analysed for feeder distances of 100 m , 200 m , 300 m , 400 m and 500 m. Statistical analysis
The dances were evaluated as follows .
For each dance , the mean waggle duration was estimated by averaging the waggle durations over all loops .
Then , the mean waggle duration for each bee was obtained by averaging the mean waggle durations over all of its dances at that feeder position .
Finally , the mean waggle duration of all bees was calculated from the mean waggle durations for the individuals .
The standard error of the mean was also calculated and displayed in the graphs .
Linear regressions of the data were computed using the GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , California , United States ) statistical analysis package .
To compare waggle durations and regression slopes of different data sets , we used the same statistical package , which implemented the slope comparison test described in Sokal and Rohlf ( 1995 ) [ 52 ] .
To compare waggle durations of Apis mellifera and Apis cerana in the pure colony and the mixed - species colony , we used Analysis of Variance for Two - stage Nested Design of DPS Software ( http://www.chinadps.net/index.htm).
To compare the visit frequencies of recruited Acc and Aml at 400 m , 500 m , and 600 m positions , we used a One - way ANOVA and Tukey 's test of DPS Software ( http://www.chinadps.net/index.htm).
We used a t- test with Welch correction to compare the number of Acc and Aml bees following Acc and Aml dancers in the mixed - species colony .
To compare the dance angles collected from Acc dancers with those of Aml dancers , we used a pairwise t- test of DPS software [ 53 ] .

Accuracy of recruitment by Acc dancers .
The experiments were carried out on the banks of the Da-Mei-canal in Zhangzhou , Fujian province of China ( see Figure 4 ) .
Similar to the experiments in which Acc and Aml foragers were recruited by Aml dancers , in this experiment , only Acc foragers were trained to collect sugar syrup at the 500 m feeder in the north - east direction from the hive , .
After three days ' training , average 9 Acc foragers had learnt to visit the 500 m station regularly .
In the tests , the previously used feeders were replaced with fresh unscented feeders .
The feeders at the 400 m and 600 m stations were unrewarded .
Figure S1a shows that the visit frequency of Acc foragers recruited by Acc dancers is significantly different at 400 m , 500 m and 600 m ( F2,30 = 5.89 , p = 0.007 , One - way ANOVA ) , and that the frequency of recruited Acc at 500 m was greater than that at 400 m ( P = 0.0175 , Tukey 's test ) and 600 m ( P = 0.0138 , Tukey 's test ) .
Comparing visit frequencies at 400 m and 600 m , more bees visited the 400 m feeder than the 600 m feeder , but the difference was not significant ( p = 0.9949 , Tukey 's test ) .
Figure S1 b shows a similar trend for Aml foragers recruited by Acc dancers .
The visit frequency of recruited Aml was significantly different at 400 m , 500 m and 600 m ( F2,30 = 10.207 , p = 0.0004 , One - way ANOVA ) , and the frequency of recruited Aml at 500 m was greater than that at 400 m ( P = 0.0045 , Tukey 's test ) and 600 m ( P = 0.0006 , Tukey 's test ) .
Comparing visit frequencies at 400 m and 600 m , more bees visited the 400 m feeder than the 600 m feeder , but the difference was not significant ( p = 0.7378 , Tukey 's test ) .
Comparison of Acc foragers and Aml foragers recruited by Acc dancers showed that Acc dancers can recruit more Acc foragers to the 500 m feeder than Aml foragers , but the difference is not significant ( F1,66 = 0.8702 , p = 0.4037 , ANOVA for Two - stage Nested Design ) .

In an attempt to grasp complex concepts , humans have tried to represent abstractions like power and dominance through visually - stimulated metaphors such as pyramids and steeples .
And dominance especially has been measured socially , linguistically and artistically on a vertical dimension , as with upper and lower class divisions in hierarchical structures .
While this may be considered a commonly recognized phenomenon , it proved to be an under - researched theory until recently when psychologists from North Dakota State University found a method to understand personality processes through the measurement of metaphoric representations .
Specifically , Sara Moeller , Michael Robinson and Darya Zabelina discovered that individuals high in dominance paid closer attention to stimuli in vertical positions than other participants .
The findings , which appear in the April 2008 issue of Psychological Science , a journal of the Association for Psychological Science , imply that a person 's level of dominance could be measured based on their biases favoring vertical representations of power .
" Simply stated , more dominant individuals think in dominance - related terms to a greater extent than do less dominant individuals , " the authors wrote .
" That is , their thoughts more often involve power , powerlessness and relative dominance . "
The scientists supported this theory using a simple computer program that prompted participants to press the ' p ' or ' q ' key when it appeared on the screen .
The letters were displayed on the right , left , top or bottom part of the screen .
Those individuals who responded quickly when the letters were on the top or bottom of the screen also had high scores in dominance on a personality inventory .
The other participants did not show a significant preference for the vertically - arranged letters .
" Our results are among the first to establish the benefits of the metaphor representation perspective for understanding personality processes , " explained Moeller , " and they specifically suggest that thinking dominantly predisposes one to see vertically . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Baby crocodiles start chatting to one another and to their mothers just before they hatch , perhaps signaling that it is time to be born , French researchers reported on Monday .

The little crocs make an “ umph ! umph ! umph ! ” sound right before they hatch , Amelie Vergne and Nicolas Mathevon of Universite Jean Monnet in Saint - Etienne , France reported .
( To listen to the audio click here )
“ Crocodile mothers react strongly to playback of pre-hatching calls , most of them by digging the sand , ” they wrote in the journal Current Biology .
The researchers tested 10 crocodiles and their eggs , recording the sounds the babies made and then playing these , as well as random sounds , to the mothers .
The sounds seemed to spur siblings to start breaking out of their eggs , Vergne and Mathevon wrote .
“ In the zoo where we did the experiments , eggs are removed within a few days after laying .
In spite of this , females continue to guard the nest . ”
Eight of the mother crocodiles who were played recordings of the correct “ umph ” calls tried to dig up their clutches , while mothers who heard random sounds did not .
Mathevon said many baby reptiles are eaten right after birth , so it may be important for them all to hatch together and for the mother to be there when they do .
“ In this sense , it is important for all embryos in the nest to be ready for hatching at the same time so that they all receive adult care and protection , ” he said in a statement .
HOUSTON 
As the price of gasoline quadrupled over the last decade , American drivers seemed to defy the laws of economics by pumping more into their vehicles year after year .
But this is the year American drivers appear to be finally succumbing to price shock at the pump , according to a new report by Cambridge Energy Research Associates , a consulting firm affiliated with IHS Inc .
It says the slowdown in the economy and soaring gasoline prices have finally persuaded Americans to drive fewer miles in fewer gas - guzzling vehicles .
“ U.S. gasoline demand will likely decline in 2008 for the first time in more than 17 years , ” says the report to be released Thursday .
“ For the first time since the 1970s and early 1980s the number of miles driven by Americans has clearly begun trending downward . ”
The Transportation Department reported on Wednesday that Americans drove 1.8 percent fewer miles on public roads in April 2008 compared with the same month last year , the sixth consecutive month of driving mileage declines .

ABUJA , June 19 ( Reuters ) - Militants in speedboats attacked Royal Dutch Shell's
RDSa .L
main offshore facility in Nigeria on Thursday , cutting the country 's oil output by a tenth and raising fears of a new campaign against deepwater installations .
The strike on Shell 's Bonga field , which lies some 120 km ( 75 miles ) off the coast and has a nameplate capacity of 220,000 barrels per day , forced the Anglo - Dutch giant to stop output from the $ 3.6 billion facility .
The rebel Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta ( MEND ) -- which until now has mainly blown up oil pipelines and kidnapped expatriate workers in the shallow creeks of southern Nigeria -- warned the attack may not be its last in deep waters .
" The location for today 's attack was deliberately chosen to remove any notion that offshore oil exploration is far from our reach , " the group said in an e-mailed statement , telling oil firms to remove expatriate workers from Nigeria .
" Oil and gas tankers are also warned to avoid Nigerian waters .
They stand the risk of laden crude oil or natural gas tankers being attacked , " the group said .
International oil companies have been increasingly focusing on offshore projects in Nigeria , partly to offset the risk to onshore operations in the Niger Delta , where a violent campaign of sabotage has cut output by a fifth in recent years .
After the Bonga attack , MEND gunmen came across a separate oil supply vessel and seized its U.S. captain -- working for oil services firm Tidex , contracted to Chevron
CVX.N
-- in what security sources said appeared to be an opportunistic strike .
MEND later said it had released the man to his employers .
MEND and other militant groups say they are campaigning for a fairer share of oil wealth for local communities in the Niger Delta , whose land and water have been polluted by oil extraction for five decades .
OFFSHORE ATTACKS RARE
Pipelines in the region are exposed and often unguarded , making them easy targets for anyone with access to explosives .
But significant attacks on offshore facilities are more complicated to carry out and have been relatively rare .
MEND said its main target had been Bonga 's computerised control room , from where crude exports are coordinated , but its detonation engineers had been unable to gain access .
" Our next visit will be different , " the group said .
Fears of supply disruption in Nigeria , home to sub-Saharan Africa 's biggest oil industry , have sent jitters through an already volatile global oil market .
President Umaru Yar 'Adua has promised a peace summit next month to address the root causes of the unrest in the Niger Delta , but MEND has said it will not take part .
Shell said it was too soon to say how long output would be shut down following the attack on Bonga , which it said had targeted a floating production storage and offloading vessel .
" It acts as a flow station , as a terminal .
It is the heart , the hub of the field , " Shell spokesman Precious Okolobo said .
Offshore installations in Nigeria are seen as more secure than those onshore , partly because MEND and other militant groups have tended to use small boats not designed for deeper waters .
Shell 's Bonga field has helped offset losses from the delta , while Chevron's

Akpo fields -- both deep offshore -- are due to come on stream this year .
But offshore security appears to be deteriorating .
Seafarers ' unions have urged shipping firms to grant crews emergency rights such as war - risk bonuses for operating in Nigerian waters , following a spate of attacks on merchant ships .
Nigerian navy spokesman Henry Babalola said armed youths in military fatigues attacked an oil security vessel and kidnapped two crew members in a separate incident on Thursday .

In providing a search service , Google have an obligation to ensure their service does not knowingly or willingly cause harm to us .
So imagine my dismay to see malware being paraded in front of me after an innocuous and totally unrelated search …
Think of it this way , if you bought a magazine on the subject of fishing and it was full of premium rate telephone numbers to companies that looked like legitimate fishing and tackle supplies , but were really fronts for eBay scammers , you ’d be pretty well annoyed , right ?
So what ’s the difference when Google sit back and allow malware to persist on their search engine ?
There is no difference .
To help cement my point , I ’ll be playing Devils Advocate with myself , highlighting the various points and counter - points , to make it a much more nuanced discussion .
Talking about Malware on Google
“ Do n’t we see people selling booze and smokes on Google ?
Is n’t that stuff harmful ? ”
Of course , but for whatever reason , these items are subject to laws .
And are ostensibly not made to harm people , despite more recent findings highlighting otherwise .
They ’re only harmful in excess , while alcohol specifically is mostly harmless in moderation .
The things that Google lists as harmful are essentially constructed with the explicit purpose of causing harm , or at the very least , some level of disruption .
“ So what about guns and knives — they ’re legal , right ?
We see people selling them and they ’re legal here in the US . ”
If we use weapons as another example , then people are buying these things with the intention of inflicting harm , obviously .
Or , at the very least , to defend themselves .
However , when I type a search for : “ Steve Jobs ‘ I like options ' ” , as I did , then I ’m certainly not looking for guns , knuckle dusters , pepper spray , knives , Mace — or malware .
So why am I even seeing these things ?
If it ’s the case that Google ca n’t guarantee the specificity of a search result , then those things are clearly not related , or offer something that is obviously in conflict with the search query should not be present .
As you ’ll probably hear if you were to find yourself in a court of law , there ’s a balance of probabilities to be considered , as well as degrees of harm .
But because Google are needlessly placing irrelevant search results in front of me , when I ’m clearly looking for something that ’s totally harmless , then the degree of harm they ’re placing in front of me and everyone else is negligence on their part .
“ Google places a warning next to the link .
What more do you want ? ”
You ’re making a perilously callous defense for Google here , which I find troubling .
That ’s like letting me perform brain surgery , which inevitably kills the patient , then claiming that because neuroscience is still in its infancy , I ’m not really to blame .
Not a particularly sound basis for any business , which on the balance of probabilities would suggest heavily that Google are acting with the interests of their business model first and the personal safety of their users second .
Shall we add pedophilia , or necrophelia to the list of things you think should be allowed on Google ?
Question is , where do you draw a sensible line ?
Of course , pedophilia is outlawed , but then so too are most of the things that are resultant of me clicking on some item of malware .
And this is n’t the first time I ’ve seen such things for innocuous searches , either .
“ I do n’t need a baby - sitter !
Ever heard the saying : ‘ once bitten twice shy ’ ?
People can look after themselves .
If they click on the wrong thing , they wo n’t do it a second time , will they ? ”
Thing is , in following your line of reasoning , we clearly place the legality of something second to its availability — which is n’t logical .
In some instances , finding such things as guns , knives and knuckle dusters available to buy is in contravention of laws within the countries where those searches are being performed .
But what we ’re wandering into are issues of creating an informational police state .
That ’s a very different matter all together , one outside the remit of this discussion .
Both you and Google are making the assumption that the average person using the internet is full of scrutiny , endlessly vigilant and the enemy of naivety — the fact is , they ’re often diametrically the opposite .
That ’s why these ploys work , because some unscrupulous bastard knows only too well people will fall for clicking on something despite the warnings , sometimes just out of curiosity .
And because the degree of harm is set too high , more people with less net savvy will be harmed because people like you are educated just enough to avoid the snares & traps , but not wordly - wise enough to see that such things are wrong .
On the one hand , we have a broadly naive huge mass of people using the internet , who are prone to having their privacy and security compromised .
On the other side is a small minority of people who are preying on the aforementioned .
What you ’re doing is mounting a defense for Google that effectively places the latter party with equal to or greater privileges than the former .
Because the latter party are n’t being dealt with , Google are essentially a market stall to these people .
Google owe it to the people using their search to make every reasonable effort to eradicate malware from their systems .
Simply providing a warning is n’t good enough …

NEW YORK ( AP )  Builders of the Freedom Tower poured a bad batch of concrete into the foundation of the skyscraper replacing the World Trade Center and spent the last few weeks removing it after tests showed it was n't strong enough , officials said .
About 50 cubic yards of concrete was jackhammered away from the core foundation of the 1,776 - foot tower under construction at ground zero .
More than 22,000 cubic yards of concrete have been poured so far , and no other batches have failed strength tests , said Steve Coleman , spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey .
The tower , the symbolic replacement to the twin towers destroyed on Sept. 11 , is being built with concrete stronger than any other building in New York City .
The foundation is built to withstand 14,000 pounds per square inch , about three times the strength of concrete in an average home and over five times the strength in a sidewalk .
A tower rebuilt north of ground zero two years ago , 7 World Trade Center , was built with concrete at a strength of 12,000 pounds per square inch , officials said .
The concrete that was removed from the Freedom Tower varied in strength between 6,000 and 10,000 pounds per square inch , Coleman said Tuesday .
It was poured Dec. 18 and passed initial strength tests , he said .
But contractors working on the site noticed a 6 - inch section appeared to have excessive air pockets , he said .
After further tests , the builders decided in mid-February to take the concrete out , he said .
The construction schedule for the tower , expected to open in 2012 , was n't affected , Coleman said .
A message left with the main concrete supplier , Quadrozzi Concrete Corp. , was n't returned .
Tony Arnold , president of iCrete , the company that developed the high - strength technology for the tower , said the small amount concrete must have been mixed improperly .
" We have had no batches that have not achieved the strength , " he said .
Removing below - strength concrete that has already been poured is rare in the industry , said Greg Vickers , managing director of operations for the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association .

Kanga 's treatment was successful , but the virus that struck her is causing increasing concern among some researchers who think it is causing a small - scale epidemic of throat cancer .
That virus , scientists have proved only in the last two years , is human papillomavirus , or HPV - the same virus that 's behind most cases of cervical cancer .
With 6,000 cases per year and an annual increase of up to 10 per cent in men younger than 60 , some researchers say the HPV - linked throat cancers could overtake cervical cancer in the next decade .
" It 's almost a new disease , in a sense , " said Dr Ezra Cohen , an oncologist at the University of Chicago Medical Centre .
" It 's now becoming a dominant sub - type of the disease that we see in our clinic . "
The HPV infections likely took root decades ago as the Baby Boomers were reaching adulthood , and only now are spurring a rise in throat cancer cases , mostly among men and women in their 50s .
No one understands the precise reason for the increase , though experts suspect it 's linked to changes in sexual practices that emerged in the 1960s and ' 70s .
For example , oral sex is a known risk factor for HPV - related throat cancers , and studies have shown that people who have come of age since the 1950s are more likely to have engaged in oral sex than those who were born earlier .
" Those people were in their teens during the sexual revolution , so they may be leading the wave , " said Dr Maura Gillison , a professor of oncology and epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Centre who has published numerous studies indicating that HPV - related throat cancer is a distinct type of disease .
The virus targets a specific portion of the upper throat called the oropharynx , which includes the tonsils and base of the tongue .
Just a decade ago , doctors believed nearly all such cancers were linked with smoking or extremely heavy drinking .
Last year , however , Gillison 's team published a major study that found stark differences between the risky behaviours of throat cancer patients with HPV and those without .
The HPV - positive cancer patients tended to have had higher numbers of sex partners than the others and were far more likely to have had multiple oral - sex partners .
The virus - linked cancer appears somewhat less deadly than throat cancers that arise from smoking or drinking .
A paper published this year found that 96 per cent of HPV - positive patients survived at least two years after diagnosis , compared with 62 per cent survival for HPV - negative cancers .
" They have a better prognosis , but these are still very aggressive cancers , " said Dr Marshall Posner , medical director of head and neck oncology at the Dana - Farber / Harvard Cancer Centre in Boston .
While doctors had hoped for an overall drop in throat cancer as the percentage of Americans who smoke declined , the rise of HPV - related throat cancers seems to be offsetting any such benefit .
Gillison 's group tested hundreds of head and neck tumours that doctors began saving in the early 1970s , long before anyone knew such cancers might be linked to HPV .
The work showed that the number of HPV - positive tumours increased by about 1 per cent a year on average , though the trend has quickened in the last decade , especially in men younger than 60 .
The virus thrives in the outer layer of skin and is transmitted mostly by skin - to - skin contact , researchers think .
Sexual transmission tends to cause infection near the site of contact ; intercourse is linked with cervical cancer , while oral sex can cause cancer of the upper throat .
Recent increases in HPV - positive throat cancers could be an aftershock of changes in sexual behaviour that began decades ago .
A landmark 1994 study of sexual behaviour showed that oral sex had become commonplace only in the generations born in the 1950s or later .
Fewer than 60 per cent of people born in the 1930s were found to have had oral sex , compared with more than 80 per cent of people born since 1950 .
" The older people simply did not do it as much , " said Edward Laumann , a University of Chicago professor of sociology who led the National Health and Social Life Survey .
" It 's a very complicated social story that nobody 's really worked out in detail , " he said .
Other causes may have contributed to the spread of HPV cancers , including the increased movement of people around the country and the world in the last half - century , experts said .
Scientists are n't even sure yet whether the virus might be spread by kissing , though data suggest oral sex is a major route of transmission .
One implication of the cancer trend is that oral sex does not constitute " safe sex , " Kanga said .
" We can't be afraid to talk about this , " Kanga said .
" The message that oral sex carries risks is just not out there . "
Conservative groups say the emergence of HPV - related throat cancer is an additional argument for abstaining from sex until marriage .
But many researchers focus on expanded use of the HPV vaccine , which since 2006 has been recommended for girls ages 11 to 12 .
Just as the vaccine lessens the risk of cervical cancer for those girls , it may offer protection from HPV - positive throat cancer , though studies have not yet addressed that question .
Vaccine maker Merck &
Co hopes to submit an application this year to the US Food and Drug Administration for use of its HPV vaccine in males .
Although the company 's studies will not show specifically whether the vaccine protects against throat cancer , they should reveal whether the shots prevent infection with HPV .
" We expect the vaccine to work just as well in male and female populations , " said Dr Richard Haupt , director of Merck 's clinical program for the vaccine , Gardasil , which was developed using technology pioneered in Australia .

I purchased a small software product about 16 months ago and after putting in hundreds of hours cleaning up the code and growing revenue , I offered it for sale to free up time for this blog and pursue another potential opportunity ( that has since gone by the wayside , as these things are apt to do ) .
Within a week of my “ for sale ” post I received 20 email inquiries , sent out nearly that many NDAs , distributed 13 sales packets ( including a detailed description of the product with all the relevant data , and a Google Analytics PDF ) to those who returned signed NDAs , and spent about 10 hours answering questions via email .
I set a deadline for offers to keep the process from dragging on , and by the time the deadline passed I had three suitable offers on my desk .
Two of them were nearly identical , with a down payment and monthly payments .
The third was something I had n’t expected .
Good Developers
In my 9 years as a professional developer I ’ve worked with at least a hundred developers , but I can count on one hand the people I would recruit if I were starting a company – these are the best software developers I ’ve worked with .
Most are not great because of their pyrotechnic coding skills ; they ’re great because of their non-technical chops ( future - oriented , ultra - reliable , attention to detail , and smart ) .
When I put DotNetInvoice on the auction block I was contacted by a developer named Jeremy whom I worked with from 2000 - 2003 ( and on a few small projects since then ) .
We worked closely on a number of projects , pulled a few all - nighters , and wrote more software than many of the four ( or more ) person teams I ’ve worked with since .
Jeremy is one of the aforementioned developers that I would count on my one hand .
So Jeremy called to make an offer for DotNetInvoice , but he had some concerns .
He was fine with the coding aspects of the project , but questioned whether he had the time to get up to speed on everything it takes to run a small software product given that he has n’t done much in the way of shrink - wrapped software , SEO , and marketing .
After a few conversations he brought up the idea of buying in as a partner .
Partnerships
I ’m wary of partnerships for a few reasons .
I ’ve worked solo for years and I like the control , the ability to make decisions when and how I want , and the fact that I answer to no one except my clients / customers .
Partnerships inevitably bring a loss of control and create many unknowns due to the fact that you ’re working with another person , typically someone you do n’t know as well as you should when you start the partnership ( “ You ’ve been to jail for what ? ! ” ) .
Having worked with Jeremy for thousands of hours I have a good read on his strengths and weaknesses , which means many of the scary unknowns of forming a partnership are a little less scary and a little less unknown .
And I have to admit that the prospect of being able to share the ongoing support and development burden was enticing .
To top it off , although the the other two cash offers were over my minimum asking price , they were not what I was hoping for .
So I mulled it over for a few days , talked to a few friends and colleagues , and decided that the partnership offered the best terms : I get a small bit of up front cash , retain partial ownership , and get to focus on the pieces of the business I enjoy ( and where I do the most good ) .
We still have the complications that come with a partnership ( potential conflicts , loss of control , things falling through the cracks ) , but the thought of keeping the product I ’ve worked so hard to build and having more time for other endeavors is very , very appealing .
And the fact that I ’m going out of town next week and I do n’t have to spend a moment thinking about answering support emails is priceless .
Although not what I anticipated , my gut tells me the product will be far better with two experienced people working on it .
Next Steps
We recently finished hashing out the contract , and expect to release the much needed next version , with much sweat from Jeremy , in the next few weeks .
Do I wish it had sold for a high valuation ?
I think so .
But even though I was committed to selling , I had a nagging doubt about whether it was the right decision .
If you ’ve ever built something and tried to sell it you ’ll know the mechanics of the sale are n’t the hard part – it ’s the psychological piece .
I think I lucked out this time around .
A few lessons I took away from the sale process ( keeping in mind I ’ve bought or sold several websites and one software product in the past ) :
Set Your Price Range – You ’ll want to stay between 12 and 30 months of revenue .
This is the standard range for websites and software products and in my experience is in line with what the market will bear .
The range varies based on the amount of time your product takes to maintain , your expenses , and the number of potential buyers given your price range and technology .

Rule of Thumb on NDA s –
If you expect the product to sell for more than $ 10 k , protect the future buyer by requiring an NDA before disclosing financial information .
s – If you expect the product to sell for more than $ 10 k , protect the future buyer by requiring an NDA before disclosing financial information .
Prepare Your Sales Kit – Include a detailed summary of the product : Product Overview Customers Technical details Positive reviews and high - profile links Revenue Expenses Partnerships Personnel Competition Website traffic ( although include a detailed traffic report in a separate document )
Assets included in the sale Price range Future plans ( surely you will have a list a mile long )
Include a detailed summary of the product : Do n’t Accept PayPal or Credit Cards – Chargebacks are too easy and the fees are high ( 3 % of $ 10,000 is $ 300 ) .
Use escrow.com or good old fashioned checks .

Transferring Assets –
You may want to use a service like escrow.com ; they facilitate the exchange of your product once funds are deposited in an escrow account .
Another option is to use a sales contracts that specifies the following : half of the purchase price to be paid up - front ( via check ) , the assets are transferred , then the second half is paid .

Hold on to Your Domain Until the Last Dollar is Paid – I received two offers that involved ongoing monthly payments for a fixed duration ( 1 year ) .
In this case , after a contract was signed and I had received the down payment I would have sent the assets to the new owner and pointed the domain to his server , but maintained control of the domain until the last dollar was in my hand .
Maintain control of your domain name : it ’s your most valuable piece of IP .
Thanks to everyone who expressed interest in the sale .
I ’ll keep you posted on how things progress .
As Americans kick off the first holiday weekend of the summer Friday , Sen .
John McCain will release 400 pages of his medical records to a handpicked group of reporters who can neither photocopy nor keep the documents , illustrating the sensitivity the campaign places on the 71 - year - old candidate ’s age and health .
For more than a year , the four - term senator has repeatedly promised to release his recent medical records , but has not yet done so .
The McCain campaign has selected a handful of news organizations to review the records today in a conference room at the Copper Wynd Resort in Fountain Hills , Ariz . , near the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale .
Reporters from all five major news networks CBS , ABC , NBC , CNN and Fox will be allowed to take notes from the records , as will wire reporters from the Associated Press , Reuters and Bloomberg news agencies .
Just two print newspapers will be among the pool : The Washington Post and the Arizona Republic .
McCain campaign officials said yesterday that the high level of interest in the records meant they had to limit access by reporters .
“ We had to do it at the Mayo Clinic and the doctors there probably did n’t want 200 reporters running around , ” said senior McCain adviser Charlie Black .
“ It ’s not a perfect situation , but its the best available . ”
No independent doctors will be allowed to examine the records , although McCain officials said Thursday that most networks are flying in their medical correspondents , some of whom are doctors .
The records dump comes as Americans head in to a three - day weekend , and just days after Sen. Edward M. Kennedy was diagnosed with a grave form of brain cancer .
But Mr. Black said the campaign ’s communications director and others have been working on the release “ for weeks , ” and is not timed to reduce the impact of whatever the records contain .
Mr. McCain , for his part , said reporters will be underwhelmed by the medical findings .
“ There are going to be no surprises , he told reporters last Friday aboard his campaign bus on a trip to West Virginia .
His doctors “ have told me that everythings fine , ” he said .
The medical records released Friday will cover the years 2000 to 2008 .
In 1999 , during his first campaign for president , the senator released 1,500 pages of in - depth medical and psychiatric records , some collected during a a Navy project to gauge the health of former prisoners of war .
Mr. McCain spent more than five years in a Vietnam prison camp and suffers long - term effects from his incarceration :
He can not lift his arms over his above shoulder height and underwent months of rehabilitation to renew flexibility in his legs .
The Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale , one of the best medical facilities in the country , was the site where Mr. McCain underwent nearly six hours after he was diagnosed with Stage 2A melanoma , a form of cancer that kills a third of sufferers within 10 years .
Doctors incised a dime - sized discolored blotch from his left temple , but also made an incision down his left cheek to remove lymph nodes in his neck , even though they later found the cancer had not spread there .
Mr. McCain left cheek is still puffy and laced with the large scar he likes to joke on the campaign trail that “ I ’m older than dirt and I ’ve got more scars than Frankenstein . ”
Still , the candidate ’s age at 72 , he would be the oldest president ever to take office and especially his health threaten to become campaign issues .
At just 46 , Sen. Barack Obama , Mr. McCain ’s likely opponent , is young enough to be his son , and he has highlighted his health by doffing his shirt at the beach and sprinting up and down the basketball court , all , of course , in front of news cameras .
The Obama campaign insists it will not make age an issue in the campaign , and in some ways the one - term senator faces the same danger Walter Mondale did when he sought to portray President Reagan as too old for the demanding job of president .
In a memorable debate line , Mr. Reagan , 73 , said of the 56 - year - old Democrat : “ I will not make age an issue of this campaign .
I am not going to exploit , for political purposes , my opponent ’s youth and inexperience . ”
On the campaign trail , Mr. McCain is a dynamo , often tiring out reporters half his age from his dawn - to - well - past - dusk schedule .
Whenever age comes up during a town hall meeting with voters , he points to his 96 - year - old mother , Roberta as proof that he comes from hearty genetic stock .
“ If there ’s any question about any age problem we might have in this campaign , there ’s my genes , ” Mr McCain said at a campaign stop in Iowa in January .
“ Last Christmas , she went to France .
She landed in Paris and wanted to rent a car .
They told her she was too old so she bought one .
Way to go , Mom ! ”

Mr Bush urged Italians to learn the " first - hand truth about America " US President George W Bush has denounced " misinformation and propaganda " which he says are sullying his country 's image abroad .
On a visit to Italy , he told young entrepreneurs on an exchange programme that going to the US would show them it was compassionate and open .
Mr Bush also held talks in Rome with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
The two leaders discussed the role of Italian troops in Afghanistan and further sanctions against Iran .
Mr Berlusconi offered his country 's " inside knowledge " to help in talks aimed at persuading Tehran to abandon uranium enrichment .
Italy has recently become the Iranians ' largest European trading partner .
We are compassionate , we 're an open country , we care about people and we 're entrepreneurial
US President George W Bush
EU and US back in step Bush bids farewell Q&A : Iran and the nuclear issue " Our offer is based on the fact that we know Iran very well from the inside - we have some leading companies that are operating there , " Mr Berlusconi said .
In return for this co-operation , Italy wants US support in its bid to join the group of five permanent UN Security Council members plus Germany , which has been conducting negotiations with Iran .
Mr Bush meanwhile repeated a warning to Iran that it would face additional sanctions if it continued to defy the international community .
He said that diplomatic pressure remained the best path to deal with the issue , but again stressed that " all options are on the table " .
' Misinformation and propaganda '
Mr Berlusconi has remained one of Mr Bush 's staunchest allies in Europe Security for President Bush 's two - day visit has been very tight .
Commercial flights over the city have been diverted , 10,000 policemen have been mobilised , there are frogmen under bridges and snipers on roofs , and mobile phone signals are being disrupted whenever his motorcade moves , says the BBC's Christian Fraser in Rome .
As Air Force
One touched down , hundreds were gathering in the city centre in protest at the Bush administration and Italy 's involvement in Afghanistan .
Another group of demonstrators chanted " Bush , go home " outside the American Academy in Rome 's Villa Aurelia while the president met young entrepreneurs inside .
HAVE YOUR SAY
One trip to Europe cannot make up for eight years of destructive foreign policy CB , New York , US Mr Bush urged them to ignore the " misinformation and propaganda " spread about his country and to learn the " first - hand truth about America " by visiting .
" The best diplomacy for America , particularly among young folks , is to welcome you to our country , " he said .
" We are compassionate , we 're an open country , we care about people and we 're entrepreneurial . "
Mr Bush will conclude his visit to Italy on Friday by meeting Pope Benedict XVI .
In an unusual break with protocol , they will meet not in the Papal Study , but in the Vatican 's gardens .

Afterwards , Mr Bush will travel to France and the UK .

Technology has transformed the baby raising landscape in some ingenious ways .
Who knows ?
If the following three inventions had been available a few years ago my home office might today be covered in Disney motif wallpaper , and all the electrical outlets plugged up with child safety protectors .
Take United States patent 6068649 .
This patent is for a strap - on pacifier that loops around a baby 's ears and stays put .
With this device a parent could , theoretically , enjoy some real quiet time with baby .
Of course , babies will often cry even with a pacifier in their mouths .
In fact , this type of cry is the most disruptive to peace and quiet as it quickly escalates to the point where babies turn dark red and seemingly become hysterical .
But the patent 's strap - on feature does eliminate one major source of a baby 's crying - dropping ( or spitting out ) the pacifier and being unable to retrieve it .
Then there 's what I like to refer to as the Baby Wedge , or United States patent 5713090 .
The Baby Wedge is an " oval shaped domed structure featuring curved crossbars that are strong enough to support an adult 's weight . "
With this device baby can safely sleep in bed " wedged " between mommy and daddy free from fear of being rolled onto by sleep - deprived parents .
I especially love this device because of all its Freudian fun implications .
I mean the child is put in a cage by her parents whose physical presence is a constant threat to the infant .
Then there 's the image of the baby as a physical barrier to her sex - deprived parents when she is sleeping between them .
Oh , and do n't even get me started on the Oedipal implications of this thing !
Finally , for today 's overworked parents there United States patent 3552388 , the Baby Patting Machine .
The inventor of this device reasoned that " it is sometimes difficult for [ an ] infant to fall asleep , and the parent must resort to patting the baby to sleep by repeated pats upon the hind parts thereof . "
So , for parents who have to get up early the next morning to put in another 8 to 15 hours at the office in order to participate in the post - modern parenting experience , or for those parents who are , let 's be honest , not quick to put in the kind of time and effort it takes to help a restless baby fall asleep , the Baby Patting Machine 's mechanized arm offers the perfect solution .
With the Baby Patting Machine in place babies get the soft caresses they need , while parents find yet another source of endless guilt as they watch a crude robotic device do the job they signed on for , the one they suspect baby would prefer they perform instead .
So , there you have it , parenting in the Twenty - first century made easier , or at least weirder , thanks to the creative responses of a few inventors .

Looking for any more evidence that Senator Barack Obama is shifting from the primary to the general election ?
Check out where Mr. Obama is planning to campaign over the next two weeks .
On Wednesday , he is headed to Michigan – and not to Detroit but to Macomb County , which has long been synonymous with so - called Reagan Democrats .
Michigan is a state that aides to Senator John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , see as highly competitive , given the number of blue - collar workers there and Mr. Obama ’s difficulties in winning support from those voters in his contest with Senator Hilary Rodham Clinton .
In addition , Michigan is one of two states that held their primaries in defiance of Democratic Party rules , which meant that Mr. Obama did not campaign there , or build up an organization there .
And next week , Mr. Obama is spending three full days in the other state which held its primary in defiance of the Democratic Party – Florida .
( He is also going tomorrow to another general election state , Missouri ) .
Mr. Obama ’s aides were quick to say that no one should conclude from this that he is viewing his primary contest with Mrs. Clinton as completed : he is going to Oregon for two days this weekend .
But they left no doubt that they were concerned with the head - start Mr. McCain was getting and did n’t want to leave him unattended .
“ Our schedule reflects the fact that we are still fighting for votes and delegates in the remaining contests but also that we are going to places that are going to be competitive in the fall , ” said Bill Burton .
“ John McCain has gone unchallenged for far too long and we ’re going to make sure that voters in competitive states know the choice in this election between changing Washington and the third term of George Bush ’s failed policies that McCain is offering .
It ’s incredibly hard to get a social media community interested in a press release , and it ’s not because they hate hearing about what your company is up to , it ’s just that they hate the way you ’re telling the story .
Consider some of the approaches the average press release takes .
1. [ company / brand name ] announces [ product / service name ]
This press release is boring and will be considered spammy because it simply uses hyperbole to shamelessly promote a company ’s product or service .
2. [ company / brand name ] announces [ financial news ]
This press release announces that a company is merging with another , has gotten additional funding , etc .
And does n’t really add any value to the experience of the end user ( unless you ’re announcing something like the Google acquisition of You Tube )
3. [ company / brand name ] plans [ action ]
This press release announces that a company plans to do something , i.e. ‘ medical company plans to combat disease ’ .
While we ’re all for combating disease most social media users would appreciate it if you did it a little more quietly or make it more relevant .
4. [ company / brand name ] achieves [ accomplishment ]
This press release just pats its sponsor on the back by boasting what the company has achieved .
Sure , we ’re happy that you ’ve signed up your 100,000th user , but what do you want us to do about it ?
Why Regular Press Releases Fail in Social Media
Here are the 3 main reasons why a press release would normally have zero chance of success in social media :
1 . They have the wrong singular focus , which is on the company issuing the release .
2 . They are full of marketing - speak that inherently engenders mistrust in the eyes of the social media audience .
3 . They do n’t have a specific audience in mind , and are written broadly and presented blandly .
Now , it ’s perfectly fine to want to promote your company , because after all , we all have to make a living .
But the social - web audience does n’t like blatant sales and marketing speak .
How to Make it Work
If you look at Brian ’s article from last week , How to Get 6,312 Subscribers to Your Business Blog in One Day , it ’s not designed as a press release ( nor was it paid for by anyone ) .
Regardless , it accomplishes most of the functions of a good press release .
When I asked Brian about it , he said when he writes press releases , that ’s the way he does it .
It should be presented as a story that has value to readers first , because if it happens to be picked up by a journalist , you ’ve just made his job easier by presenting an angle .
That said , Brian told me he rarely bothers with press releases , because if done well , a well - written case study can do better in social media in terms of both exposure and SEO benefits .
Brian ’s article worked .
It got over 900 Diggs , and made Delicious Popular while attracting 30,000 unique visitors from outside the regular Copyblogger readership .
The reason it worked is because it was n’t directly trying to promote him or his client .
Rather this “ alternative ” press release announces a service and an accomplishment but ( this is important ) then goes on to create value by explaining what techniques were used to create that success , why these techniques work , and how the audience can replicate the results .
Strategies Used in the Alternative Press Release
The article follows all the advice Brian gives related to strong blogging : a sure - fire headline structure , a strong opening that uses an anecdote that paints a relatable picture , and content that utilizes all the laws of persuasive blogging .
But what I found brilliant was that the post is completely social media optimized .
1 . The headline is optimized for all three kinds of readers .
2 . The post is perfect for diagonal readers .
3 . The text formatting is attractive , unlike the bland press releases everywhere else .
4 . It ’s to the point .
There are no words wasted .
5 . It creates value by including a step - by - step methodology for others to follow .
This is an excellent example of how putting readers first can provide big rewards in social media , as opposed to spending $ 200 to issue a press release that no one reads .
Find a way to deliver value to people beyond your company news , and more people will take an interest in what you ’re doing .
In the past weeks , we have noticed an increased interest in Plasma Mobile from different sides .
Slowly , but surely , hardware vendors have discovered that Plasma Mobile is an entirely different software platform to build products on top of .
For people or companies who want to work or invest into Plasma Mobile , it ’s always useful to know where upstream is heading , so let me give an overview of what our plans are , what areas of work we ’re planning to tackle in the coming months and years , where our focus will be and how it will shift .
Let ’s talk about Plasma Mobile ’s roadmap .
Our development strategy is to build a basic system and platform around our core values first and then extend this .
Having a stable base of essentials allows us to focus on an achievable subset first and then extend functionality for more and more possible target groups .
It avoids pie - in - the - sky system engineering something that will never be useful and designed for a unicorn market that never existed .
Get the basics right first , then take it to the next levels .
These levels are :
Prototype ( already finished ) Feature Phone Basic Smartphone Featured Smartphone
Let ’s look at these steps in detail .
Prototype and Product Vision
The first public release of Plasma Mobile was this prototype .
It showed a very basic and incomplete - for - daily - use system on actual , modern smartphone hardware .
You could make phone calls , start and manage apps , and manipulate some basic system functionality .
It showed a smartphone system based on Plasma could be done , and more importantly , it taught us a lot about where we want to take things on a technical level .
Along with the prototype , we developed a product vision for Plasma Mobile , a direction where we want to take it ( emphasis added by yours truly ) :
“ Plasma Mobile aims to become a complete software system for mobile devices .
It is designed to give privacy - aware users back the full - control over their information and communication .
Plasma Mobile takes a pragmatic approach and is inclusive to 3rd party software , allowing the user to choose which applications and services to use .
It provides a seamless experience across multiple devices .
Plasma Mobile implements open standards and it is developed in a transparent process that is open for the community to participate in . ”
Feature Phone
The feature phone milestone is what we ’re working on right now .
This involves taking the prototype and fixing all the basic things to turn it into something usable .
Usable does n’t mean “ usable for everyone ” , but it should at least be workable for a subset of people that only rely on basic features — “ simple ” things .
Core features should work flawlessly once this milestone is achieved .
With core features , we ’re thinking along the lines of making phone calls , using the address book , manage hardware functions such as network connectivity , volume , screen , time , language , etc. .
Aside from these very core things for a phone , we want to provide decent integration with a webbrowser ( or provide our own ) , app store integration likely using store .
kde.org , so you can get apps on and off the device , taking photos , recording videos and watching these media .
Finally , we want to settle for an SDK which allows third party developers to build apps to run on Plasma Mobile devices .
Getting this to work is no small feat , but it allows us to receive real - world feedback and provide a stable base for third - party products .
It makes Plasma Mobile a viable target for future product development .
Basic Smartphone
The basic smartphone extends the feature set of Plasma Mobile to a wider group of target users .
The plan is to add personal information management features , such as reading and sending emails , calendaring and reminders .
We also want to add file management capabilities in this milestone , because we think that the user should be able to deal with the data in her phone in the most transparant way , and file management is something that allows users to look into the fabric of their data , and that of the phone itself .
Another big topic for the Basic Smartphone milestone is extending the app ecosystem through third - party and original applications to allow the user to do more things with the device .
Featured Smartphone
For the featured smartphone , we want to add more system - level integration features such as deeply integrated private cloud storage and have grown our own ecosystem with more apps and of course games .
An often requested feature is support for Android apps .
Supporting Android apps could give Plasma Mobile a huge boost in terms of possible target groups , since it allows users to switch away from Android more easily , even when they are requiring a few apps and can’t really live without these .
Being able to run Android apps on a Plasma Mobile device can ease the transition considerably and it allows us to capture potential target user groups that rely on proprietary services which Plasma Mobile , at first , cannot serve simply because as a smaller player , it ’s not an attractive enough platform to have the likes of Whats App develop native clients for .
When it ’s ready !?
On purpose , we did not add a specific timeline to this roadmap for two reasons : First , Plasma Mobile is a participative project , if you want to see something done , get involved .
We ’re not running the show all by ourselves .
We want to create an open eco system where people who do the work decide on its direction .
This means if you get involved , you can help us shape the future of mobile computing instead of being just a code monkey that does what someone else has decided .
Secondly , we do n’t want to deliver half - assed software just because we set a timeline .
We want to create quality software to build products upon .
If you or your company want to ship on a specific date , work with us and we ’ll plan together .
We wo n’t make promises when something is ready beforehand , but as an upstream project , we want to ship “ when it ’s ready ” .
This “ when ” depends on all our input and hard work .
So do n’t sit in your armchairs and wait for someone else to do the heavy lifting , but let ’s get cracking !
A group of private eyes who applied spyware to industrial espionage have been jailed in Israel , in the latest twist to a long - running high - profile investigation .
Four members of the Israeli Modi'in Ezrahi private investigation firm were sentenced on Monday after they were found guilty of using Trojan malware to steal commercially sensitive information from their clients ' competitors .
The Trojan , written and marketed by London - based couple Michael and Ruth Haephrati , was reportedly used to spy on a variety of organisations including the HOT cable television group and a PR agency whose clients include Israel 's second biggest mobile operator , Partner Communications .
Asaf Zlotovsky , a manager at the Modi'in Ezrahi detective firm , was jailed for 19 months .
Two other employees , Haim Zissman and Ron Barhoum , were sent to prison for 18 and nine months respectively .
The firm 's former chief exec , Yitzhak Rett , the victim of an apparent accident when he fell down a stairwell during a break in police questioning back in 2005 , escaped a jail sentence under a plea bargaining agreement .
Rett was fined 250,000 Israeli Shekels ( £ 36,500 ) and ordered to serve ten months ' probation over his involvement in the scam .
Three other defendants were heavily fined and their licences as private investigators were revoked by a Tel Aviv court , The Jerusalem Post reports .
Michael Haephrati , who honed his computer skills during three years ' military service in the Israeli army , and his wife Ruth were fined and sentenced to jail by an Israeli court for their involvement in the case back in 2006 .
Michael was jailed for two years and his wife for four years after pleading guilty to the scam , and following their extradition from the UK in January 2006 .
Modi'in Ezrahi is the largest of three private investigation firms implicated in the case .
The case against Modi'in Ezrahi is the first to reach its conclusion .
It 's unclear whether or not further prosecutions against the two other detective agencies , Krochmal Special Investigations and Pelosoff - Balali , are likely to follow .
Graham Cluley , senior technology consultant at Sophos , said that social engineering tactics specific to individual victims were used to infect PCs .
Infected CDs were sent through the post to prospective marks , he added .
Cluley notes that the case illustrates the importance of firms hiring private investigators to seek assurances that they will refrain from behaving unethically or illegally .
" Most detective agencies would probably balk at the thought of breaking into a company 's offices to spy on them , but maybe some feel it is more acceptable to do the spying through malware ?
A strong message needs to be sent that using spyware to gain competitive advantage over competitors is not only unacceptable , it 's against the law , " Cluley told El Reg .
The identity of the spyware used in the case is unknown , but earlier reports suggest the Trojan was originally used to spy on Israeli thriller writer Amnon Jackont , the husband of Michael Haephrati 's ex-partner , radio show hostess Varda Raziel - Jackont .
Jackont 's discovery of a Trojan on his PC led to a police investigation that eventually led back to the Haephratis and a much larger plot .
More background on the genesis of the case can be found in a New York Times story here .
There 's a full rundown of the runners and riders in a Globe story here . ®

President Bush Bashes Jessica Simpson
One would have to wonder ifcomes up with his own punch lines or if someone is writing them for him .
Either way , in bad taste , the President joked that he wanted to send the " Jessica jinx " to this summer 's Democratic National Convention in Denver .
What the heck was he thinking ?
Neither Jessica Simpson nor boyfriend Dallas Cowboy quarterback Tony Romo have responded to Bush 's comment .
Jessica got a lot of crap when she showed up at one of Tony 's games and most consider it the worst game of Romo 's career .
Actually , Bush made his jinx comments in front of members of the Super Bowl - winning New York Giants when they visited the White House recently so it is likely it was right off the cuff .
One celebrity who did chime in on the cut was Dixie Chicks singer Natalie Maines , who has had her share of tension with the President .
Maines even went as far as to write a song about her run in with W entitled Shut Up and Sing .
When Natalie was asked what she thought Jessica should do about the presidential slam , she recommended that Simpson should " pick back . "
Not so fast Jessica .
Before you heed her advice , remember that Natalie barely escaped with her career after her loose lips fiasco .
What do you think Jessica should do ?
Leave us a comment and let us know .
( CNN ) -- Grainy video footage released by the U.S. military may not provide a complete picture of what happened in an airstrike that Pakistan says killed 11 of its soldiers , the Pentagon conceded Thursday .
The U.S. military says the grainy footage shows how its airstrikes targeted fighters engaged with coalition forces .
The U.S. military says the aerial footage , taken from an unmanned drone , depicts a Tuesday attack on guerrilla fighters who were battling coalition troops along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border .
An after - the - fact narration repeatedly notes that there are no military structures or outposts within the impact area , and says seven " anti-Afghan forces " were killed on a mountain ridge by precision - guided bombs .
But a U.S. Air Force document indicates bombs were dropped on buildings near the border , and Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman conceded there may have been another strike that occurred outside the view of the drone 's camera .
The Air Force 's official summary of combat action for Tuesday reports that a B - 1 bomber and two F - 15 fighter - bombers dropped laser - and satellite - guided bombs on " anti-coalition members in the open and in buildings in the vicinity of Asadabad . "
Watch footage from the drone of the U.S. airstrike »
Pakistan 's military said its troops were killed at a Frontier Corps outpost near the border town of Gora Prai , and that the outpost was destroyed in the strike .
Islamabad called it a " completely unprovoked and cowardly act , " and the Pakistani government -- a key ally in the U.S. - led war on terrorism -- summoned U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson to protest the matter .
The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad later released a statement expressing regret over the incident .
The Pentagon said the incident remains under investigation , and could not say whether additional videos would be released .
A U.S. official with knowledge of the reports told CNN that the airstrike targeted suspected militants who had fled into Pakistan after conducting an ambush on the Afghan side of the border .
The official said Pakistani military officials worked with the U.S. forces to track the militants as they fled across the border into Pakistan , and the mission was permitted under the rules of engagement , which allow " hot pursuit " across the border of suspected militants when locations are verified .
At a Pentagon news briefing on Wednesday , spokesman Geoff Morrell was grilled about the airstrike and the reported Pakistani military deaths .
He stressed that " every indication we have at this point is that this was , indeed , a legitimate strike in defense of our forces after they came under attack . "
But Pakistan 's military had a much different account of what happened .
The top spokesman for the Pakistan army , Gen. Athar Abbas , told CNN that the airstrike happened after U.S. forces were called in by Afghan troops who had engaged in a border clash with Taliban forces .
The Taliban forces fired on the Afghan troops as they tried to set up a checkpoint in a disputed area along the Afghan - Pakistan border , Abbas said .
The Afghan troops then called for help from the U.S. - led coalition forces , which carried out an airstrike on positions where Pakistani frontier corps forces were stationed , Abbas added .
Abbas said the airstrike killed 11 Pakistani soldiers , including a high - ranking major , and wounded seven others .
All About Afghanistan • Pakistan • NATO • Afghanistan War
The drug war is responsible for trillions of wasted tax dollars and misallocated government spending , as well as devastating human costs that far outweigh the damage caused by drugs alone .
The United States ’ unrivaled incarceration rate is a constant financial drain , causing an immeasurable loss in workforce productivity , and puts a strain on scant legal and law enforcement resources .
DPA is working to end wasteful government spending on the drug war by leading the national dialogue about ending prohibition and refocusing resources on health - centered approaches to drug use .
Key Economic Issues
Wasted Tax Dollars
Over the past four decades , federal and state governments have poured over $ 1 trillion the drug war and relied on taxpayers to foot the bill .
Unfortunately , these tax dollars have n’t solved the problems they were intended to solve – while creating a whole new set of huge problems .
Here are some of the fiscal costs of the war on drugs :
In 1980 , the United States had 50,000 people behind bars for drug law violations – now we have half a million .
More than one million people are arrested simply for drug possession in the U.S. every year – that ’s one arrest every 25 seconds .
Money funneled into drug enforcement has meant less funding to improve public safety and has left essential education , health , social service and public safety programs struggling to operate on meager funding .
Drug war advocates continue to demand more money for the same failed policies despite the fact that highly - funded law enforcement and interdiction strategies have failed to reduce drug use and drug availability .
They want to keep wasting your tax dollars and destroying countless lives on a losing battle .
The demand for drugs in the United States has remained constant despite the United States ’ enormous financial commitment to fighting the war on drugs with well - equipped drug taskforces and the full force of mass incarceration .
The drug war has created enormous public health costs by limiting the availability of harm reduction programs that could quell overdose and infectious disease transmission rates .
Just as disheartening as the fiscal costs of fighting a failed drug war are the opportunity costs .
Think of the impact all that drug war funding could have if instead of financing the arrest and incarceration of millions of people each year , we made drug treatment more widely available , improved social service and education programs , or simply gave the money back to taxpayers .
Distorted Incentives for Law Enforcement
Ever wonder why police spend so much time enforcing failed drug laws ?
To find the answer , you just need to follow the money .
Funding schemes – Because funding for law enforcement is often based on the number of arrests made and the amount of property seized , the easiest way for local police to up their numbers and boost their careers is to target low - level drug offenders .
To create arrest opportunities , police routinely rely on untrustworthy informants , conduct dangerous home invasions on flimsy evidence , frame suspects , and commit perjury .

To create arrest opportunities , police routinely rely on untrustworthy informants , conduct dangerous home invasions on flimsy evidence , frame suspects , and commit perjury .
Asset forfeiture laws –
These laws allow law enforcement agencies to keep the property they seize during drug arrests with minimal proof , putting the burden instead on suspects to prove their own innocence .
As a result , local law enforcement agencies tend to increase their focus on drug arrests , often at the expense of more pressing public safety needs .

The Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program –
This program provides federal funding to hundreds of regional anti-drug taskforces .
These taskforces are at the center of numerous scandals involving falsified government records , witness tampering , fabricated evidence , false imprisonment , stolen property , large - scale racial profiling and sexual abuse .
Supply and Demand
A prime example of the drug war ’s backward logic is its distortion of the basic economic principle of supply and demand .
The federal government funnels vast resources into futile criminal justice and interdiction policies intended to reduce the supply of drugs , while neglecting treatment and education strategies that could help reduce drug demand .
This focus on supply reduction has failed to reduce drug use , while provoking drug trade - related violence .
The economic incentives of the illegal drug trade ensure that supply - side interdiction is an unwinnable battle .
Education and treatment programs are exponentially more cost - effective and successful when it comes to addressing problematic substance use .
Internationally , the hypocrisy of American drug policy is clear .
Despite being the largest consumer of drugs in the world , the U.S. focuses on violent supply reduction strategies in other countries while investing little in demand reduction strategies domestically .
Drug prohibition essentially provides a monopoly and price supports for organized crime .
Forcibly limiting the supply of drugs while demand remains relatively constant only increases the profitability of drug trafficking .
Drug Prohibition and Violence
Drug enforcement officials often cite drug - related violence as a reason that drugs must be eliminated from our society , but it is actually the system of drug prohibition that causes much of the violence .
Just as alcohol Prohibition fostered organized crime in the 1920s , drug prohibition empowers a dangerous illegal market throughout the United States and the world .
Prohibition has inflated the price , and thus the profit , of drugs substantially .
It has also driven the drug trade underground , where there are no legal avenues for peacefully resolving disputes between competitors .
Rather than proposing specific policies for increasing prevention and treatment services to directly impact drug use in the United States , the federal government 's approach to the alarming prohibition - related violence in countries like Mexico and Colombia has been to pour more money into law enforcement crackdowns on cartels and efforts to intercept drug shipments .
Throughout the drug war 's history , these kinds of supply - side interventions have consistently failed to reduce violence .
They have instead made the illicit drug market more profitable , more competitive and more dangerous .
In countries that bear the brunt of drug war violence , such as Mexico , Bolivia and Colombia , prominent leaders are speaking up more and more about the benefits of ending prohibition .
We believe ending drug prohibition is the key to reducing drug war violence in the U.S. and restoring peace to destabilized regions abroad .
Our Priorities
The Drug Policy Alliance is working to shift funding away from the same old failed policies and toward effective drug treatment and education programs .
We are leading the movement to end prohibition ’s drain on our economy and to protect your tax dollars from wasteful drug war spending .
We advocate for ending prohibition and treating drug use as a health issue , not a criminal justice issue .
As a nation , we must learn to live with the reality of drugs and drug use and find solutions based on common sense and sound economic principles .
Here are some examples of our work :
This photo and caption released by Survival International on May 29 , 2008 , caused a stir : Uncontacted Indians in Brazil seen from the air , May 2008 © Gleison Miranda / FUNAI
Recent photos of an " uncontacted tribe " of Indians near the Brazil - Peru border have sparked media reports of a hoax , but the organization that released the images defends its claims and actions .
The photographs , which showed men painted red and black and aiming arrows skyward , were released in late May by Survival International , a London - based organization that advocates for tribal people worldwide .
The release stated that " members of one of the world 's last uncontacted tribes have been spotted and photographed from the air , " and quoted the Brazilian government photographer saying , " there are some who doubt [ the tribe 's ] existence " as justification for flying over the site and taking the pictures .
Some of the media published the images at the time with stories saying the tribe previously had been " lost . "
In fact , a LiveScience column stated that the tribe had " escaped discovery " until the new photos came out .
This week , suspicions about the organization 's motivations and the authenticity of the scene were raised .
On June 22 , The Observer , a London - based newspaper , ran a story , " Secret of the ' lost ' tribe that was n't , " saying that the tribe 's existence " has been noted since 1910 . "
A succession of other stories followed on the Web , claiming that reports of the tribe 's discovery were a hoax .
No hoax
Today , Survival International released a statement to try to clarify things , including : " The story is not a hoax , and none of those involved in working to protect these Indians ' rights have ever claimed they were ' undiscovered . ' "
Survival never claimed that the tribe was lost .
The story got out of control , says Fiona Watson , Survival 's Brazil expert , as a result of irresponsible reporting .
" Some of the media got very carried away and started talking about undiscovered tribes , " Watson told LiveScience .
" There was this interpretation that this was a completely new tribe , completely undiscovered , without bothering to check with sources .
Neither the Brazilian government nor Survival has ever used that word , and ' uncontacted ' means they do n't have any contact with outsiders . "
Survival International 's
Web site includes a page about " uncontacted tribes , " here , which states that more than 100 uncontacted tribes are known worldwide , with more than half living in either Brazil or Peru .
These tribes , " whilst not ' lost , ' simply reject contact with the outside world , " according to Survival 's statement today .
Survival campaigns to protect the tribes ' land .
The recently photographed tribe might have had contact with neighboring tribal groups , Watson said , adding , " We do n't know .
They almost certainly know about the outside world .
We mean ' having no physical contact , ' living in a very isolated way in the Amazon . "
" Flying over in an airplane does n't constitute contact , " she said .
The Observer journalist failed to do his homework , Watson said .
If he had , " he would have seen that we 've been talking about the existence of the tribe for some time now .
Of course we know they are there , but there has been no contact , " Watson said .
Respecting rights
Watson agreed that the Brazilian government has known about the tribe since 1910 , and said the government has had a policy of no contact with the tribe since 1988 in an effort to protect them from illnesses .
" It 's about respecting their rights to live their lives as they want to , letting them get on with their lives , " she said .
" In 20 years , they may decide they do want to come out of the forest , but that 's for them to decide .
It 's about protecting the land and letting them live as they wish to . "
The photos were taken to prove to the Peruvian government that the Brazilian tribe exists because there have been challenges controlling illegal logging near the border and the logging might be pushing Peruvian tribes into Brazil and into conflict over resources with Brazilian tribes , Watson said .
The photos have had a positive effect already , she said .
The Peruvian government has since " formed a commission of experts to look into the illegal logging and into the status of the uncontacted groups on the Peru side , " Watson said .
And would Survival International do anything differently with the recent photo campaign , if they had it to do over ?
" Nope , " said Survival 's Miriam Ross .

Secret Bilderberg Agenda To Microchip Americans
Elitists want to microchip Americans in name of fighting terrorism , Europeans universally opposed to attack on Iran , Globalists fear oil prices rising too quickly
Paul Joseph Watson

Sources from inside the 2008 Bilderberg meeting have leaked the details of what elitists were discussing in Chantilly Virginia last week and the talking points were ominous - a plan to microchip Americans under the pretext of fighting terrorist groups which will be identified as blonde haired , blue eyed westerners .
Veteran Bilderberg sleuth Jim Tucker relies on sources who regularly attend Bilderberg as aides and assistants but who are not Bilderberg members themselves .
The information they provided this year is bone - chilling for those who have tracked the development of the plan to make the general public consider implanted microchips as a convenience as routine as credit cards .
" Under the heading of resisting terrorism there were points made about how the terrorist organizations are recruiting people who do not look like terrorists - blonde , blue eyed boys - they 're searching hard for those types to become the new mad bombers , " said Tucker .
As we have documented , the blue eyed blonde haired Al - Qaeda line is a familiar talking point that has been pushed on Fox News and within other Neo - Con circles in an attempt to turn the anti-terror apparatus around to target dissidents , protesters and the American people in general .
Ominously , Tucker 's source also told him that Bilderberg were discussing the microchipping of humans on a mass scale , which would be introduced under the pretext of fighting terrorism whereby the " good guys " would be allowed to travel freely from airports so long as their microchip could be scanned and the information stored in a database .
Tucker said the idea was also sold on the basis that it would help hospital staff treat a patient in an emergency situation because a scan of the chip would provide instantaneous access to health details .
Tucker underscored that Bilderberg were talking about subdermally implanted chips and not merely RFID chips contained in clothing .
The discussion took place in a main conference hall and was part of the agenda , not an off - hand remark in the hotel bar .
Such a bizarre concept may seem unbelievable to some , but over the last ten years there have been dozens of examples of people accepting implanted chips for a variety of different reasons .
In 2004 , Mexico 's attorney general and 160 of his office staff were implanted with tracker chips to control access to to secure areas of their headquarters .
The Baja Beach Club in Barcelona and other nightclubs around the world are already offering implantable chips to customers who want to pay for drinks with the wave of a hand and also get access to VIP areas of the club lounge .
Bilderberg skeptical of attack on Iran Tucker 's source told him that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates did attend Bilderberg despite him not appearing on the official list .
Tucker said that his sources told him Gates was in attendance to present his case for war with Iran , but that the majority of Bilderberg members were against an attack at this time .
" The Europeans were generally opposed to an invasion of Iran - Gates made the regular war propaganda drill about how Iran is a nuclear threat to everybody , " said Tucker , adding that European Bilderbergers made snide comments about where such nuclear weapons actually were being kept and at one point joking that they were possibly " in Saddam Hussein 's tomb " .
Despite Bilderberg opposition , Tucker said that the administration was still considering an attack before Bush leaves office in January .
" At least 90 per cent of the Europeans oppose a war , probably closer to 100 per cent , " said Tucker , adding , " most of the Americans were passive and deferential to the Secretary of Defense and Condoleezza Rice 's pitch in so far as Iran is concerned " .
Tucker said that most Americans present at the meeting were opposed to attacking Iran but dare not be as visible and loud in their opposition as the Europeans .
Energy and oil prices
" One of the Bilderberg boys raised this question - should we put a lid on the rise in oil prices , are we reaching the point of diminishing returns , " said Tucker , adding that Bilderberg noted how Americans were trading in their SUV's in record numbers for small and more fuel efficient cars and using more public transport to combat high gas prices .
Tucker 's source said that Bilderberg were predicting $ 5 for a gallon of gas by the end of this summer and oil over $ 150 dollars a barrel , but that this was a ceiling and oil prices would probably begin to decline thereafter because they thought the acceleration had happened too quickly .
As we previously reported , Bilderberg called for oil prices to soar in 2005 when oil was a mere $ 40 a barrel .
During the conference in Germany , Henry Kissinger told his fellow attendees that the elite had resolved to ensure that oil prices would double over the course of the next 12 - 24 months , which is exactly what happened .
During their 2006 meeting in Ottawa Canada , Bilderberg agreed to push for $ 105 a barrel before the end of 2008 .
With that target having been smashed months ago , the acceleration towards $ 150 is outstripping even Bilderberg 's goal , which is why the elitists expressed a desire to cool prices at least in the short term .
Just two days after he left Bilderberg , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , George W. Bush and others expressed support for a strong dollar and Bernanke hinted that interest rates could rise , which immediately caused oil prices to drop in line with Bilderberg 's consensus .
On March 5 , 2005 , during a Bilderberg meeting at the isolated Dorint Sofitel Seehotel Ueberfahrt in Rottach - Egern in Germany , Rockefeller stated : “ It would have been quite impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years .
But , the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government .
The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries . ”
British economist Will Hutton was spot on when he declared Bilderberg to be “ the backdrop against which policy is made worldwide ” and these policies are expected to be later implemented at G - 8 meetings , and those of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank .
Asia Times journalist Pepe Escobar has noted : “ Whenever corporate media approaches Bilderberg it mirrors the silence of the lambs . ”
It is a deafening silence over at the New York Times , the Baltimore Sun , the Chicago Tribune , and yes the Washington Post , your article notwithstanding .
In fact , I am a bit surprised Slate , a wholly owned subsidiary of the Washington Post , posted your article .
But then the corporate media is boxed in a corner now that the Bilderberg confabs increasingly draw attention , never mind the former silence of corporate media lambs .
Finally , it is interesting your article , essentially a hit piece directed against Bilderberg critics , appeared at approximately the same time the Bilderberg press release and participant list appeared .
Publishing the press release and the list is a first for the Bilderbergers .
It is a defensive move , obviously designed to silence , however feebly , the critics .
It will not work , however .
The official participant list reveals no shortage of Americans , from Fed boss Ben Bernanke to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
May I suggest this list be used to round up those in violation of the Logan Act ?
Of course , that would also include your boss , Donald E Graham , who has no right to discuss the future of U.S. sovereignty in private .

Bilderberg Special on the History Channel
Body :
The Bilderberg Group is openly and admittedly FOR a global government , a true conspiracy .
Here is a short special on the History Channel .
Watch this and ask yourself just how made up these " conspiracy theories " really are .
Think critically for yourself and make your own decision just how far down the rabbit hole you want to go or how far up in the clouds of ignorance you want to stay .
It 's always your choice .

Re : http://www.slate.com/id/2193220/pagenum/all/#page_start
Jack , I work for Alex Jones .
Please allow me to state for the record I believe your Bilderberg article is bunk .
Of course the corporate media , on occasion , reports the comings and goings and when they can — dare I say , when they are permitted — the grist of Bilderberg meetings .
You miss the point .
It is not so much that there is a partial blackout surrounding these events , but rather what is discussed at the meetings is rarely if ever reported .
Adam Smith wrote back in the day , “ People of the same trade seldom meet together , even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public . ”
Same applies to the Bilderbergers .
But then I imagine you likely consider this in the province of tinfoil hat stuff , especially considering who writes your paycheck .
Daniel Estulin and Jim Tucker
May I suggest you plunk an addendum on your article after you read Daniel Estulin ’s The True Story of the Bilderberg Group ?
After reading this book , you may actually feel a tinge of embarrassment over the naivety of your article .
In this book , Mr. Estulin names plenty of corporate media people who attend this annual confab .
No wonder so few corporate media outlets report seriously on Bilderberg , including Slate , owned by the Washington Post .
But then the naivety may be on my side , as corporate media writers have a tendency not to experience embarrassment , let alone shame .
But then maybe I am a bit too judgmental .
Not sure if you know , but your boss , Donald E. Graham , was on the Bilderberg participation list this year .
Now that fact sheds a bit of light on your article .
As well , a representative of Microsoft , the multinational corporation that created Slate , was at the meeting .
No sense biting that hand that feeds , I suppose .
Finally , I find your article insulting due to the fact Alex Jones and his media team were harassed and threatened while attempting to cover the Bilderberg confab in Chantilly .
His wife received a threatening telephone call .
I wonder how many effete Washington Post writers would have put up with that for more than five minutes , let alone three days .
Dare I say none ?

Jack Shafer ’s response
Kurt ,
Thanks for your note .
Donald E. Graham , CEO of the Washington Post Company .
Mr. Graham violated the Logan
Act this past week .
I included Don Graham ’s name of those have attended Bilderberg in my article and am aware that many journalists have attended the conference .
Sorry to hear that the Jones team was harassed and his wife received a threatening phone call .
That is inexcusable .
All that said , what evidence do we have that the Bilderberg conference is nefarious ?
Do you take the Logan Act accusations seriously ?
Regards ,
Jack
—
Jack , I do take the Logan Act violations seriously .
Logan specifically addresses the Constitution , Article .
II , Section 2 , that states the President “ shall have Power , by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate , to make Treaties , provided two thirds of the Senators present concur . ”
The Logan Act expands on this by stating that any citizen of the United States “ who , without authority of the United States , directly or indirectly commences or carries on any correspondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer or agent thereof , with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer or agent thereof , in relation to any disputes or controversies with the United States , or to defeat the measures of the United States , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years , or both . ”
All Americans in attendance this past week at the Bilderberg conference in Chantilly , Virginia , are in violation of the Logan Act .
I ’d have to say those who believe kings , queens , princes , chancellors , prime ministers , presidents , ambassadors , secretaries of state , Wall Street investors , international bankers , news media executives , CEOs of transnational corporations , et al , get together annually to simply and idly engage in informal discussion without seeking to “ reach a consensus on the big issues , ” as Bilderberg founder and former British Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey once put it , are naive in extremis .
Of course the members of Bilderberg wish to reach a consensus .
And what is that consensus ?
Nothing less than the establishment of a world government .
Again , may I suggest you read Daniel Estulin ’s The True Story of the Bilderberg Club ?
This book was named Non-fiction Book of the Year in Canada by the The Kingston Eye Opener and became an international bestseller .
It details who the Bilderbergers are and their global agenda .
The late Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands , a former member of the Nazi SS and founder of the Bilderberg .
Bilderberg founder Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands , a former member of the Nazi SS , has said : “ It is difficult to re-educate people who have been brought up on nationalism to the idea of relinquishing part of their sovereignty to a supranational body . ”
Bernhard ’s daughter , Queen Beatrix , now carries this message and mission to Bilderberg meetings .
Denis Healey , mentioned above , has said : “ World events do not occur by accident .
They are made to happen , whether it is to do with national issues or commerce ; and most of them are staged and managed by those who hold the purse strings . ”
David Rockefeller , a consistent member of the Bilderberg steering committee and unabashed globalist , wrote in his memoir : “ Some even believe we are a part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States , characterizing my family and me as ‘ internationalists ’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure — one world , if you will .
If that ’s the charge , I stand guilty and I am proud of it . ”
Is it possible , when kings , sheiks and presidents visit Rockefeller at his vast family estate at Pocantico , they are engaged in idle chatter ?
Or are they discussing Rockefeller ’s lifelong passion , the establishment of a world government ?
On March 5 , 2005 , during a Bilderberg meeting at the isolated Dorint Sofitel Seehotel Ueberfahrt in Rottach - Egern in Germany , Rockefeller stated : “ It would have been quite impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected to the lights of publicity during those years .
But , the world is more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a world government .
The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national autodetermination practiced in past centuries . ”
British economist Will Hutton was spot on when he declared Bilderberg to be “ the backdrop against which policy is made worldwide ” and these policies are expected to be later implemented at G - 8 meetings , and those of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank .
Asia Times journalist Pepe Escobar has noted : “ Whenever corporate media approaches Bilderberg it mirrors the silence of the lambs . ”

Education without Activism is mute !
Yes the Bilderbergers want to chip you but they need something more a Data Base that will make the system work .
The elite have always hid projects in the budgets of other government agencies .
The Data Base that is needed to make micro-chipping work is being funded in the Agricultural Budget it ’s called the National Animal ID System ( NAIS ) .
NAIS is using your 911 home addresses as your Premises ID number .
Not a Farm number but your Home address .
That means everyone with a 911 number can be part of the Data Base even if you ’re not a farmer .
The NAIS is being designed to track the Birth , Death and movement including the buying and selling of 300 million animals .
If they can track 300 million animals they can track 300 million people .
Alex is doing all that he can do but even the efforts of Alex sometimes falls short .
Alex is educating people but we need activism .
The Farm Bureau is the main supporter of NAIS if we Boycott the Farm Bureau we can affect NAIS plus we can affect Illegal Amnesty Programs and GMO foods .
The Farm Bureau is an Insurance company only 23 % of their clients Nation wide are Farmers that means a Boycott can and will be affective .
Please help me encourage Alex to support a Boycott of Farm Bureau but also help spread the word contact the Farm Bureau at http://www.fb.org or call 202-406-3600 and tell them you do not want NAIS in any form .
Contact your local Farm Bureau and tell them No NAIS in any form .
They are trying to pass NAIS at the state levels by calling it a voluntary program but its not .
Alex Please support a Boycott of NAIS and stop Bilderberg in their tracks .

Mrs. P Says :
Excellent Article !
Nice Response !
With regard to chipping , Read Farm Journals - especially Rural Heritage - http://www.ruralheritage.com.
They have had some excellent articles .
Including one about some Austrailians who fought chipping with creative measures .
The journals will also introduce you to new language like “ kill zones ” where animals get killed in a 10 mile radius if disease is suspected .
The problem is , of course , the disease is sometimes brought in a vile to the farm and the farm owner is told that the sample was found in his or her animal .
This method was used to reduce small farms in England .
Alex needs people with PhD ’s on his team .
The methods used for forcing farmers to participate in a “ voluntary ” program are strung in an intellectual web of logic set up to stop any alternative outcome other than what is desired .
In other words , farm owners have discovered that to comply with certain laws , they must register their farms .
To register their farms , they must agree to chip their animals .
( Get this .. including chickens - now there ’s a job ) .
Those who built this new system have set it up so farmers can’t obtain any goods or services from the community to keep their farm going without going through a kind of “ filter ” that demands chipping .
If this gets transferred to people , then this is the method that will be used to chip people .
They will not be able to obtain any goods or services unless the “ volunteer ” to be chipped .
Fighting this type of arrangement requires much more than mere protests with video cameras and signs .

Area 51 Microbiologist Ready to Talk
Dr. Dan Burisch , who is in lock - down , working with the Lotus project , seeks immunity to stand before a Congressional hearing or other appropriate public body , to disclose his first - hand knowledge , with proof , of U.S. government involvement in designer viruses and other black - ops .
LAS VEGAS , NV USA ( PRWEB ) April 8 2004 — Dr. Dan Burisch has first - hand knowledge of the U.S. government ’s involvement in funding the creation of designer viruses for use in biowarfare and other applications .
He is also intimately privy to other covert operations that violate normal standards of human ethics .
Because such involvement could implicate him for war crimes charges , he requests full immunity before making such disclosure .
The terms of his agreement prohibit that he should specifically request such an appointment for disclosure .
He has stated that if subpoenaed he will disclose what he knows , answering specific questions directly .
By splicing together components of various organisms , microbiologists today are able to create new living organism with specific outcomes , both in terms of target as well as resulting disease .
Burisch stated that microbiologists have a way of encoding their “ signature ” into the designer DNA they create , whether in short sequences or those long enough to encode an entire virus .
As a possible scenario , for example , the signature could be comprised of a short segment of base - pairs that bear the microbiologists mark in such a way that other microbiologists can see the signature and readily identify it .
Because Burisch does not yet have such disclosure immunity granted , he spoke hypothetically , saying that if there were a microbiologist involved in such activities , that the microbiologist could place his signature on the resulting organism , unbeknownst to those authorizing the project .
That signature could then be called forth from all progeny organisms as evidence of the laboratory origin of the organism , and of the exact microbiologist who created the organism .
This would then provide unambiguous proof more telling than finger prints in a crime scene .
In this case , such finger prints are placed there intentionally with the intent of providing retrospective proof of the deed .
Burisch would also like to press for disclosure of other matters of which he has first - hand knowledge and evidence .
The revealing of his signature will also prove that Burisch is indeed a Ph.D. level microbiologist — a title that was erased when he was inducted into his present covert operation .
That erasure was so complete that one could hardly find evidence that Danny B Catselas Burisch ever lived if it were not for the Internet and private sharing of documents of evidence .
Catselas was his father ’s last name .
He had his name legally changed to Burisch with a recent marriage to a woman by that last name , who is also a principal in the covert operations .
He is presently working on the Lotus project at Area 51 north of Las Vegas , in a secret extra - budget operation under the umbrella direction of a non-elected shadow international governing body that has covert ties to the U.S. government and with extra-terrestrials .
The Lotus project involves studies of what is called a “ Ganesh particle ” which is capable of repairing damages cells .
The Ganesh particle itself , which gives off light , has characteristics of being a living intelligence .
Burisch has witnessed an extra- terrestrial being first - hand at Area 51 .
That exposure included touch , probing , measuring body function , communication via hand signals .
Burisch is witness to human subjects being held against their will for experimentation per covert treaties between the U.S. government and extra-terrestrial governing bodies .
The treaty , called Tau - IX , allows for abduction , removal of blood and reproductive samples and tissue ; and does not control whether humans are maimed , tortured or that they might expire .
Burisch does not believe that these activities should be held back from the knowledge of the American and International lay community .
His desire for disclosure is shared by others of his colleagues .
There are even those among the directorate who are helping to leak information from inside the covert operations out into public domain .
A primary vector for this disclosure has been taking place on an unmoderated forum at godlikeproducions.com under a thread about Dan Burisch that is now in its fifth volume , with over 10,000 posts in all .
There , those on the “ inside ” of the covert operations , who are defecting against their obligations to non-disclosure , post information to the forum where it is openly analyzed for authenticity and catalogued .
This forum thread commenced approximately six months ago and recently had been losing momentum due to lack of concrete information .
Even with the occasional patch in to Burisch with a web cam , there was no way to prove that the web cam footage was not taken at a prior date .
Those on the forum were not even sure Burisch was actually alive , and that it was him that they were conversing with on these privileged disclosures on rare occasion .
As someone in the know has watched this process , he recently decided to actually let two people from the “ outside ” have an in - person meeting with Dr. Dan Burisch .
Per a request made by a major forum participant , Harry Dschaak ( forum name : harrdrawk ) , an invitation was extended for him and write - in U.S. Presidential Candidate , Sterling D. Allan ( forum name : wallrace ) , to have an in - person meeting with Burisch .
A first attempt was made on April 3 .
The meeting was to have taken place in front of the UNLV campus Leid library at 10:00 am .
The two outsiders were coming in under the cover of being inside directorate .
This cover was exposed prior to the meeting when it was determined by security that there were no inside directorate coming into Vegas on the day appointed .
A second and successful attempt took place two days later at another location , where a window of one hour stretched into three as the two outsiders identified themselves with a pass code that only could have been given them from someone trusted on the inside .
On the following day , Allan reported on that encounter with a post to the GLP forum .
That was then followed up the next day , April 7 , with a leaked message in which Dan Burisch responded point - by - point to Allan ’s report , as requested by an individual named “ J1 ( Majesty / Directorate PD/ SF , Washington , D.C. ) ” .
The leaking of that document constitutes perhaps the most unambiguous source of information regarding this covert operation that has yet been obtained .
Within minutes of that post being made , the forum went down .
But those who intimately watch the forum immediately got on the phone with each other and made a copy of the relevant page and circulated it among their mailing lists .
When asked if this is the biggest development since the forum thread commenced six months ago , Dschaak , Allan ’s running mate , replied , “ No , this is the biggest thing to happen since the JFK assassination .
We are on the verge of alien disclosure — something we have been seeking for decades . ”
Dschaak is in process of assembling a brief list of questions that should be posed to Burisch in a hearing .
Over the past six months , GLP has accumulated a list of key questions to ask based on the intelligence they have been gathering .

Let me clearly state that I ’m on Alex ’s side here , but let me just remind Kurt to keep it pointed toward the actors rather than the players .
The tone of this bothered me :
“ His wife received a threatening telephone call .
I wonder how many effete Washington Post writers would have put up with that for more than five minutes , let alone three days .
Dare I say none ? ”
Yeah , she got a phone call .
Sucks , but maybe you ’d rather follow Carol Guzy into Haiti or Matabeleland .
It sounds to me like Jack is looking for guidance on how to cover this , and you can help .
Corporations may try to stifle it , but I promise you the journalist on the street would LOVE to blow Bilderberg wide open .
I hope you both are able to turn this into a path for journalists to get to the bottom of it , not point fingers .
Give journalists links , show them where to look , who to talk to .
Give them a FAQ , and short bullets that they all should know for interviews .

Big Shots Jump at Bilderberg ’s Oil Orders
By James P. Tucker Jr.
Powerful world leaders ran like dogs to the whistle to champion Bilderberg ’s decree ( AFP June 23 , 2008 ) to put a lid on surging oil prices .
Meanwhile , Bilderberg ’s world government project suffered another severe setback when Irish voters killed the latest version of the European Constitution .
Just three days after Bilderberg concluded its annual secret meeting , on June 11 , a top energy bureaucrat said average gasoline prices would likely peak at $ 4.35 a gallon , contradicting previous predictions that the costs would soon exceed $ 5 a gallon Guy Caruso , head of the federal Energy Information Administration , made this prediction at a congressional hearing on energy prices and the future of oil .
Gasoline prices are likely to remain close to or at $ 4 a gallon through 2009 , he said .
UN Secretary - General Ban Kimoon said on June 15 that the king of Saudi Arabia had promised to lower oil prices .
Ban spoke with reporters after meeting with King Abdullah in the port city of Jidda during a visit to the world ’s largest oil producer .
“ The king believes that the current oil prices are abnormally high , and he is ready to restore prices to their appropriate levels , ” the official Saudi News
Agency quoted Ban .
The New York Times reported on June 14 — six days after receiving its marching orders at Bilderberg — that unnamed analysts and oil traders briefed by Saudi officials said a production increase of about 500,000 barrels per day is planned
.
“ Saudi Arabia , the world ’s largest oil producer , is concerned that sustained high oil prices eventually will slacken the world ’s appetite for oil , affecting the kingdom in the long run , ” Associated Press reported .
This precisely reflects what Bilderberg said in Chantilly .
A Bilderberg speaker from Europe had said : “ Are we reaching the point of diminishing returns ?
People who switch from gas hogs to fuel - efficient , small cars are not going to do an instant about - face .
And those who convert to public transportation , many of them , are going to stick with the train or bus .
We have seen many middle - class families , who grudgingly accepted $ 3 a gallon , choose to stay home instead of driving to the beaches or mountains .
They ’re presently calling them ‘ staycations . ’
We all take the long view of history .
Will forcing gasoline prices even higher increase profits in the long term ?
Ford has already shut down production of big cars and has many SUV - types it ca n’t give away .
Ford will not retool overnight . ”
Finance ministers from the Group of Eight weighed in at their meeting in Japan , issuing a joint statement calling for lower oil prices .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , Jr. , who had just left the Bilderberg session , called for oil - producing countries to allow more investment in oil exploration and production .
In another blow to Bilderberg ’s global ambitions , Irish voters rejected a treaty to make the European Union a superstate by a decisive 53.4 percent to 46.6 percent .
A “ European Constitution ” had been rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005 .
To take effect , all European Union states must approve .
After the “ constitution ” was rejected , European leaders came up with a shorter version providing for the same envisioned superstate but called it a “ treaty . ”
As a “ treaty , ” France and the Netherlands did not have to submit
it for a vote .
But Ireland ’s constitution required a referendum and Irish voters chose national sovereignty over a European superstate .
“ It ’s a very sad day for the country and for Europe , ” said Justice Minister Brian Lenihan .
“ It is a great day for Irish democracy , ” said Declan Ganley , a businessman who led the anti-treaty forces . ”
This is democracy in action . . . and Europe needs to listen to the voice of the people . ”
Responding to those seeking a way around the Irish rejection , British Foreign Secretary David Milliband said : “ The rules are absolutely clear .
If all 27 countries do not pass the Lisbon Treaty it cannot pass into law . ”
Establishing a European Union superstate is a crucial plank in Bilderberg ’s program for a world government .
Similar efforts to establish an “ American Union ” in the Western Hemisphere have likewise bogged down .
Bilderberg is on the ropes .
AFP correspondent James P. Tucker Jr. has spent many years as a member of the “ elite ” media in Washington .
Since 1975 he has won widespread recognition , here and abroad , for his pursuit of on - the - scene stories reporting the intrigues of global power blocs such as the Bilderberg Group .
Tucker is the author of Bilderberg Diary : One Man ’s 25 - Year Battle to Shine the Light on the World Shadow Government .
Bound in an attractive full - color softcover and containing 272 pages — loaded with photos — the book recounts Tucker ’s experiences over the last quarter century at Bilderberg meetings .

Yesterday I had one of those oh - my - God moments , the kind where I thought I could see the future .
It started by reading some articles about the lack of a serious energy policy in the United States .
The problem is that our politicians believe , probably correctly , that they ca n’t get elected if they propose an energy policy that could work .
Then I stumbled across an article about two Israeli companies that have allegedly made huge breakthroughs in solar power .
As with all of these breakthrough stories , you have to assume they are more hype than substance , but take a look :
http://nextbigfuture.com/2008/04/solar-power-breakthroughs-sunrgi-7.html
The oh - my - God moment came when I realized that Israel can destroy all of its local enemies by inventing solar technology that makes oil uneconomical .
Such an invention would do more harm than any military attack .
And it ’s all legal and moral .
The politicians and business people in Israel have all the right incentives times a thousand .
Their very survival is at risk .
Israel is one patent away from crushing every oil producing country in the world .
So that ’s my prediction .
Whether these latest announcements are real or hype , I think Israel will eventually create the technology to make oil irrelevant to energy production .
Siberia , RUSSIA , June 23 , 2008  --
" Two white robed men were standing there among them and said , ' Men of Galilee , why are you standing here staring the sky ?
Jesus has gone away to heaven .
And some day , just as He went , He will return ! ' " — New Testament , Acts 1:10 - 11
Deep in the heart of Siberia 's birch forests lies one of the largest and most remote religious communes of the planet .
More than 5,000 people have left their families and their homes to move here and join the Church of the Last Testament , which has more than 10,000 followers worldwide .
The church centers on one man .
He is known simply as Vissarion , meaning " he who gives new life , " or simply as the teacher , and he claims that he is Jesus Christ .
I had heard about a self - proclaimed messiah in Siberia and I decided to try to find him myself .
Getting to Vissarion 's commune is not easy .
From Moscow , the Russian capital , it is more than 2,000 miles and four time zones away .
One begins by flying to Abakan , a bleak city near the Mongolian border , dotted with crumbling tsarist buildings and Soviet - style blocks .
Driving through , I decided to ask residents whether they had heard of Vissarion and what they thought of him .
Most people knew who he was , but they did n't seem to like him much .
" It 's a sect … He presents himself as a demi- God and it's all lies in my opinion , " Sergei told me .
Lena was equally skeptical : " I heard they do n't eat properly there .
They grow vegetables and that 's all they eat . "
Once you drive out of the city , the drab concrete of Abakan gives way to rich rolling plains , sparkling rivers and tiny hamlets .
After a few hours on the road , we finally reached Petropavlovka , where more than 80 percent of the residents are members of the Church of the Last Testament .
Life here is very basic .
Vissarion 's followers are strict vegetarians and they do n't smoke or drink .
The houses and churches are built from wood by hand and most of the energy comes from windmills and solar panels .
At the followers ' school , little boys are taught how to build model ships and young girls learn crochet and singing .
With all the beautiful nature , it seemed an idyllic setting for a child to grow up in .
But the portraits of Vissarion that adorned every wall were difficult to ignore .
The Church of the Last Testament has abolished Christmas and replaced it with a new celebration on Vissarion 's birthday .
The biggest holiday of the year is Aug. 18 , the anniversary of the teacher 's first sermon .
And a new calendar has been introduced which dates from the year of his birth , making this year 48 .
Vissarion was born Sergei Torop in 1961 and worked as a traffic cop up until his revelation .
He started the Church of the Last Testament in 1991 , the same year as the collapse of the Soviet Union .
It was a desperate and chaotic time for people .
And after decades of religious oppression , suddenly thousands of new religions and sects burst onto the scene , all claiming to have the answers that people were so hungrily craving .
' My Body Was Shivering Nonstop '
The next day we continued driving , bumping along rutted roads thick with butterflies .
Stopping at a river for a break , we met Siegfried Werner , who left his home in Germany to move here .
Many of Vissarion 's followers are educated people from different European countries .
Some of them used to work as doctors , teachers and engineers .
One was even the former Belorussian deputy railway minister .
Werner explained to me , " It 's all about Vissarion .
I had an experience when I went from Italy , he embraced me very warmly .
He took my hands and then my heart spoke and that was the time when I never doubted again that he was the Christ . "
After three hours in the car the road ended and the journey on foot began .
The four - mile trek through Siberian forest , or taiga as it is known , was brutal .
Mosquitoes swarmed menacingly overhead and ticks were everywhere .
Unsurprisingly , almost two - thirds of Vissarion 's followers have been infected with Lyme disease .
The group eschews modern medicine , relying instead on holistic remedies .
One of Vissarion 's 60 commandments declares , " in most cases , illness is punishment for an inability to keep one 's flesh in harmony with nature . "
During the 1990s there were reports that some of his followers had died after refusing medical attention .
After hours of walking , we finally reach " Abode of Dawn , " a small settlement where 250 of Vissarion 's most devout followers live .
It 's four miles to the nearest road and just a couple of miles below the teacher himself .
At this point we were assigned minders who monitored our movements until we left .
The villagers in the Abode of Dawn follow an almost entirely vegan diet , largely based on what they can grow themselves .
When they move here , they give the church their pensions and whatever possessions they may have .
In return they receive basics such as sugar , buckwheat and flour .
No money is used within the community but they are given an allowance of 300 rubles , about $ 12 , a month .
The followers here were even more zealous when talking about their teacher .
I sat down with a group of women and asked about their first time meeting Vissarion .
" When I saw him the first time my soul recognized him .
I could not cope with my emotions and my soul cried , ' It 's him , it 's him .
He is on earth ! " '
Galina told me .
" It was as if a flood came down from the sky and my body was shivering nonstop ! " Tatyana added .
Every day the women pore over his 10 volumes of teachings and five times a day a bell rings whereupon the followers turn to pray towards the mountaintop where Vissarion lives .
Life here seemed visibly more cut off from society .
The children are homeschooled .
Every year a representative from the nearest school board visits to make sure that the children are being educated according to the national curriculum .
The local government is tacitly supportive of Vissarion 's group , although the Orthodox church has denounced them as a sect .
In Siberia , where there is terrible alcoholism and a declining population , Vissarion 's community is one of the very few that is healthy , hard - working and growing fast .
A Man of Few Words
On Sunday the community congregates early to begin the rituals of the holy day .
Followers from Petropavlovka and other villages make the journey to see their teacher for the day .
People dress up for the occasion .
The day begins with a steep walk up the mountain to where Vissarion lives .
At the top of the mountain , the followers gather at an altar and sing songs and pray .
Standing amongst them , the intensity of their fervour was palpable .
As the liturgy drew to a close I felt excited .
We were getting closer to meeting Vissarion .
It was finally time .
My first impression seeing the teacher was that he did actually look how one might imagine Jesus .
With his long hair , flowing white robes and kind smile , he looked the part .
But as the interview began , my feelings soon changed .
I asked him to tell me some of the principals of his religion .
After a good 20 second pause , he replied , " The same as all other religions have .
People should learn how to love each other . "
I asked him what he enjoyed to do every day and what he thought the most important philosophy to live by was .
Each question provoked the same long pause followed by a monosyllabic reply .
Finally I asked him the question I had traveled all this way to ask : " Are you Jesus Christ ? "
" It 's not necessary to answer this , " he told me .
I asked whether he believed in Judgment Day ,
" There is a time , a certain period of time , during which the destiny of the whole human society will be decided .
This period is going on already . "
He would not elaborate on what will happen at the end of the period of judgment , nor on when that would be .
The next few questions I asked provoked the same truculent answer , " That does n't interest me . "
So I finished by asking if he had anything that did interest him that he would like to communicate to our viewers and to Americans .
His reply , " I am not interested to tell them anything .
Their time has not yet come . "
It seemed that the interview was over before it began .
I had n't expected Jesus to be a man of so few words .
Leaving , I noticed a quad bike parked in front of his house .
It seemed ironic that he was zipping around while his followers trekked up and down the mountain .
Traveling back to civilization , I marvelled at the zeal of Vissarion 's followers .
What did they see that I did not ?
Or what did I see that they did not ?
I felt inexplicably disappointed .
Yet the numbers of Vissarion 's followers continues to grow as more and more people abandon their lives and flock to this remote corner of the world , and to this chameleon of a man .
Vissarion ?
The Teacher ?
Jesus Christ ?
Or perhaps just Sergei Torop , the self - proclaimed messiah of Siberia .

The European Robot Football Cup was held in Linz from June 15 - 22 and , like Euro 2008 , matches were played in both Switzerland and Austria .
Predictably the UK team performed poorly .
A less likely outcome was the eventual tournament winners : Slovenia .

STOCKHOLM ( AP )  Sweden on Wednesday adopted contentious legislation that will give officials sweeping powers to eavesdrop on all e-mail and telephone traffic that crosses the Nordic nation 's borders .
After heated debate and last - minute changes , lawmakers approved the bill that has outraged some lawmakers and prompted protesters to hand out copies of George Orwell 's novel " 1984 " outside Parliament .
Lawmakers approved the bill in a 143 - 138 vote .
One lawmaker abstained .
It will become law in January .
Google Inc. and Swedish telecom TeliaSonera AB have called it the most far - reaching eavesdropping plan in Europe , comparable to a U.S. government surveillance program .
" By introducing these new measures , the Swedish government is following the examples set by governments ranging from China and Saudi Arabia to the U.S. government 's widely criticized eavesdropping program , " Google 's global privacy counsel , Peter Fleischer said .
Since the law was first proposed in 2005 — in a country known and praised for its democratic principles — critics have slammed it , saying it would encroach on privacy and jeopardize civil liberties .
On Wednesday , hundreds of protesters gathered outside Parliament in a last attempt to stop the law .
Supporters say the legislation is needed to ensure safety against terrorist attacks in a high - tech society where advanced technology also is used by would - be attackers .
The new powers will give Sweden 's National Defense Radio Establishment — the authority for such intelligence — the right to scan all international phone calls , e-mails and faxes for sensitive keywords without a court order .
Late Tuesday , four governing coalition lawmakers forced changes in the bill , hoping they would protect individual privacy .
They had threatened to vote against it with the opposition if the additions were not adopted .
But critics say the changes , which include monitoring by independent institutions , do not change the fundamental problems with the law , including the fact that it will make people worried about contacting journalists .
" This is just as absurd as before .
It contravenes article 12 of the U.N. 's declaration of human rights , " said Per Strom from The New Welfare Foundation think tank .
" It will still create a society characterized by self - censorship and anxiety . "
Many European countries have gradually increased surveillance powers , including wiretapping and police searches , in a move to combat terror plots .
However , Italy — which experts deem one of the world 's most wiretapped democracies — is now starting to backtrack , saying the privacy of Italian citizens needs protecting .
Currently , e-mail and phone surveillance in Sweden requires a court order if police suspect a crime , although the intelligence agency is allowed to spy on airborne signals , such as radio and satellite traffic .
The government rejects claims the law will give it unlimited powers to spy on its own citizens and maintains it will filter out domestic communications and is interested only in international traffic .
Green Party lawmaker Peter Radberg disagrees .
" It is technically impossible to separate domestic traffic from international traffic , " Radberg said .
Youth wings of two governing parties had called on lawmakers to vote against the bill , and even the national security police warned the plan risks violating citizens ' privacy .
The controversy also has stretched beyond the country 's borders .
The European Federation of Journalists highlighted a potential threat to source protection , saying electronic monitoring of phone and e-mail communications contravenes international and European legal standards .
" The tapping of journalists ' telephones compromises the watchdog role of the media and puts at risk the right to inform the public , " federation president Arne Konig said .

Tests showed people in Mexico City -- a sprawling metropolis crammed with around 20 million people and 4 million cars -- struggled to sniff out everyday odors like coffee and orange juice compared to residents of a nearby town .
Their noses are so badly damaged from a life inhaling toxic particles that they also find it harder to detect the scent of rotten food , said researcher Robyn Hudson who ran the study .
“ We added a substance ( to powdered milk ) that is a common contaminant of food , something that smells disgusting basically -- like a sour , rotting cabbage , ” said Hudson .
“ We were able to see at what point ... they would start to reject the contaminated sample , say ‘ew yuck !
no! take it away please , ’ ” said Hudson , an Australian and a senior research scientist at Mexico ’s National Autonomous University ( UNAM ) .
Mexico City is one of the world ’s most polluted capitals , along with Beijing , blighted by its thin high - altitude air and a ring of surrounding mountains that trap exhaust fumes belched from smoky buses and factories on the city outskirts .
Contamination levels are better now than two decades ago , but from a high - story window it ’s still hard most days to make out the snow - capped peaks that surround the city through the murky shroud of brownish smog .
Mexico City ’s ozone levels exceed World Health Organization standards on approximately 300 days of the year .
VULNERABLE CELLS
Hudson ’s team compared Mexico City dwellers with a group from the nearby rural state of Tlaxcala , and found country folk could detect contaminants at lower concentrations .
The researchers are now testing to see whether pollution can cause more serious cellular damage in the nose and eyes .
On entering the nose , odors pass through a thin layer of mucus where they are detected by sensory cells which send the brain messages that something reeks or smells rosy .
The cells are vulnerable to damage from pollutants , Hudson said .
“ The olfactory receptors are very exposed , ” she said .
“ They are just hanging out there in the mucus . ”
Hudson suspects pollution could also affect taste , given the two senses are intimately linked .
The loss of smell is one of a gamut of problems caused by Mexico City ’s smog , which prompts a handful of warnings a year for residents to avoid exercising or hanging about outside .
Health experts worry about lung infections , asthma , heart attacks and cancers .
A 2007 study in the “ American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine ” found Mexico City school children had unusually small lungs .
The problem is aggravated by the fact Mexico City stands some 7,400 feet above sea level in a sunken lake bed rimmed by mountains .
Its thin atmosphere and bowl - shaped valley concentrates pollutants within the city .
City authorities have worked to remove the worst - polluting vehicles from the road , but as the capital ’s population grows it buys up to 250,000 new cars each year .
Asthma , allergies and other respiratory problems are common among residents , whose grimy windows need weekly scraping .
A 10 percent drop in toxic air particles could save 3,000 lives a year and prevent 10,000 cases of chronic bronchitis , says pollution watchdog The Blacksmith Institute .
“ I know I ’m inhaling poison , ” said 38 - year - old Guadalupe , a candy seller at a busy Mexico City road intersection with cars whizzing by .
“ But there is nothing I can do . ”
To everyone ’s surprise , price tagged at $ 2 Billion , Antilla ( named after the mythical island ) is in India and is World ’s First Billion Dollar Home .
Indeed , like its name , it houses stuff that surrounds myth !
Owner is India ’s richest , Mukesh Ambani of Reliance fame whose net worth was 43 Billion in March of this year and was the 5th richest in the world .
The only remotely comparable high - rise property currently on the market is the 70 million dollar triplex penthouse at the Pierre Hotel in New York , designed to resemble a French chateau , and climbing 525 feet in the air .
When the Ambani residence is finished in January , completing four years of design and construction , it will be 27 story and 550 feet high ( height which normally houses 60 floors ) with 400,000 square feet of interior space .
Click on the picture to see the video .
However , all of this has not been without its share of controversies .
Antilla is being built on land sold to Ambanis ’ to be used as orphanage by Waqf Board .
The land measuring 11793 sq yards was sold in 2004 by the trust for a charitable purpose of looking after the destitutes and orphan children belonging to the Khoja Mohammedan community .
The land was given to the Maharashtra State Board of Waqf by Jivagi Raje Scindia in 1957 .
The MoU was signed with four companies namely Antillia Commercials , Saphire Realtors , Rockline Constructions and Baun Foundation trust .
The Waqf Board has told the Supreme Court that it sold the property thinking it was to be used for an orphanage and that commercial buildings are not allowed on Waqf land .
Property having a market value of Rs 400 crore was sold only for Rs 21.05 cr to M/s Antillia Commercial , a company of Reliance group of Industries .
Rs 16 crores were also paid to Waqf Board for No Objection Certificate .
The Supreme Court on Friday decided not to intervene in the construction of the building on Waqf board land in Mumbai and has directed the matter back to the Bombay high court .
Critics have also said that showing off such extravagant wealth in a country rife with poverty is insensitive and ethically questionable .
This is excessive and ostentatious given that more than 65 percent of Mumbai ’s 18 million residents live in tenements .
Features which have made it the world ’s best :
The first six floors will be reserved for parking alone , and that too for cars belonging only to Mukesh ’s family .
Space for a total of 168 imported cars has been earmarked here .
Where possible , the designers say , whether it ’s for the silver railings , magnificient crystal chandeliers , woven area rugs or steel support beams , the Ambanis are using Indian companies , contractors , craftsmen and materials firms .
Elements of Indian culture juxtapose newer designs .
For example , the sinks in a lounge extending off the entertainment level , which features a 65 seat movie theater and wine room , are shaped like ginkgo leaves ( native to India ) with the stem extending to the faucet to guide the water into the basin .
The top floors of entertaining space , where Ambani plans to host business guests ( or just relax ) offer panoramic views of the Arabian Sea .
No two floors are alike in either plans or materials used .
If a metal , wood or crystal is part of the ninth - floor design , it should n’t be used on the eleventh floor , for example .
The idea is to blend styles and architectural elements so spaces give the feel of consistency , but without repetition .
Atop six stories of parking lots , Antilla ’s living quarters begin at a lobby with nine elevators , as well as several storage rooms and lounges
Down dual stairways with silver - covered railings is a large ballroom with 80 % of its ceiling covered in crystal chandeliers .
It features a retractable showcase for pieces of art , a mount of LCD monitors and embedded speakers , as well as stages for entertainment .
The hall opens to an indoor / outdoor bar , green rooms , powder rooms and allows access to a nearby “ entourage room ” for security guards and assistants to relax .
On the health level , local plants decorate the outdoor patio near the swimming pool and yoga studio .
The floor also features an ice room where residents and guests can escape the Mumbai heat to a small , cooled chamber dusted by man-made snow flurries .
Each family member has a separate gymn here .
For more temperate days , the family will enjoy a four - story open garden .
In profile , the rebar - enforced beams form a “ W ” shape that supports the upper two - thirds of the building while creating an open - air atrium of gardens , flowers and lawns .
Gardens , whether hanging hydroponic plants , or fixed trees , are a critical part of the building ’s exterior adornment but also serve a purpose :
The plants act as an energy - saving device by absorbing sunlight , thus deflecting it from the living spaces and making it easier to keep the interior cool in summer and warm in winter .
An internal core space on the garden level contains entertaining rooms and balconies that clear the tree line and offer views of downtown Mumbai .
Antilla ’s shape is based on Vaastu , an Indian tradition much like Feng Shui that is said to move energy beneficially through the building by strategically placing materials , rooms and objects .
At Antilia , the overall plan is based on the square , which is Vaastu ’s basic geometric unit , and a garden level occupies the tower ’s midsection , the point where all energies converge according to the Vaastu Purusha Mandala .
The 27 - story building is eco-friendly , with hydroponically grown plants cooling the building and filtering its air , limiting the need for air - conditioning .
With vertical gardens , you can use the whole wall almost like a tree and increase the green area of the site by five or 10 times over what it would be if you just did a green roof .
The four floors at the top , just below the hellipad that provides a view of the Arabian Sea and a superb view of the city ’s skyline , is where Mukesh with his wife Neeta , their three kids and Mukesh ’s mother Kokilaben , will reside .
Nearly 600 people would attend to the six in the family .
The residence tower stands on Mumbai ’s Altamount Road on an acre site where real estate costs as much as $ 1800 / square foot .
Mumbai is the densest city of India with almost 30,000 people per square kilometer .
The architects , Perkins +
Will and Hirsch Bedner Associates , the designers behind the Mandarin Oriental , based in Dallas and Los Angeles , were picked up by Nita Ambani , who was recently in news for being gifted a $ 59 million air jet by her husband on her 44th birthday !
The jet , like their new home , was fitted with a plush bar with mood lighting , a master bedroom , showers and a state - of - the - art entertainment cabin .
The architects and designers say , ” You are looking at the model for the buildings of the future . ”

Shape of Now : Antilla Stands High As World ’s First Billion Dollar Home
On any given game day , there would be a couple of parole officers hanging around the game watching younger siblings of their charges playing ball .
One of the officers who used to talk ball with me a little told me that he had been the parole officer for two old brothers of one of the better players in the league and hoped that the third and youngest boy would avoid the fate of his brothers who had both served time for drugs and robbery .
In addition to the parole officers , various workers from Social Services and a good number of parents and relatives , a couple military recruiters began showing up at the occasional game in spring 2002 .
The boys ( and some of the girls ) were intrigued by the recruiters .
Their uniforms and their sense of certainty seemed to appeal to these young people " " especially the ones with the least stable home lives .
Burlington never had much of a gang problem , but it always seemed to me that the appeal of the recruiters was that they promised membership in something very much like a gang with all of the solidarity and unity such membership could provide .
On the days the recruiters showed up they would converse with the kids " " none who were older than 13 " " about the Red Sox , the game and what they thought about high school .
After all , the military was only recruiting high school graduates at the time .
To their credit , the recruiters were more convivial than anything else and may even have inspired some of the kids they talked to into staying in school .
Yet , their primary reason for befriending these kids was to get them to join the military and go to war .
High schools across the nation include JROTC as a standard course .
In some schools it replaces physical education .
The course is about physical education but it is also about regimentation and indoctrination .
Boys and girls in the course do not use guns except when they carry fake ones in drill .
They do , however , get indoctrinated in the military doctrine and nationalistic propaganda .
Meanwhile , the US military has total access to young people 's phone numbers and school records .
Recruiters come to schools and speak to mandatory assemblies .
The US Army sends mail and calls students incessantly in their last two years of high school and send recruitment vans into neighborhoods where many youth are present .
Recruiters hang out in shopping malls near arcades hoping to get boys hyped up on the latest video game to consider a couple years in Iraq or Afghanistan as an option .
They push their way into job fairs at two and four year colleges and set up offices in as many towns as possible throughout the United States .
The culture of militarism is pervasive and it is heavily geared toward young people between the ages of twelve and twenty .
I mention all this in relation to a recent news item from the Associated Press stating that the group the Pentagon calls Al - Qaida in Iraq is recruiting and training teenagers .
For the moment , let 's assume that this article is true and is not some kind of fake news planted by US psy - ops .
According to the story , some videos were found in an operation against insurgents .
According to Rear Admiral Smith of the US Navy , the videos " were meant to spread Al Qaida 's message among the young rather than train the boys for missions . " 
This was not the first time such videos had been found , the story continued , but " it was the most disturbing . " 
Now , if I understand this right , the US military is appalled and disturbed because some Iraqi insurgent groups ( that may or may not have anything to do with Al Qaida in Iraq ) are using videos to propagandize among adolescents in the hope that they will enlist .
Meanwhile , the US military , which is engaged in the same type of operations as the Iraqi insurgency only as the occupying force , glorifies its mission of bloodshed , intimidation , and killing in videos , video games , in schools , on the television , at shopping malls and through the mails .
Naturally , these methods are not training the US adolescents that they are targeting for operations , but they are definitely " meant to spread the US military 's message among the young ( to borrow Admiral Smith 's words . ) " 
As I write this , a news item is coming over the radio stating that the US Army Surgeon General issued an order telling military counselors to stop helping Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans fill out paperwork required to seek psychological assistance .
After denying such a document existed , the General backtracked from that denial when the document was produced .
He is now looking for another lie to explain away the order .
Do you think the recruiters mention this to the teenagers they target ?

For more than 450 years Sark stood alone as one of Europe 's last bastions of feudal law , but yesterday marked the end of an era for the tiny Channel island as the UK Privy Council approved changes to its system of government , heralding the arrival of democracy for the first time .
Since the 1500s , Sark , the smallest of the Channel Islands , has been governed by the unelected descendants of the original 40 land - owning families , plus 12 elected deputies .
But , following pressure on the island to reform its feudal constitution to comply with the European Human Rights laws and other international obligations , Sark has finally had to make the change to democracy .
The decision was agreed by the island 's parliament , the Chief Pleas , back in February and yesterday that decision was formalised by the Privy Council .
It means that Sark will now be governed by a chamber of 28 elected members who will stand for office at the island 's first elections in December .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The presiding officer of the Chief Pleas , Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Guille , the Seneschal of Sark , said the changes would help modernise the island 's judiciary and government .
Speaking after the Privy Council 's decision , he said : " For the people of Sark and the Chief Pleas , this is a momentous day .
These moves are intended to be a step away from a feudalist system but at the same time still keeping some aspects of that system in place . "
Sark , which sits just 80 miles off the south coast , is just three miles long and 1.5 miles wide and has a resident population of about 600 .
It is car - free and the only forms of transport permitted are horse - drawn vehicles , bicycles , tractors and battery - powered buggies .
However , the tiny island was thrust into the public eye in 2000 when Sark came under pressure to reform its system of government in light of the human rights laws .
Two proposals for reform were rejected in 2005 and 2007 until February 's historic agreement paved the way for yesterday 's move to democracy .
Paul Armorgie , one of the people 's deputies , said at the time of the agreement : " It 's a great relief .
We have been trying to achieve this for 10 years and now a line has been drawn . "
US workers paying the price for Wall Street ’s debacle
By Barry Grey
16 May 2008
The Federal Reserve Board , with the full backing of the Bush administration , Congress and both political parties , has carried out a massive and unprecedented intervention to avert an imminent collapse of the US banking system and bolster the major Wall Street finance houses .
The Fed ’s decision in March to underwrite with $ 29 billion of its own funds the takeover of investment bank Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase , in order to prevent the collapse of Bear Stearns , and its even more extraordinary move to allow major investment banks to avoid a similar fate by borrowing directly from its coffers , was a signal that the US government would marshal whatever resources were necessary to rescue the banking system from the consequences of the speculative binge that had generated billions in salaries and bonuses for the Wall Street elite .
While the government bailout , ultimately to be financed from public funds , has seemingly averted an immediate banking collapse , it has done nothing to address the underlying crisis .
Rather , the Fed and the US corporate - financial establishment hope that it has created the conditions for a more orderly “ deleveraging ” of the financial system , i.e. , a liquidation of trillions in vastly inflated and unmarketable assets , in which the social and economic pain is borne overwhelmingly by working class and middle class families .
The Fed ’s actions have restored a measure of confidence to the financial markets , reflected in a stock market rally that has driven the Dow Jones Industrial Average back toward the 13,000 level .
At the same time , the Fed and most financial analysts are acknowledging that the US housing collapse and credit crunch have precipitated an economic slowdown that will likely be protracted .
Addressing a conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta on Tuesday , Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke said that financial markets were improving but “ remain far from normal . ”
He said the decision in March to allow investment firms to obtain emergency loans from the Fed “ seems to have bolstered confidence . ”
But , he cautioned , the crisis would not be resolved quickly .
“ Ultimately , ” he said , “ market participants themselves must address the fundamental sources of financial strains through deleveraging , raising new capital and improving risk management , and this process is likely to take some time . ”
Whatever the technical indices of the slump — not a few experts have taken to denying that the US is in a recession or heading for one — ordinary working people in the United States are suffering a major cut in their living standards .
Job losses are mounting , wages are declining , work hours are being reduced and prices for essentials such as food and gasoline are soaring .
In a word , the underlying historical and economic processes that produced the crisis on Wall Street are making the vast majority of Americans poorer .
And we are only at the beginning of this process .
The impact of the economic crisis on the general population was reflected in a Washington Post - ABC News poll released Tuesday , which reported that 68 percent of people surveyed said they were concerned about their ability to maintain their standard of living .
The biggest factor cited by respondents was the sharp rise in consumer prices .
A separate poll released by ABC showed economic anxiety to be at its highest point on record since 1981 .
In the Post - ABC poll , the nearly 70 percent who said they were worried about maintaining their lifestyles represented a 17 percent jump since December of last year .
The growing anxiety reported by respondents cut across party and income lines , “ spreading rapidly among Republicans , people from rural areas and those from middle - and upper - income households , ” according to the Post .
The newspaper said that nearly six in ten people from households with an annual income of $ 100,000 or higher said they were worried , up from a third in December .
Of those who identified themselves as Republicans , 56 percent expressed concern , up from 32 percent .
Twenty percent cited higher gasoline prices as the single most important economic issue , and about a third pointed more generally to rising prices as the primary cause of their apprehension .
Two - thirds called rising gasoline prices a financial hardship , including a third who said higher fuel prices were a severe burden .
There is , of course , a very real basis for these concerns .
Just on the question of gasoline , the Energy Department reported that the average cost of gas rose 11 cents in the past week alone , and has gone up 33 cents over the past month on its way to over $ 4 a gallon .
According to a report issued Wednesday by the Labor Department , food prices shot up 5.1 percent in April over a year earlier , and 0.9 percent from the previous month .
Both of these gains are the biggest since 1990 .
The spike in food prices was propelled by increases in the price of bread , fruit , coffee and other consumer staples .
Health care costs have risen 4.3 percent in the past 12 months .
Prices for imported goods — a direct reflection of the precipitous decline of the US dollar — rose 1.8 percent in April from March .
They have soared 15.4 percent from last year , the biggest year - to - year increase since such records began to be kept in 1982 .
Meanwhile , real weekly wages have fallen compared to a year earlier in every month since October .
A major component of the “ deleveraging ” process is an assault on jobs by means of downsizing , restructuring and corporate bankruptcies .
The last three months have seen , according to the Labor Department , a net loss of 180,000 jobs in the US .
Aside from construction and manufacturing , where job cuts continue to escalate , the financial sector is bearing the brunt of the job - cutting .
It is estimated that so far this year 50,000 financial jobs have been slashed .
More than 23,000 financial - related US job cuts were announced in April , according to the outplacement firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
That increased the total to 49,825 in the first four months of this year — nearly as many job cuts as were announced in all of 2007 .
This , however , is only the first stage of what promises to be a far larger job - slashing process .
Last week , the Swiss bank UBS announced it will lay off 5,500 employees in the US and Britain .
Lehman Brothers is expected to announce that it is eliminating 5 percent of its employees , or about 1,425 positions , on top of a previously announced 5 percent cutback in its work force .
By the end of June , Morgan Stanley plans 1,500 more job cuts .
This puts total layoffs at Morgan Stanley at about 4,500 , or 10 percent .
Citigroup on May 9 announced a plan to shed up to $ 500 billion of assets and slash some $ 15 billion off its cost base .
The bank did not say how many jobs would be eliminated , but the figure will likely be in the tens of thousands .
The bank has already announced 13,000 job cuts .
The crushing impact of job losses and price rises continues to undermine retail sales .
The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that retail sales fell another 0.2 percent in April from the previous month .
This smaller - than - expected drop obscures the dramatic slump in consumer spending in key manufacturing sectors .
Auto sales fell 2.8 percent in April , after a 0.5 percent drop in March .
The Federal Reserve issued a report on US manufacturing Thursday which showed that the slump in that critical sector is deepening .
Industrial production declined 0.7 percent in April , more than twice the drop forecast by economists .
The financial crisis is taking a growing toll in the form of corporate bankruptcies .
Corporate bankruptcy filings rose in the US last month more than 50 percent over the previous year ’s figure .
In the financial sector itself , losses from failed mortgage - related assets and bad debts continue to mount , reflecting the underlying insolvency of major sections of the financial system .
Last week , American International Group , the world ’s largest insurance firm , announced a record $ 7.8 billion loss in the first quarter of 2008 .
This brought the company ’s loss to $ 13.1 billion over the past two quarters .
AIG has written down $ 20 billion in credit derivative contracts since December .
The deepening financial crisis of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the two major mortgage companies that are sponsored by the US government , is indicative of the way in which the crisis on Wall Street is being offloaded onto the government .
Freddie Mac on Wednesday reported a loss of $ 151 million in the first quarter of 2008 .
The market responded to this lower - than - expected loss by driving the company ’s stock up by 9 percent .
However , the reported figure was achieved by means of accounting gimmicks that concealed an actual loss of $ 2 billion .
The previous week , Fannie Mae reported a first quarter loss of $ 2.2 billion .
Its stock also shot up .
The two companies suffered more than $ 9 billion in mortgage - related losses last year , and are sitting on as much as $ 19 billion in additional losses that they have not yet fully acknowledged , analysts say .
Their combined cushion of $ 83 billion underpins a colossal $ 5 trillion in debt and financial commitments — a level of leverage that is unsustainable .
But in the aftermath of the bursting of the housing bubble , the government has allowed them to expand their loans while lowering their capital cushions .
This is because the two government - backed firms are essentially taking over the mortgage financing business that has been dumped by the banks and investment firms .
As the New York Time reported last week , “ As Wall Street all but abandons the mortgage business , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac now overwhelmingly dominate it , handling more than 80 percent of all mortgages bought by investors in the first quarter of this year .
That is more than double their market share in 2006 . ”
In a separate article on Thursday , the Times explained the reason for the stock market ’s enthusiasm for the shares of the two companies .
“ ‘ Both these companies are clearly going to be insolvent by the end of the year , but everyone knows that Congress will do anything to keep them afloat , because if Fannie and Freddie go under , the entire global financial system will melt down , ’ said Christopher Whalen , a founder of Institutional Risk Analytics , an independent research firm .
‘ These companies ’ earnings do n’t matter .
Their accounting hardly matters .
People buy the stock because they believe the federal government will bail them both out if things get really bad . ’”
No such bailout is in the works for the millions of families that are losing their homes as a result of the mortgage crisis .
Foreclosure filings surged 65 percent in April from April 2007 , according to a report issued Wednesday by RealtyTrac .
One in every 519 households received a foreclosure filing — the highest such figure since the real estate tracking company began issuing foreclosure reports in January 2005 .
Nationally , 243,353 homes were facing foreclosure last month .
That amounts to 2 percent of all homes .
Foreclosure filings rose in all but eight states .
The hardest hit states included Arizona , California , Florida and Nevada .
Analysts expect the foreclosure rate to continue to rise , spiking in the third and fourth quarters of this year .
Game
It is unfair but there is nothing I can do about it .
I am aching to get my hands on them .
Shotwell and I watch the console .
Shotwell and I live under the ground and watch the console .
If certain events take place upon the console , we are to insert our keys in the appropriate locks and turn our keys .
Shotwell has a key and I have a key .
If we turn our keys simultaneously the bird flies , certain switches are activated and the bird flies .
But the bird never flies .
In one hundred thirty - three days the bird has not flown .
Meanwhile Shotwell and I watch each other .
We each wear a .45 and if Shotwell behaves strangely I am supposed to shoot him .
If I behave strangely Shotwell is supposed to shoot me .
We watch the console and think about shooting each other and think about the bird .
Shotwell 's behavior with the jacks is strange .
Is it strange ?
I do not know .
Perhaps he is merely a selfish bastard , perhaps his character is flawed , perhaps his childhood was twisted .
I do not know .
Each of us wears a .45 and each of us is supposed to shoot the other if the other is behaving strangely .
How strangely is strangely ?
I do not know .
In addition to the .45 I have a .38 which Shotwell does not know about concealed in my attaché case , and Shotwell has a .25 caliber Beretta which I do not know about strapped to his right calf .
Sometimes instead of watching the console I pointedly watch Shotwell 's .45 , but this is simply a ruse , simply a maneuver , in reality I am watching his hand when it dangles in the vicinity of his right calf .
If he decides I am behaving strangely he will shoot me not with the .45 but with the Beretta .
Similarly Shotwell pretends to watch my .45 but he is really watching my hand resting idly atop my attaché case , my hand resting atop my attaché case , my hand .
My hand resting idly atop my attaché case .
In the beginning I took care to behave normally .
So did Shotwell .
Our behavior was painfully normal .
Norms of politeness , consideration , speech and personal habits were scrupulously observed .
But then it became apparent that an error had been made , that our relief was not going to arrive .
Owing to an oversight .
Owing to an oversight we have been here for one hundred thirty - three days .
When it became clear that an error had been made , that we were not to be relieved , the norms were relaxed .
Definitions of normality were redrawn in the agreement of January 1 , called by us , The Agreement .
Uniform regulations were relaxed , and mealtimes are no longer rigorously scheduled .
We eat when we are hungry and sleep when we are tired .
Considerations of rank and precedence were temporarily put aside , a handsome concession on the part of Shotwell , who is a captain , whereas I am only a first lieutenant .
One of us watches the console at all times rather than two of us watching the console at all times , except when we are both on our feet .
One of us watches the console at all times and if the bird flies then that one wakes the other and we turn our keys in the locks simultaneously and the bird flies .
Our system involves a delay of perhaps twelve seconds but I do not care because I am not well , and Shotwell does not care because he is not himself .
After the agreement was signed Shotwell produced the jacks and the rubber ball from his attaché case , and I began to write a series of descriptions of forms occurring in nature , such as a shell , a leaf , a stone , an animal .
On the walls .
Shotwell plays jacks and I write descriptions of natural forms on the walls .
Shotwell is enrolled in a USAFI course which leads to a master 's degree in business administration from the University of Wisconsin ( although we are not in Wisconsin , we are in Utah , Montana or Idaho ) .
When we went down it was in either Utah , Montana or Idaho , I do n't remember .
We have been here for one hundred thirty - three days owing to an oversight .
The pale green reinforced concrete walls sweat and the air conditioning zips on and off erratically and Shotwell reads Introduction to Marketing by Lassiter and Munk , making notes with a blue ballpoint pen .
Shotwell is not himself but I do not know it , he presents a calm aspect and reads Introduction to Marketing and makes his exemplary notes with a blue ballpoint pen , meanwhile controlling the .38 in my attaché case with one - third of his attention .
I am not well .
We have been here one hundred thirty - three days owing to an oversight .
Although now we are not sure what is oversight , what is plan .
Perhaps the plan is for us to stay here permanently , or if not permanently at least for a year , for three hundred sixty - five days .
Or if not for a year for some number of days known to them and not known to us , such as two hundred days .
It may be that they are pleased with us , with our behavior , not in every detail but in sum .
Perhaps the whole thing is very successful , perhaps the whole thing is a experiment and the experiment is very successful .
I do not know .
But I suspect that the only way they can persuade sun-loving creatures into their pale green sweating reinforced concrete rooms under the ground is to say that the system is twelve hours on , twelve hours off .
And then lock us below for some number of days known to them and not known to us .
We eat well although the frozen enchiladas are damp when defrosted and the frozen devil 's food cake is sour and untasty .
We sleep uneasily and acrimoniously .
I hear Shotwell shouting in his sleep , objecting , denouncing , cursing sometimes , weeping sometimes , in his sleep .
When Shotwell sleeps I try to pick the lock on his attaché case , so as to get at the jacks .
Thus far I have been unsuccessful .
Nor has Shotwell been successful in picking the locks on my attaché case so as to get at the .38 .
I have seen the marks on the shiny surface .
I laughed , in the latrine , pale green walls sweating and the air conditioning whispering , in the latrine .
I write descriptions of natural forms on the walls , scratching them on the tile surface with a diamond .
The diamond is a two and one - half carat solitaire I had in my attaché case when we went down .
It was for Lucy .
The south wall of the room containing the console is already covered .
I have described a shell , a leaf , a stone , animals , a baseball bat .
I am aware that the baseball bat is not a natural form .
Yet I described it .
" The baseball bat , " I said , " is typically made of wood .
It is typically one meter in length or a little longer , fat at on end , tapering to afford a comfortable grip at the other end .
The end with the handhold typically offers a slight rim , or lip , at the nether extremity , to prevent slippage . "
My description of the baseball bat ran to 4500 words , all scratched with a diamond on the south wall .
Does Shotwell read what I have written ?
I do not know .
I am aware that Shotwell regards my writing - behaviour as strange .
Yet it is no stranger than his jacks - behaviour , or the day he appeared in black bathing trunks with the .25 caliber Beretta strapped to his right calf and stood over the console , trying to span with his two arms outstretched the distance between the two locks .
He could not do it , I had already tried , standing over the console with my two arms outstretched , the distance is too great .
I was moved to comment but did not comment , comment would have provoked counter - comment , comment would have led God knows where .
They had in their infinite patience , in their infinite foresight , in their infinite wisdom already imagined a man standing over the console with his two arms outstretched , trying to span with his two arms outstretched the distance between the locks .
Shotwell is not himself .
He has made certain overtures .
The burden of his message is not clear .
It has something to do with the keys , with the locks .
Shotwell is a strange person .
He appears to be less affected by our situation than I .
He goes about his business stolidly , watching the console , studying Introduction to Marketing , bouncing his rubber ball on the floor in a steady , rhythmical , conscientious manner .
He appears to be less affected by our situation than I am .
He is stolid .
He says nothing .
But he has made certain overtures , certain overtures have been made .
I am not sure that I understand them .
They have something to do with the keys , with the locks .
Shotwell has something in mind .
Stolidly he shucks the shiny silver paper from the frozen enchiladas , stolidly he stuffs them into the electric oven .
But he has something in mind .
But there must be a quid pro quo .
I insist on a quid pro quo .
I have something in mind .
I am not well .
I do not know our target .
They do not tell us for which city the bird is targeted .
I do not know .
That is planning .
That is not my responsibility .
My responsibility is to watch the console and when certain events take place upon the console , turn my key in the lock .
Shotwell bounces the rubber ball on the floor in a steady , stolid , rhythmical manner .
I am aching to get my hands on the ball , on the jacks .
We have been here one hundred thirty - three days owing to an oversight .
I write on the walls .
Shotwell chants " onesies , twosies , threesies , foursies " in a precise , well - modulated voice .
Now he cups the jacks and the rubber ball in his hands and rattles them suggestively .
I do not know for which city the bird is targeted .
Shotwell is not himself .
Sometimes I can not sleep .
Sometimes Shotwell cannot sleep .
Sometimes when Shotwell cradles me in his arms and rocks me to sleep , singing Brahms ' " Guten abend , gut Nacht , " or I cradle Shotwell in my arms and rock him to sleep , singing , I understand what it is Shotwell wishes me to do .
At such moments we are very close .
But only if he will give me the jacks .
That is fair .
There is something he wants me to do with my key , while he does something with his key .
But only if he will give me my turn .
That is fair .
I am not well .

Want to see a signature worth $ 320 million ?

It belongs to Jack Gardner , an official with the now - defunct Coalition Provisional Authority , who in July 2003 authorized that amount to be transferred to the Iraqi Ministry of Finance for the payment of Iraqi salaries .
There are no other records of the transfer , just Mr. Gardner ’s John Hancock .
Now that ’s power .
The payment is but one example of the process by which U.S. dollars have disappeared without a trace into the confusion ( and , yes , corruption ) of Iraq reconstruction , confounding Pentagon auditors who are now trying to find out where all that money went … and what exactly , if anything , the U.S. got in return .
One such auditor is Mary L. Ugone , the Pentagon ’s deputy inspector general for audit .
Her testimony this morning before Rep. Henry Waxman ’s ( D - Calif . )
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform coincided with the release of a new report from Pentagon ’s Office of Inspector General , which reviewed over 180,000 payments made by the Pentagon to contractors in Iraq , Kuwait , and Egypt , totaling approximately $ 8.2 billion .
Of that , the Pentagon admits that it cannot properly account for how $ 7.8 billion — ” a stunning 95 % failure rate in following basic accounting standards , ” Waxman said in his opening statement .
The IG report details how $ 135 million was paid to the governments of the United Kingdom , South Korea , Poland , and others contributing troops to Iraq without any mechanism for determining how it was used .
Another $ 1.8 billion in seized Iraqi assets were also simply given away , without any accountability .
IG investigators examined 53 payment invoices .
Not one made note of the money ’s ultimate destination .
Together with a separate Pentagon IG report released last November , which showed the Defense Department could not account for at least $ 5 billion issued to Iraqi security forces ( causing it to lose track of nearly all of the 13,508 rifles , machine guns , and RPGs it provided to Iraqi troops ) , today ’s report sets the new total of Pentagon Iraq funds lost or stolen at almost $ 15 billion .
To date , Pentagon auditors have referred 28 cases to criminal investigators .

DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Osama bin Laden vowed in an audio tape to mark Israel ’s 60th anniversary to continue to fight the Jewish state and its allies in the West .
The al Qaeda leader , who has placed growing emphasis on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , said it was at the heart of the Muslim battle with the West and an inspiration to the 19 bombers who carried out the attacks on U.S. cities on September 11 , 2001 .
“ We will continue , God permitting , the fight against the Israelis and their allies ... and will not give up a single inch of Palestine as long as there is one true Muslim on Earth , ” he said in the message , posted on an Islamist website on Friday .
Bin Laden said Israel ’s anniversary celebrations were a reminder that it did not exist 60 years ago , and had been established on land seized from Palestinians by force .
“ This is evidence that Palestine is our land , and the Israelis are invaders and occupiers who should be fought , ” he said in the tape , which was addressed to the Western public .
The Saudi - born militant also said that decades of peace initiatives had failed to establish a Palestinian state , and the West had proved time and again that it sided with Israel .
“ The participation of Western leaders with the Jews in this celebration confirms that the West backs this Jewish occupation of our land , and that they stand in the Israeli corner against us , ” he said .
“ They proved this in practice by sending their forces to southern Lebanon . ”
He also said Western media had over the years painted Israelis as victims , and the Palestinians who had been displaced from their land as terrorists .
“ CRAZY TERRORIST ”
The authenticity of the tape could not immediately be verified but the voice sounded like bin Laden’s .
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Arye Mekel dismissed the tape as the ravings of a terrorist .
“ We do n’t pay any attention to the threats of a crazy terrorist .
The time has come for him to be caught and to be punished for all his crimes , ” Mekel said .
A U.S. official in Washington said the tape was being reviewed to establish if it was genuinely from bin Laden but the content came as no surprise .
Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden speaks at a news conference in Afghanistan in a 1998 file photo .
REUTERS / Stringer / Files
“ There ’s been a recent spate of terrorist messages in which Israel has been a central theme -- one that al Qaeda believes resonates in the Muslim world , ” the official said .
In a message on March 20 , bin Laden urged Muslims to maintain the struggle against U.S. forces in Iraq as a path toward “ liberating Palestine . ”
Al Qaeda has vowed attacks on Jews both inside and outside Israel and regularly expresses support for the Palestinians .
Al Qaeda is widely blamed for a suicide attack on an Israeli - owned hotel in Kenya and a simultaneous failed attempt to shoot down an Israeli charter jet near Mombasa airport in Kenya in 2002 .
But despite calls by al Qaeda supporters for the militant network to establish a presence in Palestinian areas , U.S. intelligence officials see no evidence it has done so .
Analysts say it faces competition for turf , in particular in the Gaza Strip , from the well - established Hamas .
Bin Laden said the Palestinians in Gaza were being subjected to a “ slow death ” and blamed U.S. - allied Egypt for helping Israel to besiege the overcrowded Hamas - run area .
Failure in tests can damage enthusiasm for school , say teachers
She said she gave the idea - which will be discussed at a teachers ' conference - " nought out of 10 " .
The Professional Association of Teachers will be told at its meeting next week that the label of failure could undermine pupils ' enthusiasm .
Delegates will also hear a condemnation of the phrase " happy slapping " .
The term is used to describe bullying where assaults are filmed on mobile phones .
Liz Beattie , a retired teacher , will call on the association 's annual gathering in Buxton , Derbyshire , to " delete the word ' fail ' from the educational vocabulary to be replaced with the concept of ' deferred success ' " .
Demolish
She argues that repeated failure , such as in exams , can damage pupils ' interest in learning .
She told the Today programme on BBC Radio Four she had deliberately made the motion provocative to spark a good debate , but said it reflected the way the education system was developing .
" We have made so much development in recent years in making examinations more flexible , doing them in modules so you can concentrate on different parts of them at different times , " she said .
" What happens when an exam is failed but , for example , three - quarters of it is perfectly satisfactorily done ?
It should be possible to do the other bits as add - ons afterwards and to defer the success of the exam . "
When young people grow up they have to deal with success and failure
Ruth Kelly , Education Secretary
Wesley Paxton , a member of the association 's council , is supporting the motion .
" Elsewhere we applaud those who persevere , like marathon contestants who take days to complete .
It 's time we made the word ' fail ' redundant and replaced it with ' please do a bit more ' , " he said .
Education Secretary Ruth Kelly told the Today programme on BBC Radio Four : " For that particular proposal , I think I might give them nought out of 10 .
" It 's really important for young people to grow up with the ability to get on and achieve , but also to find out what failure is .
" When young people grow up and enter the adult world they have to deal with success and failure , and education is about creating well - rounded young people who can deal with these sorts of situations . "
The association , one of the smaller organisations for teachers , will also hear a call to block the use of the term " happy slapping " - when the attacks recorded on phones should be labelled as either an assault or bullying .
And there will be a call for " the producers of children 's programmes to consider and address the presentation , language and diction of those programmes " .
Should teachers use the word failure ?

The Supreme Court is set to rule on this case by June in Indiana just in time to purge the voting rolls and disenfranchise as many voters as possible before anyone has a chance to doing something about it .
Well , Valerie Williams and Mary - Jo Criswell are prime examples of why it 's completely bogus and must be defeated at all costs .
In April 2006 , a federal judge upheld Indiana ’s law on voter identification , the strictest in the nation , saying there was no evidence that it would prevent any voter from having his ballot counted .
But on Election Day last November , Valerie Williams became that evidence , according to lawyers in a case that will be argued Wednesday before the Supreme Court .
After Ms. Williams grabbed her cane that day and walked into the polling station in the lobby of her retirement home to vote , as she has done in at least the last two elections , she was barred from doing so .
The election officials at the polling place , whom she had known for years , told her she could not cast a regular ballot .
They said the forms of identification she had always used — a telephone bill , a Social Security letter with her address on it and an expired Indiana driver ’s license — were no longer valid under the voter ID law , which required a current state - issued photo identification card .
“ Of course I threw a fit , ” said Ms. Williams , 61 , who was made to cast a provisional ballot instead , which , according to voting records , was never counted .
Ms. Williams — who has difficulty walking — said she was not able to get a ride to the voting office to prove her identity within 10 days as required under the law , and her ballot was discarded ... read on
But the decision will effect more than just the voter - identification issue .
It will be pushed through as many states as the GOP can muster .
In the 1980s and ’90s , the Supreme Court came up with a test for assessing any law that placed hurdles before voters .
The justices ruled that courts must weigh the value of the law to the state against the burden it placed on voters .
How the court applies that test in this case could set the standard for challenges to election rules across the country .
The decision could affect a range of other voting - related rules being imposed by states , including ones involving the handling of provisional ballots , new restrictions on voter registration and the methods states can use to purge voters from registration rolls .
You can see the entire scam now .
And what does the Bush administration say about it ?
The Bush administration , arguing in favor of the law in a brief filed with the Supreme Court , suggested it was not necessary to prove fraud was actually taking place , given the importance of preventing such fraud .
BushCo. is implementing a preemptive doctrine on voter fraud where none exists and Republicans are determined to get this passed .
This case has been decided right down party lines so I do n't expect the Roberts Court to rule in favor of Democracy .
We 've had to fight for the right to vote since this nation was born and we must continue that struggle .
Mechanisms of Western Domination : A Short History of Iraq and Kuwait
by David Klein
California State University , Northridge
January 2003
In the United States of America , it is almost beyond the bounds of acceptable discourse to address the question , why did Saddam Hussein invade Kuwait in 1990 ?
Even to ask the question , one risks the appearance of supporting a repressive dictatorship , and to the extent that the question is entertained at all , the simplistic answer proffered by political leaders is that Saddam Hussein is an aggressive tyrant , bent on territorial acquisition and the subjugation of other nations .
He is a modern day Hitler .
The same answer is utilized to explain why Iraq invaded Iran in 1980 .
This standard answer is easy to accept , in part , because of the well - documented brutality of Saddam 's regime , including human rights violations committed by his government against the Iraqi people , and especially the Kurds .
In spite of partial truths imbedded in this standard explanation , it smacks of propaganda .
Much more needs to be understood by the American public before it allows its government to wage war against Iraq .
The history of Iraq , Kuwait , Britain , and the United States reveals that the reasons for the Iraqi invasions of Kuwait and Iran are far more complex and interesting than the standard answer allows .
Over a period of decades , and especially in recent years , Britain and the U.S. have consciously manipulated tensions in the region and have masterfully set into motion sequences of events leading to the Iraqi invasions .
The purpose of these manipulations was to increase power and control over middle eastern governments and their oil resources by elite U.S. and British interests .
This short historical outline is far from comprehensive , and even the references are sketchy .
The main purpose of this essay is to offer student peace activists , and others who might be unfamiliar with Middle Eastern history , a few key talking points and an historical context from which to support their efforts to block the drive toward war .
This outline is organized by historical chronology into sections .
Much of the beginning of this essay relies heavily on a single reference , Iraq and Kuwait : A History Suppressed , by Ralph Schoenman [ 1 ] .
Relevant web site addresses are sprinkled throughout and are provided for readers who seek a greater depth of understanding than this short outline alone provides .
Early History
The ancient civilizations of Sumer and Babylon originated in Mesopotamia ( the Greek word for " between rivers " ) , near the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in what is now Iraq .
Modern day Kuwait began in the eighteenth century as a small village on the Persian Gulf .
" Kuwait , " the word for " small human settlement , " was so named by Iraqi rulers of that era .
Throughout the nineteenth century and up to World War I , Kuwait was a " Qadha , " a district within the Basra Province , and it was an integral part of Iraq under the administrative rule of the Ottoman Empire .
British Domination
As the victors of World War I , France and Britain dismantled the Ottoman Empire and the Arab nation for their own colonial purposes .
The Iraq Petroleum Company was created in 1920 with 95 % of the shares going to Britain , France , and the U.S.
In order to weaken Arab nationalism , Britain blocked Iraqi access to the Persian Gulf by severing the territorial entity , " Kuwait " from the rest of Iraq in 1921 and 1922 .
This new British colony , Kuwait , was given artificial boundaries with no basis in history or geography .
King Faisal
I of the new Iraqi state ruled under British military oversight , but his administration never accepted the amputation of the Kuwait district and the denial of Iraqi access to the Persian Gulf .
Attempts by Faisal to build a railway to Kuwait and port facilities on the Gulf were vetoed by Britain .
These and other similar British colonial policies made Kuwait a focus of the Arab national movement in Iraq , and a symbol of Iraqi humiliation at the hands of the British .
Resistance to the British imposed separation of Kuwait from Iraq continued through the 1930s .
In 1932 , the British Agent in Baghdad forced the Iraqi leadership to enter into " correspondence " on the delimitation of boundaries for British Kuwait , but the Iraqi Chamber of Deputies repudiated these " correspondences . "
A mass movement of Kuwaiti youth called the " Free Kuwaiti Movement " defied British rule and submitted a petition requesting the Iraqi government to reunify Kuwait and Iraq .
Fearing an uprising , the Kuwaiti Sheik agreed to the establishment of a legislative council to represent the " Free Kuwaitis . "
The first meeting of the council in 1938 resulted in an unanimous resolution demanding that Kuwait revert back to Iraq .
That same year , the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iraq informed the British Ambassador in Baghdad that :
" The Ottoman - British Agreement of 1913 recognizes Kuwait as a District under the jurisdiction of the Province of Basra .
Since sovereignty over Basra has been transferred from the Ottoman state to the Iraqi state , that sovereignty has to include Kuwait under the terms of the 1913 Agreement .
Iraq has not recognized any change in the status of Kuwait . " ( quoted in [ 1 ] )
U.S. Domination
Following World War II , British rule was gradually replaced by U.S. neo-colonial domination of the Middle East .
The new state of Israel became an important instrument for U.S. control of Middle Eastern oil in the post war era .
With the U.S. / Israeli sponsored coup of 1953 that deposed Mossadegh , the popularly elected president of Iran , and installed the Shah in his place , the U.S. became the dominant imperial power in the region .
In 1955 the U.S. and Britain inaugurated the Baghdad Pact , an anti-Soviet security agreement for Middle Eastern nations , including Iraq .
The Baghdad Pact was widely perceived in the Arab world as alliance of regimes subordinate to British and U.S. power , and it was greeted with popular protests and riots .
Nuri es- Said responded to the protests by jailing opposition leaders who demanded that Iraq withdraw from the pact .
However , he also began secret negotiations with the U.S. and Britain for the return of Kuwait to Iraq in order to placate Iraqi national sentiment .
For two years , appeals for the return of Kuwait to Iraq intensified .
In January 1958 , Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri es-Said addressed a meeting of the Baghdad Pact and publicly urged the return of Kuwait to Iraq .
All pact members agreed with the proposal , with the sole exception of Britain .
Further diplomatic gestures from Iraq to Britain were rebuffed , and finally Iraq informed Britain that it was preparing documents and copies of secret understandings together with a formal memorandum , to be published before the world in July 1958 .
The British Ambassador responded to the Iraqi government that Great Britain had " approved in principle " the unification of Kuwait and Iraq , but requested a meeting in London with the Iraqi and British Prime Ministers and other government officials .
But this meeting never took place , because the Iraqi monarchy was overthrown on July 14 , 1958 in a revolution led by General Abdel Karim Qassim .
King Faisal II and Nuri es- Said were executed , and Britain immediately thereafter abrogated the agreement to return Kuwait to Iraq .
News of the coup triggered an uprising of the poor and dispossessed in Baghdad .
The crowds attacked the British embassy and other targets .
The U.S. did not initially respond to the coup , but the political upheaval of the subsequent popular uprising pushed the new regime further to the left than it had originally intended .
The new government lifted the ban on the Iraqi Communist Party , and that modest step toward democracy in turn mobilized the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency .
CIA director Alan Dulles assigned the job of incapacitating Qassim to the euphemistically named Technical Services Division ( TDS ) of the CIA .
The head of the TDS in 1960 , Stanley Gottlieb , initiated a program to assassinate Qassim .
One failed assassination attempt in this context was made by Saddam Hussein .
Qassim continued to alienate the U.S. and Britain , and Britain further exacerbated relations by declaring its Kuwait colony free and independent in 1961 .
Qassim held a press conference on June 19 , 1961 at which he declared that " Iraq regards Kuwait as an integral part of its territory . "
Following that press conference , Britain quickly massed troops in Kuwait with naval support in the Gulf .
Kuwait gained admission to the United Nations in 1963 , the same year that Qassim was killed and his government overthrown in a CIA supported coup led by the Baath Party .
Saddam Hussein's Rise to Power
By 1965 , Saddam Hussein 's cousin became Secretary General of the Baathist Party .
In 1968 Saddam Hussein was made Deputy Secretary General and Saddam and his Baathist supporters succeeded in seizing state power , all with CIA backing .
What followed was a slaughter of the left , including the murder and torture of Iraqi Communist Party members and trade unionists .
Throughout the 1970s , Iraq offered compromises to Kuwait 's rulers that would enable Iraq to gain access to its former islands in the Gulf .
But no agreements were reached , and the floating border separating the two countries crept northward .
In mid-July , 1979 , Saddam replaced Al Bakr as president of Iraq .
He reportedly uncovered a conspiracy against his government with the result that twenty - one high government and Baath Party officials were executed .
The armed forces and the Baath Party were purged and there were widespread arrests .
A short time later , in August 1979 a general amnesty was announced that resulted in the release of Kurdish prisoners , members of the Iraqi Communist Party , and others .
However , Amnesty International reported continual human rights abuses from that period .
That same year , Zbigniew Brzezinski , President Jimmy Carter 's National Security Adviser , proposed to Saddam Hussein that he invade Iran and annex Khuzistan , thereby providing Iraq access to the Gulf through the narrow waterway , Shatt -al Arab .
The U.S. hoped to use Iraq to counter the radicalism of the Khomeini regime in Iran from spreading to oppressed peoples of the Emirates and to Saudi Arabia .
Saddam Hussein was guaranteed financial backing in the form of loans from Kuwait , Saudi Arabia , and other nations .
About half a million Iranians and Iraqis were killed in the Iran Iraq war , and unbeknownst to Hussein , the U.S. and Israel also secretly armed the Iranians so as to weaken both Iran and Iraq .
President Ronald Reagan 's special envoy , Donald Rumsfeld visited Saddam Hussein once in late December 1983 and again in March 1984 .
These visits paved the way for the normalization of relations between the U.S. and Iraq at a time when Saddam Hussein was using chemical weapons in his war against Iran .
Iraq had been removed from the U.S. State Department 's list of alleged sponsors of terrorism in 1982 , and Iraq went on a buying spree to purchase weapons from U.S. and German companies .
These weapons were used in 1988 for attacks against the Kurds .

Prelude to the 1991 Gulf War
The war with Iran left Iraq in ruins .
When Saddam Hussein launched his eight year war against Iran , Iraq had $ 40 billion in hard currency reserves .
But by the end of the war , his nation was $ 80 billion in debt .
Iraq was pressed to repay the $ 80 billion to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia , with interest .
While Iraq was distracted by its war , Kuwait had accumulated 900 square miles of Iraqi territory by advancing its border with Iraq northward .
This was presented to Iraq as a fait accompli and it gave Kuwait access to the Rumaila oil field .
The Kuwaiti Sheik had purchased the Santa Fe Drilling Corporation of Alhambra , California , for $ 2.3 billion and proceeded to use its slant drilling equipment to gain access to the Iraqi oil field .
The main source of earnings for Iraq was petroleum whose price fluctuated depending on international production levels .
By 1990 , Kuwait , under U.S. tutelage had increased its oil production to undermine OPEC quotas thereby driving the price of Iraqi oil down from $ 28 per barrel to $ 11 per barrel and further ruining the Iraqi economy .
Appeals from Iraq , Iran , Libya , and other countries to the Emirates , Kuwait , Saudi Arabia and Egypt to stick to OPEC production levels were met with increased naval activity in the Persian Gulf by the United States .
In February 1990 , Saddam Hussein spoke at the Amman summit on the relationship between oil production and the U.S. navy buildup and warned that the Gulf people and the rest of the Arabs faced subordination to American interests .
Following this speech the Western press carried stories of Saddam 's missiles , chemical weapons and nuclear potential .
The Israeli press speculated about pre-emptive strikes such as the Israeli attack on Iraq 's nuclear power plant in 1981 .
In spite of Iraqi diplomatic appeals , Kuwait and the Emirates increased oil production , harming their own economic interests , but damaging Iraq 's even more so .
Kuwait refused to relinquish Iraqi territory it had acquired during the Iran Iraq war which Kuwait had helped finance .
Kuwait also rejected production quotas and rejected appeals to cease pumping oil from Iraq 's Rumaila oil reserve .
It refused to forgo any of Iraq 's debt .
On September 18 , 1990 , the Iraqi Foreign Ministry published verbatim the transcripts of meetings between Saddam Hussein and high level U.S. officials .
Knight - Ridder columnist James McCartney acknowledged that the transcripts were not disputed by the U.S. State Department .
U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie informed Hussein that , " We have no opinion on ... conflicts like your border disagreement with Kuwait . "
She reiterated this position several times , and added , " Secretary of State James Baker has directed our official spokesman to emphasize this instruction . "
A week before Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait , Baker 's spokesperson , Margaret Tutwiler and Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly both stated publicly that " the United States was not obligated to come to Kuwait 's aid if it were attacked . "
( Santa Barbara News - Press September 24 , 1990 cited in [ 1 ] ) .
Two days before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait , Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly testified before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee that the United States has no defense treaty relationship with any Gulf country . "
The New York Daily News editorialized on September 29 , 1990 , " Small wonder Saddam concluded he could overrun Kuwait .
Bush and Co. gave him no reason to believe otherwise . " ( quoted in [ 1 ] ) .
The 1991 Gulf War
On August 2 , 1990 , Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait and quickly gained control of the country .
The United States , along with the United Nations , demanded the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces .
Attempts by Iraq to negotiate withdrawal were rebuffed by the United States .
U.S. military forces in the region had already rehearsed battle plans to repel an Iraqi invasion .
On January 16 , 1991 , U.S. and other allied forces launched a devastating attack of Iraq and its armed forces in Kuwait .
The Allied bombing was intended to damage Iraq 's infrastructure so as to hinder its ability to prosecute war by lowering both civilian and military morale .
The United States led the allied forces , but 34 nations also provided troops and / or financial support for the military operations .
Among these are : Afghanistan , Argentina , Australia , Bahrain , Bangladesh , Britain , Canada , Czechoslovakia , Denmark , Egypt , France , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Honduras , Italy , Kuwait , Morocco , The Netherlands , Niger , Norway , Oman , Pakistan , Poland , Portugal , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Senegal , South Korea , Spain , Syria , Turkey , and The United Arab Emirates .
( See : http://www.historyguy.com/GulfWar.html#gulfwardates or http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/gulf.war/facts/gulfwar/)
U.S. media portrayed the Iraqi military as a global threat and as a formidable military opponent to the United States .
Nevertheless , the military outcome of the war was one - sided in the extreme .
Of the more than 500,000 U.S. troops engaged in the war , 148 died in battle , many from " friendly fire . "
Total allied losses were minimal .
By contrast , in June 1991 , the U.S. military reported more than 100,000 Iraqi soldiers killed , 300,000 wounded .
Some human rights groups claimed a higher number of Iraqis killed in battle .
According to Baghdad , civilian casualties numbered more than 35,000 .
However , after the war , some scholars report that the number of Iraqi soldiers killed was significantly less than 100,000 .
Whatever the numbers , the Iraqi army was completely routed , and all surviving Iraqi military units withdrew to Iraq .
" Desert Storm , " as the war was called , destroyed 80 % of Iraq 's weaponry , and the international monitoring and inspections that followed the war ( see the next section ) , resulted in at least 90 % of Iraq 's pre-invasion weaponry eliminated .
Former U.S. Attorney General , Ramsey Clark , and International Action Center have reported devastating effects of the U.S. and British bombing on the Iraqi civilian population , including the use of depleted uranium from U.S. bombs that have led to cancer and unprecedented levels of birth defects in Iraq .
More than 600,000 pounds of depleted uranium was left in Iraq after the war ( See the International Action Center web site : http://www.iacenter.org/depleted/du.htm).
The war also had negative repercussions for U.S. soldiers .
Some have reported the effects " Gulf War Syndrome " and other debilitating health consequences from exposure to harmful chemical and / or biological agents ( see e.g .
http://mediafilter.org/MFF/CAQ/caq53.gws.html)
U.S. Disinformation Campaigns
It is difficult to document or even estimate the extent of psychological operations , propaganda projects , and disinformation propagated by the U.S. government to enlist public support for military campaigns against Iraq .
However , two examples have been documented and are well known : false reports of an Iraqi troop buildup threatening Saudi Arabia , and a manufactured story recited in congressional hearings about Iraqi soldiers killing newborn babies in a Kuwaiti hospital .
The film " Hidden Wars " [ 2 ] and Pacifica National Radio have presented coverage of these stories .
Fabricated Report of Iraqi Troop buildup
The following description is taken from http://www.swans.com/library/art8/ga138.html
The U.S. administration made the claim that the Iraqis had amassed troops and tanks along the Saudi border and were poised to invade the kingdom .
This claim was widely relayed by the main media .
The only problem with these allegations was that they were utterly false .
The former Soviet Union had provided satellite pictures , taken on September 11 and 13 , 1990 , of the border ( actually , they were selling the pictures for $ 1,500 each ) that clearly indicated that no concentration of Iraqi troops and equipment was in sight .
Major news organizations like ABC News ( Sam Donaldson ) or The Washington Post ( Bob Woodward ) sat on the pictures and never used them .
The only U.S. news organization that indeed published them was a regional paper , The St. Petersburg Times ( Florida ) .
Those pictures clearly showed , however , the concentration of U.S. troops on the Saudi side of the border !
John R. MacArthur ( and Ben Haig Bagdikian ) documented this falsity in their book , " Second Front : Censorship and Propaganda in the Gulf War , " University of California Press ; reprint edition 1993 ; ISBN : 0520083989 .
MacArthur also cited these facts in his above - mentioned speech , http://www.independent.org/tii/content/events/f_macarth.html.
Brian Becker debunked this claim in detail in his report .
Jean Heller , the Editor of The St. Petersburg Times hired a U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in the Reagan Administration , and a former image specialist for the Defense Intelligence Agency , Peter Zimmerman , to analyze the satellite photographs , to no avail .
There simply were no Iraqi troops poised to invade Saudi Arabia .
The following description is taken from http://www.swans.com/library/art8/ga138.html
" The readers may recall the testimony before Congress on October 10 , 1990 of a 15 - year old Kuwaiti woman , Nayirah ( her last name was kept confidential ) .
She had witnessed a terrifying deed by the Iraqi invaders of Kuwait .
In her own words : ' I volunteered at the al - Addan hospital .
While I was there , I saw the Iraqi soldiers come into the hospital with guns , and go into the room where . . . babies were in incubators .
They took the babies out of the incubators , took the incubators , and left the babies on the cold floor to die . '
The story about the 312 babies made the news with a vengeance .
President Bush ( that would be George I ) repeated it .
The line in the sand was drawn .
Like Racak , it turned public opinion and Congress on the path of war .
Months later we learned that Nayirah was the daughter of a Kuwaiti prince , Saud Nasir al - Sabah , Kuwait 's Ambassador to the U.S.
She had left Kuwait before the Iraqi invasion .
The story had been entirely fabricated by the PR firm Hill & Knowlton .
Tom Lantos , the California Democrat who chaired the hearing was co-chair ( with Republican Rep. John Porter ) of the Congressional Human Rights Foundation that occupied free office space in Hill & Knowlton 's Washington , DC office . "
One of the best documentation of this hoax can be found in a fascinating book , " Toxic Sludge Is Good for You , Lies , Damn Lies and the Public Relations Industry " by John C. Stauber , Sheldon Rampton , 1995 ; ( Common Courage Press ; ISBN : 1-56751-060-4 ) .
Stauber and Rampton are Executive Director and Editor , respectively , of PR Watch , a newsletter published by the Center for Media and Democracy .
An excerpt of the book on this PR issue was published in June 1996 by Claire W. Gilbert in her fine publication Blazing Tattles and can be read on line at http://www.blazingtattles.com/info/mother1.htm and http://www.blazingtattles.com/info/mother2.htm.
It 's an extraordinary read .
PR
Watch also recently posted these excerpts on their Web site , at http://www.prwatch.org/books/tsigfy10.html.
Last May 2002 , the former Hill & Knowlton staffer who was handling Nayirah made the claim that the story was true in O'Dwyer 's PR Daily , an online access to the inside news of Public Relations but was forcefully rebuked by PR Watch Editor , Sheldon Rampton .

The Devastating Effects of Sanctions
Four days after Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait , on August 6 , 1990 , the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 661 , imposing comprehensive sanctions on Iraq and creating a committee to monitor them .
The U.S. agreed to a cease fire with Iraq in February 1991 .
The cease - fire agreement required Iraq to eliminate its chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and missiles with a range over 150 kilometers .
Set forth in U.N. security resolution 687 , the agreement tied the lifting of U.N. sanctions to the destruction of Iraq 's " Weapons of Mass Destruction " arsenal .
The no-fly zones over two - thirds of Iraq ( north and south ) were imposed by the U.S. , France , and Britain a year and a half after the Gulf War .
The United Nations never sanctioned them , and France has since withdrawn from participation .
The no-fly zones violate international law .
According to Article 51 of the U.N. Charter , Iraq has the right to defend itself , including from U.S. and British overflights of the no-fly zones .
The United Nations " Oil for Food " program became operational in 1996 and was instituted by the Iraq Sanctions Committee .
All contracts for aid ( emergency supplies as well as infrastructure equipment ) requested by Iraq had to be approved by the Sanctions Committee .
Each member country could place a hold on any contract it considered to have " dual use , " that is , both civilian and military use .
The U.S. repeatedly exercised its prerogative to withhold supplies to Iraq , vital to the civilian population .
In an article , " Throttling Iraq , " published in the Sept - Oct 2000 New Left Review , Tariq Ali described the circumstances confronting the civilian population of Iraq as follows :
A land that once had high levels of literacy and an advanced system of health - care has been devastated by the West .
Its social structure is in ruins , its people are denied the basic necessities of existence , its soil is polluted by uranium - tipped warheads .
According to UN figures of last year , some 60 per cent of the population have no regular access to clean water , and over 80 per cent of schools need substantial repairs .
In 1997 the FAO reckoned that 27 percent of Iraqis were suffering from chronic malnutrition , and 70 percent of all women were anaemic .
UNICEF reports that in the southern and central regions which contain 85 percent of the country 's population , infant mortality has doubled compared to the pre-Gulf war period .
The death - toll caused by deliberate strangulation of economic life cannot yet be estimated with full accuracy -- that will be a task for historians .
According to the most careful authority , Richard Garfield , 'a conservative estimate of " excess deaths " among under five - year - olds since 1991 would be 300,000 ' , while UNICEF -- reporting in 1997 that ' 4,500 children under the age of five are dying each month from hunger and disease '- reckons the number of small children killed by the blockade at 500,000 .
Other deaths are more difficult to quantify , but as Garfield points out , 'UNICEF 's mortality rates represent only the tip of the iceberg as to the enormous damage done to the four out of five Iraqis who do survive beyond their fifth birthday ' .
In late 1998 the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq , former Assistant Secretary General Denis Halliday , an Irishman , resigned from his post in protest against the blockade , declaring that total deaths that it had caused could be upwards of a million .
When his successor Hans von Sponeck had the temerity to include civilian casualties from Anglo - American bombing raids in his brief , the Clinton and Blair regimes demanded his dismissal .
He too resigned , in late 1999 , explaining that his duty had been to the people of Iraq , and that ' every month Iraq 's social fabric shows bigger holes ' .
These holes have continued to tear under the Oil - For - Food sanctions in place since 1996 , which allow Iraq $ 4 billion of petroleum exports a year , when a minimum of $ 7 billion is needed even for greatly reduced services .
After a decade , the throttling of Iraq by the US and UK has achieved a result without parallel in modern history .
This is now a country that , in Garfield 's words , 'is the only instance of a sustained , large increase in mortality in a stable population of more than two million in the last two hundred years ' .
( http://www.zmag.org/aliiraq.htm)
" ... the targets included water treatment plants , sewage treatment plants , electrical generating plants , communications centers , on the theory , I suppose , of dual use , that the Iraqi military also needs clean water , sewage treatment , communications , etc. and therefore the fact that the 23 million people of Iraq might be denied clean water was considered an acceptable consequence of that .
So there were very direct efforts made by the U.S. , and they were very successful efforts , to destroy these kinds of infrastructure centers .
The result has been absolute devastation for the civilian population at enormous cost in the future to be repaired .
As they erode further , the cost of rebuilding them of course will climb even higher .
During this last set of military strikes , Operation Desert Fox , last December , at least one oil refinery was deliberately targeted on the grounds that that particular refinery 's output was being used for smuggling .
Whether it was or not , I do n't know .
But whether it was or not , it is a violation of international law to deliberately target an economic target , as was chosen here , meaning that everyone in the Pentagon involved in that decision is guilty of a war crime .
The inability of Iraq to make those repairs means that the continuation of malnutrition , of inadequate water supplies , and most importantly , perhaps , the largest number of casualties today , is the result of dirty , contaminated water because of inadequate sewage treatment and water treatment facilities .
What that means is that children are dying in Iraq of eminently treatable diseases : diarrhea , typhoid , and other contaminated - water - borne diseases , in a country whose advanced health care system was so developed before the sanctions regime and before the bombings that the most important problem faced by Iraqi pediatricians was childhood obesity . "
" Several United States Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) documents clearly and thoroughly prove , in the words of one author , " beyond a doubt that , contrary to the Geneva Convention , the U.S. government intentionally used sanctions against Iraq to degrade the country 's water supply after the Gulf War .
The United States knew the cost that civilian Iraqis , mostly children , would pay , and it went ahead anyway " ( The Progressive , August 2001 ) . "
( http://www.geocities.com/iraqinfo/sanctions/sarticles9/mandf.htm)
Lesley Stahl on U.S. sanctions against Iraq : " We have heard that a half million children have died .
I mean , that 's more children than died in Hiroshima .
And , you know , is the price worth it ? "
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright : " I think this is a very hard choice , but the price -- we think the price is worth it . "
United Nations weapons inspectors were ordered out of Iraq in 1998 , not by the Iraqi government , but by the United States .
In the words of Scott Ritter , a former U.N. Chief Weapons Inspector in Iraq :
" The U.S. ordered the inspectors out 48 hours before they initiated Operation Desert Fox military action that did n't have the support of the U.N. Security Council and which used information gathered by the inspectors , to target Iraq . "

U.S. Foreign Policy Objectives
A Los Angeles Times article dated October 27 2002 appearing on the first page of the Business Section provided a possible agenda for the Bush administration for the Middle East .
The article , " Iraq Regime Change Could Weaken OPEC " included the byline , " Restoring the country 's oil production capacity might be enough to break the cartel 's grip on world markets , " and included this explanation :
Some industry analysts say the restoration of Iraq 's production capability over the next decade might be enough to break OPEC 's grip on world oil markets , even if Iraq remained a nominal member .
" It 's tough to see Iraq under any circumstances really participating closely with OPEC in the next five years , " said analyst Raad Alkadiri of Petroleum Finance Co. in Washington .
" If you have a government in Iraq that is closely tied to the United States and dependent on the United States for its continued power , it is conceivable that it will feel pressure to leave OPEC . "
U.S. Undersecretary of State Grant Aldonas cited the potential economic payoff during a recent trip to Poland .
A regime change , he said in Warsaw , would " open up the spigot on Iraqi oil , which would have a profound effect in terms of the performance of the world economy . "
A U.S. - led ouster of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein could open a bonanza for American oil companies long banished from Iraq , scuttling oil deals between Baghdad and Russia , France and other countries , and reshuffling world petroleum markets , according to industry officials and leaders of the Iraqi opposition .
The importance of Iraq 's oil has made it potentially one of the administration 's biggest bargaining chips in negotiations to win backing from the U.N. Security Council and Western allies for President Bush 's call for tough international action against Hussein .
All five permanent members of the Security Council -- the United States , Britain , France , Russia and China -- have international oil companies with major stakes in a change of leadership in Baghdad .
" It 's pretty straightforward , " said former CIA director R. James Woolsey , who has been one of the leading advocates of forcing Hussein from power .
" France and Russia have oil companies and interests in Iraq .
They should be told that if they are of assistance in moving Iraq toward decent government , we 'll do the best we can to ensure that the new government and American companies work closely with them . "
But he added : " If they throw in their lot with Saddam , it will be difficult to the point of impossible to persuade the new Iraqi government to work with them . "
Concluding Remarks
Saddam Hussein does not deserve support from the progressive community , but Saddam Hussein is not Iraq .
It is the people of Iraq who will do most of the dying when and if the U.S. attacks them , and the people of Iraq deserve our support .
The claim that Iraq poses a grave danger to the rest of the world , and to the United States in particular , is so ridiculous that it would not even merit the attention of a rebuttal except for the fact that U.S. government propaganda has been so successful in fabricating that threat .
Part of the propaganda success stems from completely unsupported claims that Saddam Hussein is in league with al Qaeda .
The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency has found no credible connection between Saddam Hussein and bin Laden and / or al Qaeda .
Moreover , such an alliance is implausible .
Iraq is a secular state whereas al Qaeda is fundamentalist , and the two do not mix well .
Militarily , Iraq is far weaker in 2003 than it was in 1990 when the United States defeated Iraq 's armies in a matter of hours .
With at least 90 % of its pre-Gulf
War weaponry destroyed , Iraq is completely vulnerable to outside attack and poses no realistic threat to the United States , or to other countries .
The U.S. accusation that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction ( whether they actually exist or not ) is subterfuge for the Bush administration 's real agenda : control of the oil resources of the Middle East .
The hypocrisy of U.S. policy toward Iraq may be seen by comparing it to U.S. policy toward other countries .
For example , Israel possesses nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons .
Israel has violated United Nations resolutions ; it has threatened and attacked neighboring countries ; and Israel is guilty of extensive human rights violations .
Yet , there is no talk from Washington of weapons inspections in Israel , much less of an invasion of that country .
Indeed , the U.S. arms Israel and provides it with massive economic and political support .
The ultimate hypocrisy in Washington 's focus on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction is that the U.S. itself leads the world in the possession and production of weapons of mass destruction .
The U.S. has weapons of every imaginable variety , including a nuclear arsenal sufficient to obliterate human life on this planet .
If weapons of mass destruction were a real concern to Washington , weapons inspections and disarmament would begin at home .

With 186 stores in the US , Apple has a retail presence in 37 of the 50 states .
29 of those states have multiple stores , including New York with 13 , Florida with 14 , and California with 38 .
That 's why it makes total sense that Apple would build an entire fake store on the Warner Brothers parking lot in Los Angeles over Memorial Day weekend in order to film a commercial .
According to Valleywag , that is exactly what the computer company did .
According to the site 's sources , the set took two days to build and was used to film a commercial that will air during the WWDC keynote .
The store was full - size and sported all of the hardware and software that one would expect in a ( real ) Apple Store .
Rather then shutting down a low - traffic Apple Store somewhere in middle - America , Apple instead chose to presumably pay workers overtime and holiday time to have an almost completely private set in California .
The set was apparently closed to all but a few select crew members ; Valleywag assumes the move was made to prevent the amount of hoopla that surrounded the closing of the 5th Avenue store for a commercial shoot recently .
If all this is to be believed , and we have no reason to think it is n't , then Apple seems to be up to some super top - secret commercial filming here .
Could it be just 3G iPhones or something bigger ?
Just one more week .
You can do it .

Secure Passwords Keep You Safer
Italian translation
Ever since I wrote about the 34,000 MySpace passwords I analyzed , people have been asking how to choose secure passwords .
My piece aside , there ’s been a lot written on this topic over the years — both serious and humorous — but most of it seems to be based on anecdotal suggestions rather than actual analytic evidence .
What follows is some serious advice .
The attack I ’m evaluating against is an offline password - guessing attack .
This attack assumes that the attacker either has a copy of your encrypted document , or a server ’s encrypted password file , and can try passwords as fast as he can .
There are instances where this attack does n’t make sense .
ATM cards , for example , are secure even though they only have a four - digit PIN , because you ca n’t do offline password guessing .
And the police are more likely to get a warrant for your Hotmail account than to bother trying to crack your e-mail password .
Your encryption program ’s key - escrow system is almost certainly more vulnerable than your password , as is any “ secret question ” you ’ve set up in case you forget your password .
Offline password guessers have gotten both fast and smart .
AccessData sells Password Recovery Toolkit , or PRTK .
Depending on the software it ’s attacking , PRTK can test up to hundreds of thousands of passwords per second , and it tests more common passwords sooner than obscure ones .
So the security of your password depends on two things : any details of the software that slow down password guessing , and in what order programs like PRTK guess different passwords .
Some software includes routines deliberately designed to slow down password guessing .
Good encryption software does n’t use your password as the encryption key ; there ’s a process that converts your password into the encryption key .
And the software can make this process as slow as it wants .
The results are all over the map .
Microsoft Office , for example , has a simple password - to - key conversion , so PRTK can test 350,000 Microsoft Word passwords per second on a 3 - GHz Pentium 4 , which is a reasonably current benchmark computer .
WinZip used to be even worse — well over a million guesses per second for version 7.0 — but with version 9.0 , the cryptosystem ’s ramp - up function has been substantially increased : PRTK can only test 900 passwords per second .
PGP also makes things deliberately hard for programs like PRTK , also only allowing about 900 guesses per second .
When attacking programs with deliberately slow ramp - ups , it ’s important to make every guess count .
A simple six - character lowercase exhaustive character attack , “ aaaaaa ” through “ zzzzzz , ” has more than 308 million combinations .
And it ’s generally unproductive , because the program spends most of its time testing improbable passwords like “ pqzrwj . ”
According to Eric Thompson of AccessData , a typical password consists of a root plus an appendage .
A root is n’t necessarily a dictionary word , but it ’s something pronounceable .
An appendage is either a suffix ( 90 percent of the time ) or a prefix ( 10 percent of the time ) .
So the first attack PRTK performs is to test a dictionary of about 1,000 common passwords , things like “ letmein , ” “ password1 , ” “ 123456 ” and so on .
Then it tests them each with about 100 common suffix appendages : “ 1 , ” “ 4u , ” “ 69 , ” “ abc , ” “ ! ” and so on .
Believe it or not , it recovers about 24 percent of all passwords with these 100,000 combinations .
Then , PRTK goes through a series of increasingly complex root dictionaries and appendage dictionaries .
The root dictionaries include :
Common word dictionary : 5,000 entries
Names dictionary : 10,000 entries
Comprehensive dictionary : 100,000 entries
Phonetic pattern dictionary : 1/10,000 of an exhaustive character search
The phonetic pattern dictionary is interesting .
It ’s not really a dictionary ; it ’s a Markov - chain routine that generates pronounceable English - language strings of a given length .
For example , PRTK can generate and test a dictionary of very pronounceable six - character strings , or just - barely pronounceable seven - character strings .
They ’re working on generation routines for other languages .
PRTK also runs a four - character - string exhaustive search .
It runs the dictionaries with lowercase ( the most common ) , initial uppercase ( the second most common ) , all uppercase and final uppercase .
It runs the dictionaries with common substitutions : “ $ ” for “ s , ” “ @ ” for “ a , ” “ 1 ” for “ l ” and so on .
Anything that ’s “ leet speak ” is included here , like “ 3 ” for “ e . ”
The appendage dictionaries include things like :
All two - digit combinations
All dates from 1900 to 2006
All three - digit combinations
All single symbols
All single digit , plus single symbol
All two - symbol combinations
AccessData ’s secret sauce is the order in which it runs the various root and appendage dictionary combinations .
The company ’s research indicates that the password sweet spot is a seven - to nine - character root plus a common appendage , and that it ’s much more likely for someone to choose a hard - to - guess root than an uncommon appendage .
Normally , PRTK runs on a network of computers .
Password guessing is a trivially distributable task , and it can easily run in the background .
A large organization like the Secret Service can easily have hundreds of computers chugging away at someone ’s password .
A company called Tableau is building a specialized FPGA hardware add - on to speed up PRTK for slow programs like PGP and WinZip : roughly a 150 - to 300 - times performance increase .
How good is all of this ?
Eric Thompson estimates that with a couple of weeks ’ to a month ’s worth of time , his software breaks 55 percent to 65 percent of all passwords .
( This depends , of course , very heavily on the application . )
Those results are good , but not great .
But that assumes no biographical data .
Whenever it can , AccessData collects whatever personal information it can on the subject before beginning .
If it can see other passwords , it can make guesses about what types of passwords the subject uses .
How big a root is used ?
What kind of root ?
Does he put appendages at the end or the beginning ?
Does he use substitutions ?
ZIP codes are common appendages , so those go into the file .
So do addresses , names from the address book , other passwords and any other personal information .
This data ups PRTK ’s success rate a bit , but more importantly it reduces the time from weeks to days or even hours .
So if you want your password to be hard to guess , you should choose something not on any of the root or appendage lists .
You should mix upper and lowercase in the middle of your root .
You should add numbers and symbols in the middle of your root , not as common substitutions .
Or drop your appendage in the middle of your root .
Or use two roots with an appendage in the middle .
Even something lower down on PRTK ’s dictionary list — the seven - character phonetic pattern dictionary — together with an uncommon appendage , is not going to be guessed .
Neither is a password made up of the first letters of a sentence , especially if you throw numbers and symbols in the mix .
And yes , these passwords are going to be hard to remember , which is why you should use a program like the free and open - source Password Safe to store them all in .
( PRTK can test only 900 Password Safe 3.0 passwords per second . )
Even so , none of this might actually matter .
AccessData sells another program , Forensic Toolkit , that , among other things , scans a hard drive for every printable character string .
It looks in documents , in the Registry , in e-mail , in swap files , in deleted space on the hard drive … everywhere .
And it creates a dictionary from that , and feeds it into PRTK .
And PRTK breaks more than 50 percent of passwords from this dictionary alone .
What ’s happening is that the Windows operating system ’s memory management leaves data all over the place in the normal course of operations .
You ’ll type your password into a program , and it gets stored in memory somewhere .
Windows swaps the page out to disk , and it becomes the tail end of some file .
It gets moved to some far out portion of your hard drive , and there it ’ll sit forever .
Linux and Mac OS are n’t any better in this regard .
I should point out that none of this has anything to do with the encryption algorithm or the key length .
A weak 40 - bit algorithm does n’t make this attack easier , and a strong 256 - bit algorithm does n’t make it harder .
These attacks simulate the process of the user entering the password into the computer , so the size of the resultant key is never an issue .
For years , I have said that the easiest way to break a cryptographic product is almost never by breaking the algorithm , that almost invariably there is a programming error that allows you to bypass the mathematics and break the product .
A similar thing is going on here .
The easiest way to guess a password is n’t to guess it at all , but to exploit the inherent insecurity in the underlying operating system .

QUESTION : Some are raising that the privacy aspects of this thing , you know , sharing of that kind of data , very personal data , among four countries is quite a scary thing .
SECRETARY CHERTOFF : Well , first of all , a fingerprint is hardly personal data because you leave it on glasses and silverware and articles all over the world , they ’re like footprints .
They ’re not particularly private .

Styles and Themes
The " themed " aspect of the new Ttk widgets is one of the most powerful and exciting aspects of the new widget set .
Yet because it does things quite differently from how Tk has traditionally worked , and because in trying to be flexible it does a lot of things , it 's certainly the most confusing for many people .
Definitions
We 'll first define a few concepts and terms that Ttk themes and styles rely on .
Widget Class
A widget class is used by Tk to identify the type of a particular widget ; essentially , whether it is a button , a label , a canvas , etc .
In classic Tk , all buttons had the same class ( " Button " ) , all labels had the same class ( " Label " ) , etc .
You could use this widget class both for introspection and for changing options globally via the option database .
This could let you say , for example , that all buttons by default had a red background .
There were a few classic
Tk widgets , including frame and toplevel widgets , which would allow you to change the widget class of a particular widget when the widget was first created , by passing it a " class " configuration option .
So while normally frames would have a widget class of " Frame " , you could specify that one particular frame widget had a widget class of " SpecialFrame " .
Because of that , you could use the option database to define different looks for different types of frame widgets ( not just all frame widgets , or frame widgets located at a particular place in the hierarchy ) .
What Ttk does is take that simple idea and give it rocket boosters .
Widget State
A widget state allows a single widget to have more than one appearance or behavior , depending on things like mouse position , different state options set by the application , and so on .
In classic Tk , several widgets had " state " configuration options which allowed you to set them to " normal " or " disabled " ; a " disabled " state for a button , for example , would draw its label greyed out .
Some used an additional state , " active , " again which represented a different behavior .
The widget itself , or more typically , the widget 's class bindings , controlled how the appearance of the widget changed in different states , typically via consulting widget configuration options like " foreground " , " activeforeground " , and " disabledforeground " .
Ttk again extends and generalizes this basic idea of widget state , in two important ways .
First , rather than being widget - specific , all Ttk widgets have state options , and in fact , all have exactly the same state options , accessed by the " state " and " instate " widget commands .
A Ttk widget state is actually a set of independent state flags , containing zero or more of the following flags : " active " , " disabled " , " focus " , " pressed " , " selected " , " background " , " readonly " , " alternate " , or " invalid " ( see the widget page in the reference manual for exact meanings ) .
Note that while all of these state flags are available for every widget , they may not be used by each widget .
For example , a label widget is likely to ignore an " invalid " state flag , and so no special appearance would be associated with that flag .
The second major change that Ttk makes is that it takes the decision of what to change when the state is adjusted out of the widget 's control .
That is , a widget author will no longer hardcode logic to the effect of " when the state is disabled , consult the disabledforeground configuration option and use that for the foreground color . "
With that logic hardcoded , not only did it make coding widgets longer ( and more repetitive ) but also restricted how a widget could be changed based on its state .
That is , if the widget author had n't coded in logic to change the font when the state changed , you as the user of the widget were out of luck .
Instead of hardcoding these decisions within each widget , Ttk moves the decisions into a separate location : styles .
This means that the widget author does n't need to provide code for every possible appearance option , which not only simplifies the widget but paradoxically ensures that a wider range of appearances can be set , including those the widget author may not have anticipated .
Style
That brings us then to define a widget style .
Very simply , a style describes the appearance ( or appearances ) of a Ttk widget class .
All widgets created with that widget class will have the same appearance (s ) .
While each themed widget has a default class ( e.g. " TButton " for " ttk::button " widgets ) , you can , unlike in classic Tk , assign a different widget class for any themed widget you create .
This is done using Ttk's " style " configuration option , which all themed widgets support .
So a style defines the normal appearance of widgets of a certain widget class , but can also define variations of that appearance that depend on the current state flag .
For example , a style can specify that when the " pressed " state flag is set , the appearance should change in a particular way .
Because of this , a style can describe one or more ways for the widget to appear , depending on the state .
The rest of this chapter will delve into far more detail of what a style actually is , but at least now you know the responsibility it has .
Themes
You can think of a theme as a collection of styles .
While each style is widget - specific ( one for buttons , one for entries , etc. ) a theme will collect many styles together .
Typically , a theme will then define one style for each type of widget , but each of those styles will be designed so that they visually " fit " together with each other — though perhaps , unfortunately , Ttk does n't technically restrict bad design or judgement !
To use a particular theme for an application is really to say that you 'd like to have a set of styles defined so that by default all the different type of widgets will have some common appearance , and fit in well with each other .
Using Styles and Themes
So now we know what styles and themes are supposed to do , but how exactly do we use them ?
To do this , we need to know how to refer to styles and themes , and how to apply them to a widget or user interface .
Style Names
Every style has a name .
If you 're going to modify a style , create a new one , or use a style for a widget , you need to know its name .
How do you know what the names of the styles are ?
If you have a particular widget , and you want to know what style it is currently using , you can first check the value of its " style " configuration option .
If that is empty , it means the widget is using the default style for the widget .
You can retrieve that via the widget 's class .
For example :
% ttk::button .b .b % .b cget - style # empty string as a result % winfo class .b TButton
>> b = Tk :: Tile::Button.new ( parent ) => # >> b [ ' style ' ] => [ ] >> TkWinfo.classname(b ) =>
" TButton "
Perl > $ b = $ mw->new_ttk__button ( ) .b Perl > $ b -> cget ( - style ) # empty string as a result Perl > Tkx : : winfo( ' class ' , $ b ) TButton
>>> b = ttk.Button ( ) >>> b[ ' style ' ] '' >>> b.winfo_class ( ) ' TButton '
So in this case , the style that is being used is " TButton " .
The default styles for other themed widgets are named similarly , e.g. " TEntry " , " TLabel " , " TSizeGrip " , etc .
It 's always wise to check specifics though ; for example , the treeview widget 's class is " Treeview " , not " TTreeview " .
Beyond the default styles though , styles can be named pretty much anything .
You might create your own style ( or use a theme that has a style ) named " FunButton " , " NuclearReactorButton " , or even " GuessWhatIAm " ( not a smart choice ) .
More often , you 'll find names like " Fun. TButton " or " NuclearReactor .
TButton " , which suggest variations of a base style ; as you 'll see , this is something Ttk supports for creating and modifying styles .
The ability to retrieve a list of all currently available styles is currently not supported .
Using a Style
To use a style means to apply that style to an individual widget .
If you know the name of the style you want to use , and which widget to apply it to , it 's easy .
Setting the style can be done at creation time :
ttk::button .b - text " Hello " - style " Fun. TButton "
b = Tk :: Tile::Button.new ( parent ) {text " Hello " ; style " Fun. TButton " }
$ b = $ parent->new_ttk__button ( - text => " Hello " , - style => " Fun. TButton " ) ;
b = ttk .
Button ( parent , text =' Hello ' , style= ' Fun. TButton ')
As well , you can change the style of a widget at any time after you 've created it with the " style " configuration option :
. b configure - style " NuclearReactor .
TButton "
b [ ' style ' ] = " NuclearReactor .
TButton "
$ b->configure ( - style => " NuclearReactor .
TButton " ) ;
b [ ' style ' ] = ' NuclearReactor .
TButton '
Using Themes
While styles control the appearance of individual widgets , themes control the appearance of the entire user interface .
The ability to switch between themes is one of the significant features of the themed widgets .
Like styles , themes are identified by a name .
You can obtain the names of all available themes :
% ttk :: style theme names aqua clam alt default classic
>> Tk :: Tile:: Style.theme_names => [ " aqua " , " step " , " clam " , " alt " , " default " , " classic " ]
Perl > Tkx::ttk__style_theme_names ( ) aqua clam alt default classic
>>> s = ttk . Style( ) >>> s.theme_names ( ) ( ' aqua ' , ' step ' , ' clam ' , ' alt ' , ' default ' , ' classic ' )
Only one theme can ever be active at a time .
To obtain the name of the theme currently in use , you can use the following :
This API , which was originally targeted for Tk 8.6 , was back - ported to Tk 8.5.9 .
If you 're using an earlier version of Tk getting this info is a bit trickier .
% ttk :: style theme use aqua
>> Tk.tk_call ( ' ttk : : style ' , ' theme ' , 'use ' ) => " aqua " As of Ruby 1.9.3 - p0 , the Tk : : Tile :: Style .
theme_use API had n't been updated to allow querying the current style .
This will probably change soon .
Perl > Tkx::ttk__style_theme_use ( ) aqua
>>> s.theme_use ( ) ' aqua '
Switching to a new theme can be done with :
ttk :: style theme use themename
Tk : : Tile :: Style.theme_use " themename "
Tkx ::ttk__style_theme_use(" themename " ) ;
s.theme_use ( ' themename ' )
What does this actually do ?
Obviously , it sets the current theme to the indicated theme .
Doing this , therefore , replaces all the currently available styles with the set of styles defined by the theme .
Finally , it refreshes all widgets , so that they take on the appearance described by the new theme .
What 's Inside a Style ?
If all you want to do is use a style , you now know everything you need .
If however , you want to create your own styles or modify an existing one , now it gets " interesting " .
Elements
While each style represents a single widget , each widget is normally composed of smaller pieces , called elements .
It 's the job of the style author to construct the entire widget out of these smaller elements .
What these elements are depends on the widget .
Here 's an example of a button .
It might have a border on the very outside , which is one element .
Just inside that , there may be a focus ring , which is normally just the background color but may be highlighted when the user tabs into the button .
So that 's a second element .
Then there might be some spacing between that focus ring and the button 's label .
So that spacing would be a third element .
Finally , there is the label of the button itself , a fourth element .
Possible Elements of a Button .
Why might the style author have divided it up that way ?
If you have one part of the widget that may be in a different location from another or might be a different color than another , it may be a good candidate for an element .
Note that this is just one example of how a button could be constructed from elements .
Different styles and themes could ( and do ) accomplish this in different ways .
Here is a second example of a vertical scrollbar , containing a " trough " element containing the rest , which includes the up and down arrow elements at either end and a " thumb " element in the middle .
Possible Elements of a Scrollbar .
Layout
Besides the choice of which elements are part of a widget , a style also defines how those elements are arranged within the widget , or in other words , their layout .
In the button example , we had a label element inside a spacing element , inside a focus ring element , inside a border element .
So the logical layout is like this :
border { focus { spacing { label } } }
We can ask Ttk what the layout of the TButton style is like this :
% ttk:: style layout TButton Button . border - sticky nswe - border 1 - children { Button .
focus - sticky nswe - children { Button .
spacing - sticky nswe - children { Button.label - sticky nswe}}}
>> Tk :: Tile:: Style.layout(' TButton ' ) => [ [ " Button.border " , { " children " = > [ [ " Button.focus " , {" children " = > [ [ " Button.spacing " , { " children " = > [ [ " Button.label " , { " sticky " => " nswe " } ] ] , " sticky " = > " nswe " } ] ] , " sticky " = > " nswe " } ] ] , " sticky " = > " nswe " , " border " = > " 1 " } ] ]
Perl > Tkx ::ttk__style_layout(' TButton ')
Button. button - sticky nswe - border 1 - children { Button .
padding - sticky nswe - children { Button .
spacing - sticky nswe - children { Button.label - sticky nswe}}}
>>> s.layout (' TButton ' ) [ ( " Button.border " , { " children " : [ ( " Button.focus " , { " children " : [ ( " Button.spacing " , { " children " : [ ( " Button.label " , { " sticky " : " nswe " } ) ] , " sticky " : " nswe " } ) ] , " sticky " : " nswe " } ) ] , " sticky " : " nswe " , " border " : " 1 " } ) ]
If we clean this up and format it a bit , we get something with this structure :
Button . border - sticky nswe - border 1 - children { Button .
focus - sticky nswe - children { Button . spacing - sticky nswe - children { Button.label - sticky nswe } } }
This starts to make sense ; we have four elements , named " Button.border " , " Button.focus " , " Button.spacing " , and " Button.label " .
Each of these has different element options , such as " - children " , " - sticky " , and " - border " that here specify layout or sizes .
Without getting into two much detail at this point , we can clearly see the nested layout , based on the " - children " and " - sticky " attributes ;
Ttk uses a simplified version of Tk's " pack " geometry manager to specify element layout .
Element Options
Each of these different elements may have a number of different options .
For example , the thumb of the scrollbar may have an option to set its background color , or another to provide the width of a border , if any .
These can be customized to adjust how the elements within the widget look .
What options are available for each element ?
Here 's an example of checking what options are available for the label inside the button ( which we know from the " layout " command is identified as " Button.label " ) :
% ttk:: style element options Button.label - compound - space - text - font - foreground - underline - width - anchor - justify - wraplength - embossed - image - stipple - background
>> Tk :: Tile::Style.element_options (" Button.label " ) => ...
Perl > Tkx::ttk__style_element_options ( " Button.label " ) - compound - space - text - font - foreground - underline - width - anchor - justify - wraplength - embossed - image - stipple - background
>>> s.element_options (' Button.label ' ) ( ' - compound ' , ' - space ' , ' - text ' , '- font ' , '- foreground ' , '- underline ' , '- width ' , '- anchor ' , '- justify ' , '- wraplength ' , '- embossed ' , '- image ' , '- stipple ' , '- background ' )
Presumably these options should n't have the leading dash on them .
In the next sections , we 'll take a look at the not - entirely - straightforward way that you can work with element options .
Changing Style Options
In this section , we 'll look at how you can change the style 's appearance via modifying style options .
You can do this either by modifying an existing style , or more typically , by creating a new style .
Modifying a Style Option
Modifying a configuration option for an existing style is done in a similar fashion as modifying any other configuration option , by specifying the style , name of the option , and new value :
ttk :: style configure TButton - font " helvetica 24 "
Tk : : Tile:: Style.configure(' TButton ' , { " font " => " helvetica 24 " } )
Tkx ::ttk__style_configure(" TButton " , - font => " helvetica 24 " ) ;
s.configure (' TButton ' , font= ' helvetica 24 ' )
You 'll learn more about what the valid options are shortly .
If you need to retrieve the current value of an option , this can be done with the " lookup " method .
% ttk:: style lookup TButton - font helvetica 24
>> Tk :: Tile:: Style.lookup(' TButton ' , ' font ' ) => " helvetica 24 "
Perl > Tkx ::ttk__style_lookup (" TButton " , " - font " ) helvetica 24
>>> s.lookup(' TButton ' , ' font ' ) ' helvetica 24 '
Creating a New , Derived Style
If you modify an existing style , such as " TButton " , that modification will apply to all widgets using that style ( so by default , all buttons ) .
That may well be what you want to do .
More often , you 're interested in creating a new style that is similar to an existing one but varies in a certain aspect .
For example , you 'd like to have most of the buttons in your application keep their normal appearance , but create certain special " emergency " buttons , which will be highlighted in a different way .
In this case , creating a new style ( e.g. " Emergency . TButton " ) derived from the base style ( " TButton " ) would be the appropriate thing to do .
By prepending another name ( " Emergency " ) followed by a dot onto an existing style , you are implicitly creating a new style derived from the existing one .
So in this example , our new style will have exactly the same options as a regular button except for the indicated differences :
ttk :: style configure Emergency .
TButton - font " helvetica 24 " - foreground red - padding 10
Tk : : Tile:: Style.configure(' Emergency .
TButton ' , { " font " => " helvetica 24 " , " foreground " => " red " , " padding " => 10} )
Tkx ::ttk__style_configure(" Emergency.TButton " , - font => " helvetica 24 " , - foreground => " red " , - padding => 10 ) ;
s.configure ( ' Emergency .
TButton ' , font=' helvetica 24 ' , foreground='red ' , padding =10 )
State Specific Style Options
Besides the normal configuration options for the style , the widget author may have specified different options to use when the widget is in a particular widget state .
For example , when a button is disabled , you 'd like to have the color of the button 's label greyed out .
To do this , you can specify a " map " , which allows you to specify variations for one or more of a style 's configuration options .
For each configuration option , you can specify a list of widget states , along with the particular value the option should be assigned when the widget is in that state .
Remember that the state is composed of one or more state flags ( or their negation ) , as set by the widget 's " state " method , or queried via the " instate " method .
The following example provides for the following variations from a button 's " normal " appearance :
when the widget is in the disabled state , the background color should be set to " #d9d9d9 "
when the widget is in the active state ( mouse over it ) , the background color should be set to " #ececec "
when the widget is in the disabled state , the foreground color should be set to " # a3a3 a3 " ( this is in addition to the background color change we already noted )
when the widget is in the state where the button is pressed and the widget is not disabled , the relief should be set to " sunken "
ttk :: style map TButton \ - background [ list disabled # d9d9d9 active #ececec ] \ - foreground [ list disabled # a3 a3 a3 ] \ - relief [ list {pressed ! disabled} sunken ] \ ;
Tk : : Tile:: Style.map ( " TButton " , " background " => [ " disabled " = > " #d9d9d9 " , " active= > " #ececec " ] , " foreground " => [ " disabled " = > " #a3a3a3 " ] , " relief => [ " pressed ! disabled " = >" sunken " ] ) ;
PERLTODO
s.map (' TButton ' , background = [ ( ' disabled ' , '# d9d9d9 ) , ( ' active ' , '#ececec ) ] , foreground = [ ( ' disabled ' , '# a3a3 a3 ' ) ] , relief= [ ( ' pressed ' , '! disabled ' , ' sunken ' ) ] )
Remember that in the past , with classic
Tk widgets , exactly what changed when the widget was in each state would have been determined solely by the widget author .
With themed widgets , it is the style itself that determines what changes , which could include things that the original widget author had never anticipated .
Because widget states can contain multiple flags , it 's possible that more than one state will match for an option ( e.g. " pressed " and " pressed ! disabled " will both match if the widget 's " pressed " state flag is set ) .
The list of states is evaluated in the order you provide in the map command , with the first state in the list that matches being used .
Sound Difficult to you ?
So you now know that styles are made up of elements , which have a variety of options , and are composed together in a particular layout .
You can change various options on styles , to make all widgets using the style appear differently .
Any widgets using that style take on the appearance that the style defines .
Themes collect an entire set of related styles , making it easy to change the appearance of your entire user interface .
So what makes styles and themes so difficult in practice ?
Three things .
First :
You can only modify options for a style , not element options ( except sometimes ) .
We talked earlier about how to discover what elements were used in the style by examining the style 's layout , and also how to discover what options were available for each element .
But when we went to make changes to a style , we seemed to be configuring an option for the style , without specifying an individual element .
What 's going on ?
Again , using our button example , we had an element " Button.label " , which among other things had a " font " configuration option .
What happens is that when that " Button.label " element is drawn , it looks at the " font " configuration option set on the style to determine what font to draw itself in .
To understand why , you need to know that when a style includes an element as a piece of it , that element does not maintain any ( element - specific ) storage .
In particular , it does not store any configuration options itself .
When it needs to retrieve options , it does so via the containing style , which is passed to the element .
Individual elements , therefore , are " flyweight " objects in GoF pattern parlance .
Similarly , any other elements will lookup their configuration options from options set on the style .
What if two elements use the same configuration option ( like a background color ) ?
Because there is only one background configuration option , stored in the style , that means both elements will use the same background color .
You can't have one element use one background color , and the other use a different background color .
Except when you can .
There are a few nasty , widget - specific things called " sublayouts " in the current implementation which let you sometimes modify just a single element , via configuring an option like " TButton .
Label " ( rather than just " TButton " , the name of the style ) .
Are the cases where you can do this documented ?
Is there some way to introspect to determine when you can do this ?
No to both .
This is one area of the themed widget API that I definitely expect to evolve over time .
The second difficulty is also related to modifying style options :
Options that are available do n't necessarily have an effect , and it's not an error to modify a bogus option .
You 'll sometimes try to change an option that is supposed to exist according to element options , but it will have no effect .
As an example , you can't modify the background color of a button in the " aqua " theme used by macOS .
While there are valid reasons for these cases , at the moment it 's not easy to discover them , which can make experimenting frustrating at times .
Perhaps more frustrating when you 're experimenting is that specifying an " incorrect " style name or option name does not generate an error .
When doing a " configure " or " lookup " you can , in fact , specify any name at all for a style , and specify any name at all for an option .
So if you 're bored with the " background " and " font " options , feel free to configure a " dowhatimean " option .
It may not do anything , but it 's not an error .
Again , it may make it hard to know what you should be modifying and what you should n't .
This is one of the downsides of having a very lightweight and dynamic system .
You can create new styles by just providing their name when configuring style options ; this means you do n't need to explicitly create a style object .
At the same time , this does open itself to errors .
It 's also not possible to find out what styles currently exist or are used .
And because style options are really just a front end for element options , and the elements in a style can change at any time , it 's not necessarily obvious that options should be restricted to those referred to by current elements alone , which may themselves not all be introspectable .
Finally , here is the last thing that makes styles and themes so difficult :
The elements available , the names of those elements , which options are available or have an effect for each of those elements , and which are used for a particular widget can be different in every theme .
So ?
Keep in mind among other things that the default theme for each platform ( Windows , macOS , and Linux ) are different , ( which is a good thing ) .
Some implications of this :
If you want to define a new type of widget ( or more likely a variation of an existing widget ) for your application , you 're going to need to do it separately and differently for each theme your application uses ( so at least three for a cross- platform application ) .
The elements and options available will differ for each theme / platform , meaning you may have to come up with a quite different customization approach for each theme / platform .
The elements , names , and element options available with each theme are not typically documented ( outside of reading the theme definition files themselves ) , but are generally identified via theme introspection ( which we 'll see soon ) .
Because all themes are n't available on all platforms ( e.g. " aqua " will only run on macOS ) , you 'll need ready access to every platform and theme you need to run on .
As an example , here is what the layout of the " TButton " style looks like on the theme used by default on three different platforms , as well as the advertised options for each element ( not all of which have an effect ) :
Mac OS X Button. button - sticky nswe - children { Button .
padding - sticky nswe - children { Button.label - sticky nswe}} Button.button - Button . padding padding , relief , shiftrelief Button . label compound , space , text , font , foreground , underline , width , anchor , justify , wraplength , embossed , image , stipple , background Windows Button.
button - sticky nswe - children { Button .
focus - sticky nswe - children { Button .
padding - sticky nswe - children { Button.label - sticky nswe}}} Button.button - Button.focus - Button . padding padding , relief , shiftrelief Button . label compound , space , text , font , foreground , underline , width , anchor , justify , wraplength , embossed , image , stipple , background Linux Button .
border - sticky nswe - border 1 - children { Button .
focus - sticky nswe - children { Button .
padding - sticky nswe - children Button.label - sticky nswe}}} Button .
border background , borderwidth , relief Button .
focus focuscolor , focusthickness Button .
padding padding , relief , shiftrelief Button . label compound , space , text , font , foreground , underline , width , anchor , justify , wraplength , embossed , image , stipple , background
The bottom line is that in classic
Tk , where you had the ability to modify any of a large set of attributes for an individual widget , you'd be able to do something on one platform and it would sorta kinda work ( but probably need tweaking ) on others .
In themed Tk , the easy option just is n't there , and you 're pretty much forced to do it the right way if you want your application to work with multiple themes / platforms .
It 's more work up front .
Advanced : More on Elements
While that 's about as far as we 're going to go on styles and themes in this tutorial , for curious users and those who want to delve further into creating new themes , we can provide a few more interesting tidbits about elements .
Because elements are the building blocks of styles and themes , it begs the question of " where do elements come from ? "
Practically speaking , we can say that elements are normally created in C code , and conform to a particular API that the theming engine understands .
At the very lowest level , elements come from something called an element factory .
At present , there is a " default " one , which most themes use , and uses Tk drawing routines to create elements .
A second allows you to create elements from images and is actually accessible at the script level using the " ttk : : style element create " method ( from Tcl ) .
Finally , there is a third , Windows - specific engine using the underlying " Visual Styles " platform API .
If a theme uses elements created via a platform 's native widgets , the calls to use those native widgets will normally appear within that theme 's element specification code .
Of course , themes whose elements depend on native widgets or API calls can only run on the platforms that support them .
Themes will then take a set of elements , and use those to assemble the styles that are actually used by the widgets .
And given the whole idea of themes is so that several styles can share the same appearance , it 's not surprising that different styles share the same elements .
So while the " TButton " style includes a " Button. padding " element , and the " TEntry " style includes a " Entry. padding " element , underneath these padding elements are more than likely one and the same .
They may appear differently , but that 's because of different configuration options , which as we recall , are stored in the style that uses the element .
It 's also probably not surprising to find out that a theme can provide a set of common options which are used as defaults for each style , if the style does n't specify them otherwise .
This means that if pretty much everything in an entire theme has a green background , the theme does n't need to explicitly say this for each style .
This uses a root style named " . " ; after all , if " Fun. TButton " can inherit from " TButton " , why can't " TButton " inherit from " . " ?
Papaya is an exceptionally promising system for the exploration of tropical - tree genomes and fruit - tree genomics .
It has a relatively small genome of 372 megabases ( Mb ) 6 , diploid inheritance with nine pairs of chromosomes , a well - established transformation system7 , a short generation time ( 9 –15 months ) , continuous flowering throughout the year and a primitive sex-chromosome system8 .
It is a member of the Brassicales , sharing a common ancestor with Arabidopsis about 72 million years ago9 .
Papaya is ranked first on nutritional scores among 38 common fruits , based on the percentage of the United States Recommended Daily Allowance for vitamin A , vitamin C , potassium , folate , niacin , thiamine , riboflavin , iron and calcium , plus fibre .
Consumption of its fruit is recommended for preventing vitamin A deficiency , a cause of childhood blindness in tropical and subtropical developing countries .
The fruit , stems , leaves and roots of papaya are used in a wide range of medical applications , including production of papain , a valuable proteolytic enzyme .
A total of 2.8 million whole - genome shotgun ( WGS ) sequencing reads were generated from a female plant of transgenic cultivar SunUp , which was developed through transformation of Sunset that had undergone more than 25 generations of inbreeding10 .
The estimated residual heterozygosity of SunUp is 0.06 % ( Supplementary Note 1 ) .
After excluding low - quality and organellar reads , 1.6 million high - quality reads were assembled into contigs containing 271 Mb and scaffolds spanning 370 Mb including embedded gaps ( Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ) .
Of 16,362 unigenes derived from expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) , 15,064 ( 92.1 % ) matched this assembly .
Paired - end reads from 34,065 bacterial artificial chromosome ( BAC ) clones provided alignment to an fingerprinted contig ( FPC ) - based physical map ( Supplementary Note 2 ) .
Among 706 BAC end and WGS sequence - derived simple sequence repeats on the genetic map , 652 ( 92.4 % ) could be used to anchor 167 Mb of contigs or 235 Mb of scaffolds , to the 12 papaya linkage groups in the current genetic map ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ) .
Papaya chromosomes at the pachytene stage of meiosis are generally stained lightly by 4′,6 - diamidino - 2- phenylindole ( DAPI ) , revealing that the papaya genome is largely euchromatic .
However , highly condensed heterochromatin knobs were observed on most chromosomes ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ) , concentrated in the centromeric and pericentromeric regions .
The lengths of the pachytene bivalents that are heavily stained only account for approximately 17 % of the genome .
However , these cytologically distinct and highly condensed heterochromatic regions could represent 30 – 35 % of the genomic DNA11 .
A large portion of the heterochromatic DNA was probably not covered by the WGS sequence .
The 271 Mb of contig sequence should represent about 75 % of the papaya genome and more than 90 % of the euchromatic regions , which is similar to the 92.1 % of the EST and 92.4 % of genetic markers covered by the assembled genome and the theoretical 95 % coverage by 3 × WGS sequence12 .
Gene annotation was carried out using the TIGR Eukaryotic Annotation Pipeline .
The assembled genome was masked based on similarity to known repeat elements in RepBase and the TIGR Plant Repeat Database , plus a de novo papaya repeat database ( see Methods ) .
Ab initio gene predictions were combined with spliced alignments of proteins and transcripts to produce a reference gene set of 28,629 gene models ( Supplementary Table 3 ) .
A total of 21,784 ( 76.1 % ) of the predicted papaya genes with average length of 1,057 base pairs ( bp ) have similarity to proteins in the non-redundant database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information , with 9,760 ( 44.8 % ) of these supported by papaya unigenes .
Among 6,845 genes with average length 309 bp that had no hits to the non-redundant proteins , only 515 ( 7.5 % ) were supported by papaya unigenes , implying that the number of predicted papaya - specific genes was inflated .
If the 515 genes with unigene support represent 44.8 % of the total , then 1,150 predicted papaya - specific genes may be real , and the number of predicted genes in the assembled papaya genome would be 22,934 .
Considering the assembled genome covers 92.1 % of the unigenes and 92.4 % of the mapped genetic markers , the number of predicted genes in the papaya genome could be 7.9 % higher , or 24,746 , about 11 – 20 % less than Arabidopsis ( based on either the 27,873 protein coding and RNA genes , or including the 3,241 novel genes ) 2,13 , 34 % less than rice3 , 46 % less than poplar4 and 19 % less than grape5 ( Table 1 ) .

Comparison of the papaya genome with that of Arabidopsis sheds new light on angiosperm evolutionary history in several ways .
Considering only the 200 longest papaya scaffolds , we found 121 co-linear blocks .
The papaya blocks range in size from 1.36 Mb containing 181 genes to 0.16 Mb containing 19 genes ( a statistical , rather than a biological , lower limit ) ; the corresponding Arabidopsis regions range from 0.69 Mb containing 163 genes to 60 kilobases ( kb ) containing 18 genes .
Across the 121 papaya segments for which co-linearity can be detected , 26 show primary correspondence ( that is , excluding the effects of ancient triplication detailed below ) to only one Arabidopsis segment , 41 to two , 21 to three , 30 to four , and only 3 to more than four .
The fact that many papaya segments show co-linearity with two to four Arabidopsis segments ( Fig. 1 , and Supplementary Figs 3 and 4 ) is most parsimoniously explained if either one or two genome duplications have affected the Arabidopsis lineage since its divergence from papaya .
Although it was suspected that the most recent Arabidopsis genome duplication , α14 , might affect only a subset of the Brassicales15 , previous phylogenetic dating of these events15 had suggested that the more ancient β- duplication occurred early in the eudicot radiation , well before the Arabidopsis–Carica divergence .
This incongruity is under investigation .
Figure 1 : Alignment of co-linear regions from Arabidopsis ( green ) , papaya ( magenta ) , poplar ( blue ) and grape ( red ) .
‘ Vv chr 16 r ’ is an unordered ultracontig that has been assigned to grape chromosome 16 .
Triangles represent individual genes with transcriptional orientations .
Several Arabidopsis regions belong to previously identified duplication segments ( α3 , α11 , α20 , β 6 , γ 7 , shown to the right ) 23 .
The whole syntenic alignment supports four distinct whole - genome duplication events : α , β within the Arabidopsis lineage , an independent duplication in poplar , and γ which is shared by all four eudicot genomes .
Co-linear regions can be grouped into three γ sub-genomes based on Camin–Sokal parsimony criteria .

In contrast , individual Arabidopsis genome segments correspond to only one papaya segment , indicating that no genome duplication has occurred in the papaya lineage since its divergence from Arabidopsis about 72 million years ago5 .
The lack of relatively recent papaya genome doubling is further supported by an L - shaped distribution of intra-EST correspondence for papaya ( not shown ) .
However , multiple genome / subgenome alignments ( see Supplementary Methods ) reveal evidence in papaya of the ancient ‘ γ’ genome duplication shared with Arabidopsis and poplar that is postulated to have occurred near the origin of angiosperms 14 .
Indeed , both papaya ( with no subsequent duplication ) and poplar ( with a relatively low rate of duplicate gene loss ) suggest that γ was not a duplication but a triplication ( Fig. 1 ) , with triplicated patterns evident for about 25 % of the 247 Mb comprising the 200 largest papaya scaffolds .
This is most probably an underestimate that will increase as papaya contiguity is improved .
Triplication in papaya and poplar corresponds closely to the triplication suggested by an independent analysis of the grape genome5 .
A few hundred papaya chromosomal segments were aligned using BLASTZ to their one to four syntenic regions in Arabidopsis , and the results examined visually using the Genome Evolution ( GEvo ) viewer 16 .
The orthologous region of grape was also included5 , making the alignment a six - way comparison .
One example is given in Supplementary Fig. 5 : a 500 kb segment of papaya , its four 60 kb syntenic , orthologous Arabidopsis segments and the 400 kb orthologous segment of grape .
For the homologous Arabidopsis segments that are discernibly co-linear ( by MC - SCANNER ) to the 200 longest papaya scaffolds , 34.8 % of Arabidopsis genes in any one segment correspond to a papaya gene , whereas only 24.8 % of papaya genes in any one segment correspond to an Arabidopsis gene .
Moreover , the Arabidopsis homologous segments contain fewer genes , on average only about 57.9 % of the number in their papaya counterparts .
Papaya provides a useful outgroup necessary to detect subfunctionalization .
Supplementary Fig. 6 is a GEvo screenshot of a blastn alignment illustrating subfunctionalization of conserved non-coding sequences ( CNSs ) 17 upstream of two syntenic , duplicate Arabidopsis genes and their single papaya orthologous gene .
The α-duplicated genomes within Arabidopsis are perfect for CNS discovery18 .
Comparative analysis of the papaya and Arabidopsis 5 ′ untranslated regions showed that only 14 % of orthologous promoter pairs exhibit significantly higher levels of sequence identity than random comparisons ( Supplementary Figs 7 and 8 ) .
Although some highly conserved promoters show substantial conservation across much of their length , sequence similarity for most orthologous papaya promoters is indistinguishable from background .
Global analysis of all inferred protein models from papaya , Arabidopsis , poplar , grape and rice clusters the 208,901 non-redundant protein sequences into 39,706 similarity groups , or ‘ tribes ’19 , 11,851 of which contain two or more genes ( see Supplementary Methods ) .
Tribes with multiple genes in a species typically correspond to families or subfamilies of genes ; however , tribes may also contain just one gene ( ‘ singleton tribes ’ ) .
In papaya , 25,312 gene models were classified into 12,958 tribes , 5,669 of which were specific to papaya ( Supplementary Table 4 ) .
Of the papaya - specific tribes , 5,314 were singleton tribes .
EST support was markedly lower for genes in papaya - specific tribes ( below 14 % ) than in tribes that included genes from at least one other taxon ( 72.4 % ) .
To investigate the smaller number of genes in papaya , we compared tribe membership from each of the five sequenced angiosperm species ( Supplementary Table 5 ) .
Among the 6,726 tribes that contain genes from both Arabidopsis and papaya , 3,595 contain equal numbers of genes from both species .
However , tribes with more Arabidopsis genes outnumber those with more papaya genes by more than 2:1 ( 2,153:979 ) .
The trend of smaller number of papaya genes is widespread across tribes of all sizes and major functional categories ( Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 9 ) .
We then examined membership in the 815 tribes with members identified as being likely transcription factors in the Arabidopsis transcription factor database ( http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu/AtTFDB/).
This set includes 2,897 genes in Arabidopsis and 2,438 in papaya ( a ratio of 1.19:1 ) .
The details of tribe membership are illustrated for 25 exemplar families and superfamilies ( Fig. 2 ) , where most transcription - factor tribes have fewer genes in papaya than Arabidopsis .
Some transcription - factor tribes had more genes in papaya , specifically RWP -RK , MADS - box , Scarecrow , TCP and Jumonji gene families .
Interestingly , the difference in MADS protein family size appears to be due to expanded numbers for half of the 36 MADS tribes .
The other 18 MADS tribes had fewer papaya genes , including 14 that were not found in papaya .
Figure 2 : Comparison of gene numbers in transcription - factor tribe or related tribes from Arabidopsis and papaya .
Most transcription factors are represented by fewer genes in papaya than Arabidopsis .
Transcription - factor names are given , with values after the names corresponding to : number of tribes with genes assigned to transcription factor group , number of tribes with smaller counts in papaya than Arabidopsis , number of tribes with equal counts in papaya and Arabidopsis , number of tribes with larger counts in papaya , and number of tribes with zero members in papaya .
Supporting data are provided in Supplementary Table 8 .

Assuming that a generalized angiosperm could potentially require only the types and minimal numbers of genes that are shared among divergent plant species , we examined each of the tribes shared among the five angiosperms with sequenced genomes .
The number of genes required in a minimal flowering plant is based on the observed minimum number of genes across each of the shared tribes ( Table 2 ) .
When the smallest observed number is taken for each evolutionarily conserved tribe , a minimal angiosperm genome of 13,311 genes is estimated .
Papaya has the smallest number of genes for more tribes than any other sequenced taxon ( 4,515 , or 76 % of 5,925 shared tribes ) , reinforcing the notion that papaya has fewer genes than any angiosperm sequenced so far .

Only 55 nucleotide - binding site ( NBS ) - containing R genes were identified in papaya ; about 28 % of the 200 NBS genes in Arabidopsis20 and less than 10 % of the 600 NBS genes in rice21 .
Resistance proteins also have a carboxy - terminal leucine - rich repeat ( LRR ) domain .
These NBS - containing R - gene families can be subdivided into three classes : NBS–LRR , toll interleukin receptor ( TIR ) –NBS–LRR , and coiled - coil ( CC ) –NBS–LRR on the basis of their amino - terminal region .
Papaya NBS–LRR outnumbered both TIR–NBS–LRR and CC–NBS–LRR genes , in contrast to both poplar ( with more CC–NBS–LRR genes4 ) and Arabidopsis ( with more TIR– NBS–LRR ) .
More than 50 % of the NBS - type R genes were clustered in about eight scaffolds , indicating that resistance gene evolution may involve duplication and divergence of linked gene families .
Homologues for genes involved in cellulose biosynthesis are present in papaya and Arabidopsis , with more cellulose synthase genes in poplar , perhaps associated with wood formation .
Papaya has at least 32 putative β- glucosyl transferase ( GT1 ) genes compared with 121 in Arabidopsis identified using sequence alignment .
A total of 38 and 40 cellulose synthase - related genes ( GT2 ) were identified in papaya using the 48 poplar and 31 Arabidopsis genes as queries , respectively .
These genes include 11 cellulose synthase ( CesA ) genes , the same number as in Arabidopsis but 7 fewer than in poplar .
Putative cellulose orientation genes ( COBRA ) were more abundant in Arabidopsis ( 12 ) than in papaya ( 8 ) .
Papaya also has a similar complement though fewer genes for cell - wall synthesis than Arabidopsis .
Papaya and Arabidopsis , respectively , have 6 and 12 callose synthase genes ( GT2 ) ; 15 and 15 xyloglucan α-1,2 - fucosyl transferases ( GT37 ) ; 5 and 7 β- glucuronic acid transferases in familes GT43 and GT47 ; and 27 and 42 in GT8 that includes galacturonosyl transferases , associated with pectin synthesis .
The cell wall of plants is capable of both plastic and elastic extension , and controls the rate and direction of cell expansion 22 .
Despite fewer whole - genome duplications , papaya has a similar number of putative expansin A genes ( 24 ) as Arabidopsis ( 26 ) and poplar ( 27 ) , and more expansin B genes ( 10 ) than Arabidopsis ( 6 ) and poplar ( 3 ) .
In contrast to expansion - related genes , papaya has on average about 25 % fewer cell - wall degradation genes than Arabidopsis , in some cases far fewer .
For example , papaya and Arabidopsis , respectively , have 4 and 12 endoxylanase - like genes in glycoside hydrolase family 10 ( GH10 ) ; 29 and 67 pectin methyl esterases ( carbohydrate esterase family 8 ) ; 28 and 69 polygalacturonases ( GH28 ) ; 15 and 49 xyloglucan endotransglycosylase / hydrolases ( GH16 ) ; 18 and 25 β-1,4-endoglucanases ( GH9 ) ; 42 and 91 β- 1,3 - glucanases ( GH17 ) ; and 15 and 27 pectin lyases ( PL1 ) .
A semi-woody giant herb that accumulates lignin in the cell wall at an intermediate level between Arabidopsis and poplar , papaya generally has intermediate numbers of lignin synthetic genes , fewer than poplar but more than Arabidopsis despite fewer opportunities for duplication in papaya .
Poplar , papaya and Arabidopsis have 37 , 30 and 18 candidate genes for the lignin synthesis pathway , respectively 4,23 , with papaya having an intermediate number of genes for the PAL , C4H , 4CL and HCT gene families , and only one COMT and two C3H genes .
In contrast , poplar has three C3H genes , which are presumed to convert p-coumaroyl quinic acid to caffeoyl shikimic acid , whereas there are two in papaya and one in Arabidopsis .
Papaya , Arabidopsis and poplar each have two genes in the family CCoAOMT , which are presumed to convert caffeic acid to ferulic acid4 .
Compared with these other plants , papaya has the fewest genes in the CCR gene family ( 1 gene ) and the most in the F5H ( 4 genes ) and CAD gene families ( 18 genes ) , which all mediate later steps of the lignin biosynthesis pathway .
More starch - associated genes in papaya , a perennial , may be due to a greater need for storage in leaves , stem and developing fruit than in Arabidopsis , an ephemeral that stores oil in the seed .
Papaya and Arabidopsis , respectively , have 13 and 6 putative starch synthase ( GT5 ) genes ; 8 and 3 starch branching genes ; 6 and 3 isoamylases ( GH13 ) ; and 12 and 9 β-amylases ( GH14 ) .
Early unloading of fruit sugar in papaya is probably symplastic24 , with five genes for sucrose synthase / sucrose phosphate synthase ( GT4 ) ; seven are reported for Arabidopsis .
Five acid invertase ( GH32 ) sequences were found in papaya whereas 11 have been reported in Arabidopsis .
Papaya has at least seven putative neutral invertase ( GH32 ) genes ; Arabidopsis has six .
Wall - associated kinases ( WAK ) are thought to be involved in the regulation of vacuolar invertases , with 17 in Arabidopsis and only 10 in papaya .
Arabidopsis and papaya have 14 and 7 hexose transporters , respectively .
The greater number of genes for sugar accumulation in Arabidopsis may reflect recent genome duplications .
Papaya has undergone particularly striking amplification of genes involved in volatile development .
Papaya and Arabidopsis , respectively , have 18 and 8 genes for cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase ; 2 and 1 genes for cinnamate - 4 - hydroxylase ; 9 and 3 genes for phenylalanine ammonia lyase ; and 24 and 3 limonene cyclase genes .
Papaya ripening is climacteric , with the rise in ethylene production occurring at the same time as the respiratory increase25 .
Papaya and Arabidopsis , respectively , have similar numbers of genes involved in ethylene synthesis , with four each for S - adenosyl methionine synthase ( SAM synthase ) ; 8 and 13 for aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid ( ACC ) synthase ( ACS ) ; 8 and 12 for ACC oxidase ( ACO ) ; and 42 and 64 for ethylene - responsive binding factors ( AP2 / ERF ) .
Because papaya grows in tropical climates where daily light / dark cycles do not change much over the year , we can ask if more or fewer light / circadian genes are required to synchronize with the environment .
In fact , there are fewer light / clock genes in the papaya genome ( 49 % and 34 % of poplar and Arabidopsis , respectively ; Supplementary Table 7 ) .
However , among the core circadian clock genes , the pseudo - response regulators ( PRRs ; Supplementary Fig. 10 ) have expanded in poplar compared with Arabidopsis , and the papaya PRR7 cluster has seemingly duplicated with the recent poplar salicoid - specific genome duplication4 ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ) .
Against the backdrop of fewer overall genes , the parallel expansion of the PRRs is consistent with circadian timing being important in papaya .
The PAS–FBOX–KELCH genes control light signalling and flowering time ; however , the only papaya orthologue ( ZTL ) lacks an obvious KELCH domain compared with Arabidopsis and poplar , which have five and one KELCH domains , respectively ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ) .
In fact , the papaya genome contains fewer KELCH domains ( 37 compared with 130 and 74 in Arabidopsis and poplar , respectively ) .
In contrast , there are three constitutive photomorphogenic 1 ( COP1 ) paralogues in the papaya genome compared with only one in Arabidopsis ( Supplementary Tables 7 and 8 ) .
A similar expansion has been noted in moss ( Physcomitrella patens ) , which has nine COP1 paralogues that are hypothesized to aid in tolerance to ultraviolet light ( Supplementary Fig. 12) 26 .
Both KELCH domains and the WD - 40 of the COP1 family form β- propellers and play a role in light - mediated ubiquitination .
There is not a general expansion of WD - 40 genes in papaya ( 173 compared with 227 in Arabidopsis ) .
Perhaps papaya has developed an alternative way of integrating light or timing information specific to day - neutral plants , such as a strict adherence to the diel light / dark cycle that is better served by the COP - mediated system .
Sex determination in papaya is controlled by a pair of primitive sex chromosomes , with a small male - specific region of the Y chromosome ( MSY ) 8 .
The physical map of the MSY is currently estimated by chromosome walking to span about 8 Mb ( ref. 27 ) .
Two scaffolds in the current female - genome sequence align to the X chromosome physical map based on BAC end sequences , spanning 4.5 Mb and including 254 predicted protein - encoding genes , of which 75 ( 29.5 % ) have EST support ( Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Fig. 13 ) .
If adjusted for the percentage of unigene validation for other genes ( 48.0 % ) , the estimated number of genes in the X - specific region would be 156 .
The average gene density would be one gene per 19.5 kb , lower than the estimated genome average of one gene per 14.3 kb .
By contrast , among seven completely sequenced MSY BACs totalling 1.2
Mb , a total of four expressed genes were found on two of the BACs 14,28 .
The somewhat lower - than - average gene density in the X - specific scaffolds is accompanied by more repetitive DNA ( 58.3 % ) than the genome - wide average , perhaps because this region is near the centromere28 .
Re-analysis of the repetitive DNA content of the MSY BACs , to include the new papaya - specific repeat families identified herein , increased the average repeat sequence to 85.6 % , with 54.1 % Gypsy and 1.9 % Copia retro-elements ( Supplementary Table 10 ) .
This compares with an earlier estimate of 17.9 % using the Arabidopsis repeat database alone28 .
The SunUp genome has presented an opportunity to analyse transgene insertion sites critically .
Southern blot analysis was key in the initial identification of transgenic insertion fragments and was performed with probes spanning the entire 19,567 - bp transformation vector used for bombardment ( Supplementary Fig. 14 ) .
Among the identified inserts were the functional coat - protein transgene conferring resistance to papaya ringspot virus , which was found in an intact 9,789 - bp fragment of the transformation plasmid , and a 1,533 - bp fragment composed of a truncated , non-functional tetA gene and flanking vector backbone sequence .
The structures of the coat - protein transgene and tetA region insertion sites were determined from cloned sequences .
Southern analysis also confirmed a 290 - bp non-functional fragment of the nptII gene originally identified by WGS sequence analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 15 ) .
Five of the six flanking sequences of the three insertions are nuclear DNA copies of papaya chloroplast DNA fragments .
The integration of the transgenes into chloroplast DNA - like sequences may be related to the observation that transgenes produced either by Agrobacterium - mediated or biolistic transformation are often inserted in AT - rich DNA29 , as is the chloroplast DNA of papaya and other land plants .
Four of the six insert junctions have sequences that match topoisomerase I recognition sites , which are associated with breakpoints in genomic DNA transgene insertion sites and transgene rearrangements
29 .
The presence of these inserts was confirmed by high - throughput MUMmer30 analysis for each region of the transformation vector .
Evidence for the presence of other transgene inserts is not conclusive ( Supplementary Note 3 ) .
Its lower overall gene number notwithstanding , striking variations in gene number within particular functional groups , superimposed on the average approximate 20 % reduction in papaya gene number relative to Arabidopsis , may be related to key features of papaya morphological evolution .
Despite a closer evolutionary relationship to Arabidopsis , papaya shares with poplar an increased number of genes associated with cell expansion , consistent with larger plant size ; and lignin biosynthesis , consistent with the convergent evolution of tree - like habit .
Amplification of starch - synthesis genes in papaya relative to Arabidopsis is consistent with a greater need for storage in leaves , stem and developing fruit of this perennial .
Tremendous amplification in papaya of genes related to volatile development implies strong natural selection for enhanced attractants that may be key to fruit ( seed ) dispersal by animals and which may also have attracted the attention of aboriginal peoples .
This also foreshadows what we might expect to discover in the genomes of other fragrant - fruited trees , as well as plants with striking fragrance of leaves ( herbs ) , flowers or other organs .
Arguably , the sequencing of the genome of SunUp papaya makes it the best - characterized commercial transgenic crop .
Because papaya ringspot virus is widespread in nearly all papaya - growing regions , SunUp could serve as a transgenic germplasm source that could be used to breed suitable cultivars resistant to the virus in various parts of the world .
The characterization of the precise transgenic modifications in SunUp papaya should also serve to lower regulatory barriers currently in place in some countries .
One of the oldest contested file - sharing cases has come to an abrupt and unexpected end .
In a motion filed last month , but only uncovered today by Ray Beckerman , the RIAA has dismissed a two - year - old lawsuit filed against Joan Cassin .
The dismissal is without prejudice , which means the RIAA could sue Cassin once again , but Cassin 's attorney would likely argue that the label 's recent dismissal is a final adjudication on the merits ; more on that below .
Cassin was sued in April 2006 for copyright infringement .
The boilerplate complaint used by the RIAA at the time is light on the details , but the exhibits attached to the filing show that MediaSentry detected a user with the handle omc@KaZaA sharing 406 files on KaZaA , including tracks from Madonna , Bob Seger , Dixie Chicks , and Sade .
Instead of filing an answer , Cassin 's attorney ( who works at the same law firm as Beckerman ) filed a motion to dismiss in early 2007 .
One of the issues raised in the motion was the now - well - known argument that merely making a file available over a P2P network constitutes distribution .
Indeed , Warner v. Cassin looked as though it would be one of the first cases where the issue would be argued in court .
Instead , the oral arguments never took place , and in the months since , a handful of rulings have come down on the making - available argument .
The first , in Elektra v. Barker , largely went the RIAA 's way , as a judge said that offering copyright music on a P2P network infringed on the label 's publication right spelled out in the Copyright Act .
Subsequent rulings , however , have gone the other way .
In early April , a federal judge in Massachusetts quashed an RIAA subpoena seeking the identities of Boston University students suspected of copyright infringement .
" Merely because the defendant has ' completed all the steps necessary for distribution ' does not necessarily mean that a distribution has actually occurred , " wrote Judge Nancy Gertner in her ruling .
" As noted above , merely exposing music files to the Internet is not copyright infringement . "
And in Atlantic v. Howell , a case where the defendants are representing themselves , a judge denied the label 's motion for summary judgment , ruling that the label had not proven that any actual distribution had taken place .
Beckerman told
Ars that he suspects that the RIAA may have been concerned about the impact of those recent rulings on Warner v. Cassin .
" They were afraid of [ Warner v. Cassin ] Judge Robinson deciding the case , because his would be the most well - informed decision so far . "
The RIAA rarely reveals the particulars of why it dismisses individual cases , and has not yet given Ars its perspective on the case .
Historically , the group has walked away from cases where there 's significant doubt that it would prevail , and it may have concluded that this lawsuit fell into that category .
Since the case was dismissed without prejudice , the RIAA could refile it , but Beckerman believes that under federal court rules , which count the second dismissal of the same case as an " adjudication on the merits , " Cassin should be considered the prevailing party .
Under his reasoning , the first case was the filing and dismissal of a John Doe lawsuit for the sole purposes of obtaining Cassin 's identity from the ISP .
Scheme : マクロの効用
普通のやつらの上を行け でLispにおけるマクロの効用が述べられているが，
「じゃあ具体的にマクロを使って『こりゃ便利だ』っていう例を見せてよ 」
と言われてもなかなかすぐに出て来ない。 そこで、なんかいいマクロの使用例を思い付いたら書いてってみるコーナー。
通りすがりのマクロ初心者です。便利なマクロの具体例はすごく知りたいので、この項、期待してます。
Paul Graham 「 On Lisp」を読書中でなかなか良いけど、日本語の解説があった方が理解が早まるので。
もくじ
関連 ：Scheme : マクロの危険
マクロを使う局 面
なんとなく、マクロを使いたくなる理由というのが分類できるような
気がしてきたので書いてみる。もちろんそれぞれの理由は排他的でなく、
またオーバーラップするものもあるけれど。
定型パターンの簡略 化
繰り返し似たようなコードを書かなければならず、
しかも関数による抽象化がやりにくい場合、あるいは性能の問題から
関数による抽象化をやりたくない場合。
Cの引数付きマクロは多くの場合、このケースに相当するように思う。 但し、Cの場合は関数による抽象化に厳しい制限があるため、
マクロにせざるを得ない場合が多くあるが、 Schemeではlambdaを書くのを厭わなければ高階関数による抽象化だけで済むことも多い。
Gaucheのlib/ gauche/listutil.scmの%define-cxrマクロなんかがこの例。
マクロを使わないと、本質的でない要素が繰り返し並んで見づらくなる。
関数呼び出しのインライン展開の代用
関数呼び出しのように見せかけて、実はその場でコードが展開されるので
呼び出しが一回減ってお得、というやつ。
但し、処理系によって最適化の方策は異なるので、なんでもかんでも
マクロにすれば速くなるとは限らない。 ナイーブなインタプリタ(ほとんど無いと思うけど)では評価の度にマクロが展開 されるかもしれない。 モジュールを解釈するコンパイラなら、逆にモジュール内ローカルの
関数定義は勝手にインライン展開してくれるかもしれない。
よって、 「べき論」で言えばこのパターンは多用すべきではない。
ただし、特定の処理系のコンパイラの癖を熟知した上で、
特定のプログラムにチューニングをかけてゆく時には
チューニング手段としてのマクロは大いに活躍する。
「 コンパイラが最適化しやすいパターンのコード」と 「人間が読んでわかりやすいコード」が違う場合に、
マクロによって後者を前者に変換してやるのだ。
新しい構文による抽象化
新しい構文の導入は 「定型パターンの簡略化」であることも多いけど、
着目したい要素を目立つように配置する、というような目的もある。
たとえば ( dolist ( elt lis ) body ... ) は ( for - each ( lambda ( elt ) body ... ) lis ) と等価だけれど、 body が長くて、かつリストによる繰り返しがネストするような場合は、 dolistの方が見やすい 。
ミニ言語の埋め込 み
「 新しい構文による抽象化」をさらに進めた形で、
新たなシンタクスとセマンティクスを持つミニ言語をプログラム中に
埋め込むのにもマクロが使える。
具体例にあげる、リストの内包表記を実現するlist-ofなんかは このパターンの控えめな例。 Schemeにprologを埋め込むSchelogや、 処理 系BiglooにあるLALR grammerなんかもこれ。
Common Lispのloopマクロは一番極端な例かな。ほとんど独立した埋め込み言語と 化している。
宣言的なコードに見せる
このパターンもよく使うな。 本当はランタイムに手続きが走っていろいろやっているんだけど、
宣言的に書けたほうが整理しやすい場合がある。
Wilikiの macro.scm では、define - writer - macro , define - reader - macro , define - virtual - pageのような 構文で新しいマクロを定義できるようにしている ( ソースの後半参照 ) 。
実体は実行時にマクロ手続きを作ってグローバルなリストに登録しているだけなんだが、
見掛け上宣言的なので、マクロを「定義している」って気分になる。
オブジェクトシステムのdefine-classやdefine-methodもそう。
実体はクラスオブジェクトを作って変数にbindしてたり、
ジェネリックファンクションにadd-method!してるんだけど、
見掛けが宣言的だと「オブジェクト指向言語」っぽく見えるし、
実際そういうつもりで使って何ら問題はない。
コンパイル時の処 理
これは処理系特有の事情なんだが、 実行時ではなくコンパイル時に何か処理をしたいという場合がある。
マクロは一般にコンパイル時に展開されるので、
マクロの展開コードの中に処理を仕込んでおくという方法がある。
極端な場合、展開されたコードそのものには意味はないので、
展開結果は#fだけ、という場合だってある。
もっとも、これは激しく処理系依存なので、どっちかっていうと
その処理系特有の裏事情を表に見せないようにこっそり処理する
ような形で使うのが吉かな。Gaucheのadd-load-pathとかrequireとかで使っている。
Common Lispではeval - when という構文が仕様にあって、 ちゃんとポータブルにそのへんが書けるようになってる。
具体例
クラス定義でのリーダーの生成
高林さんの いやな日 記 ( 3/15 ) に 、Rubyでインスタンス変数がたくさんあるときにattr_readerを
たくさん書くのが面倒、という話題が出てた。Rubyでは、reflectionを
使って生成時にevalでリーダーの定義をしてゆくという方法が挙げられている。
Lisperだとこういうときはマクロを使う。Gaucheの構文だと
( define - macro ( define - class * name supers slots . options ) `( define - class , name , supers , ( map ( lambda ( slot ) ( let ( ( reader - name ( string - > symbol # `" get - , ( car slot ) " ) ) ) ( list * ( car slot ) : getter reader - name ( cdr slot ) ) ) ) slots ) , @options ) )
通常のdefine-classではなくdefine-class * を使ってクラス定義をすると、
各スロットに対して自動的に get -スロット名 という名のリーダーメソッド が定義される。
( define - class * < foo > ( ) ( ( foo :init - value 1 ) ( bar : init - value 2 ) ) ) ( define foo ( make < foo > ) ) ( get - foo foo ) ==> 1 ( get - bar foo ) == > 2
さらに、もとの定義で : read - only というオプションがついていたらリーダー メソッドのみ、そうでなければライターメソッドも定義するようにしてみる。
( define - macro ( define - class * name supers slots . options ) `( define - class , name , supers , ( map ( lambda ( slot ) ( let ( ( reader - name ( string - > symbol # `" get - , ( car slot ) " ) ) ( writer - name ( string - > symbol # `" set - , ( car slot ) ! " ) ) ) ( if ( get - keyword : read - only ( cdr slot ) # f ) ( list * ( car slot ) : getter reader - name ( cdr slot ) ) ( list * ( car slot ) : getter reader - name : setter writer - name ( cdr slot ) ) ) ) ) slots ) , @options ) ) ( define - class * < foo > ( ) ( ( foo : init - value 1 ) ( bar :init - value 2 :read - only # t ) ) ) ( define foo ( make < foo > ) ) ( get - foo foo ) ==> 1 ( get - bar foo ) ==> 2 ( set - foo ! foo 8 ) ==> # < undef > ( get - foo foo ) ==> 8 ( set - bar ! foo 8 ) == > error
なお、この例に関して はMetaobject Protocol ( MOP ) を使っても可能で、 むしろ拡張性を考える とMOP の方が好ましい。 Scheme : メタオブジェクトプロトコルで考えてみる。
リストの内包表記 ( List comprehension )
Haskellとか、最近ではPythonも採り入れたlist comprehension。 これをSchemeのマクロで実現するコードが最近 comp.lang.schemeに投稿されていました。
コード ( これだけ。ちなみにfold- leftはSRFI-1でfoldという名前で定義されています ) 。
( define ( fold - left f b l ) ( if ( null ? l ) b ( fold - left f ( f b ( car l ) ) ( cdr l ) ) ) ) ( define - syntax list - of ( syntax - rules ( ) ( ( list - of expr ... ) ( reverse ( list - of - tail '( ) expr ... ) ) ) ) ) ( define - syntax list - of - tail ( syntax - rules ( in ) ( ( list - of - tail base expr ) ( cons expr base ) ) ( ( list - of - tail base expr ( var in generator ) rest ... ) ( let * ( (f ( lambda ( z var ) ( list - of - tail z expr rest ... ) ) ) ) ( fold - left f base generator ) ) ) ( ( list - of - tail base expr pred ?
rest ... ) ( if pred ?
( list - of - tail base expr rest ... ) base ) ) ) )
以下は実行 例
( list - of (* x x ) ( x in ' ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) ) ) => ( 1 4 9 16 25 ) ( define ( upto a b ) ( if ( < b a ) ' ( ) ( cons a ( upto (+ a 1 ) b ) ) ) ) ( upto 1 5 ) => ( 1 2 3 4 5 ) ( define ( squares n ) ( list - of (* x x ) ( x in ( upto 1 n ) ) ) ) ( squares 5 ) => ( 1 4 9 16 25 ) ( define ( qsort lt ? lst ) ( if ( null ? lst ) '( ) ( append ( qsort lt ?
( list - of x ( x in ( cdr lst ) ) ( lt? x ( car lst ) ) ) ) ( list ( car lst ) ) ( qsort lt ?
( list - of x ( x in ( cdr lst ) ) ( not ( lt? x ( car lst ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( qsort < ' ( 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 6 5 4 ) ) => ( 1 1 2 3 4 4 5 5 6 9 ) ( define ( pyth n ) ( list - of ( list a b c ) ( a in ( upto 1 n ) ) ( b in ( upto a n ) ) ( c in ( upto b n ) ) ( = (+ (* a a ) (* b b ) ) (* c c ) ) ) ) ( pyth 20 ) => ( ( 3 4 5 ) ( 5 12 13 ) ( 6 8 10 ) ( 8 15 17 ) ( 9 12 15 ) ( 12 16 20 ) )
Haskellと違ってeagerな評価になってしまうのが欠点ですが… delayを使ってlazyにすることはできるでしょう。
Scheme : TaxiNumberも参照。
( nobsun ) 本質的ではないですが。。。list - of とすこしちがう let - zf というlet とおなじ形式の構文をもつ( マクロではなく組み込みでした ) 処理系をつかったことがあります。構文的には、let-zf の方が Scheme にはなじむ感じがします。( この処理系は Lazy でした： ) )
( define ( qsort lt ? lst ) ( if ( null ? lst ) '( ) ( append ( qsort lt ?
( let - zf ( ( x ( cdr lst ) ) ( lt? x ( car lst ) ) ) x ) ( list ( car lst ) ) ( qsort lt ?
( let - zf ( ( x ( cdr lst ) ) ( not ( lt? x ( car lst ) ) ) ) x ) ) ) ) )
( Shiro ) これって、束縛 ( x ( cdr lst ) ) と述語 ( lt? x ( car lst ) ) とはどうやって区別するんでしょ。
( nobsun ) ならびの最後にあることと型です :P 件の処理系を見てみたら ( def qsort ( lambda ( lt xxs ) ( if ( null xxs ) xxs ( let ( (x ( hd xxs ) ) ( xs ( tl xxs ) ) ) ( append ( qsort lt ( letzf ( (y xs ) ( $ ( lt y x ) ) ) y ) ) ( cons x ( qsort lt ( letzf ( (y xs ) ( $ ( not ( lt y x ) ) ) ) y ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) と書くようです．guard は $ を使って表現していました ．
リストの構 築
わりと良く出会うパターンである。こういうリストを作りたい。
関数proc1 がtrueを返したら値 x1 を含む。
関数proc2がtrueを返したら値 x2 を含む。
関数proc3 がtrueを返したら値 x3 を含む。
もちろん実際にはこういう条件の数はもっとたくさんあるし、 procNの部分もxNの部分もごちゃっとした式が入ると思いねえ
代表的なのは、条件によってメニュー項目を出したり引っ込めたりとか、 動的なHTML生成で条件によってリンクを表示したりしなかったりとかする場合だ。
手続き的な方法なら素直に書ける。
( let ( ( r ' ( ) ) ) ( when ( proc1 ) ( push ! r x1 ) ) ( when ( proc2 ) ( push ! r x2 ) ) ( when ( proc3 ) ( push ! r x3 ) ) ( reverse ! r ) )
でも、リストといういわばLispの土俵であるデータ構造で、 副作用を使うのはちょっと悔しい。
関数的に書けなくはないんだが、なんか素直にならないんだこれが。
バッククオート内で , @ を使うと、空リストは 「 なかったこと 」になるので、 それを利用する方法：
`( , @( if ( proc1 ) ( list x1 ) '( ) ) , @( if ( proc2 ) ( list x2 ) '( ) ) , @( if ( proc3 ) ( list x3 ) '( ) ) )
しかしif式の戻り値をいちいちリストにしなきゃならんし、
条件不成立の場合に空リストを返すのもちょっとうざったい。 特に条件や値が長くてif式を複数行に渡って書く場合、elseの部分が '( ) だけってのは どうもバランスが悪い 。
リストを扱うのに定番なのはmap系なんで、無理矢理使ってみる：
( use srfi - 1 ) ( filter - map ( lambda ( test value ) ( if test value # f ) ) ( list ( proc1 ) ( proc2 ) ( proc3 ) ) ( list x1 x2 x3 ) )
条件のリストとか戻り値のリストとかが別に用意されている場合はこれでも
良いかもしれないが、そういうのが固定でソースに埋め込みたい時には
ちょっと条件と戻り値の関係がわかりづらい。
素直なのは、条件を調べて真の時には値をcons , 偽なら現在の値をそのままにする、という操作なのだが、
それをそのまま書こうとするとconsのネストが深くなって何やら わからなくなる。
そこでマクロの登場だ。
( define - syntax cond-cons ( syntax - rules ( ) ( ( _ ) '( ) ) ( ( _ ( test . expr ) . more ) ( let ( ( r ( cond-cons . more ) ) ) ( if test ( cons ( begin . expr ) r ) r ) ) ) ) )
これで、当初の問題はこんなふうに書ける：
( cond-cons ( ( proc1 ) x1 ) ( ( proc2 ) x2 ) ( ( proc3 ) x3 ) )
素直だが見づらいコードを、見やすいシンタックスでラップしているわけだ。
nobsun( 2003/01/07 08:48:20 PST ) マクロの話なのにマクロじゃない例 :- p ( define ( cond - cons x y ) ( if ( eval ( car x ) ( interaction - environment ) ) ( cons ( cadr x ) y ) y ) ) という定義をして、当初の問題を ( fold - right cond-cons '( ) ( list '( ( proc1 ) x1 ) '( ( proc2 ) x2 ) '( ( proc3 ) x3 ) ) ) とする
Shiro ( 2003/01/07 14:20:31 PST ) : うーむ裏技的ですな。 proc1やx1がその時点でのローカルな環境を参照したい場合は困りますね。
やっぱり呼び出し側で評価しておかないと。
;; 上の技だと困る例： ( let ( ( proc1 foo ) ( proc2 bar ) ( proc3 baz ) ) ( fold - right cond-cons '( ) ( list '( ( proc1 ) x1 ) '( ( proc2 ) x2 ) '( ( proc3 ) x3 ) ) ) ;; 呼び出し側で評価 ( define ( cond - cons x y ) ( if ( car x ) ( cons ( cadr x ) y ) y ) ) ( fold - right cond-cons '( ) `(( ,( proc1 ) , x1 ) ( , ( proc2 ) , x2 ) ( , ( proc3 ) , x3 ) ) )
でも、ここまで凝るならマクロかいちゃえってLisperは思います。
quasi - quote があったんだ。わすれてた。lazy ならそれさえもいらないのに とHaskellerは思います。:-p
silk_warm_eel append-mapをつかうと幸せではないかな？と
( srfi1 : append - map ( lambda ( tf x ) ( if tf ( list x ) '( ) ) ) ( list ( proc1 ) ( proc2 ) ( proc3 ) ) ( list x1 x2 x3 ) )
他の処理系の移 植
( 2004/02/06 03:54:24 PST ) : そうそう、こういうふうな使いかたもよくするんだけど、
あまりに普通に使ってるので気づかなかった。
「 ある処理系でサポートされている構文が、自分の処理系にはない。 さてどうする ?」
以下は 、PLT SchemeのライブラリをGaucheで走らそうかとした時に、 ひっかかったPLT特有の構文をマクロでカバーした例。
こういうことが簡単だから、逆にScheme/Lispは方言の発生にあまり 抵抗が無いってこともあるかなあ。

David Wise , a worker at a Firestone facility in North Carolina , will be forced to chose between his faith and his job under an important ruling from the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals .
A member of the the Living Church of God , Wise is required to take a greater number of days off than most employees and sued when he was terminated for these practices as violative of his religious rights .
The Court ruled against him and held that Firestone could refuse to accommodate such religious practices .
As a “ lab floater , ” Wise was able to work around his religious holidays until a restructuring in the company made it impossible .
The Living Church of God has some pretty decent holidays , according to the court :
His religion prohibits him from working during the faith ’s weekly Sabbath , which takes place from sundownon Friday to sundown on Saturday .
In addition , Wise must observe , and therefore cannot work on , seven sets of religious holidays .
The holidays , which are based on certain biblical Holy Days , are Passover , the Feast of Unleavened Bread , the Day of Pentecost , the Feast of Trumpets , the Day of Atonement , the Feast of Tabernacles , and the Last Great Day .
These holidays typically total twenty days , including fourteen that do not already coincide with part of the weekly Sabbath .
With the restructuring , Wise tried to work it out with his immediate supervisor , Kevin Cash .
( That ’s right , Mr. Wise worked for Mr. Cash ) .
Mr Cash could not make it work and Wise was fired .
The opinion is an interesting statutory interpretation exercise , relying on plain meaning of the statute and congressional intent in the use of the word “ reasonable . ”
Appellants contend , as they did before the district court , that anemployer provides a reasonable accommodation only when it “ elimi- nate [s ] the conflict between the religious practice and the work requirement . ”
Brief of Appellant at 26 .
Put another way , appellants argue that Title VII requires an employer , absent undue hardship , tototally accommodate an employee ’s religious observances .
This would essentially limit the Title VII analysis to whether an employer ’s failure to provide total accommodation was based on undue hardship .
For the reasons that follow , we cannot accept appellants ’ interpre-tation of § 2000 e ( j ) and hold that “ reasonably accommodate ” means what it says : reasonably accommodate .
The problem with appellants ’ “ total ” accommodation interpretationis that such a construction ignores the plain text of the statute , namelythe inclusion of the word “ reasonably ” as a modifier of accommodate .
If Congress had wanted to require employers to provide complete accommodation absent undue hardship , it could easily have done so .
For instance , Congress could have used the words “ totally ” or “ completely , ” instead of “ reasonably . ”
It even could have left out any qualifying adjective at all .
Rather , Congress included the term reasonably , expressly declaring that an employer ’s obligation is to “ reasonably accommodate ” absent undue hardship — not to totally do so .
It could be a ruling that is not only appealed to the Supreme Court but raised in Congress , where members have sought to demand accommodations for religious practices on various levels in the last ten years .
This may put some members in a bind between religious right advocates and business interests in Congress

To see if they 're working .
Just because something 's internal does n't mean it does n't need to be verified .
I mean I understand and respect the perspective that what 's exported is the determinant and the important part of a module ; at the same time , testing is about making sure I got my stuff right , and errors and defects are just as likely in private code as they are in public .
Practically speaking , many tests are n't viable if they have to be dispatched upstream .
In particular , testing something to make sure it behaves correctly with malformed data is nearly impossible if you 're only feeding it data from your normal upstream code .
Yes , there 's something to be said for tests that only mimic real world circumstances , but there 's also something to be said for exhaustive testing , and something which is limited to the currently realistic set of circumstances and causations is anything but exhaustive .
Code sensibly .
Test paranoiacally .
Anyway , it 's an opinion .

A Question of Balance : Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies by William Nordhaus Yale University Press , 234 pp. , $ 28.00 Global Warming : Looking Beyond Kyoto edited by Ernesto Zedillo Yale Center for the Study of Globalization / Brookings Institution Press , 237 pp. , $ 26.95 ( paper )
I begin this review with a prologue , describing the measurements that transformed global warming from a vague theoretical speculation into a precise observational science .
There is a famous graph showing the fraction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as it varies month by month and year by year ( see the graph ) .
It gives us our firmest and most accurate evidence of effects of human activities on our global environment .
The graph is generally known as the Keeling graph because it summarizes the lifework of Charles David Keeling , a professor at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , California .
Keeling measured the carbon dioxide abundance in the atmosphere for forty - seven years , from 1958 until his death in 2005 .
He designed and built the instruments that made accurate measurements possible .
He began making his measurements near the summit of the dormant volcano Mauna Loa on the big island of Hawaii .
Concentration of Carbon Dioxide in the Atmosphere
He chose this place for his observatory because the ambient air is far from any continent and is uncontaminated by local human activities or vegetation .
The measurements have continued after Keeling ’s death , and show an unbroken record of rising carbon dioxide abundance extending over fifty years .
The graph has two obvious and conspicuous features .
First , a steady increase of carbon dioxide with time , beginning at 315 parts per million in 1958 and reaching 385 parts per million in 2008 .
Second , a regular wiggle showing a yearly cycle of growth and decline of carbon dioxide levels .
The maximum happens each year in the Northern Hemisphere spring , the minimum in the Northern Hemisphere fall .
The difference between maximum and minimum each year is about six parts per million .
Keeling was a meticulous observer .
The accuracy of his measurements has never been challenged , and many other observers have confirmed his results .
In the 1970s he extended his observations from Mauna Loa , at latitude 20 north , to eight other stations at various latitudes , from the South Pole at latitude 90 south to Point Barrow on the Arctic coast of Alaska at latitude 71 north .
At every latitude there is the same steady growth of carbon dioxide levels , but the size of the annual wiggle varies strongly with latitude .
The wiggle is largest at Point Barrow where the difference between maximum and minimum is about fifteen parts per million .
At Kerguelen , a Pacific island at latitude 29 south , the wiggle vanishes .
At the South Pole the difference between maximum and minimum is about two parts per million , with the maximum in Southern Hemisphere spring .
The only plausible explanation of the annual wiggle and its variation with latitude is that it is due to the seasonal growth and decay of annual vegetation , especially deciduous forests , in temperate latitudes north and south .
The asymmetry of the wiggle between north and south is caused by the fact that the Northern Hemisphere has most of the land …
I am particularly fond of Medieval movies so I was very keen to do this list .
As I progressed through my research I was shocked to realize how few of them are accurate historically .
For that reason this is a list of 9 movies when I would have preferred to do 10 .
For the purposes of this list , the Medieval period is considered to have run from the 6th century to the 16th century .
The films selected here are not always 100 % accurate but are the best of all movies of this genre for being as accurate as possible ; do not expect to see the Knight ’s Tale here .
9 Henry V 1989 , Kenneth Branagh
King Henry V of England ( Kenneth Branagh ) is insulted by the King of France .
As a result , he leads his army into battle against France .
Along the way , the young king must struggle with the sinking morale of his troops and his own inner doubts .
The war culminates at the bloody Battle of Agincourt .
This film is based on the Shakespeare play of the same name and it contains brilliant battle scenes .

8 The Name of the Rose 1986 , Jean - Jacques Annaud
1327 : after a mysterious death in a Benedictine Abbey , the monks are convinced that the apocalypse is coming .
With the Abbey to play host to a council on the Franciscan ’s Order ’s belief that the Church should rid itself of wealth , William of Baskerville , a respected Franciscan monk , is asked to assist in determining the cause of the untimely death .
This film depicts the turmoil that the Franciscan religious order was going through at the time and – like all work by Umberto Eco – is extremely well researched .

7 The Message 1976 , Moustapha Akkad
This is a historical epic concerning the birth of the Islamic religion and the story of Mohammed , who , in accordance with the tenants of Islam , is never seen or heard ( any physical depiction of Mohammed is considered a sin within Islam ) .
In Mecca in the 7th century , Mohammed is visited by a vision of the Angel Gabriel , who urges him to lead the people of Mecca to cast aside the 300 idols of Kaaba and instead worship the one true God .

6 El Cid 1961 , Anthony Mann
This is an epic film of the legendary Spanish hero , Rodrigo Diaz ( “ El Cid ” to his followers ) , who , without compromising his strict sense of honor , still succeeds in taking the initiative and driving the Moors from Spain .
While aspects of this film may be slightly off ( such as calling for Victory for Spain , which – as a political entity – was of little relevance at the time ) , it is nearly unique in its accurate portrayal of the time of the Crusades .

5 Andrei Rublev 1969 , Andrei Tarkovsky
Andreiv Rublev charts the life of the great icon painter through a turbulent period of 15th Century Russian history , a period marked by endless fighting between rival Princes and by Tatar invasions .
Tarkovsky is well known for his beautiful cinematography and that is definitely visible in this film .

4 A Man for All Seasons 1966 , Fred Zinnemann
The story takes place in 16th century England .
But men like Sir Thomas
More , who love life yet have the moral fiber to lay down their lives for their principles , are found in every century .
Concentrating on the last seven years of English chancellor ’s life , the struggle between More and his King , Henry VIII , hinges on Henry ’s determination to break with Rome so he can divorce his current wife and wed again , and good Catholic More ’s inability to go along with such heresy .
While there is a slight bit of confusion over relationships in the movie , it is an extremely accurate portrayal of the time and situation the Saint Thomas More found himself in .
You would be far better watching this than any of the “ Elizabeth ” movies of late which lack the accuracy and integrity of Zinnemann ’s work .

1 The Passion of Joan of Arc 1928 , Carl Theodor Dreyer
You ca n’t get much more accurate than acting out the authentic court transcript of the trial of Saint Joan of Arc .
This is a very old silent film , but it is ranked as number 1 for its attachment to the true story without the deviations or ulterior motives that many other portrays of St Joan have , and the fact that the lead actress ( Maria Falconetti ) gives what many consider to be the greatest acting performance ever recorded on film .
If you have n’t seen this one , you should .

What if you could simply reuse packaging as part of a product rather than sending away for disposal or recycling ?
Some industrial designers have taken up the challenge with varied results .
Like creative flat - pack designs , the constraints of the projects become opportunities for self - expression and to ( literally ) think outside the box .
Tom Ballhatchet is a jack - of - all trades , working on inventions , interior designs and ecologically friendly products .
His work is perhaps best understood through a single object that combines all of these interests : his television box that turns into a stand after a quick transformation following the unpacking of its contents .
Olivia Cheung is a conceptual artist and product designer who specializes in three dimensional design with an emphasis on popular culture .
One of her projects involves light bulb packaging that also takes on the function of a lamp shade .
In principle this is simple , in practice it combines entertainment , reuse and feasibility .
Knoend is a commercial company that has put into practice Cheung ’s design concept , creating semi- transparent and still - elegant packaging that conveniently folds out into a surprisingly appealing minimalist light cover for the purchased fixture .
Zero
Thick has another solution the the package - as - product problem .
It perhaps is n’t as elegant , but it also does n’t aim to be .
In a very modernist way the packaging is expressive of its multiple purposes and shows both its final use ( as a candle holder ) and its prior purpose ( as a candle package ) quite clearly and creatively .

Probably .
But let this teach you how Microsoft ‘ extends ’ into Source Forge et al , using sponsorship that later have fear - inspiring awards up for grabs .

Not quite , but it does n’t look all that encouraging , either . █

Survivors are complaining that aid is simply not reaching those that need it The official death toll for Burma 's cyclone disaster has jumped to almost 78,000 people , with nearly 56,000 missing , according to state TV .
The numbers are nearly double those released on Thursday , raising fears the final human toll may be enormous .
The Red Cross is seeking more than $ 50 m ( £ 26 m ) in aid to help survivors of the storm which struck on 2 - 3 May .
Foreign aid agencies are frustrated at the slow progress of aid to areas worst hit , especially in the Irrawaddy Delta .
A BBC reporter in the delta this week saw little sign of official help and foreign aid workers have been barred from the area .
We are certainly going to see a further aggravation of the situation , further destitution among an already very hard - hit population
Thomas Gurtner
Red Cross director of programmes and co-ordination
Eyewitness : Barred from Burma
Heavy rain has been lashing the region , compounding the misery of survivors of Cyclone Nargis .
The UN Humanitarian Co-ordinator , John Holmes , is due to visit Rangoon , Burma 's main city , on Sunday in a bid to persuade the military government to grant more access to UN relief workers and expand its aid effort .
Earlier , the EU 's top aid official , Louis Michel , was denied permission to visit the delta region .
He said he was given no explanation why disaster emergency experts were being refused visas .
However , Burma - also known as Myanmar - has promised to take foreign diplomats on a tour of the region this weekend .
' Beggars for miles '
Previously , Burma was giving a toll of 43,000 dead and 28,000 missing while the Red Cross and United Nations had estimated a death toll above 100,000 .

The Burmese blamed the sudden increase in the death toll on difficulties they have had confirming what has happened to people in the worst - affected areas .
The difficulty in getting accurate figures is inevitable bearing in mind the scarce resources there are on the ground to assess the needs of those affected by this disaster , the BBC's Chris Hogg reports from Bangkok .
The lack of solid information makes the task of planning how to help them even harder , he adds .
It is not clear how much access the foreign diplomats will have to areas outside the official tour route .
On a trip to the Delta this week , the BBC's Natalia Antelava saw muddy river banks lined with white , swollen bodies , and found survivors with barely enough rice to live on .
A Reuters team travelling to Kunyangon , around 100 km ( 60 miles ) south - west of Rangoon , found rows of beggars stretching for miles on either side of a road .
Men , women and children stood in the mud and rain , hands clasped together in supplication at the occasional passing aid vehicle .
One woman , in her 60s , said she had only survived the storm by climbing a tree .
' Time is life '
Many relief workers are awaiting visas and most of those who have been allowed into the country remain confined to Rangoon .
EXTENT OF THE DEVASTATION
See map and satellite images
Send us your comments Speaking in Bangkok after his visit to Burma , the EU 's Louis Michel said the world needed to impress upon Burma 's rulers the urgency of survivors ' needs .
" Time is life , " he told AFP news agency .
" Every possible pressure - all rhetorical and diplomatic means - must be used to get them to understand that they must help us help them . "
The UN's John Holmes had his visa for Burma approved on Thursday night .
At this stage it is not clear who he will be able to talk too given that Burma 's leader , Thein Sein , has refused even to pick up the phone to talk to Mr Holmes 's boss , the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon , our correspondent notes .
In the last few days , Burma has agreed to allow a few experts from neighbouring countries in to help , our correspondent notes .
It may not be as many as the international community thinks are needed , he says , but UN officials believe this is an opportunity to show the military government that aid - workers ' motives are humanitarian , not political .
Water alert According to the Red Cross , aid agencies have been able to reach only around 20 % to 30 % of cyclone victims and hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of diseases such as dysentery because of lack of clean water .
" If clean water is n't available , it 's going to be the biggest killer in the post - disaster environment , " Thomas Gurtner told the Associated Press news agency .
Speaking in Geneva , Mr Gurtner predicted " further destitution among an already very hard - hit population " , noting that the harvest had already been lost .
The Association of South East Asian Nations ( Asean ) is due to hold a high - level meeting in the coming days that is expected to lay the framework for a broader aid donors conference .
Burma 's military leadership has warned that those who hoard or sell aid on the black market will be prosecuted , amid international reports of misuse of some aid shipments .

Cattori ’s article is longer and includes an interview with the book ’s editors , Laura Knight - Jadczyk and Henry See .
I make the effort to share this information because it gives me , at last , a plausible answer to a long - unanswered question :
Why , no matter how much intelligent goodwill exists in the world , is there so much war , suffering and injustice ?
It does n't seem to matter what creative plan , ideology , religion , or philosophy great minds come up with , nothing seems to improve our lot .
Since the dawn of civilization , this pattern repeats itself over and over again .
The answer is that civilization , as we know it , is largely the creation of psychopaths .
All civilizations , our own included , have been built on slavery and mass murder .
Psychopaths have played a disproportionate role in the development of civilization , because they are hard - wired to lie , kill , cheat , steal , torture , manipulate , and generally inflict great suffering on other humans without feeling any remorse , in order to establish their own sense of security through domination .
The inventor of civilization – the first tribal chieftain who successfully brainwashed an army of controlled mass murderers – was almost certainly a genetic psychopath .
Since that momentous discovery , psychopaths have enjoyed a significant advantage over non-psychopaths in the struggle for power in civilizational hierarchies – especially military hierarchies .
Behind the apparent insanity of contemporary history , is the actual insanity of psychopaths fighting to preserve their disproportionate power .
And as their power grows ever - more - threatened , the psychopaths grow ever - more - desperate .
We are witnessing the apotheosis of the overworld – the overlapping criminal syndicates that lurk above ordinary society and law just as the underworld lurks below it .
During the past fifty years , psychopaths have gained almost absolute control of all the branches of government .
You can notice this if you observe carefully that no matter what illegal thing a modern politician does , no one will really take him to task .
All of the so called scandals that have come up , any one of which would have taken down an authentic administration , are just farces played out for the public , to distract them , to make them think that the democracy is still working .
One of the main factors to consider in terms of how a society can be taken over by a group of pathological deviants is that the psychopaths ’ only limitation is the participation of susceptible individuals within that given society .
Lobaczewski gives an average figure for the most active deviants of approximately 6 % of a given population .
( 1 % essential psychopaths and up to 5 % other psychopathies and characteropathies . )
The essential psychopath is at the center of the web .
The others form the first tier of the psychopath ’s control system .
The next tier of such a system is composed of individuals who were born normal , but are either already warped by long - term exposure to psychopathic material via familial or social influences , or who , through psychic weakness have chosen to meet the demands of psychopathy for their own selfish ends .
Numerically , according to Lobaczewski , this group is about 12 % of a given population under normal conditions .
So approximately 18 % of any given population is active in the creation and imposition of a Pathocracy .
The 6 % group constitutes the Pathocratic nobility and the 12 % group forms the new bourgeoisie , whose economic situation is the most advantageous .
When you understand the true nature of psychopathic influence , that it is conscienceless , emotionless , selfish , cold and calculating , and devoid of any moral or ethical standards , you are horrified , but at the same time everything suddenly begins to makes sense .
Our society is ever more soulless because the people who lead it and who set the example are soulless - they literally have no conscience .
In his book Political Ponerology , Andrej Lobaczewski explains that clinical psychopaths enjoy advantages even in non-violent competitions to climb the ranks of social hierarchies .
Because they can lie without remorse ( and without the telltale physiological stress that is measured by lie detector tests ) , psychopaths can always say whatever is necessary to get what they want .
In court , for example , psychopaths can tell extreme bald - faced lies in a plausible manner , while their sane opponents are handicapped by an emotional predisposition to remain within hailing distance of the truth .
Too often , the judge or jury imagines that the truth must be somewhere in the middle , and then issues decisions that benefit the psychopath .
As with judges and juries , so too with those charged with decisions concerning who to promote and who not to promote in corporate , military and governmental hierarchies .
The result is that all hierarchies inevitably become top - heavy with psychopaths .
Since psychopaths have no limitations on what they can or will do to get to the top , the ones in charge are generally pathological .
It is not power that corrupts , it is that corrupt individuals seek power .
How can we distinguish between psychopaths and healthy people ?
What is the portrait of a true psychopath ?
Such a dangerous question has almost never been successfully asked .
The reason is because we mistakenly confuse healthy for normal .
Human psychological diversity is the health of our race .
There is no normal because healthy humans continuously evolve beyond all normalizing standards .
The terrorism of searching through hierarchies for anyone deviating from normal is no different from witch hunts or Inquisitions .
You must remember that hierarchies thrive on such low dramas , torturing victims until they confess to evil beliefs .
Not so long ago the church and state ongoingly acquired significant income and property through witch hunts and Inquisitions .
This continued for over two hundred and fifty years .
Ten generations of Europeans understood pogrom as normal life .
Let us not return to that nightmare .
Testing for normal is guaranteed to backfire in our face .
There is no normal .
But there is conscience .

French President Nicolas Sarkozy has become a neoconservative heart - throb since he appears to genuinely admire the U.S.
He also is a mercantilist , protectionist , and nationalist .
Common positions all , but none advance America ’s interest .
Browbeating Ireland to reverse the results of its recent referendum rejecting the Lisbon Treaty , which would consolidate power in Brussels and create , nominally , at least , a united European defense and foreign policy , has become Sarkozy ’s latest passion .
He also wants to enhance European military power .
The former is a dubious venture , since the flow of power to Brussels almost certainly means a respective flow of liberty away from the European people .
But this is Europe ’s , not America ’s , business .
Sarkozy ’s military gambit is a more positive venture and provides Washington with an opportunity to say “ Au Revoir ” to its promise to defend Europe .
Until World War II , Europe contained several major if not great powers , while the U.S. was a military midget .
The U.S. foolishly abandoned its policy of continental defense and nonintervention in European wars in 1917 , briefly demonstrating its globe - spanning military potential , .
Unfortunately , its decision to ally with several imperial powers against several imperial powers led to an unbalanced European peace embodied in the Versailles Treaty , which contained the seeds of conflict in virtually every clause .
When the new war came , the threats were far more virulent .
With either Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia poised to dominate Eurasia , it was hard for the U.S. to avoid joining the murderfest .
Before the war even Italy had a bigger military than did America .
When peace came to Europe in May 1945 the U.S. vied with the Soviet Union as the globe ’s greatest military power .
Washington continued in that role throughout the extended Cold War , creating the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to guarantee the security of the war - torn and demoralized western European states .
Such a policy made sense during the 1950s and 1960s .
But as NATO ’s European members recovered economically , surpassing the Soviet Union and its dismal Eastern Bloc , the American - dominated alliance appeared to do more to deter European military spending than Soviet aggression .
The Europeans saw no reason to cut back on their welfare states to provide for their own defense .
In their view , the threat from Moscow was an insufficient reason not to construct a natural gas pipeline to the U.S.S.R.
European states similarly believed Washington ’s antagonism towards the Nicaraguan Sandinistas to be of no account in determining their own policy towards the new Marxist state in America ’s backyard .
Little has changed over the last two decades , even though the Soviet Union collapsed , Warsaw Pact dissolved , Berlin Wall fell , and one - time Soviet satellites and constituent republics scurried to join the EU and NATO .
The Europeans still leave their defense up to Washington , while subsidizing inefficient welfare states and disdaining U.S. international priorities .
The result is truly scandalous .
When the world ’s greatest , most powerful alliance grandly went off to its first war in 1999 , bombing hapless Yugoslavia over its attempt to prevent Kosovo ’s secession ( following standard European policy : remember Spain and the Basques , Britain and the Irish , and Turkey and the Kurds ) , the Europeans did little other than applaud .
After all , they acknowledged , while their combined economy and population exceeded those of America , their united combat effectiveness was only about ten to fifteen percent of that of the U.S.
One was tempted to ask , why did they bother maintaining militaries ?
Nothing has changed since then .
The practical firepower of NATO ’s European members remains dismal .
Yet the alliance keeps expanding , drawing in such powerhouses as Slovenia , Estonia , and Bulgaria , with Albania , Macedonia , and Georgia clamoring to get in the door .
While the Europeans periodically chatter about creating a continental defense policy , they leave their security in Washington ’s hands .
Moreover , the U.S. is expected to do the military heavy - lifting every where else .
America provides most outside troops in Iraq , the majority of foreign forces in Afghanistan , large garrisons in South Korea and Japan , and ships to patrol the globe ’s oceans , seas , gulfs , and straits .
The U.S. is the only nation , other , perhaps , than Israel , with the capacity to attack Iran , and is the ultimate guarantor against Russian or Chinese aggression .
While Europe has divided over some of these policies , particularly Iraq , most European states have been happy to pocket any geopolitical benefits from Washington ’s actions while carping on the sidelines .
Other than Britain , the Europeans do nothing meaningful in Iraq .
And only Britain , Canada , and the Netherlands help out much practically  as in , really fight  in Afghanistan .
True , Germany and numerous other European nations have troops on station in the latter , but have chosen locations or imposed rules of engagement to essentially keep their forces out of combat .
The Germans would n’t even shoot a notorious Taliban leader and bomber because the Germans had n’t been fired upon first .
The once feared Wehrmacht has become a gang of armed social workers .
The few score soldiers provided by the likes of Albania and Estonia merely demonstrate the hollowness of the Bush administration ’s supposedly grand coalition .
There ’s really the U.S. and the United Kingdom , and nobody else .
The alliance ’s terminal flaccidity is evident in its response to the growing need for troops in Afghanistan .
Last year Washington ’s plea for an additional 3,000 soldiers went unanswered , causing the U.S. to send in another 3,200 Marines .
At the April NATO summit the U.S. and Canada , whose small troop contingent has been under pressure , begged for European reinforcements .
Allied commanders in Afghanistan said they needed at least 10,000 more troops .
Most NATO members mumbled while looking at the floor .
Their militaries were strained , they told U.S. officials , who must scramble to maintain troops at some 800 military facilities around the globe .
The alliance collected pledges for an extra 2,000 soldiers , most in dribs and drabs , but only the French actually seem to be moving to deliver , with a promised 700 men .
Last week London said it planned to add 230 logistical and staff personnel .
Nor is the problem just manpower .
The Europeans notoriously lack lift capacity .
Their shortage of helicopters has crippled their troops ’ effectiveness in Afghanistan .
Other equipment is poor , old , or both .
One unnamed Pentagon official spoke of “ despair ” to the Daily Telegraph : “ For many countries being in Afghanistan seems to be about keeping up appearances , rather than actually fighting a war that needs to be won . ”
The Pentagon is considering sending up to 7,000 American more troops to Afghanistan next year , on top of the 34,000 already there .
( Allied states provide about 28,000 collectively . )
But now President Sarkozy is pushing a new initiative .
He wants to modernize the French military with full integration into NATO .
Moreover , he advocates providing the EU with a “ permanent and autonomous strategic planning capacity , ” creating a deployable European force of 60,000 and pooling European logistical resources .
Over the years American officials have had an odd ambivalence towards any autonomous European military initiatives .
Washington always wanted Europe to do more  but under U.S. control .
The whining grew deafening at the thought that the Europeans might create an independent military capability .
Horrors !
Our populous and prosperous allies might decide to do something with guidance and permission from Washington .
What is the world coming to ?
Instead of balking , the U.S. should offer encouragement .
Left unsupported , Sarkozy ’s proposal is unlikely to come to much .
His government is about to assume the six - month presidency of the EU Council , but the Irish rejection of the Lisbon Treaty puts the entire campaign for Europeans political integration , with a continental president and foreign minister , managing an EU defense and foreign policy , in doubt .
Moreover , every prior proposal for a European military capability , including a formal EU commitment in 1999 to create a Rapid Reaction Force , has come to naught .
Even the governments most friendly to the U.S.  in Germany , Italy , and Poland , for instance  prefer to applaud as American forces traverse the globe .
The belief that they would actually spend more money , put more people in uniform , and take greater risks belongs to a late - night comedy routine .
In speaking of European contributions to NATO , British Defense Secretary Des Browne admitted that there was “ far too big a mismatch between our aspirations and what we actually deliver . ”
He pointed to the lack of enthusiasm for bolstering the alliance ’s military capabilities and acknowledged : “ The public and politicians of many European NATO allies do not yet instinctively see expeditionary operations and capabilities as directly linked to their defense and security . ”
Domestic pressure is increasing among Canadians , Dutch , and Germans , in particular , to bring home their forces .
Britain , too , is growing weary of participating in America ’s wars and plans to soon withdraw its forces from Iraq .
Sarkozy might have the clout to remake the French military , but even he could have trouble dragging his nation into another U.S. - orchestrated war .
So what Washington needs to say is : it ’s time for Europe to defend itself .
It is truly a scandal that a continent filled with wealthy states run by politicians determined to forge a global power is unable to provide for its own defense and project sufficient military power to protect its international interests .
That will change only when it has to change .
Europe could do so much more .
To the extent that Russia requires deterring , it should be Europe ’s job .
To the degree that Eastern Europe can be drawn westward , it should be Europe ’s job .
To the extent that missile threats from Iran and similar states must be defended against , it should be Europe ’s job .
To the extent that North Africa can be integrated with Europe , it should be Europe ’s job .
A stronger Europe and U.S. could then join in military action elsewhere when their interests coincide .
And with a serious military capability , Europe could demand to be treated as an equal , with a decision - making role commensurate with its military contribution .
Of course , this might all be a pipe dream .
Perhaps the European people will continue to believe that a serious military is unnecessary .
But that ’s fine too .
It does n’t matter much to the U.S. if the Europeans can summon up the military wherewithal to garrison Kosovo or support Georgia against Russia .
Bizarrely , the Bush administration acts as if both of these issues matter to America .
They do n’t .
Being a superpower without a hegemonic competitor gives America enormous freedom of action .
Frankly , there is n’t much that need concern Washington .
Terrorism and proliferation pose the greatest threats today .
In decades hence China and maybe India could become geopolitical peer competitors .
But America ’s traditional security concern  that one power would dominate Eurasia  today looks like a paranoid fantasy .
If the Europeans prefer to engage in global social work , let them .
The U.S. can protect its own interests irrespective of the Europeans ’ behavior .
But doing so requires Washington to turn the defense of Europe over to the Europeans .
Nazism and Communism are dead .
The U.S. no longer needs to patrol the borders of Europe , whether old or new .
French President Sarkozy wants a more powerful European Union .
Excellent .
America should use NATO ’s 60th anniversary next April as the moment to hand over its well - worn defense responsibilities to the Europeans .
Voting is said to be slower than during the first round vote Voting has been slow in Zimbabwe 's run-off presidential poll in which Robert Mugabe is the sole candidate .
Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai withdrew from the contest because of violence against his supporters .
He said that millions were refusing to vote despite government efforts to force them to take part .
He also urged the world not to recognise the result .
The European Union called the run-off a " sham " and the US and Germany say the UN will consider sanctions .
Marwick Khumalo , head of the Pan - African parliamentary observer mission , told the BBC that turnout was very low and that the mood was sombre .
" We saw one long queue , which we mistook for a polling station , only to find the people were queuing for bread , " he said , adding that the ingredients for a free and fair election were missing .

However Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa told the BBC that people were taking part in large numbers to preserve Zimbabwe 's independence .
" They are voting to say no to the recolonisation of our country , " he said .
" They are voting to demand the lifting of illegal sanctions against Zimbabwe . "
As he cast his vote in Harare , Mr Mugabe , who is 84 , said he was feeling " very fit , very optimistic " .
' Frightening ' Foreign ministers for the Group of Eight nations ( G8 ) meeting in Japan have said they could not accept the legitimacy of a government " that does not reflect the will of the Zimbabwean people " .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said they would consult other members of the UN Security Council to see what " next steps " might need to be taken .
People will not feel safe moving about with an unmarked finger

At a glance
In pictures : Mugabe election A Zimbabwean journalist said militias loyal to Mr Mugabe were going door - to - door in townships outside the capital , Harare , forcing people to vote .
The BBC's John Simpson , in Zimbabwe despite a reporting ban , says he had never seen an election as frightening - where people know that if they fail to turn out to vote and do not have the ink stain to prove it , they are liable to the most ferocious retribution from the ruling Zanu - PF .
He adds that if someone does summon up the courage to vote for Morgan Tsvangirai , whose name is still on the ballot , then there are fears their identity could be discovered .
Journalist Themba Nkosi , in Bulawayo said officials for Mr Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) had told supporters in rural areas to vote if they felt their lives were in danger - and to vote for Morgan Tsvangirai or spoil their ballot .
A resident of Manicaland Province told the BBC : " I am not going to vote in a one - person race .
I will not vote for a dictator and for hunger while my brother was killed in cold blood . "

But Zanu - PF supporter Richard Munsaka , in Hwange , Matebeland North Province said the question of a free and fair election " depends on the eyes of the beholder " .
" I 'm not saying there is no violence in the east of the country ... but not on a massive scale and that in itself cannot stop the whole country from going to vote just because a few individuals are kicking themselves . "
A woman in Harare said : " I will be exercising my right .
We as Zimbabweans need to decide the direction that we want the country to take - so we can only do that by voting . "
Protection Reports suggested Zanu - PF membership cards were selling for huge sums on the black market .
Those buying the cards believe they will offer some protection from attack by militias , a BBC correspondent reports .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This election is a charade .
Mugabe and his thugs have succeeded in driving out the opposition Nikolai , UK Zimbabwe 's police said the MDC was planning to disrupt the elections and have warned that any criminal activity will be met " head on , and with the full force of the law " .
Polling stations are due to close at 1900 ( 1700 GMT ) .
At a news conference in Harare , Mr Tsvangirai said people were being intimidated into voting but said millions were refusing .
He called the poll a " sham " exercise staged by a " dictatorship desperate for the illusion of legitimacy " .
Mr Tsvangirai also urged the international community to reject the results .
" Anyone who recognises the result of this election is denying the will of the Zimbabwean people , " he said .
Mr Tsvangirai has been taking refuge at the Dutch embassy for most of the past six days .
Talks offer
The MDC is contesting three by - elections that are also taking place on Friday following the deaths of three candidates - in circumstances not related to the political violence .
The MDC won the parliamentary elections - also held in March - but the presidency is a far more powerful institution .

Mr Mugabe came second to Mr Tsvangirai in the first round of the presidential vote in March .
Since then , the MDC says some 86 of its supporters have been killed and 200,000 forced from their homes by militias loyal to Zanu - PF .
The government blames the MDC for the violence .
Regional leaders - including from Nigeria , the Southern African Development Community ( Sadc ) and the African Union - had called on Mr Mugabe to postpone the vote and negotiate with the opposition .
While Mr Mugabe said he planned to attend an African Union summit in Egypt next week , Mr Mugabe said the AU had " no right in dictating to us what we should do with our constitution , and how we should govern this country " .
He has suggested negotiations with the MDC were possible - " should we emerge victorious , which I believe we will " .
Mr Tsvangirai has said negotiations would not be possible if Mr Mugabe went ahead with the run-off .

What are these ?
We had to double check that this was n't a story about Second Life , but rather is an actual event in actual meatspace occurring this past weekend in Moscow .
As former chess champion Garry Kasparov was giving a speech to unite opposition political forces , a radio - controlled penis flew across the room to some applause and laughter .
The fun was ended when a dour - faced man smashed the penis out of the air .
That 's always the case , is n't it ?

It has been debated for nearly four decades but no one has yet been able to prove it is chemically possible .
Now good evidence suggests that birds can actually “ see ” the lines of the Earth ’s magnetic field .
Klaus Schulten of the University of Illinois , proposed forty years ago that some animals – including migratory birds – must have molecules in their eyes or brains which respond to magnetism .
The problem has been that no one has been able to find a chemical sensitive enough to be influenced by Earth ’s weak geomagnetic field .
Now Peter Hore and colleagues at the University of Oxford have found one .
Cryptochromes are a class of light - sensitive proteins found in plants and animals , and are thought to play a role in the circadian clock , in regulating plant growth , and timing coral sex .
A few years ago , Henrik Mouritsen of the University of Oldenburg in Germany showed that they were present in the retinal neurons of migratory garden warblers , and that these cells were active at dusk , when the warblers were performing magnetic orientation .

Weak but radical
Cryptochromes have not yet been made in the lab and obtaining them is difficult , but Hore ’s team has now shown that a related molecule – a carotenoid - porphyrin - fullerene triad – with similar chemical properties to cryptochromes is sensitive to weak magnetism .
Like cryptochromes , the CPF molecule , made by Devens Gust of Arizona State University , US , is stimulated by light of specific wavelengths to produce two free radicals .
Hore found that he could control the concentrations of each free radical in a solution of CPF by applying a magnetic field .
Hore says most chemists would have predicted that the extremely weak magnetic field could not possibly have an effect on molecules because the electromagnetism would be completely swamped by the molecules ’ inherent energy .
“ They are just tiny , tiny perturbations , ” he says .
But how could this influence the direction taken by a migrating bird ?
Birds appear to orientate at dusk , and cryptochromes form their pair of free radicals when “ activated ” by the blue light typical of dusk .
Hore suggests that dusk might activate the birds ’ magnetic sense , producing the radical pair .
The concentrations of each free radical would be controlled by the Earth ’s magnetic field , which is known to vary with latitude .
As a result , he speculates , the radicals would bind in varying degrees with other signalling molecules , depending on how far north or south the animal is .
Between the lines
How birds decode their “ magnetic sense ” is another topic of debate .
Mouritsen believes they have an additional layer to their vision , which when switched on allows them to visually “ see ” the Earth ’s magnetic field .
The situation would be similar to “ head - up displays ” in fighter jets and some cars , where transparent screens displaying information are built into windscreens .
“ Having that on all the time would be distracting , so you can see why it would be desirable for the system to switch on and off , ” says Hore .
Thorsten Ritz , of the University of California , Irvine , welcomes this “ first - ever demonstration of an earth - strength magnetic field effect on photochemical reactions ” .
“ It beautifully matches the theoretical expectations , ” he says .
Another group suggests that a quantum effect could underlie the birds ’ magnetic sense .

Going through a romantic breakup can be very distressing , and it ai n’t an easy experience for anyone .
However , things tend not to work out for some partners , which eventually leads to a breakup .
No matter how the relationship ended , there are surprising things that tend to happen after the breakup .
For instance , your ex-boyfriend starts calling and texting you perhaps after a few weeks , months or even years , and his key message is that he misses you and wants you back .
This might come at a point when you ’ve already moved on and you already have a new boyfriend , or you could have decided to take a break from relationships as you try to heal your broken heart .
However , making a decision on whether you should give him a second chance can be a very complicated process .
So , if you ’re in such a situation , you could be wondering what you need to do .
Well , there are certain things that you need to consider before getting back together with your ex-boyfriend .
In this , I am going to delve deeper into some factors that will help you decide whether you should accept your ex-boyfriend back after he dumped you .
Things You Need To Consider Before Giving Your Ex Another Chance
How long had you been together ?
It is important that you put into consideration the length of time that you two were together .
It would be easier to work out things in a relationship that had lasted for years than one where you had been together for just a few months .
What ’s more , if you had been with him for just a few months and fighting always seemed to be the order of the day , that could be an indication that you two were incompatible .
Fighting among couples is inevitable , but when it happens too often , something is not right .
All in all , the duration of the previous relationship is a key factor that you need to consider .
Why did he dump you ?
The first thing you need to do is to ask yourself why he dumped you .
It could be he dumped you for no apparent reason , but all the same , it would be important to find out the reason as to why he dumped you .
Getting to know the reason you were dumped helps you to make an informed decision on whether the relationship will last or whether it will be another round of fights and disagreements .
For instance , if you ’re ex-boyfriend dumped you because he thought you did not satisfy him sexually , it is possible he might still feel the same way if you get back together and the relationship might not be fulfilling , nor last for long .
Regardless of the reasons he will give you , it is advisable that you put into consideration all those reasons before you decide to give him a second chance so as to ensure you are not running back into a relationship that will fail a second time .
Will you be able to trust him with your heart again ?
Being dumped can be a very painful and agonizing experience , particularly when you thought he could become your life partner .
Betrayal can result in feelings of distrust and anger , and it is important that you first deal with those feelings before giving him another chance .
It is also important to note that trust is a key component of any relationship , and it would be difficult to have a peaceful union if you ’re not able to trust him again .
Do you vibe well with his personality traits ?
Being crazy in love or even just very attracted to someone is one thing , but if you do n’t get on with a number of their personality traits then it is likely to cause a problem in your relationship .
Was there friction between how you and he say the relationship ?
Does he have any personality traits that you ca n’t accept ?
If there are and he ’s willing to work on them then that is certainly a positive sign .
If he ’s just so stubborn that he refuses to change then this could be a problem .
Stubbornness is a trait that many people seem to have in varying degrees and is very typical of Aries or Taurus men .
However , with a little maturity , he should be open and willing to accept that he may need to lighten up a little on the bull - headedness .
In my opinion , anger is definitely a trait that needs to be addressed in order for two people to have a happy and healthy relationship .
Is he seeing someone else ?
Another important thing that you need to find out before giving your ex-boyfriend another chance is if he has another girlfriend .
Well , it would really help to consider how the other relationship is likely to influence your relationship should you get back together .
For instance , how will seeing them talk to each other affect you ?
Will feelings of jealousy affect your relationship ?
It would also be important to find out why they broke up with that other girl .
If he ’s been staying in contact with you then it ’s more likely that he is not seeing someone else , although this is not a definite thing .
It is also entirely possible that he is seeing another woman but is still thinking about you and missing you .
Here are some more reasons why your ex boyfriend is staying in touch with you .
One way you can find out if he is seeing someone else is to simply start a conversation with him over text .
Before long you will likely pick up if he is seeing another woman by how he responds to you .
However , if you ’re still not sure then you can ask him directly .
after all , it is perfectly natural to ask your ex how they are doing and what they are up to after the two of you have broken up .
Have you moved on ?
If you had already accepted that it is over , chances are you might find it difficult to give the relationship another chance , particularly if it ’s been months since you two broke up .
So , if you had already erased him from your mind and life , you might want to think hard if it is worth giving him another chance more so since he had decided you are not the one for him .
However , if you still love him and you feel that you want to take the risk , why not ?
Summary
In addition to the things I have mentioned above , it would also be important to find out the reasons why your ex-boyfriend wants to come back to you , and whether you two will fit into each other ’s life .
Finally , making a decision on whether you should take your ex-boyfriend back after he dumped you can be a daunting task , but I am sure that it will be a lot easier if you put the above factors into consideration .
WASHINGTON ( AP )  New Englanders struggling this summer to pay gas prices topping $ 4 a gallon should brace for more bad news — home heating oil costs next winter are expected to hit record highs .
One retail heating oil dealer says she expects a typical household delivery that cost $ 500 last winter will climb to at least $ 850 this winter .
" It 's going to be staggering , " said Northboro Oil Co. owner Sandra Farrell in telephone interview with The Associated Press .
" It 's going to be a real problem going into this winter for everyone unless something changes . "
Farrell , whose family has owned and operated the Northborough , Mass. , business since 1953 , said some dealers are talking about prices in the $ 4.89 per gallon range for the coming winter , about $ 2 more per gallon than last winter .
An average household usually needs four deliveries from December to March , she said .
Record - high crude oil prices have sent gasoline costs soaring this year .
The National Energy Assistance Directors ' Association , which represents state - run low income energy assistance programs , recently predicted that home heating oil costs will hit record levels this winter .
The group said the national average cost to heat a home with oil this winter will be $ 2,593 , up from $ 1,962 last winter .
Families in cold - weather Northeast states will be hit even harder .
About 40 % of Massachusetts homes use oil heat .
More than 963,000 households in the state use home heating oil which is delivered by more than 800 distributors , many of them small businesses .
In Maine , one of the nation 's coldest states , four out of five households heat with oil .
Farrell told a Senate panel she expects high heating oil costs will force many cash - strapped families to make tough choices between eating and staying warm .
" It is very tough looking into the eyes of these customers when they ask me what I think they should do , " Farrell said in testimony Wednesday at a Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee hearing .
" I do n't know what to tell them .
For the first time I think some of my customers are going to have to choose between main essentials like groceries , gasoline , warm clothes and heating oil just to pay their bills . "
Sen. John Kerry , D - Mass. , who heads the Small Business panel , warned of an impending crisis in the Northeast , which is more reliant on oil heat than other regions .
" It is reality not rhetoric that price spikes will force people to decide whether to feed their families or heat their homes , " Kerry said at the hearing .
Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe , the panel 's ranking Republican member , said high oil prices are a matter of life and death .
She said parts of Maine could literally " become uninhabitable " for many this winter .
" When people can't afford the cost of home heating oil , they simply freeze , " Snowe said .
" Consumers and small businesses are being stretched to the limit and beyond , but nowhere is the ensuing calamity looming larger than in New England where just getting through this winter is fast - becoming our No. 1 priority . "
To ease the oil heating price crunch , Kerry and Snowe are pushing legislation to give businesses hurt by high heating oil costs access to credit through Small Business Administration disaster loan programs .
They also want to help more families by expanding government home heating aid through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program .
Millions of poor and elderly people on fixed incomes rely on heating assistance to help pay their bills .
Snowe has a bill , co-sponsored by Kerry , to mandate that heating oil from the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve should be released if home heating oil tops $ 4 per gallon this winter .
Farrell said the line between running a business and a social services agency can sometimes seem to blur when she 's dealing with families who can't afford to heat their homes .
" It is painful to have to tell someone when the temperature outside is below zero that we cannot deliver to them because they have no money , " she said in testimony .
" I have made so many exceptions , but if I make too many more , the business wo n't survive . "
Small oil dealers are feeling squeezed because many customers can't pay , or else they get way behind in what they owe .
The credit crunch means dealers can't pay their suppliers , who want their money within 10 days , Farrell said .
" We 're finding the cash coming in very slowly , " Farrell said .

Following the recent reports of a man dying after handling compost , is it still safe to have a compost heap in the garden ?
T Dent , Suffolk
The Lancet did , indeed , report on the case of a 47 - year - old man from Buckinghamshire who died of kidney failure a week after inhaling Aspergillus fumigatus spores while handling old bags of compost , leading him to develop acute aspergillosis .
These fungal spores are an essential component of composting and help organic matter from the garden to decompose , but such incidents are , thankfully , extremely rare .
Indeed , a microbiologist at Wycombe hospital , where the man was taken , said he had been " extremely unlucky " :
" There must have been a very large number of spores which he inhaled ...
He was a smoker and a welder by trade and his lungs may have been damaged .
It 's a very unusual thing to happen , but if people are dealing with big bags of mulch , there is a potential danger . "
Earlier this year , a leading German pneumologist went as far as recommending that gardeners wear face masks when handling compost and mulch .
Jane Griffiths , sustainable waste manager at Garden Organic ( formerly known as the Henry Doubleday Research Association ) , agrees that , when handling or turning compost , wearing a dust mask is a sensible precaution .
" A compost bin should be treated with due consideration , " she says .
" However , this fungus should not cause anybody harm at a home - composting level . "
Griffiths also recommends using a compost bin rather than a loose heap , to keep the spores contained ; ensuring that the organic material inside the bin is kept moist ; only adding small quantities of matter at a time ; and maintaining an even , aereated mix of " green and brown " materials inside .

The runner 's high : every athlete has heard of it , most believe in it and many say they 've experienced it .
But scientists have reserved judgment because no rigorous test confirmed its existence .
Until now .
Researchers in Germany , using advances in neuroscience , report in the current issue of the journal Cerebral Cortex that the folk belief is true : running does elicit a flood of endorphins in the brain .
The endorphins are associated with mood changes and the more endorphins a runner 's body pumps out , the greater the effect .
Leading endorphin researchers not associated with the study say they accept its findings .
" Impressive , " says Solomon Snyder , a neuroscience professor at Johns Hopkins and a discoverer of endorphins in the 1970s .
" I like it , " says Huda Akil , a professor of neurosciences at the University of Michigan .
" This is the first time someone took this head on .
It was n't that the idea was not the right idea .
It was that the evidence was not there . "
For athletes , the study offers a vindication that runner 's high is not just a New Age -y excuse for their claims of feeling good after a hard workout .
Some people reported they felt so good when they exercised that it was as if they had taken mood - altering drugs .
Others who say they 'd experienced a runner 's high found it to be infrequent – they might feel relaxed or at peace after exercising , but only occasionally euphoric .
Often , those who say they experienced an intense euphoria report that it came after an endurance event .
Some , such as marathon runner Marian Westley , had such volatile emotions that the sight of a puppy could make her weep .
A short , intense effort , like a five - kilometre race , induced the high in still others who pushed themselves near to the point of collapse .
And yet , there are those like Annie Hiniker , who says that when she finishes a 5 - K race , the last thing she feels is euphoric .
" I feel like I want to throw up , " she says .
For more than 30 years , the runner 's high hypothesis has been unproven since spinal taps were the only way to measure endorphins in the brain .
The theory proposed there were real biochemical effects of exercise on the brain as the release of endorphins – the brain 's naturally occurring opiates – could change an athlete 's mood .
Running was not the only way to get the feeling ; it could also occur with most intense or endurance exercise .
But now medical technology has caught up with exercise lore .
For athletes and nonathletes alike , the results are opening a new chapter in exercise science .
It is now possible to define and measure the runner 's high , and should be possible to figure out what brings it on .
The results also offer hope for those who do not enjoy exercise , but do it anyway , as motivation to elicit a feeling that makes working out positively addictive .
The lead researcher for the study , Dr. Henning Boecker of the University of Bonn , says he got the idea of testing the endorphin hypothesis when he realized that methods he and others were using to study pain were directly applicable .
The idea was to use 3 - D imaging PET scans , combined with recently available chemicals that reveal endorphins in the brain , to compare runners ' brains before and after a long run .
If the scans showed that endorphins were being produced and were attaching themselves to areas of the brain involved with mood , that would be direct evidence for the endorphin hypothesis .
And if the runners , who were not told what the study was looking for , also reported mood changes with intensities matching the amount of endorphins produced , that would be another clincher for the argument .
Boecker and his colleagues recruited 10 distance runners and told them they were doing a broader study of opioid receptors in the brain and not specifically the release of endorphins , and the runner 's high .
The athletes had PET scans before and after two - hour runs .
They also took a standard psychological test that indicated their moods before and after running .
The data showed that , indeed , endorphins were produced during running and were attaching themselves to areas of the brain associated with emotions – in particular the limbic and prefrontal areas .
The limbic and prefrontal areas , Boecker says , are activated when people are involved in romantic love affairs or , he says , " when you hear music that gives you a chill of euphoria , like Rachmaninoff 's Piano Concerto No. 3 . "
The greater the euphoria the runners reported , the more endorphins in their brain .

" Some people have these really extreme experiences with very long or intensive training , " says Boecker , a casual runner and cyclist who says he feels completely relaxed and his head is clearer after a run .
That calm and clarity also occurred in the study subjects : " You could really see the difference after two hours of running .
You could see it in their faces , " he says .
In a follow - up study , Boecker is investigating whether running affects pain perception .
" There are studies that showed enhanced pain tolerance in runners , " he says .
" You have to give higher pain stimuli before they say , ` Okay , this hurts .'''
C and Morse Code
Darren Stokes sides with Joel over Jeff on whether programmers should know C .
This whole debate reminds me of amateur radio operators bickering over whether newbies should be allowed to get a license without learning Morse code .
Morse Code
So Eric , tell us about your experience as an amateur " ham " radio operator ?
My call sign is KA9KEF .
To get my General class license , I had to pass a written exam as well as a Morse code test at 13 words per minute .
Really , you know Morse code ?
Nowadays , it 's possible to get a ham radio license with no code at all .
Yes , and I think that 's outrageous !
It 's just wrong .
Why do you think that ?
If I had to learn Morse code , then everybody else should too .
So does anybody really need Morse code these days ?
Well , I suppose not .
But do n't pester me with facts that distract from my point .
Learning Morse code should be a rite of passage for all hams .
Anybody who got a license without code is not a " real ham " .
But you -- you are a " real ham " .
Yep .
I passed the Morse code test . 13 wpm .
So you 're still actively involved in amateur radio ?
Well , no .
Oh .
When was the last time you used your ham rig ?
I suppose it 's been a few years .
How many years are in " a few " ?
Maybe five ?
More like twenty .
Twenty years ?
Twenty - three , actually .
And you still have your amateur radio equipment ?
Well , no .
I sold my station a long time ago .
OK , let 's review .
You 're a " real ham " , even though everything you know about ham radio is two decades out of date .
But the guys who got a " no code " license and are actively practicing the hobby today , they 're somehow not " real " ?
That 's right .
I know Morse code .
They do n't .
So you think all ham radio operators should be required to learn a basically useless skill simply because you did ?
Exactly !
And do n't ask me to get down from my high horse .
I like it up here .
C
The argument about whether programmers need to know C is just so similar .
All of the people arguing that C is important are the people who have already learned it .
I 'm pretty sure that a lot of their argument is resting on the same foundation as those crotchety old hams : " If I had to learn C , then everybody else should too . "
I am one of those people .
Yep , not only am I a Morse code bigot , I 'm a C bigot as well .
I learned C , and I learned it good .
I 've worked on multiple significant C projects .
I even wrote a C compiler .
In C. I think all " real programmers " know C .
Yep , we C programmers are elitist and proud of it .
The view from up here on our high horse is pretty good .
We see lots of so - called programmers down there :
They do n't really know what a pointer is .
They 're not even using a real compiler !
That thing they 're using does n't even generate native code you know .
It 's " byte code " , so it 's not real .
Those people have never had to manage their own memory .
In fact , they 've never really had to do anything at all .
I mean really .
They 're building on a class library that 's got more features in it than Photoshop .
We are different .
We learned C. We are " real programmers " .
One big difference
What 's the main difference between hams who know Morse code and programmers know C ?
The C programmers actually have a point .
Seriously , strip away all the elitism and see what 's left .
Morse code is nearly useless , but C is still darn important whether you 're using it or not .
And a lot of people are still using it , by the way .
Do n't think of C as merely " important historical and foundational background " .
In fact , my current project is being written in C. Software development today is a big field .
There are still many problems for which C is the best solution .
But even if you 're coding in something higher level , the experience of using low - level programming techniques is invaluable .
I 'm not going to take a black - and - white stance on this .
I wo n't go so far as to say that every developer must learn C. I 've met lots of developers without C experience who are successful and making positive contributions to important software projects .
Furthermore , I 'll admit that knowing C is not a magic solution to poor skills .
A lousy developer who happens to know C is simply better equipped to hurt himself or somebody nearby .
However , I can say these two things :
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Newly diagnosed cases of post - traumatic stress disorder among U.S. troops sent to Iraq and Afghanistan surged 46.4 percent in 2007 , bringing the five - year total to nearly 40,000 , according to U.S. military data released on Tuesday .

The statistics , released by the Army , showed the number of new PTSD cases formally diagnosed at U.S. military facilities climbed to 13,981 last year from 9,549 in 2006 .
The numbers rose as President George W. Bush poured extra forces into Iraq to try to quell sectarian violence and extended Army tours from 12 to 15 months .
The United States has also sent more forces to Afghanistan .
The figures , encompassing all four branches of the U.S. armed services , showed that the Army alone had 10,049 new PTSD cases last year .
This brings to 39,366 the number of PTSD cases diagnosed at military facilities between January 1 , 2003 , and December 31 , 2007 , among troops deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan .
The totals include 28,365 cases for the Army , 5,641 for the Marines , 2,884 for the Navy and 2,476 for the Air Force .
Army officials said the larger number of PTSD diagnoses in recent years partly reflects greater awareness and tracking of the disorder by the U.S. military .
LONGER , MULTIPLE COMBAT TOURS
“ But we ’re also exposing more people to combat , ” Lt. Gen. Eric Schoomaker , the Army surgeon general , told reporters .
Experts also say PTSD symptoms increase as soldiers return to combat for multiple tours of duty .
PTSD is a health condition that can result from wartime trauma such as being physically wounded or seeing others hurt or killed .
Symptoms range from irritability and outbursts of anger to sleep difficulties , trouble concentrating , extreme vigilance and an exaggerated startle response .
People with the condition can persistently relive the traumatic events that initially induced horror or helplessness .
The Pentagon has come under mounting political pressure in recent years to enhance treatment for PTSD amid criticism that initial programs were inadequate .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Earlier this month , Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced a change in the U.S. government clearance process that allows PTSD sufferers to seek help for combat - related mental health problems without risking their military careers .
Army officials on Tuesday emphasized that the data do not reflect the actual number of troops and war veterans who suffer from PTSD , many of whom do not seek treatment or have been diagnosed at civilian facilities where records are confidential .
A recent study by the RAND Corp. estimated about 300,000 troops , or 18.5 percent , of the more than 1.5 million troops sent to Iraq and Afghanistan exhibit symptoms of either PTSD or depression .
The fresh statistics add detail about the scale of human suffering from two wars that have killed 4,579 U.S. troops and inflicted physical wounds on 32,076 more .
There currently are 155,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and 33,000 in Afghanistan .

Companies in this article Nintendo
Having ignited controversy with remarks he insists were a " joke " , Nintendo 's Laurent Fischer has moved to reassure consumers on the issue of Wii system memory , confirming : " We 're working on a solution " .
But rumours of an external hard drive have been torpedoed by the Euro marketing boss , who revealed : " Definitely there 's no plan to issue hardware " .
In his first major interview since the now - infamous " geeks and otaku " comment was quoted in a magazine article , Fischer insisted that the company took people 's concerns over the storage limits of its console seriously .
" We definitely detect that they [ gamers ] are serious and we know there is an issue in this , so it 's something that we 're working on , " he told GamesIndustry .biz .
But Fischer poured cold water on rumours - stemming from recent hints dropped by Nintendo President Satoru Iwata - that the company was planning an external solution .
" Definitely there 's no plan to issue hardware , an external hard drive , but we know that we have an issue in that area , " he added .
" It 's very obvious and we 're perfectly aware of it , but there 's nothing we can say beyond this . "
Pressed on what this entailed , Fischer said he was not yet privy to the details , explaining that " this area is fully handled by the development team in Japan .
It 's very linked to the overall strategy ; that 's something they 're working on . "
Last week , Edge magazine reported that Fischer had said during a press event that only " geeks and otaku " were worried about Wii memory limitations .
The comments provoked a furious response in forums , and a scathing attack from outspoken God Of War creator David Jaffe , who labelled the remarks " arrogant " and said Nintendo should be " very ashamed " if they reflected company thinking .
Fischer was forced to issue a statement aplogising for what he called a " misunderstanding " .
And eager fully to set the record straight , he this week insisted his words had been meant as a " joke " .
" I really did n't use that terminology to describe the Nintendo consumer - it was something related basically to myself and to the journalists attending .
It was a joke I made on myself and somehow it 's been confused and taken out of context to define those consumers . "
He added : " I understand I have created a lot of offence with people .
And for me it 's very , very important to clarify this - that 's not the kind of thing I 've been saying in [ the way it has been reported ] .
Disappointment in the community is something I was really affected by .
" We had this event one month ago .
It was very positive ; we had lots of open and interesting discussions with journalists and the developers - it was beneficial for us as we could go in depth into all the WiiWare questions . "
Wii offers 512 Mb of Flash memory for the storage of saved games and downloadable content .
But following the launch of the WiiWare games channel - which rolled out in Europe on May 20th - many users have complained of running out of storage space .
With the promised " solution " still shrouded in secrecy , Fischer reiterated Nintendo 's official advice : " You can store your Virtual Console games on an SD card , and also we at Nintendo can store the things for you .
So if you delete some of the software you have downloaded it 's no problem to go again to the download process and get the software back for free . "
Consumers , however , have complained that this is a cumbersome process in practice .

IT 'S FREE As skyrocketing food and gasoline prices strain budgets , utilities are disconnecting many more customers who fall behind on their bills , and even moderate - income households are getting zapped .
Electricity and natural gas shutoffs are up at least 15 % in several states compared with last year .
Totals for some utilities have more than doubled .
" We 're seeing a record number of shutoffs , " says Mark Wolfe , head of the National Energy Assistance Directors ' Association , which represents programs that subsidize energy bills .
An NEADA survey this month shows 8 % of four - member households earning $ 33,500 to $ 55,500 have had their power turned off for non-payment .
" It 's hitting people in the suburbs with two cars and two kids , " Wolfe says .
The disconnects are rising as warm - weather power bills increase , some state moratoriums on winter shutoffs expire , and rates are climbing in many states .
Service is typically restored within days after customers work out payment plans , but even brief outages can pose a health hazard on sweltering days .
Still , customers typically pay the mortgage and car payment before utility charges , as they can usually buy more time from the power or gas company .
In Pennsylvania , PPL Electric Utilities disconnected 7,054 customers through April this year , up 168 % over the same 2007 period .
PPL wo n't shut off customers until they owe at least $ 250 and will first try to work out a payment plan , says spokesman Ryan Hill .
Duke Energy in North Carolina is averaging about 11,000 shutoffs a month , 14 % above last year .
That 's an annualized rate equal to nearly 10 % of its 1.4 million residential customers , though Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan says some households may be shut off more than once .
She says unpaid bills are ultimately borne by all other customers through higher rates .
Disconnects are up 27 % for Peoples Gas in Chicago , 14 % for Southern California Edison and 56 % for Detroit Edison , according to utilities or regulators .
In Michigan , where home foreclosures are soaring and the unemployment rate is the USA 's highest , more than one in five Detroit Edison customers were behind in their electric bills in May .
Some help is available .
The Low - Income Home Energy Assistance Program ( LIHEAP ) is providing $ 2.5 billion in fiscal 2008 , but funds are depleted .
Congress may kick in $ 1 billion more .
States add $ 2 billion but strapped ones such as Rhode Island are scrapping aid .
Ginger Hall , 34 , got a shutoff notice from her Sacramento power company in March when she racked up about $ 500 in overdue bills after a broken furnace forced her to use electric heaters .
She paid the debt with help from LIHEAP .
Hall , who is married with four children , says their $ 45,000 household income is normally sufficient , but not with food and gas prices soaring .
" You can't have your utilities getting shut off , but when they double each month , it catches you off guard .
You have to juggle and make it work , " she says .

Desired Demo :
Men , not necessary homosexuals , who want to sodomize a migrant worker
Quote :
" Im a construction guy really not gay ... I pick this guy up to work with me he is one of those mexican waiting for day jobs in the corners and I do n't think he is gay also but I give extra cash for his extra service ... sweet sweet butt , I pick him up 3 - 4 days a week , I thought I could find some to do this with , another guy with strong dick . "
What We Can Assume :
We 're guessing Lou Dobbs is going to use this as ammunition in his campaign for immigration reform .
Meanwhile , the construction worker in the Village People suddenly makes a lot more sense , though we still do n't get the gay Indian .

Where It Went Wrong :
The photo is presumably the boner of the construction worker who posted the listing .
Unfortunately , it 's simply not an effective use of imagery if you 're trying to attract people interested in " sweet sweet butt , " or sweet sweet anything really .
Also , if the listing 's creator is " really not gay , " he might want to think twice about soliciting men with his dong .
Why They 're Not Getting Laid :
A blue collar worker who sodomizes migrant workers : Sounds like the villain from some NRA - sponsored first person shooter .
We 're guessing there are more armed to the hilt conservative vigilantes out there than men interested in photos of a fat , " not gay " dude 's dong .
How the most expensive clothes in the world get made
Adil Najam
For nearly two days now I have been debating whether to put up this post and , especially , the accompanying photograph .
A shiver runs through my body to think about , let alone see , this picture .
But as we have done before ( here , here , here , here , here , here ) we put up this picture of mob vigilante violence – with the strongest possible advisement for caution by the faint of heart – not because we wish to glorify or fetishize violence but because we want to jolt ourselves , and you , into a realization of just what a horrible , horrifying and horrendous epidemic of violence is spreading through our land .
Recently we had heard of people in Multan reacting to the energy shortage by violently attacking WAPDA offices and officials .
Now , one reads of a much more horrifying spectacle of residents in Karachi on May 14 burning alive robbers ; two died at the spot and another later in the hospital ( details below ) .
We had called 2007 “ A Year of Angst and Anger . ”
But maybe we live in the age of angst and anger .
( We are purposely putting the picture and story ‘ below the fold ’ ( after the ‘ Next Page ’ button ) so that those who do not wish to read or see this for their own sensibilities can do so . )
A group of incensed residents of the Nishtar Road neighbourhood beat and burnt three robbers so badly on Wednesday that two died on the spot and another died at hospital .
The three men ( according to some reports there was one more ) were caught trying to escape after robbing flat No. 303 of Samia Kalam Building during which its resident Akbar was injured , said DSP Malik Mazar Hussain .
There were reports that the men of the area got together to grab the men who were beaten with whatever they could lay their hands on , including sticks and blades .
Some type of oil was sprinkled on them and a match was lit .
The police were present but the mob did not agree to hand them over .
They said that the police would release them for a bribe or they could easily get bail , so they would tackle matters on their own .
They also argued that this incident would teach other criminals a lesson .
The incident took place around midday and nearly five to six police mobile units and ambulances reached the scene .
An ambulance volunteer claimed that the police was standing there unable to do anything and the other volunteers had to wait for 20 minutes before they could take the injured and dead to hospital .
“ The robbers were lying in a pile on the road and petrol was poured over them , ” he said .
The real story is told by this very graphic picture below , from AFP , of an angry street mob in Karachi on May 14 burning and being jubilant over the burning of robbers who had just held robbed an apartment in the Nishtar Road area .
The basic details , according to The Daily Times are :
The report in The News gives more texture .
In a shocking incident of vigilante justice , a mob in Karachi on Wednesday burnt three bandits alive near the Timber Market , venting their anger and disgust over the rising crimes .
The gory incident took place when four robbers barged into Akbar Soomro ’s apartment on the third floor in the Somiya Mukarram Palace , situated near the Timber Market .
The robbers barged into his house at around 1:30 pm and held the children hostage at gunpoint .
They cut the telephone line and electricity wires and locked the house from inside and started misbehaving with the women .
The bandits looted cash and jewellery .
When they were about to flee , the door bell rang .
When the bandits opened the door , they found Akbar , the head of the family .
They shot and injured him and started fleeing .
Akbar , a seaman by profession , chased the bandits and made a hue and cry .
The passers - by and residents of the area caught the three bandits and started beating them , while the fourth escaped .
They immediately shifted Akbar to a hospital where he was declared out of danger .
In the meantime , 800 to 1,000 people gathered at the scene and started beating the robbers with fists , blows and sticks .
Some people brought kerosene and petrol and sprinkled it over the bandits and the mob torched them .
Some people resorted to aerial firing and also shot and injured the bandits before they were killed .
A large contingent of police tried to rescue the bandits but the public resisted and pushed the police back .
Edhi workers who tried to save the bandits who were aflame were also beaten by the public .
After a tough struggle of 20 minutes , the police managed to shift one injured bandit to hospital , while two bandits who were completely burnt died on the spot .
The third bandit died in the hospital after struggling for life for two hours .
The residents said they were happy over the incident and praised the persons who had torched these robbers alive .
The robbers , they said , looted the area people and had been killing them for just a cell - phone or cash .
They added due to this , they had instructed their children not to resist and surrender cell - phones to the robbers .
They said what the people achieved was justice because had the bandits been arrested , they would have been granted bail by the courts and would have resumed looting .
Of course , one ’s sympathy is with the children and the family that were robbed and held at gunpoint .
Of course , one ’s sympathy is with Akbar and his valiant attempt to save his family .
Of course , one sympathizes with the community and their anger at the police for not being able to stop these robberies .
Of course , one wants the robbers to be brought to justice .
But , no , one cannot condone or accept the vigilantism and the very violent vigilantism at that .
Had the community caught the robbers and then handed them to the police , maybe pressured the police to actually do something , that would have been heroic .
There is nothing heroic about burning them alive , doing so on purpose , and expressing pride at doing so .
That is only sad – and deeply disturbing .
Let us put this in context .
Because horrible as this incident is , the context is more horrifying .
And the real is the increasingly prevalent phenomenon of the justification of violence .
The justification of violence and of violent means for achieving goals that one considers worthy – and which may well be worthy – is a deeply disturbing phenomenon ( we have heard , and probably will again hear hints of this attitude of justification in the comments right here on ATP ) .
From the vigilantism of the Lal Masjid brigades , to the murder of a woman MNA , to political mayhem in Karachi last year , to political assassinations , to the menace of suicide bombers , and beyond .
All of these are signs of people seeking political and social goals – goals that would ordinarily have been sought through political and social means in a stable society – through violent means .
These are signs of a divided society that is losing faith in societal processes and taking things into its own hand .
These are manifestations of the tearing apart of a people .
A tearing apart that is fed by the apathy and an inability to provide essential justice by those who are in power .
What we see here is a sign – and it is not longer a ‘ first ’ sign , because there have been too many of these signs – of societal angst having reached blow - up proportions .
I have believed , and continue to believe , that we are a good people ( I think all people are essentially good but circumstances can make them do bad things ) .
Burning people alive – even criminals – is not what good people do .
I understand that living in Pakistan is like living in a pressure cooker ; and the pressure can get to the best of us .
But if we are indeed to be vigilant – and we must – then let us also be vigilant of our own actions .
Let us not let the actions of those who are compelled to do bad things force us to loose our inherent goodness and human decency .

about food Poisoning
Foodborne illness , or “ food poisoning ” occurs when food contaminated with bacteria , viruses , or parasites or is consumed .
Poisonous chemicals , toxins , pesticides , and other harmful substances can also cause illness or “ poisoning . ”
Food can become contaminated as a result of improper food processing , handling , preparation and / or storage .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) estimates that each year 48 million Americans are sickened by food poisoning , resulting in about 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths .*
Food Poisoning symptoms
Food poisoning symptoms may vary , and can include upset stomach , diarrhea , fever , nausea , vomiting , abdominal cramps , headache , weakness , and dehydration .
The symptoms may appear several hours to several days after eating contaminated food .
Everyone is at risk for food poisoning , however , pregnant women , infants and children , and the frail and elderly , are at greatest risk for severe food poisoning complications .
food poisoning pathogens
The CDC reports that the most commonly recognized bacterial foodborne infections are caused by Salmonella , Clostridium perfringens , and Campylobacter .
Other bacteria including , E. coli , Listeria , Shigella , Staph aureus , and Vibrio also cause illness and life threatening infections .
The viruses Norovirus and Hepatitis A ; and parasites Cyclospora , Giardia , Toxoplasma , and Cyrptosporidium are also of considerable public health concern .
Still , other foodborne diseases are caused by the presence of a microbial toxin .
For example , a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum causes the rare but deadly disease botulism .

It 's hard to watch the college - baseball World Series , under way now in Omaha , Neb. , without noticing how different the college game is from the major - league version .
Not in the caliber of play or the funny ping of the aluminum bats , but in the way the players look .
College players in the three main divisions are 86 % white , according to the most - recent NCAA figures .
That 's a big difference from Major League Baseball , where one study puts the number at less than 60 % .
The most striking difference is in the number of Latinos on ...
The Pentagon in Arlington , Virginia , has been the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense since the 1940s and is now widely recognized as both a visual and a metonymic symbol of the U.S. military .
According to many trivia pages , the Pentagon was designed and constructed when segregation laws abounded , so it has twice as many bathrooms as necessary .
Is that true ?
Of its construction , Pentagon historian Steve Vogel wrote :
The creation of the Pentagon in seventeen whirlwind months during World War II is one of the great construction feats in American history , involving a tremendous mobilization of manpower , resources , and minds .
In astonishingly short order , Brigadier General Brehon B. Somervell conceived and built an institution that ranks with the White House , the Vatican , and a handful of other structures as symbols recognized around the world .
All did not go smoothly during the construction of the Pentagon , however .
Despite the impression created by some post - war Hollywood films that depicted white and black troops fighting side by side during World War II , the U.S. armed forces were not desegregated until 1948 ( three years after the end of the war ) , when President Harry Truman issued an executive order calling for “ equality of treatment for all persons in the armed services , without regard to race , color , religion or national origin . ”
The racial divide that existed in wartime America ( and the manpower shortages created by the war ) affected the civilian workers who toiled on the Pentagon construction site as well :
There were racial tensions among the construction workers .
About 40 percent of the work force was black ; many of them worked as laborers , but because of wartime manpower shortages , others were given jobs as skilled workers .
The prominent role of black workers bred resentment among some whites .
The construction cafeterias had separate sections for black and white workers in accordance with the “ Virginia Separation of Races ” law .
Out on the construction site , brawls broke out several times between groups of white and black workers ; on one occasion , [ executive officer Lt. Robert ]
Furman arrived at the scene to find a large group of black and white workers facing off , hurling angry words at each other .
“ They were drawing lines , and I walked between the lines , ” Furman said .
“ Whether it did any good or not I do n’t know . ”
The standoff broke up but the tensions remained .
As constructing engineer Captain Clarence Renshaw learned to his dismay , the Virginia segregation laws did n’t apply merely to cafeteria facilities for construction workers ; he was expected to make allowances for segregated facilities in the construction of the Pentagon itself :
Discrimination created an absurd new concern for Renshaw : He was supposed to build a segregated Pentagon .
The word came in a telephone call March 7 [ 1942 ] from one of [ chief of operations Colonel Leslie R. ]
Groves ’s aides , Major Donald Antes .
“ Colonel Groves just asked me to call you and find out whether you have made any provisions for separate design for the different classes of people in the War Department Building , ” said Antes , who then clarified his euphemism : “ By that I mean separate toilet rooms for black and white as required by the Virginia law , and if you have n’t taken such precautions that you are to do so immediately . ”
This was news to Renshaw .
“ Separate design of toilet rooms ? ” he asked .
Yes , replied Antes , who added this coda from Groves : “ He said do n’t slip on it . ” Renshaw promised to take care of it .
The matter was not as simple as Groves believed , however .
While Virginia law required whites and blacks to be segregated in public places , Franklin Roosevelt had signed executive order 8802 the previous June , which forbade discrimination against government workers on the basis of race , creed , color , or national origin .
Moreover , on March 11 Virginia governor Colgate W. Darden granted a request from [ Secretary of War Henry ]
Stimson to give the War Department exclusive jurisdiction over the land on which the Pentagon was being built .
Still , whether out of ignorance or deliberate discrimination , the Army made preparations for separate bathrooms .
However , according to Vogel , even though the extra bathroom facilities were eventually built , they were never identified as being for purposes of adhering to racial segregation laws :

A timetable of Port Office closures in Oxfordshire has been drawn up with the first 16 shutting within days .
A total of 22 branches in the county will go under plans to shut 2,500 nationwide by the end of 2008 .
Six branches will cease trading on Thursday with the rest shutting their doors at points up until 11 June .
The Post Office said 291 branches would remain open across Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire and 18 " outreach " services would replace some branches .
Oxfordshire branches agreed closures Begbrook - 5 June Dalton Barracks - 5 June Fyfield - 5 June Grimsbury , Banbury - 5 June King 's End - 5 June Orchard Way , Banbury - 5 June Combe - 9 June Upton - 9 June Farmoor - 10 June Grandpont , Oxford - 10 June Stanton St John - 10 June Wolvercote , Godstow Road - 10 June Wytham - 10 June Ardington - 11 June Childrey - 11 June Iffley - 11 June
The closure dates for the other six post offices in Oxfordshire are yet to be decided .
Mark Partington , Post Office 's network development manager for Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire , said : " These are difficult decisions which have not been taken lightly .
" We believe the plan offers our customers across Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire the best prospect for a sustainable network in the future . "
The outreach service involves a mobile post office visiting an area at set times , or a service within community centres , local shops or a home phone service .
Berlusconi does it again .
Zapatero zaps the conservatives .
Will it be Boris or Ken for mayor of London ?
Europe , where democracy was invented 25 centuries ago , is now a hotbed of it .
Messy , often corrupt , distorted by media ownership , sometimes disconcerting in its outcomes - Berlusconi ! - but still definitely democracy , a system in which the people can change the government .
Not a month goes by without an election somewhere in Europe .
And you never know who 's going to win .
What the ancient Athenians called demokratia may be old , but for most Europeans the reality is new : half today 's European states have enjoyed consolidated liberal democracy for less than a generation .
And from Portugal to Croatia , the prospect and process of joining the EU have strengthened democracy in country after country .
This has been , and for a few candidate countries still is , Europe 's transformative power - more effective in securing regime change than any army .
Now a great idea is stalking the corridors of Europe .
It is that Europeans should resolve to promote a modern , liberal version of demokratia in countries beyond Europe 's borders - in our own interest , and in theirs .
This should become a central purpose of the European project for the next 50 years .
Not imposing a single model of democracy by military means and not " exporting " democracy , but supporting it , by peaceful means .
" Showing the way does not mean imposing the way , " as European commission president José Manuel Barroso said earlier this week , at the launch of a new , non-governmental European Foundation for Democracy through Partnership .
To make this happen , we have first to agree among ourselves that this is what we want to do .
That may sound obvious , but it 's not .
Many people , particularly on the European left , somehow feel the idea of " democracy promotion " is tainted by its association with George Bush and a neoconservative vision for the transformation of the Middle East .
Until recently , French , Spanish and German socialists spoke very little about promoting democracy .
This is changing , especially as the debate about development has increasingly focused on good governance , but we still need to make the explicit commitment , across all parties .
Then we need to say what we mean by democracy .
After all , everyone pays lip service to it : the Egyptians , the Chinese , Vladimir Putin , Robert Mugabe .
But they mean something different .
This does not and cannot imply a single rigid template .
Europe is immunised against what one might call the American temptation by the simple fact that Europe 's democracies are themselves so diverse : constitutional monarchies and republics , unicameral and bicameral , centralised and decentralised , with a strong executive and weaker legislature , or vice versa .
We can hardly propagate a single model when we have none ourselves .
All the more reason , however , to spell out the shared essentials without which there is no democracy worthy of the name .
That does not just mean regular , free and fair elections .
The emerging European definition of democracy will be multidimensional , including the rule of law , independent media , respect for both individual human rights and minority rights , sound public administration , civilian control over the military and a strong civil society .
( Yes , I know , not all EU member states themselves score well on all these points - a subject to which I 'll return . )
In the framework of the EU , these two things - saying what we want , and what we mean by it - can best be done through promulgating a European consensus on democracy , like the European Consensus on Development passed a few years ago .
In that pioneering document , the member states , the European parliament , the European commission and the Council of Ministers all agreed what we meant by development and how we should best work to promote it .
Now a proposal is before the European parliament suggesting we do the same for democracy .
Several governments support the idea , and the three upcoming half - year EU presidencies should be interested : the French , especially with veteran human rights activist Bernard Kouchner as foreign minister , the Swedes , and the Czechs , who have a vivid , recent memory of what a difference it made to be helped to democracy .
And the proposal will find stalwart friends in Javier Solana and Barroso , who actively participated in their countries ' transition to democracy .
The devil will , as always , be in the detail .
The text must avoid , at all costs , those characteristic EU afflictions : waffle and fudge .
Yet there 's some uncharacteristically clear and robust language around already , in existing European documents , including those from the development aid side , where Europe spends bigger bucks than anyone .
Then , however , it 's a matter of practising what we preach .
Who will do it and how ?
We know the answer for a country accepted as a candidate for membership .
We are only beginning to work out how we can effectively influence those that are not .
One thing is certain : there will be many players , and every one of them needs careful scrutiny .
A European commission operation called ( somewhat mysteriously ) the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights has € 1.1bn allocated for the seven years from 2007 to 2013 .
But are its slow , rule - bound , super - cautious bureaucratic procedures the best way to get the money to those who really make a difference on the ground in a country like Egypt or Pakistan ?
Past experience is not encouraging .
The foundations of the German political parties are big players , with total budgets larger than the US 's National Republican and National Democratic Institutes .
The German party foundations did an inspirational job in countries like Spain and Chile 30 years ago , but have they become too bloated and complacent ?
Each of the 27 member states does things differently .
In Britain , for example , there 's the Westminster Foundation for Democracy , but also stuff done directly by the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development .
And then there 's the new European Foundation for Democracy through Partnership , which aims to be a " knowledge hub " and ginger group , as well as giving small grants of its own .
Far from the monolithic Brussels superstate of Eurosceptic nightmare , what we have here is more like herding cats .
The best we can hope for is a shared approach , not a single policy .
But if we can achieve a shared approach , then our diversity will be a strength .
Imagine that in a country such as Egypt or Morocco the myriad European players in democracy promotion would agree a set of priorities for that particular place and time , perhaps the judiciary and NGOs there .
Then 100 - plus European players go quietly to work in their different ways .
Local anti-democratic rulers would hate it , of course , but in their agreements with the EU they have already signed up to the principles of respect for democracy , human rights and the rule of law .
And what could they do about it ?
If they cut off three heads , there would still be 97 left .
We need , in short , a benign European hydra for democracy : a modern version of an ancient Greek mythological monster to promote a modern version of ancient Greece 's finest invention .
Here 's an idea whose time has come .

Juan Carlos Zarate , described as a senior US counterterrorism official by the Telegraph is quoted as claiming " that the demise of al - Qa'eda is in sight because its failure to adapt its violent ideology and tactics has provoked growing dissent across the Islamic world . "
This claim is not as outrageous -- even to those who believe ideologies are invincible -- as it might at first seem .
While Islam has maintained its general militancy and aggressiveness over the centuries , the lifespan of individual fanatical movements is distinctly shorter .
It is possible that the world has not seen the last of radical Islam ; but it may be true that it has seen the last of Bin Laden 's crew .
History suggests that Islamic militancy comes in waves .
Mohammed bin Abdullah Hassan , better known as the Mad Mullah of Somaliland , had a heyday between the years 1900 and 1920 .
The Mahdi , Mohammed Ahmad of Khartoum fame , lasted from the early 1880s to the turn of the century , if the career of his successor the Khalifa is added to it .
The British were chronically in pursuit of one mad mullah or another throughout their vast colonial possessions .
The young Winston Churchill facing the forces of yet another " mad mullah " in the Swat Valley some years after he had accompanied Kitchener to Omdurman , remarked :
" How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries !
Besides the fanatical frenzy , which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog , there is this fearful fatalistic apathy .
The effects are apparent in many countries .
Improvident habits , slovenly systems of agriculture , sluggish methods of commerce , and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live .
A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement ; the next of its dignity and sanctity .
The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property - either as a child , a wife , or a concubine - must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men .
Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities .
Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the Queen ; all know how to die ; but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it .
No stronger retrograde force exists in the world .
Far from being moribund , Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith .
It has already spread throughout Central Africa , raising fearless warriors at every step ; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science - the science against which it had vainly struggled - the civilisation of modern Europe might fall , as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome " .
The wave passes .
But the ocean remains .
Yet if Zarate were correct in claiming that the US has , for the moment , beaten back al - Qaeda to what would it be due ?
To two things .
The first is to inevitable excesses of the Mad Mullahs themselves .
A movement like the Jihad eventually sustains itself by exactions and impositions on the population .
A movement which aims at paradise can have little regard for daily concerns .
Al - Qaeda gets real old , real quickly when you actually have to live under it .
The reason it retains the sympathy of the Western intelligensia is because they do n't have to live under it .
The second reason for al - Qaeda 's decline has been their defeat on every battlefield on which they have been found .
And as important as the material losses to them have been , far more serious has been the loss to their prestige .
They have gone from godlike warriors who can topple skyscrapers in Manhattan to helpless bugs who are effortlessly incinerated despite their incantation .
And that battlefield helplessness , to their adherents , is subliminal proof of the power of a greater magic : " the strong arms of science " .
It is the triumph in this battle of conjury , this wizard war , which in some sense has been the true metric of victory .
The widespread disgust with brutality of al - Qaeda coupled with a grudging admiration for the power of the US is the psychological reason why al - Qaeda , if it has declined as Zarate claims , has done so .
Deborah Haynes , a journalist with the Times Online , describes the latest fashion trends among young men in Baghdad .
They want to look like American soldiers .
Elbow or knee pads strapped deliberately to ankles and goggles worn back to front over helmets , some Iraqi soldiers have a unique sense of style .
Efforts to mimic their American mentors or simply spruce up and re-enforce their regular army gear result in a variety of different outfits whenever the troops are on patrol .
Sejad Mehdi , 21 , said that he habitually fixes a pair of goggles to the back of his American helmet – bought at a Baghdad market for 50,000 Iraqi dinar ( 21 pounds ) – because he saw US troops wearing them that way rather than because he uses the mask in his job .
If it is true that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery , some enterprising sociology student may one day describe a correlation between fashion and consciousness .
In the years after the Second World War the hot fashion item in war - ravaged Manila were Ray Ban aviator sunglasses .
Not because people had any Hellcats to fly , but because everyone wanted to look like a " winner " .
In short , winning against al - Qaeda has been largely achieved by winning .
There are those who think negotiations are a substitute for winning , rather than their complement .
When J. Peter Scoblic , writing in the LA Times argues that " negotiating is n't appeasement " , urges US officials to go cap in hand to Teheran and has even written a book to prove it entitled How a Half Century of Conservatism Has Undermined America 's Security , he neglects this essential correlation .
He claims the fact that Reagan negotiated with Gorbachev is implicit proof that real men negotiate with the enemy while wusses like Bush do n't .
But that is to see negotiations in isolation from the battlefield .
He neglects to mention that timing is everything .
Negotiations are useful when they are used to complement success or effect a mutually improved solution to a crisis .
Negotiations are not useful merely as instruments of surrender or vanity platforms for the self - flagellant .
Timing is everything .
Wainrights negotiations with Japan after the Fall of Bataan are not the same as the one Wainright attended on the deck of the USS Missouri .
And that difference is sometimes more acutely perceived by the man on the street than by academics .
Everyone loves a winner .
Nobody remembers a loser .
And that fact is remembered in popular culture .
There are in Mindanao Muslims named " Pershing " and " Temojin " but there is n't to my knowledge anyone called Scoblic , or Berrigan or Joan Baez .
In the days after September 11 there were probably a spate of " Osamas " .
My guess is that there are fewer now .
It is significant that some members of the Western elite want to wear a keffiyeh at precisely the time when young Muslim men in Baghdad are saving to buy Wiley - X's .
While I do n't know precisely what it signifies , it 's fair to claim that a world where Islamic militants wanted to dress like Nancy Pelosi would be profoundly different from on in which Nancy Pelosi wants to dress like an Islamic militant .
Call it the Ray Ban theory of history .
It means something and I leave it to wiser heads to puzzle out what .
The wave passes but the ocean remains .
And while al - Qaeda may be beaten down for now in the long run the outcome of historical encounters is determined by health of cultures .
And how does our culture fare ?
If Churchill were alive today he might say :
How dreadful are the curses which Political Correctness lays on its votaries !
Besides the fanatical frenzy , which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog , there is this fearful fatalistic apathy .
The effects are apparent in many countries .
Improvident habits , slovenly systems of thought , sluggish methods of commerce , and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the PC rule or live .
A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement ; the next of its dignity and sanctity .
The fact that in post - modern politics every minority must belong to some liberal as his absolute property - either as ward , token , or a concubine - must delay the final extinction of slavery until PC has ceased to be a great power among men .
Individual leftists may show splendid qualities .
Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the Queen ; all know how to die ; but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it .
No stronger retrograde force exists in the world .
Far from being moribund , PC is a militant and proselytizing faith .
It has already spread throughout Europe , raising mindless warriors at every step ; and were it not the strong arms of science are sheltered in the strong arms of freedom - the freedom against which it had vainly struggled - the West might fall , as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome .
Lance Mungia got it right in his movie The Six String Samurai .
All that ultimately matters is whether the spirit survives .
In what , even in a post apocalyptic world , people choose to wear or to sing .
Even at the end of things , what matters is whether and who takes the throne of Elvis .

The Cold Equations Of Spaceflight
The DC - X was rebuilt as the DC - XA with composite propellant tanks , but its fuel fraction only went up to a pitiful 54 % .
by Jeffrey F. Bell
Honolulu HI ( SPX ) Sep 09 , 2005
In the past month , we have been blessed with numerous leaks from NASA of various study documents relating to the new boosters that will be needed to carry out the new manned moon program .
I 've been monitoring the large volume of Web chatter about these plans , and have noticed a disturbing theme therein .
Many Space Cadets are expressing dissatisfaction with these leaked NASA plans .
They say that the Shuttle - derived boosters are too primitive , too expensive to develop , too expensive to operate , and not inspiring enough .
They can't understand why we will be returning to the Moon with rockets and space capsules that look like minor variations of those used in the Apollo program 40 years ago .
" Where is the sexy new stuff ? " they ask .
" For that matter , where is the sexy old stuff ?
Why is n't Mike Griffin pulling out the blueprints for X -30 / NASP , DC-X / Delta Clipper , or X - 33 / VentureStar ?
Billions of dollars were spent on these programs before they were cancelled .
Why are n't we using all that research to design a cheap , reusable , Single - Stage - To - Orbit vehicle that operates just like an airplane and does n't fall in the ocean after one flight ? "
The answer to this question is :
All of these vehicles were fantasy projects .
They violated basic laws of physics and engineering .
They were impossible with current technology , or any technology we can afford to develop on the timescale and budgets available to NASA .
They were doomed attempts to avoid the Cold Equations of Spaceflight .
The rocket equation tells you that an SSTO booster using LH2 fuel and LO2 oxidizer needs a fuel mass fraction of around 0.92 .
That means that 92 % of the take - off weight needs to be ascent propellant , and only 8 % is left for everything else .
This is a very demanding requirement .
The second and third stages of the Saturn V actually achieved a dry mass fraction of about 10 % .
But these are not complete spacecraft , only expendable stages without payload or recovery gear .
But the Space Cadets want a booster than can quickly return to its launch site and take off again in a few days with another payload .
This requires the addition of large amounts of weight which renders the vehicle incapable of orbital flight .
The biggest advance in rocket design was the replacement of the V - 2's separate fuel tanks , load - bearing structure , and aeroshell with a single thin skin that serves all three functions .
Every design since Redstone and Scud has used this principle ( except Korolyov 's dreadful N - 1 ) .
This is the key to the low dry weight and high performance of modern booster stages .
But the reusable SSTO booster needs to reenter the earth 's atmosphere at 17,500 mph .
Every square inch of its huge propellant tanks needs to be protected against reentry heat .
This is far more difficult than protecting a small warhead or entry capsule .
Most SSTO designers have adopted the old double - wall system of a separate fuel tank and heat shield separated by a space which often contains an elaborate structure .
The following particularly bad example is from Reaction Engines ' Skylon design :
This return to 1930s design concepts makes these recoverable vehicles unacceptably heavy , as we can see by looking at the DC -X .
Of all SSTOs , this one was the closest to a traditional rocket .
Its fuel tanks were mostly cylindrical , and instead of a heat shield it had a flimsy plastic aeroshell that broke twice and caught on fire once in only a dozen test flights .
Yet the DC - X had a fuel weight fraction of only 52 % !
This is less that that of the V - 2 and absurdly short of the 91 - 92 % projected for the operational Delta Clipper .
The DC - X was not a meaningful prototype of a working spaceship , but merely the world 's most inefficient VTOL aircraft , scarcely more advanced than the " Flying Bedstead " prototypes of the 1950s .
Space Cadets frequently claim that new materials like Al - Li or carbon - fiber composites as solving the weight problem , but they do n't represent enough of an increase in strength / weight to make up for the massive increase in structural weight that wrapping an entire rocket stage in a heat shield implies .
The DC- X was rebuilt as the DC - XA with composite propellant tanks , but its fuel fraction only went up to a pitiful 54 % .
And after our overweight booster reenters , it has to land itself .
We Space Cadets were so impressed by the smooth automated vertical landings of the DC - X that we never asked where all that fuel would come from in the operational Delta Clipper .
It 's not part of the % 92 of GLOW that is fuel burned during ascent to orbit .
It ca n't even be residual fuel carried by making the take - off tanks slightly oversized , since these big tanks would be impossible to keep cold during orbital flight and reentry .
The fuel for the retro-burn and the landing maneuver must be carried in a second , smaller set of cryogenic tanks that are carefully insulated and isolated from the vehicle 's skin .
Fuel , tanks , pipes , and landing legs all must be charged against that 8 % dry weight .
The weight demands of the X - 33 / VentureStar runway - landing configuration were more subtle .
The vehicle had a lifting - body shape which is less efficient than a cylinder , so more heat shield mass was needed .
To fit inside that shape , propellant tanks had to be made in complex multilobed forms that required internal bracing to resist pressure .
And then there was the dead weight of landing wheels , brakes , struts , doors , actuators , and structure to support them .
As development proceeded , the X - 33 sprouted four large fixed tail fins and no less than ten movable control surfaces with associated hydraulic actuators and APUs .
Lifting - bodies are particularly susceptible to control and stability problems and it seems likely that this elaborate tail structure was added to solve some unexpected problems that surfaced during wind - tunnel tests .
With all this burden of landing hardware eating away at that 8 % dry weight fraction , it was no surprise that Lockheed kept cutting back the payload of the VentureStar - until one day Dan Goldin caught them and had that parameter contractually defined .
After that , the weight and size of both VentureStar and its X - 33 prototype grew uncontrollably with every design iteration until the program was cancelled .
The very last VentureStar concept took the drastic step of eliminating the internal payload bay and carrying ISS supply modules externally .
Clearly X -33 / VS suffered from fundamental problems that were not connected with the composite tank failure that was the official reason for cancelling the program .
In failed aerospace projects , a particular technical hitch is often made the scapegoat for systemic management and engineering problems that are too embarrassing for the funding agency to admit .
The X - 30 National Aero -Space Plane had even more strikes against it , because it relied on air - breathing scramjet engines to boost itself to orbital velocity while still inside the sensible atmosphere .
This led to skin temperatures that would quickly melt any known material .
Active cooling studies showed that the LH2 fuel could only absorb about 25 % of this heat .
Furthermore , NASP needed at least two more engine sets ( turbojet and ramjet ) to boost itself up from the runway to scramjet ignition speed .
These heavy engines then had to be sealed off from the hot hypersonic airflow and dragged uselessly all the way to orbit .
It 's no surprise that even senior NASA engineers working on NASP recognised that the project was hopeless right from the start .
The projected gross weight of X - 30 ballooned up from 50,000lb to ~ 450,000lb - a two - seat orbital B - 52 !
The Angry Reader is now saying , " If all this is so obvious , why did these hopeless designs get approved ?
Why did the US government spend billions of dollars on impossible projects ?
That makes no sense ! "
Yes , it makes no sense - but it frequently happens that governments spend huge sums of money on aerospace projects that make no technical sense , for political reasons , or simple ignorance , or because the decision - makers have been bought .
X - 33 was born during Dan Goldin 's reign of error at NASA , when all sorts of absurd projects were promoted for reasons that still defy any rational analysis .
In the cases of X - 30 and DC - X , there WAS a reason to spend money on impossible vehicles .
Both these doomed projects were sponsored by the old Strategic Defense Initiative Office , which was running an elaborate scam on the Soviet Politburo .
In order to make credible their central fantasy project of orbital battle stations shooting down Red ICBMs , they had to run a parallel fantasy booster development program .
The Space Shuttle was clearly not up to the task of launching serious " Star Wars " hardware .
These phony programs of the 1980s achieved their goal .
Soviet intelligence looked at the press releases about X - 30 , and looked at the satellite photos of the 25,000 ' runway and huge hangar at Groom Lake / Area 51 , and the disinformation about ' Aurora ' in Aviation Leak , and evaluated them all as signs that the USA would soon have cheap frequent access to space .
And those old fossils on the Politburo remembered many previous occasions when the West had done things they could n't - most notably Apollo .
They ignored their own science advisers and spent millions of rubles on similar hopeless projects like Polyus and Tu-2000 which helped drive their empire into collapse .
And it was n't just dumb Communists who were fooled .
In his fascinating memoirs , NASA - Dryden aerodynamicist Ken Iliff describes a meeting of the AIAA soon after the Challenger crash .
In the morning session , the NASA Administrator described how they would build a replacement Shuttle Orbiter from the existing blueprints - for about $ 3B .
After lunch , the head of the NASP project showed graphs indicating that the X - 30 would be designed , built , and flown for only about $ 5B .
Afterwards at the coffee break , Iliff expected many of the experienced engineers in the audience to point out the obvious contradiction between these two presentations .
But nobody else seemed to have noticed .
Everyone was wildly enthusiastic about X - 30 and seemed to have no doubt that all its super - advanced technologies could be perfected within this bargain - basement budget .
This little episode shows that even hard - nosed rocket scientists have an emotional weak spot .
They are in love with the idea of space travel , and do n't apply the same critical standards to space projects that they would to buying a used car .
( If any of my old Space Cadet friends are reading this , they may recall a time when I was a DC - X fan myself . )
But 20 years later there is no longer any excuse for us to fool ourselves .
The Cold Equations dictate that rockets need to look like oil storage tanks , not the sleek spaceships of science fiction .
This will always be true until we have developed some totally new technology like " unobtainium " .
And the Cold Equations also dictate that rockets need to operate like rockets , not like airplanes .
New technologies have always required new ways of thinking .
Firms that tried to build , sell , and maintain diesel locomotives in the same ways they had handled the old steamers all went broke , like all the alt .
space booster companies that have followed the space airplane model .
Mike Griffin understands the Cold Equations .
He has seven college degrees .
He has taught aerospace engineering .
He has a fixed budget and schedule to work with , and knows that there is n't enough money or time available to develop some magic technology that would make the simple one - piece spaceships of science fiction work .
Griffin's plan may well be too expensive and too boring to succeed , but returning to the fantasy projects of the 1980s and 1990s is not the way to fix it .
We Space Cadets need to get this virus out of our system before it does any more damage to our future in space .

This PEP proposes an ordered dictionary as a new data structure for the collections module , called " OrderedDict " in this PEP .
The proposed API incorporates the experiences gained from working with similar implementations that exist in various real - world applications and other programming languages .
In current Python versions , the widely used built - in dict type does not specify an order for the key / value pairs stored .
This makes it hard to use dictionaries as data storage for some specific use cases .
Some dynamic programming languages like PHP and Ruby 1.9 guarantee a certain order on iteration .
In those languages , and existing Python ordered - dict implementations , the ordering of items is defined by the time of insertion of the key .
New keys are appended at the end , but keys that are overwritten are not moved to the end .
The following example shows the behavior for simple assignments :
>>> d = OrderedDict ( ) >>> d[' parrot ' ] = ' dead ' >>> d[' penguin ' ] = ' exploded ' >>> d.items ( ) [ ( ' parrot ' , ' dead ' ) , ( ' penguin ' , ' exploded ' ) ]
That the ordering is preserved makes an Ordered Dict useful for a couple of situations :
On Saturday , 17 year old Javon Dawson was shot by Officer Terrence Nemeth of the St. Petersburg , Florida police department .
The St. Petersburg Times reports the police side of the story in general terms .
According to the St. Petersburg police , they were called out to the scene on Saturday evening after a party outgrew its venue and spilled into the street , and neighbors complained about the noise .
As Officer Nemeth related his account of events , Dawson was in the middle of the street , firing a handgun .
Nemeth verbally challenged the teenager and told him to put down the gun .
Dawson refused , and pointed his gun at the officer , who then shot Dawson .
Dawson ran , but collapsed and died shortly after .
Police say they have collected evidence that Dawson had fired a gun that night .
Other witnesses , however , dispute the official police version of the tale .
Bay News 9 reports another version of the events :
But witnesses said police had the wrong guy .
Dawson ’s friends said they witnessed the situation .
They claim police are n’t telling the whole story .
“ I saw the police officer shot him right in the back on purpose , ” said Deon Hison , a friend of Dawson .
Hison said Dawson did n’t even have a gun .
The Uhuru Movement ( associated with the African People ’s Socialist Party ) staged a protest at the St. Petersburg Police Department , along with members of Dawson ’s family .
Internal affairs and the state attorney ’s office are investigating the matter , as part of standard procedure .
If nothing else , they should definitely be able to determine whether Dawson was shot in the back .
I wonder if the resolution of this investigation will make the news .
In an interview at the protest , as reported in the “ This Just In ” weblog post about the protest at tampabay.com , Uhuru Movement founder Omali Yeshiteli said that other teens who tried to help Dawson after he collapsed were pepper - sprayed by police .
I ’m not sure how much credence to lend to the words of a socialist agitator who claims to have gotten his information from witnesses he refuses to name .
On one hand , that sounds pretty damning , if it ’s true .
On the other , it may lend credence to the idea that police thought Dawson had a gun ( whether he did or not ) .
Police say they recovered a revolver at the scene , presumably the firearm used by Dawson .
Please let me know if you find further informative reports about this incident .
The American Dream : Dr. Quiñones ' Incredible Journey Dr. Quiñones on his incredible journey from Mexicali , Mexico , to Johns Hopkins .
June 26 , 2008  -- Today , Dr. Alfredo Quiñones - Hinojosa may be living the American dream .
As one of the nation 's leading brain surgeons , he has built an exceptional career at Baltimore 's legendary Johns Hopkins Hospital , surgically treating patients with brain tumors and leading cutting - edge research into cures for brain cancer .
And he is one of the doctors featured on the new ABC series " Hopkins . "
But his journey to the top of the medical profession did n't start out as many might expect .
More than 20 years ago , Quiñones - Hinojosa , known to his colleagues now as Dr. Q , was a teenager with few prospects living in Mexicali , Mexico .
Watch the series premiere of " Hopkins " Thursday , June 26 , at 10 p.m. ET .
CLICK HERE for behind the scenes videos , doctor profiles and patient updates .
Although he always had a strong work ethic , Quiñones - Hinojosa -- who manned the pumps at his father 's gas station -- seemed destined for a life of menial labor at low - paying jobs in his hometown .
For Quiñones - Hinojosa , growing up was difficult .
" At the age of five I started working in a gas station , " he said .
" It 's hard to believe .
...
We did n't have enough money to eat , and everybody had to pitch in . "
From Rags to Riches
But Quiñones - Hinojosa knew early on that somehow he was meant for bigger things than the dusty backstreets of Mexicali .
" By the time I was 19 , I decided I wanted to go to the U.S. and explore , " Quiñones - Hinojosa said .
" I was tired of the political oppression and the bifurcation of classes , the oppression of the poor that happens in my country . "
Desperate for money , and with his sights set on a brighter future , he scaled a barbed border fence across from Calexico , Calif .
" It was a pretty scary experience , " Quiñones - Hinojosa remembered .
" It was filled with a real adrenaline rush excitement , but also fear , and , you know , fear gives you extra strength and courage .
I got caught and sent back , but I did it again the same night . "
He worked illegally for more than a year doing backbreaking work in California 's fields , mostly picking tomatoes .
Like other migrant workers , he sent his hard - earned cash back to his family in Mexico .
Derided by his fellow workers as a dreamer , Quiñones - Hinojosa enrolled himself in community college to learn English .
Before long , he found a professor to mentor him .
This professor encouraged Quiñones - Hinojosa to seek a scholarship to attend the University of California , Berkeley .
At Berkley , Quiñones - Hinojosa excelled in the natural sciences .
He tutored other students , and his grades were such that Harvard Medical School was eager to recruit the young Mexican with so much drive .
While at Harvard , Quiñones - Hinojosa earned his U.S. citizenship before being selected to do his residency at Johns Hopkins .
Dr. Q Says Border Fences Not the Solution
Quiñones - Hinojosa 's personal story of climbing over the border fence to gain access into the United States is just a microcosm of the immigration debate still raging in Washington .
Both presumptive presidential nominees Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , and Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , favor border fences , just like the one Quiñones - Hinojosa climbed .
McCain , who sponsored a 2005 immigration bill that proposed to legalize the more than 12 million undocumented immigrants in the country , now takes a much harder line on immigration .
He vowed that he would not vote for the bill he co-sponsored three years ago , and emphasizes that his number one priority is to secure U.S. borders .
At the Democratic debate in Austin , Texas , on Feb. 21 , 2008 , Obama explained why he supported the construction of a border fence .
" There may be areas where it makes sense to have some fencing , " he said .
" Having the border patrolled , surveillance , deploying effective technology -- that 's going to be the better approach . "
The Bush administration continues to move forward on the border fence construction that Congress authorized in 2005 , despite environmental concerns .
Earlier this week , the Supreme Court denied an environmental group 's plea to slow down construction of a U.S. - Mexican border fence .
After living on U.S. soil for more than half of his life , Quiñones - Hinojosa believes that a border fence is not the solution to illegal immigration .
" I think it 's just a patch , and I think that 's not going to be a solution , " Quiñones - Hinojosa said of border fences .
" As long as there is poverty , as long as there 's inequality , people are going to look for better ways to survive .
It 's human nature . "
June 25 , 2008  --
There were no weapons on board or concerns about terrorism , but an American Eagle flight about to take off from the Raleigh - Durham , N.C. , airport was turned back to its gate on Monday to remove two passengers .
The culprits ?
An upset , autistic toddler and his mother .
By all accounts , two - year - old Jarret Farrell was n't a happy traveler .
But his mother , Janice Farrell , who said she tried everything to calm her son , believes there was no reason for the airline to kick them off the plane .
The airline disagrees , saying they were removed primarily because Janice Farrell kept her carry - on bag on the floor in front of her seat , but that Jarret 's behavior added to the tense situation .
" The child had been crying and screaming uncontrollably , to the point where the child 's well being was in question , " American Airlines , the parent company of American Eagle , said in a statement .
" Though , ultimately , the parent 's violation of FAA regulations was the cause for removal , both situations contributed to an uncomfortable and potentially unsafe atmosphere for our passengers and crew . "
But Farrell told " GMA " she allowed the flight attendant to place her bag in an overhead compartment .
And , even though Farrell said she explained Jarret 's autism to the flight crew , they only made the situation worse by reprimanding and yelling at the toddler .
" [ The flight attendant ] kept coming over and tugging his seatbelt to make it tighter , ' This has to stay tight . '
And then he was wiggling around and trying to get out of his seatbelt .
And she kept coming over and reprimanding him and yelling at him " Farrell told ABC News ' Raleigh - Durham affiliate WTVD .
Farrell said that a pilot came into to the cabin and told Jarret , " You have to get in your seat , young man . "
Farrell said she started crying then , which just exacerbated Jarret 's behavior .
" He just melted down .
He saw me getting upset .
He was upset .
He was on the floor rolling around , " Farrell told WTVD .
Jarret was perfectly fine on that flight , Farrell said , with crew members letting her son walk around the plane and watch his DVD player .
Farrell said that had the flight crew been more patient and understanding , the situation might not have escalated .
She suggested that airline flight attendants and other crew members should be trained to deal with special needs children .
This story was originally reported by Ed Crump at ABC News affiliate WTVD .
I WAS reading a recipe for apple strudel when I came to a sentence that stopped me cold : “ If you do n’t have a helper , ” it began .
If a dish needs a helper , I need to move on .
Although I did n’t end up with a strudel , I did end up on a quest .
I began asking good cooks I know about recipe deal breakers  those ingredients or instructions that make them throw down the whisk and walk away .
Whether for reasons practical or psychological , even the most experienced cooks have an ingredient , technique or phrase that will make them bypass a recipe .
Some deal breakers are simply a function of place .
People in small New York apartments do n’t execute recipes that require well - ventilated spaces .
They rarely char peppers or broil salmon , lest the apartment stink for days .
They rarely deep - fry .
Pennebaker : Clip Doctored
I just spoke to D.A. Pennebaker , the director of " The War Room , " who said his film had been doctored to produce a widely - viewed YouTube clip .
In a clip from his film on the 1992 Clinton campaign , posted to YouTube today , Clinton advisor Mickey Kantor is -- according to subtitles -- seen referring to Indiana residents with an expletive and to his colleague George Stephanopolous with a racial slur .
" He does not say that .
He does not say that , " said Pennebaker , after viewing the clip .
He said the initial expletive referred to the anticipated reaction in the Bush White House to the fact that Ross Perot 's polling numbers were holding strong .
" What he says is he ’s surprised Perot ’s numbers are holding , " said Pennebaker in a brief phone interview .
" He says they must be shi**ing in the White House . "
The second expletive , he said , appeared to have been entirely fabricated , with new audio dubbed onto the original movie .
Pennebaker appeared surprised and amused by the video .
" A thousand people saw that film in theaters and did n't think " the second expletive had been used , he said .
" It 's very clearly understandable .
It 's not like it was in Bulgarian . "
In an earlier version posted yesterday , the clip was circulating with a subtitle indicating -- Pennebaker says inaccurately -- that Kantor had insulted Hoosiers ; the racial slur appears to have been added to the second version .
The audio in both versions is n't clearly audible ; it 's possible that the subtitles are incorrect , but that the audio has n't been deliberately altered .
UPDATE : I spoke to the editor of the video who said that he enhanced , but did n't alter , the audio in the second portion of the video .
TROY , Mich . – If Hillary Rodham Clinton wants to restore her tattered reputation and repair the party she has shattered , there is only one place for her to be tonight : St. Paul , Minn .
That is where Barack Obama will kick off his general - election campaign tonight .
He chose the convention center in St. Paul because it is the very hall where Republicans will officially nominate John McCain later this summer .

A surprise appearance and endorsement by Clinton – who is scheduled to hold her own event in Manhattan – would allow Democrats to mark that territory in history as the heart of a new and perfect unity for the party .
The election - night festivities would begin as usual with Obama mounting the stage before 20,000 wildly cheering voters .
He would start his victory speech and then pause .
After a dramatic silence , he would say he wants to introduce a very , very special guest .
Already buzzing with giddiness , the puzzled crowd whispers and speculates .
The curtains spread , and to the tune of “ I Will Survive , ” a face unimaginable yet so familiar appears .
Hillary Rodham Clinton , her granite smile , steady wave – even her cheery yellow pantsuit – would in an instant become so brave and honest and selfless .
She would endorse Obama in biblical terms and embrace him – literally – with both arms .
Obama would bury her in the genuine gracious praise that comes so naturally from him .
And just when the drama could not possibly heighten , the curtains would part again and out would walk her husband and her daughter , along with Michelle Obama and their two girls .
In that instant , everyone would forget all there has been in this campaign to dislike about Bill and remember why they once loved him .
A warm family embrace would underscore just how much Hillary gave up to be there , in the name of something much bigger than herself .
It ’s been a long and nasty fight , and Hillary has just one card left .
But it ’s an ace .
Will she play it ?

Fellow ath5k hackers , Good news .
I write to you to inform you that I have decided to join Atheros as a full time employee , as a Software Engineer , to help them with their goals and mission to get every device of Atheros supported upstream in the Linux kernel .
I realize there are a lot of challenges ahead but I am well aware of the how the community works and the benefits of working with it and am confident we will find ways to strengthen the relationship between Atheros and the community .
I also realize there are a lot of pending questions and perhaps even more now .
Please rest assured we are doing what we can to work together as soon as possible .
I will keep maintaining compat - wireless and prism54 but I did n't get to finish the Marvell TopDog driver port from net80211 to mac80211 .
Hope someone is willing to take that over as I will be pretty busy with other work now .
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mcgrof/mrvl_cb82.git
I do plan on keeping on pushing the Central Regulatory Domain Agent work I had started .
The db schema and a port of ar5 k regulatory information to it can now be found here :
http://winlab.rutgers.edu/~mcgrof/crda/
In the coming weeks I hope to finish the integration now that a db is available and hope to also update the db with more up to date values .

He has never deviated from his much - quoted formulation in “ The Audacity of Hope , ” where he described himself as aloof from “ the psychodrama of the baby boom generation ” with its “ old grudges and revenge plots hatched on a handful of college campuses long ago . ”
His vocabulary is so different from that of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain that they often find it as baffling as a foreign language , even as they try to rip it off .
The selling point of Mr. Obama ’s vision of change is not doctrinaire liberalism or Bush - bashing but an inclusiveness that he believes can start to relieve Washington ’s gridlock much as it animated his campaign .
Some of that inclusiveness is racial , ethnic and generational , in the casual , what ’s - the - big - deal manner of post - boomer Americans already swimming in our country ’s rapidly expanding demographic pool .
Some of it is post - partisan : he acknowledges that Republicans , Ronald Reagan included , can have ideas .
Opponents who dismiss this as wussy naïveté do so at their own risk .
They at once call attention to the expiring shelf life of their own Clinton - Bush - vintage panaceas and lull themselves into underestimating Mr. Obama ’s political killer instincts .
The Obama forces out - organized the most ruthless machine in Democratic politics because the medium of their campaign mirrored its inclusive message .
They empowered adherents in every state rather than depending on a Beltway campaign hierarchy whose mercenary chief strategist kept his day job as chief executive for a corporate P.R. giant .
Such viral organization and fund - raising is a seamless fit with bottom - up democracy as it is increasingly practiced in the Facebook - YouTube era , not merely by Americans and not merely by the young .
You could learn a ton about the Clinton campaign ’s cultural tone - deafness from its stodgy generic Web site .
A similar torpor afflicts JohnMcCain.com , which last week gave its graphics a face - lift that unabashedly mimics BarackObama.com and devoted prime home page real estate to hawking “ McCain Golf Gear . ”
( No joke . )
The blogs , video and social networking are static and sparse , the apt reflection of a candidate who repeatedly invokes “ I ” as he boasts of his humility .
Mr. Obama ’s deep - rooted worldliness  in philosophy as well as itinerant background  is his other crucial departure from the McCain template .
As more and more Americans feel the pain of spiraling gas prices and lost jobs , they are also coming to recognize , as Mr. Obama does , that the globally reviled American image forged by an endless war in Iraq and its accompanying torture scandals is inflicting economic as well as foreign - policy havoc .

European Roulette
Wheel – A guide on how to play
European Roulettes –
The bets and rules
European Roulette Tips
Are you familiar with live casinos and land - based casinos ?
Then you will have likely come across this fantastic gambling game and of course , with a good reason .
The European roulette is the most popular roulette game outside the United States of America and one of the top choice roulette games in Europe .
Interestingly , there ’s one apparent reason why European Roulette players : this roulette has a house edge of a humble 2.7 % , which is roughly half of the house advantage in the American Roulette – it works with 5.26 % .
If you wish to play a game of roulette , then European Roulette is the safest and most profitable bet .
In this piece , you will come across tips as well as strategies , and so much more .
Playing roulette is relatively straightforward , and despite the accoutrement that comes with the game like table , chips , and wheel , there ’s nothing much to it .
Roulette players can choose in which numbered slot they believe the spinning ball will land .
They may also pick a number or a series of numbers just by placing their bets on a particular position on the table .
The European roulette wheel is the standard layout of roulette that one will encounter anywhere ( at least , almost anywhere ) .
Meanwhile , the American roulette , on the other hand , features 38 slots on the wheel , instead of 37 which can be found on the European version of roulette .
Even though the slot game lacks the extra zero , it halves it .
The American roulette fairly has an advantage of 5.26 % while the European roulette is 2.7 % .
Betting in a European roulette tend to range from betting on a specific number on the roulette table to a comprehensive one and for instance , betting on the roulette ball while also landing on an even staked number .
Mind you ; these are the types of bets that are known as outside bets – it means outside the numbers ’ brawn up on tee roulette table .
Just know that the European Roulette comes with its unique strategy .
Just as you ’ve noticed , there ’s the little one that could affect the total outcome of the roulette .
The advice you can get in a normal may dangerous , more of than you would .
According to the attacker , you ’d be well advised to at least balance your bets , right been a low - risk outside bet .
Also , there is a good reason for the layout outside bets .
While playing roulette online ( mougle.com ) , you will come across some roulette betting system on the internet such as Martingale betting strategy ; there are at least eight betting strategies to pick from .
One of the difficulties playing games online is that you ’ll encounter lots of systems , a mathematician who will claim to have cracked the roulette games and he ’ll also promise of an impressive winning streak .
One inevitable fact that they did n’t dispute is the game ’s complexity , and you ’ll be doing yourself a lot of favour by not messing things up .

Patrick Mahomes 's mom displeased with ' MNF ' booth
As the Kansas City Chiefs opened a 27 - 10 halftime lead over the Baltimore Ravens , Randi Mahomes was n’t happy with everything she saw on the ESPN broadcast .
Success in politics is often about how a candidate defines it and what the public expectations are .
Set the bar low and clear it ; declare victory and call it momentum .
Governor Romney Romney tried it by calling his second place finishes in the earliest primaries and caucuses " silver medal victories " and invoking Bruce Jenner 's Olympic decathalon championship .
Mayor Giuliani tried it by avoiding the early primary states , where defeat was certain , and by betting all his chips on the Florida Republican primary .
Romney stumbled and Giuliani burned .
Now , Senator Hillary Clinton has readjusted her campaign 's self - declared objectives by announcing that she will recapture the momentum by building a firewall in the big states of Texas and Ohio , march on to victory in Pennsylvania and snatch the nomination at the Democratic National Convention this August in Denver .
The Clinton camp knows that victories in Texas , Ohio and Pennsylvania will be important for the Democrat 's super - delegates .
Big , blue collar , states like Pennsylvania and Ohio are fundamental to the success of the Democratic Party in national general elections .
Democrats do n't win national elections unless they sweep the older industrial states .
Those are the kinds of considerations that super - delegates , for the most part experienced campaign veterans and party bigwigs , were created for .
By redefining expectations , Sen.
Clinton is attempting to focus the attention of the super - delegates entirely on the November election calculus and urge them to overlook the passing primary results .
Sen .
Obama holds a small lead in both the popular vote and delegate count .
He 's got a 700,000 - vote margin in the almost - nationwide popular vote ( Democratic Chairman Howard Dean 's declaration that Florida does n't count still holds , at this point ) and Obama counts 1,302 delegates on his side compared to Clinton 's 1,235 pledged and committed delegates .
Clinton should n't be counted out ... yet .
Polls in Wisconsin and Hawaii suggest that Obama will win this week 's contests , extending his streak of primary and caucus victories .
Those victories will solidify Obama 's status as the clear front - runner ; a dangerous position to hold against team Clinton , especially during a two - week hiatus for primary contests and a pause in weekly victories that have demonstrated significant momentum for his candidacy .
Team Clinton can be expected to use the next couple of weeks to exploit the sense of buyers ' remorse that seems to be right below the surface of Obama - mania by portraying the front - runner as an , empty , albeit good looking , suit .
The Clinton operation will try desperately to reverse what has become a flood of unflattering media coverage fueled by comments by Clinton insiders fretting over the state of the campaign and by the mounting criticism of columnists like the New York Times ' Frank Rich and the Washington Post 's Richard Cohen who , if not fully over the moon about Obama , are preparing Hillary Clinton 's political obituary .
Bill and Hillary Clinton have lived near the edge and faced adversity for most of their joint political careers .
Their recipe is as predictable as it is proven -- bite the lower lip , wag a finger and shed a tear or two to demonstrate sincerity , vulnerability and contrition while at the same time completely demonizing the opposition .
Their combined success has relied on their ability to make people like Newt Gingrich and Kenneth Starr look like Neanderthals and to make women like Paula Jones , Gennifer Flowers and Monica Lewinski look like delusional women from a double - wide .
Will the Clinton campaign risk trying to paint Obama and his supporters as delusional ?
Will they even dare try to Neanderthalize him ?
It is hard to say , but the Clinton 's are very good at what they do .
The proof is in ther victims who are scattered along the shoulder of America 's political highway .

The “ Free ” Firestorm
Hank Williams , my recent blogging buddy , lit the internet on fire recently with a series of posts where he accuses venture capitalists of collapsing the market for software entrepreneurship by funding so many companies that give products away for free .
He says :
In today \’s â€œfreeâ€ world , in most online business categories , it is inherently impossible to start a small self - sustaining business and to grow it .
This is because in the digital world , advertising , the only real revenue stream , cannot support a small digital business .
If businesses were based on the idea that people paid for services then small companies could succeed at a small scale and grow .
But it is very hard to charge when your competition is free .
… Venture capital has totally distorted the market .
VCs are investing billions of dollars in companies with instructions to get big fast and to worry about advertising revenue later .
As a result the competition is for users and not paying customers .
Then at Startup School 2008 , DHH took Hank ’s fire and poured a 500,000 DWT oil tanker on it with his talk “ The Secret to Making Money Online “ .
And what was the secret ?
Charge people for your product !
Breathtaking , is n’t it ?
We ’re living a world where feathers get seriously ruffled when you insinuate that people should have to pay money for stuff .
This recent “ free ” debate needed to happen , and some good points were raised .
Anything that can be digitized can be copied and distributed for ( essentially ) free on the Internet , so anyone whose business is digital or digitizable needs to understand free .
It can either be an advantage ( if you ’re starting from nothing and building up ) or a disadvantage ( if you used to rely on high copying costs to protect your profits – I ’m looking at you , music and movie industries ) .
Breaking Free From Free
What does this mean for software entrepreneurs ?
Right now the market for people wanting to make money off the Internet ( supply of entrepreneurs ) is growing , the demand for free software is growing , but what about the demand for non -free software ?.
Reg Braithwaite aka Raganwald asked a great question :
Rather than answer those specific questions ( which I do n’t have any particular insight or experience into ) , let ’s look at some guidelines for anyone trying to grow a profitable , Ben and Jerry - style software company .
Hank gave his advice on the subject in “ Seven Dos and Three Dont ’s for Creating New Web Products ” post ( definitely go read the whole post for details and examples ) .
Here ’s my list of 5 principles to evaluate an idea to see if people will pay for a product that :
Supports serious , expensive hobbies
Is so outstanding it redefines its category Helps businesses spend less money Helps businesses make more money Can be bought easily and instinctively
1 ) Consumers with serious , expensive hobbies will pay for high quality tools and services .
Look at what people DO spend money on , and figure out what benefit they get out of it .
Then provide a similar or better benefit .
For example , photo buffs like SmugMug because it ’s better , more attractive , and has better tools to make showcasing pictures easier .
Millions of people pay for XBox live because it ’s the best console - based Internet gaming platform .
Audio and video buffs buy expensive software to give them the effects , speed , and ease of use that they need .
People throw money around all the time – if we ’re afraid to charge money , have we really created something that people value ?
Heck , I paid over $ 150 just for my scuba fins and that ’s not even the part that keeps me alive !
Not only that , I was ogling the $ 250 pair that made me swim faster for less effort .
And I pay $ 50 - 70 every single time I get on a boat .
Looking around my house at my hobbies , I have about $ 1,200 of scuba gear , about $ 1,000 of camera gear , a $ 600 camcorder , over 100 DVDs , a gajillion dollars worth of kids ’ toys and books , etc .
I even have about $ 500 worth of lawn tools and I hate working on my lawn !
Now try to tell me it ’s hard to get people to pay for stuff .
Just take go through every expensive hobby that people have and find some aspect of it that could be digitized and delivered through software .
Again , back to scuba diving – if you mapped and created 3D models of the world ’s most popular dive sites , I guarantee people would pay to preview them ( the trick would be to do it cost effectively , but that ’s the sort of technological problem that we ’re supposed to be good at , right ? ) .
If you ’re paying $ 5 K for a one week diving trip to Hawai ’i , what ’s another $ 99 to scope out the territory before you get there ?
Piggyback off where people are already spending tons of money .
People throw money around for experiences all the time – if we ’re afraid to charge money , have we really created an experience that people value ?
If you ca n’t get people to pay you what they pay for a cup of coffee , a magazine , or one adult beverage , then how much are you really enriching their life ?
2 ) Do n’t be second best .
People that are paying for hobbies pay for excellence .
Excellence is your opportunity to build a moat around yourself .
Two things happen if you build something that ’s the best in class : you become easier to choose and you become harder to leave .
When you ’re the best and you exceed expectations , people talk about you , the press covers you , and your sales and marketing job just got a whole lot easier .
The hype before the release of the iPhone was estimated to be valued at $ 400 million in marketing value .
If a satisfied customer raves to his friends about your product , your cost to sell to his friends is lower .
They know about you and someone they trust has already recommended you .
They ’re now much more likely to choose you than Joe Schmo who has n’t heard of you .
Not only that , once they ’re in your fold , you get to raise the bar for their expectations as high as you want .
While it might be hard for you to clear that bar , it will be sooooo much harder for your competitors .
No one likes to backslide when they feel they ’ve made progress – I get claustrophobic just thinking of some of the apartments I lived in when I was in college .
Do I ever whip out my old cassette Walkman because I get so sick of having thousands of songs on my iPod ?
No .
Have I ever copied the address from a company ’s MapQuest page and entered it into Google Maps ?
Yes .
Once I started using MSN Maps , I never used MapQuest again .
Once I started using Google Maps , I never used MSN Maps again .
I think iTunes / iPod music syncing falls into this category – people who would never dream of dragging and dropping music files to a mapped drive have no problem plugging in an iPod and waiting a couple minutes .
Most people never looked back on tenements , horses , or farming once houses , cars , and grocery stores were available .
Back to the 3D scuba site model example ( hint , hint to anyone that wants to collect some money from me ) : if your models are slow , wireframe models with little detail and no fish , then adios .
If you ’re offering full screen , full color , interactive environments with lots of detail , realistic fish , day / night cycles , tides , etc , then I have no choice but to take you .
How good could you make it ?
Could you compare with Finding Nemo ?
Could you make it into a video game ?
Could scuba simulators be as popular as flight simulators ?
Do n’t think small .
Make the product that is so good it forces your customers to raise their expectations .
3 ) Businesses buy things that help them spend less money .
After all , if you shrink the top line , the bottom line grows .
After all , businesses are just organizations whose expensive hobby is making money ?.
One way to do this is to build something comparable to an existing product and sell it for a lower price .
This is very tempting because it ’s easy to measure , but competing on price in a world with no distribution costs leads you to …free .
Nuff said .
This is n’t a good idea for any industry and it ’s especially bad for software .
The price of physical goods is partly based on reproduction and distribution costs , while software is almost entirely priced according to willingness to pay ( maybe that ’s why there is more free software than free products ) .
So if you have a worse physical product with better distribution or lower cost , you have more ways to swing the balance in your favor ( think McDonalds vs Five Guys ) .
With software , the only two variables are design ( how well you solve the problem ) and marketing ( how aware are customers of your product ) .
A better approach is to shrink a market or disrupt your competitors .
You build a worse solution to a known problem that happens to be a better solution to an unknown problem .
This opens up new markets that you conveniently become a dominant player in – look at 37 signals in simple web - based project management software .
Basecamp is terrible compared to MS Project , unless you ’re part of the ( much larger ) group of businesses that does n’t find the power of Project to be worth the effort of dealing with it .
This lets you nail the most important subset of features and since you have a different business model , you can charge a premium for your product while still undercutting competitors on price .
4 ) A close corollary of # 3 is to help businesses make more money .
The other way for businesses to make more money is to earn more money .
They would love to buy a product that helps them make more money , but why should they trust you when you ’re telling them exactly what they want to hear ?
They only want to buy things that works , not just what the vendor says will work .
The Pragmatics and the Conservatives need to see other successful examples in order to trust you and to take the uncertainty out of your promised ROI numbers .
The uncertainty of a new product is fine for the entrepreneur that created it , but not for most customers .
That ’s why you need bold initial customers who will take the risk and are willing to share their experiences .
Having predictable results is often more important for a client than good results ( “ No one ever got fired for choosing IBM ’s $ 400 / hr consultants ” ) .
This is fine , because once you have this baseline level of market confidence , your name and reputation sells itself and you get exponential growth through client case studies and testimonials .
Why else is this hard ?
You have to know a business or industry well enough to know how to improve it .
You do n’t have to be the guru of that industry ; you can often make a huge difference by bringing a computational perspective to the domain .
I bet everyone of you reading this has cringed at a horribly inefficient business practice that could be done cheaper , faster , and more reliably with a little bit of computing added to the mix .
If you or someone you know has access to a non-computer business , dive in and look for ways it could be improved .
Find out what they have to do but hate doing and find a way to simplify or automate it .
A dentist would rather clean teeth than fight with insurance companies , a band would rather write songs than try to book gigs , an architect would rather design buildings than wrestle with permitting , etc .
If they can invest some money in software that would help them do more of what they love and are good at , they ’ll buy it .
And what if they do n’t ?
Their aggressive competitor will :) .
Those previous examples were ways to save time , which was then used on the primary business to earn more money .
Another way would be to augment the primary business to make it run better .
For instance , video editing software makes video production faster and easier while improving the quality .
Digital cameras let you spend more time taking pictures and less time developing , while also letting you take more pictures and get instant feedback .
A CRM lets you keep better track of your customers so you have more information to help your interaction with them .
Project management software helps you write better software with fewer bugs .
A Mercedes helps a real estate agent impress his clients while chauffeuring them from showing to showing .
Know the business , make it better .
5 ) Make buying your product easy and instinctive .
I can grocery shop very fast because I buy the exact same things every time – bananas , apples , milk , yogurt , Marshmallow Mateys , Tennessee Pride sausage biscuits , 5 lb bag of rice , frozen veggies , ground beef , chicken breasts , etc .
I do n’t comparison shop anymore because I ’ve already done that and now I know what I should buy .
The companies I buy from literally do n’t have to do any more work to sell to me !
This is the appeal of subscription based software – continue to meet expectations and you continue to receive payments .
Make something that becomes part of everyday life , and you ’ve got a recurring revenue stream .
Just ask Amazon how nice that tastes .
And please , please , PLEASE , make it easy for people to give you money !
If you only accept Google Checkout , expect to miss out on PayPal users .
If you do n’t take checks , you ’ll probably lose business .
Do you customers really need to register to buy your product ?
If not , do n’t make them !
The exact amount of lost business because of payment restrictions is unknowable , but you can be pretty confident it ’s not $ 0 .
Conclusion
If you ’re now thinking “ So what happened ?
I thought this was supposed to be the easy answer to all of my entrepreneurial woes !
All this guy did was increase the amount of work I have to do before I can cash out and go kiteboarding all day ! ” , then my work here is done .
The simple lesson of economics ( that I could have saved myself 2,500 words if I was n’t busy trying to blow your cache ) is that people pay for things that they value and that are scarce .
Fix your eye on that principle , and while you ’re walking down the road towards it , you ’ll find what they value ( expensive hobbies , making money ) and what ’s scarce ( original , non-commoditized products , experiences , services that create value ) .
Now quit reading blogs and get to work !

If you 're a conservative and your ideas make no sense , then your opponents must be Neville Chamberlain .
Hence , Bush at the Knesset :
Some seem to believe we should negotiate with terrorists and radicals , as if some ingenious argument will persuade them they have been wrong all along .
We have heard this foolish delusion before .
As Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared : " Lord , if only I could have talked to Hitler , all of this might have been avoided . "
We have an obligation to call this what it is – the false comfort of appeasement , which has been repeatedly discredited by history .
The standard point to make in response to this is still a true one -- we refer to this day to the " lessons of Munich " and make a big deal out of Adolf Hitler because that was really unusual whereas to hawks it 's always 1939 , every foreigner we do n't like is a new Hitler , and preventive war is always the only solution .
Bush and McCain truly are the ideological descendants of the folks who urged Eisenhower to go for " rollback " and who insisted that Ronald Reagan betrayed the true path when he sat down with Gorbachev for arms control talks .
Meanwhile , Bush continues to fundamentally misunderstand the purpose and nature of diplomacy .
The idea of talks is n't that you marshall convincing arguments and beat your enemies back with force of words .
The idea is that it 's sometimes possible to achieve a reconciliation of partially divergent interests .
Maybe Iran wants a nuclear weapon in order to deter American attack .
And maybe America wants a nuclear - free Iran to help preserve stability in the region .
Down one path , we have conflict and the U.S. sanctions and bombs Iran which causes suffering but only delays Iran 's acquisition of a nuclear weapon .
But down another path , each side discusses it's top priorities and we reach an agreement on verifiable disarmament in the context of security guarantees and a path to normalized relations .
Down the road , that gives the U.S. the stability we want and creates more prosperity and security for Iran .
Maybe that wo n't work -- it was n't possible to reconcile interests with Hitler -- but that 's what 's on the table .
Now if you believe that literally every antagonistic force in the world is exactly like Hitler , then the distinction collapses , but only an idiot would believe that .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Ken Caldeira devised simulations to discredit geoengineering .
But the surprising results converted him . *
Photo : Todd Hido *
It was one of the largest public demonstrations in US history .
On June 12 , 1982 , an estimated 750,000 protesters thronged Central Park in New York City , chanting " No nukes ! " and bearing signs reading " Reagan is a bomb — both should be banned " and " Arms are for embracing . "
Some demonstrators called for unilateral US disarmament , others for renewing arms control talks with the Soviet Union .
It was a diverse coalition that had been pulled together by Ken Caldeira , a 25 - year - old activist and computer geek .
Back then he was paying the rent doing software consulting on Wall Street , but his passion for the environment would eventually lead him to become one of the nation 's leading experts on global warming .
Around the same time , at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory near San Francisco , Lowell Wood — then 41 and a protégé of the brilliant and controversial hydrogen bomb inventor Edward Teller — was leading a secretive team of young geniuses called the O Group .
They were n't merely working with the nukes that Caldeira and his fellow peaceniks reviled ; they were dreaming up new and expanded uses for them .
One plan called for channeling the energy of a hydrogen bomb into laser blasts that could theoretically destroy enemy ballistic missiles from outer space .
It sounded crazy , but Wood and Teller 's ideas inspired President Reagan 's famous March 23 , 1983 , " Star Wars " speech introducing the Strategic Defense Initiative , the bane of arms - control advocates everywhere .
What 's surprising , then , is that today , 25 years later , Caldeira , the left - wing environmentalist , calls Wood , the Cold Warrior and Star Wars proselytizer , " one of my best friends . "
Recently , they have collaborated on strategies for a process known as geoengineering : the large - scale , deliberate modification of the planet to counteract the consequences of ever - increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gas .
The global climate crisis has made for strange bedfellows , and Caldeira 's passage from devout environmentalist to would - be geoengineer has led him into a partnership that his younger self would have scorned .
Geoengineering schemes sound like they 're pulled straight from pulp sci- fi novels : Fertilize the oceans with iron in order to sequester carbon dioxide ; launch fleets of ships to whip up sea spray and enhance the solar reflectivity of marine stratocumulus clouds ; use trillions of tiny spacecraft to form a sunshade a million miles from Earth in perfect solar orbit .
They all may seem impractical , but among a small but growing set of climate scientists , one idea that Wood and Teller started pushing in the late 1990s ( before Teller 's death in 2003 ) is gaining acceptance :
Inject sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to reflect a portion of the sun 's rays back into space , thus cooling the planet .
Ken Caldeira is a self - described blabbermouth with disheveled curly hair and a habit of modestly turning his voice up at the end of sentences so even his most definitive utterances sound like questions .
On a recent morning in his Carnegie Institution office on the Stanford campus , he 's dressed casually in a sweater and jeans , eagerly examining results from a new climate model run that was designed to explore possible consequences of geoengineering .
As Caldeira tinkers with the software , he jokes that his talent with computers basically ensured that he would spend more time in an office than out leading research expeditions .
A career in science , he says , " was all a ploy for me to get into the rain forests .
But it never really worked . "
Caldeira 's transit from antinuke activist to climate scientist grew out of his fondness for ecotourism .
During the ' 80s , he joined occasional research expeditions into the Mexican rain forest ; he pitched in by writing software to help researchers map out species distributions .
Caldeira loved the trips , but he soon realized that to get himself beneath the canopy more regularly , he 'd need a PhD .
So he took night classes at New York University under Martin Hoffert , a physicist best known today for his skepticism about how quickly cleaner energy sources can actually replace dirty fossil fuels .
In 1990 , a year short of his doctorate , Caldeira went to Leningrad to study with Russian climate scientist Mikhail Budyko , one of the first champions of geoengineering .
In the 1970s , Budyko had suggested an early version of the basic Teller - Wood idea — decrease the global temperature by shooting sunlight - scattering particles into the stratosphere .
While he was in Leningrad , Caldeira 's philosophical outlook still predisposed him to distrust such interventions , but years later that would change .
In 1993 , the former peace activist accepted a research post at that haven of bombmakers , the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .
Caldeira was running high - powered computer models to study the climate , but when he was offered a security clearance that would have allowed fuller access to the lab 's resources , he tried to stay true to his old principles by declining .
As a result , he did n't see much of Wood .
" There 's an outer fence at Livermore , and then there 's an inner fence , " Caldeira says .
" Lowell worked inside the fence . "
The two got to know each other in 1998 , just after the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol , at a conference in Aspen , Colorado .
The topic was strategies for stabilizing the climate system , and Wood had been invited to speak about his work with Teller on geoengineering .

### Cooling the Globe
Many climate specialists see so - called geoengineering techniques as a way to bring down global temperatures if other attempts to combat global warming fail .
One approach is to inject sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere , where it reacts to form particles that block sunlight .
Roll over the numbers in the infographic to learn more .
Infographic : Ryan VulkUnlike many political conservatives in the late '90s , Wood and Teller took climate change seriously .
But they doubted people would ever give up enough of their costly energy - consumption habits to prevent climate - associated risks ( a cynical point of view that seems to have been borne out a decade later ) .
Wood and Teller were just as dismissive of global greenhouse gas treaties like Kyoto as they had been of arms - control agreements during the ' 80s .
They thought the only solution lay with technology : direct , aggressive intervention , either in the upper atmosphere or low Earth orbit , essentially to turn down the volume knob on solar radiation .
In Aspen , Wood did n't pull any punches .
" He was being outrageous , " Caldeira remembers with amusement .
" He said something like , ' If we want to solve the global warming problem , we could just have a nuclear war . ' "
Even the title of his presentation was provocative : " Geoengineering and Nuclear Fission as Responses to Global Warming . "
By spending only about $ 1 billion per year , Wood argued , we could put enough particles in the stratosphere to reduce sunlight by about 1 percent — and that 's all we 'd need to start reversing global warming .
Wood must have known his talk was going to be controversial .
Geoengineering had a long history but a checkered reputation .
In a 1965 environmental report that discussed climate change ( yes , back then ) , President Johnson 's Science Advisory Committee offered a single solution to the problem , and it was a fix that we would now call geoengineering : Spread reflective particles over the oceans .
But as the environmental movement gained momentum , it became decidedly uncool to propose high tech interventions .
Geoengineering also suffered by association with several undistinguished military ventures into weather modification .
In 1971 , news broke that the Pentagon had attempted to alter the weather in Vietnam for military purposes by seeding clouds with silver iodide crystals .
The episode prompted an international outcry and , later , a United Nations convention against weather interference for hostile purposes .
Wood 's talk did n't generate much enthusiasm among the scientists in Aspen that day .
" I thought it would never work , " Caldeira says .
In fact , he teamed up with another Livermore colleague , Bala Govindasamy , to prove Wood wrong by conducting a thorough climate simulation , the first of its kind .
" The intent was to put an end to all the geoengineering talk , " Caldeira says .
Because changes in the intensity of sunlight affect the climate quite differently than do changes in greenhouse gas concentrations — sunlight varies by season and by the diurnal cycle and falls most strongly over the tropics and equator , whereas carbon dioxide traps heat both day and night across the globe — he had a hunch that the two might not really offset one another very well , especially on a regional or seasonal basis .
When the results came back , Caldeira had disproved his own hypothesis .
Geoengineering really did seem to operate more or less like a planetwide thermostat .
As the resulting paper noted , Wood 's proposal might have any number of adverse environmental and ecological consequences , but it also might offer real benefits .
" Melting of Greenland and Antarctic ice caps and the consequent sea level rise , " Caldeira and Govindasamy wrote in the spring 2000 issue of Geophysical Research Letters , " is less likely to occur in a geoengineered world . "
The paper helped propel Wood 's idea into the scientific mainstream and turned Caldeira and Wood into unlikely new allies .
Since then , increasingly bad climate news has only heightened interest in the proposal .
The summer of 2007 saw a new low in the extent of Arctic sea ice , while data from the Greenland ice sheet is similarly ominous ; if it were to melt entirely , sea levels would rise 20 feet , submerging coastal cities like New York and Shanghai .
Meanwhile , a new climate - modeling study by Caldeira and another colleague found that in order to stabilize the climate now , we'd have to go to zero emissions almost immediately — something nobody thinks is even remotely possible .
All of which is forcing scientists to consider geoengineering more seriously as a way to fight climate change .
There 's no better evidence for the growing acceptance of geoengineering than a 2006 essay in the journal Climatic Change by the atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen , who shares a 1995 Nobel Prize for work on ozone formation and decomposition .
The continuing failure of governments to move on global warming , Crutzen says , makes open discussion of geoengineering essential .
" The very best would be if emissions of the greenhouse gases could be reduced so much that the stratospheric sulfur release experiment would not take place , " he wrote .
" Currently , this looks like a pious wish . "
The stratospheric sulfate experiment has already had its proof of concept — courtesy of planet Earth .
On June 15 , 1991 , Mount Pinatubo , which for months had been rumbling , belching , and terrorizing the main Philippine island of Luzon , finally blew its top in an explosion so powerful that it carried 500 feet of the mountain 's peak along with it .
It was the second - largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century , 10 times the size of the Mount Saint Helens explosion in 1980 and the first of its scale to occur with modern scientific technologies in place — especially satellites — to measure the global environmental and climatic effect .
Pinatubo's eruption did n't just unleash huge mud slides and lava flows ; it also fired an ash stream 22 miles into the air , injecting 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere .
Over the following months , a massive haze gradually dispersed across the globe .
Meanwhile , the sulfur dioxide component underwent chemical reactions to form a particulate known as sulfate aerosol ( in essence , droplets of water and sulfuric acid ) , which absorbs sunlight and reflects some of it back into space .
The climatic effect of this volcanic eruption was rapid , dramatic , and planetary in scale .
In a year , the global average temperature declined by half a degree Celsius , and researchers observed less summer melt atop the Greenland ice sheet .
Of course , that got scientists thinking .
Not only could we mimic volcanoes by seeding the stratosphere with extra sulfur , but if we were really clever , we could design particles to do an even better job at scattering sunlight .
University of Calgary climate scientist and geoengineering expert David Keith has suggested that we might ultimately find a particle that can be placed still higher up in the atmosphere , in the region called the mesosphere , above the ozone layer , where it would cause fewer problems .
The evidence from Pinatubo showed that such an intervention will definitely cool the planet .
Furthermore , it would work quickly and would n't alter the atmosphere permanently : Depending upon the starting elevation , stratospheric sulfate aerosol will stay in the atmosphere for only a year or two .
( Though this could also be seen as a drawback :
If you cool the planet artificially by injecting sulfur and then stop suddenly , things warm back up more quickly than before . )
The next question , of course , is how to get the particles up there .
Various proposals have suggested using artillery , balloons , suspended hoses , military jets , or even converted 747s .
Then there is the question of where to deposit the sulfur .
There are different elevations to consider , as well as planetary location .
A number of scientists , most recently Wood and Caldeira in a yet - unpublished paper , propose dispensing the gas over the Arctic — after all , that 's where global warming is felt most powerfully and where cooler temperatures would help restore sea ice and stabilize Greenland .
Al Gore is n't buying it , and neither are mainstream green organizations .
" People have this fantasy right now that maybe this will save us , " says Alan Robock , a Rutgers University climate scientist and geoengineering critic , " but it looks like it 's going to cause more problems than it will solve . "
Indeed , ever since that first 2000 study , nearly all geoengineering simulations that Caldeira has run point to unwanted consequences .
Caldeira 's response is that it's hard to see how those consequences would be anywhere near as nasty as simply letting global warming go unchecked .
But the more geoengineering becomes a matter of public debate and concern , the more the downsides of a remade world come under scrutiny .
First , there 's the fear that injecting sulfate into the stratosphere could destroy much - needed ozone , which also declined markedly after Pinatubo .
Another possible side effect is acid rain .
But sulfur dioxide pollution from coal - burning power plants , one of the prime causes of acid rain in the past , never reaches the stratosphere — it remains in the atmosphere 's lowest layer , the troposphere , and rains out quickly as a result .
The stratospheric sulfate from geoengineering would stay up longer and be more stable , so we would need less of it to begin with , which somewhat weakens the acid rain argument .
But the deepest concern is that at a fundamental level we would be messing with a complex and incompletely understood system , one that — even in the most powerful computer models — can be rendered only partially .
There will undoubtedly be unexpected results — the " unknown unknowns , " as climate scientists call them .
That 's why critics like Robock and prominent atmospheric - sciences historian James Rodger Fleming want to avoid " playing God with the elements , " to use Fleming 's phrase .
Finally , while geoengineering could presumably lower the planet 's temperature , it cannot correct the other consequences of mounting carbon dioxide pollution .
For instance , as the oceans absorb more CO 2 they acidify , and decreasing ocean pH levels threaten coral reefs and other marine ecosystems .
No amount of stratospheric sulfate can reverse that .
Until large - scale experiments are funded , the only way to explore the potential consequences is through computer simulations .
By turning down the virtual sun or cranking up the digital carbon , we can create any planetary future we want .
Back at his office at the Carnegie Institution , where he recently received a lifetime research position , I watch Caldeira decipher the results from a new simulation .
He designed the study to investigate whether a geoengineered climate in which atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have doubled is significantly worse for plants — in other words , will there be less soil moisture for them ?
Previous studies suggested that this might be another potentially troubling consequence of geoengineering :
If you artificially cool the planet , you also apparently decrease overall precipitation and at a rate that slightly outstrips the corresponding temperature change .
So Caldeira wants to know just how bad that would be and , more specifically , whether it would automatically translate into stunted plant growth .
The results finally appear , expressed as images on a map in which the continents are shaded green but trending blue or red in certain places , depending upon soil - moisture changes .
Overall , there seems to be little , if any , dramatic consequence .
A geoengineered planet , it appears , would have less precipitation but also less evaporation — at least according to this simulation .
Caldeira expected as much .
Soil moisture is one of many aspects of a geoengineered world that he has explored since his first study back in 2000 , and though there are always some downsides , he continues to be encouraged by the results .
Still , he admits that the trajectory of his research leads to a paradox .
He does n't want to deploy any of these solutions immediately — he still views them as last resorts — yet his own ongoing investigations and endorsements could contribute to making them more likely , if not inevitable .
Caldeira may be leery of how such research is altering the debate , but some are already saying , just as Wood and Teller did long ago , that if geoengineering works — why wait ?
Americans can drive their gas - guzzling SUVs to their hearts ' content , and China can build as many coal - powered electricity plants as it wants .
The online edition of the conservative magazine National Review recently made the case for geoengineering — in part because it prevents us from having to cut emissions .
Similarly , in a recent article in the right - wing journal The National Interest , Wood and a coauthor painted geoengineering as a favorable alternative to the practical difficulties of controlling global carbon gas emissions .
True to his green roots , Caldeira does n't want people to view geoengineering as a magic bullet to be fired at the expense of cutting emissions .
" I 'm actually more concerned about the effect of geoengineering on the social and political systems than on the climate system , " he says .
Caldeira wants geoengineering only if , say , Greenland starts sliding into the ocean .
But at some point , the lure of geoengineering may gradually overwhelm all reservations .
Congress is currently considering legislation that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions 56 percent by the year 2050 , hardly enough , according to many scientists , to stabilize the climate .
And the law regulates only US emissions ; getting emerging economies like India and China to cut back presents far greater hurdles .
Meanwhile , Caldeira and Wood keep debating the issue .
Despite their differences , they still seem to agree more than they disagree .
Sure enough , when our conversation ends , Caldeira checks his phone .
Another email from Wood has just come in .

CHICAGO  Commodity prices went wild on Wednesday , with the price of corn shooting through the $ 7 barrier for the first time , soybeans and wheat moving up sharply and oil jumping more than $ 5 a barrel .
Corn prices , which have been hitting new highs for a week , are reacting to six weeks of heavy rains and cool weather in the Midwest .
That prevented planting in some areas , leading some farmers to abandon the crop in the last few days .
It is still raining .
The bad weather comes as supplies of corn , wheat and other staples are already tight thanks to soaring global demand .
The higher commodity prices are likely to add to a worldwide inflationary picture that seems to worsen by the day .
Prices of many grocery items in the United States have been rising briskly , with some goods like eggs and milk  produced from animals fed with corn  up by 13 to 30 percent in the past year .
Taras Kalapun 's Beginning of a Music
A Japanese instrument maker with his trumpet made from a bell pepper and a cucumber has been making its rounds on the internet , so I 'll bring a few other interesting instruments from elsewhere in the world .
YouTube user 13 strings ( account currently closed ) made an open call : to have everyone show their own home - made instruments on YouTube , and replies have rolled in including the following three : a whole orchestra made from recycled cans and plastic soda - bottles , how to make didgeridoos , a bottle wind and water organ .
From another place in the world , an instrument that may not be home made but certainly has a distinctive sound : the hurdy gurdy .
From Brazil , jamilgiudice has at least 5 different instruments made from recycled soft drink cans and bottles .
From Australia , gwdidg shows us how aborigines harvest from termite hollowed - out gum trees what is possibly the world 's oldest wind instrument , the didgeridoo :
From Singapore , einrahseinraw blows into tuned bottles , takes pictures of himself and proceeds to mix them up to play Toccata et Fugue in D Minor by Bach :
And to wrap things up , thanks to avinograd from Russia comes a beautifully rhythmic traditional folk song played in an instrument I had never seen in my life , the hurdy gurdy or gironde :
A Netflix - like system for trading your unwanted DVDs with others through the mail sounds like a cool idea .
But in practice , you wind up with a stack of old discs that no one will take off your hands .
That 's been my experience with Peerflix , an online movie - swapping service that applies the principles of peer - to - peer file - sharing to physical DVDs .
See photos
The idea is simple :
You sign up at the website , list the DVDs you own and DVDs you want .
When another Peerflix member requests your movie , an automated e-mail alerts you and you send the person the film through the mail .
Likewise , when you request a movie , another member is alerted , and you should have it in your hands days later .
You pay $ 1 ( plus postage ) for every exchange .
Unlike the online DVD rental service Netflix , there 's no central DVD warehouse – the movies come directly from other film fans .
Peerflix has more than 30,000 DVDs in circulation , up from about 5,000 in February , according to the company .
But the company will not disclose how many people have signed up for the service .
The test started out well .
I signed up and received an introductory mailing from the company two days later , faster than I expected .
The packet included four special envelopes for mailing DVDs .
As with Netflix , you only send the DVD , not the case .
The movie swap itself was great .
I started with one DVD , The Rocky Horror Picture Show , which was requested by another member only a few hours after I registered .
I sent out Rocky Horror to someone in North Carolina .
After surrendering it , I chose the hilarious Down With Love from someone in Southern California .
It arrived three days after I requested it .
Cool .
To trade movies , you must earn " peerbux , " which is a value assigned to every film in circulation .
New releases like Sideways are assigned three peerbux ; older films are either one or two peerbux .
Boxed sets can cost six or more .
You acquire the peerbux associated with a film when you mail it off to another user .
The value of Rocky Horror and Down With Love was two peerbux each , so it was an even trade .
My first trade on the site was free ( I did n't have to pay the dollar fee ) , a promotion the company offers first - time users .
Then I relied on my co-workers to provide a few of their unwanted flicks for the test .
They brought in some older but critically acclaimed films , As Good As It Gets and Amadeus ; a mediocre action movie , Mission : Impossible II and a very , um , " niche " film called Trekkies 2 .
But just as I was getting jazzed about trading DVDs , the system ground to a halt .
After several days , the collection I had cobbled together was not generating any interest , and sat in a pile on my desk .
At the same time , it was frustrating to navigate through the system 's occasionally buggy and clunky website .
Billy McNair , co-founder of Peerflix , said most DVDs are usually requested within 10 days to two weeks , depending on the titles .
New releases like The Aviator , which just came out on DVD , are snapped up immediately , he said .
My little collection of DVDs had been taking up space for about a week .
My solution , then , was to buy peerbux so I could order more DVDs .
While peerbux is a value assigned to movies in circulation , you can also buy peerbux from Peerflix , enabling you to obtain certain films that you do n't have enough peerbux to get on your own .
Unfortunately , I ran into problems when I tried to buy peerbux ( a name that is confusing , since one peerbux costs $ 5 ) .
The transaction did n't work after four attempts .
McNair said the company was upgrading the site , and that peerbux transactions work " 95 percent of the time . "
While the transactions did n't work , I noticed I had been charged $ 5 the next day .
McNair said when a person fully activates her account by typing in credit card information , the company charges $ 5 toward five pre-paid trades .
But this was unclear to me , the user .
At the same time , I had one peerbux inexplicably credited to my account – apparently a bonus for becoming an active member .
This was not explained either until I talked to McNair .
The descriptions and images of the DVDs are inconsistent as you browse , which can be annoying if you 're trying to learn more about a movie .
I found a boxed set called Controversial Classics , but no description of the films appeared , only their titles .
The company currently relies on Amazon.com 's open - source affiliate program for such information but will be switching to a third - party provider , McNair said .
In each category , boxed sets are also grouped with single DVDs in a mass list , which can make it difficult to browse and sort out the DVDs you want and can afford .
Some of the DVDs seem mis-categorized .
In fairness , perhaps I 'm not the best candidate for the service .
I do n't own a collection of hot new releases , which would surely be snapped up faster than the DVDs on my list .
And I want to keep the movies I do own .
I 'm apparently unlike many of my fellow movie fans who buy lots of DVDs , watch them a few times and then do n't know what to do with them .
This service might be great for impulse - buying types .
Or , it might be a perfect service for people like reviewers , who get a lot of lame or duplicate DVDs and want to trade them in .
The system could be useful if you live in a small town , for instance , and your movie choices are limited to those at the local Wal - Mart .
Peer - to - peer means more variety .
The company pointed out another feature I did not try , which enables you to share movies with your friends without charging peerbux .
You still have to pay a dollar for the trade , however .
McNair said the company is talking with retailers about potential partnerships .
If someone buys a new DVD from a retailer , they might receive free trades on Peerflix .
That would help seed the Peerflix network , and would give people more mileage out of a DVD purchase .
Still , with my collection of DVDs piling up on my desk and the difficulty of trying to purchase peerbux , the service takes more time than I 'm willing to give .
I 'm not sure I want to wait weeks to earn my peerbux or get my movies .
The convenience and instant gratification of renting is simply better .

produce an MD5 collision .
I thought it would be interesting to visualise MD5 ’s internal state for these two blocks .
The bits go horizontally , and the rounds vertically .
A white square is zero for both blocks , black is one for both blocks , red is one for the first and zero for the second and green is zero for the first and one for the second .
The first block of bits , to the left , is the input used in that round ( 32 bits per round ) .
The remainder are A , B , C and D , the internal state ( 32 bits each ) .
There is a horizontal break at the end of each input block .
By contrast , here ’s what it looks like if the second block is the same as the first but with the MSB flipped in the first byte .
Senator Arlen Specter took the stage with a panel of journalists at the American Civil Liberties Union 's annual convention earlier this week to urge support for a federal shield law that would protect journalists from being compelled to disclose confidential sources .
He also addressed reports of a possible compromise on legislation to grant some form of legal amnesty to telecommunications firms accused of participating in warrant - less surveillance by the National Security Agency , arguing that the lawsuits must be allowed to proceed , but with the government as defendant .
The Pennsylvania Republican was joined by James Risen , one of the two New York Times reporters who first broke the story of the extrajudicial NSA surveillance program , and Toni Locy , the former USA Today reporter who was held in contempt of court for refusing to disclose the identities of her sources for her 2002 reporting on the FBI investigation into the previous year 's anthrax attacks .
Mr Risen has , himself , been served with a federal grand jury subpoena in connection with his 2006 book State of War .
Specter warned that courts ' increasing willingness to go after journalists ' sources threatened to create " more than a chilling effect ; it is a freezing effect " that would hamper the publication of important stories .
The Senator singled out Risen 's NSA reporting for praise , saying that it " ranks with Watergate , it ranks with Iran - Contra . "
In order to ensure that such stories can continue to be printed , Specter wants the Senate to act on his Free Flow of Information Act , which would provide qualified protection for reporters .
The House version of the bill passed by an overwhelming margin last year , but has stalled in the Senate in the face of opposition ( and a veto threat ) from the White House .
Lucy Dalglish , executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , is optimistic about the prospects of renewed action , and told Ars she believes a vote on the stalled bill could come as soon as late this month .
Both journalists noted that their past ambivalence about special protections —
Locy had long believed that " the First Amendment was enough " — had fallen away in recent years .
While prosecutors have , in the past , tended to be chary of subpoenaing journalists , Risen worried that the Justice Department 's discretion in deciding whom to investigate could be used as a weapon against inconvenient reporting , especially as more and more information is deemed classified , whether or not it is especially sensitive .
" Virtually every day , the New York Times prints classified information , " Risen said .
" You could have a leak investigation every day .
Locy , whose own brush with the law stems from a civil suit by scientist Steven Hatfill , whom Locy 's reporting identified as a " person of interest " to the FBI , stressed that private legal action by the disgruntled subjects of reporting posed a similar threat .
Without protection , she predicted , " investigative reporting will be gone . "
There was some disagreement on the panel , however : Risen suggested that Specter 's bill might not cover the national security stories whose sources are most in need of confidentiality .
While the law would raise high barriers for prosecutors seeking disclosure of a journalist 's source in most cases , it contains an exception for cases in which a court finds , by a preponderance of the evidence , that disclosure would help to prevent " significant and articulable harm to national security . "
Specter , however , asserted that reporting like Risen 's would be protected , a view Risen later said he found surprising .
Unlike earlier versions of the shield law , the bill under consideration in the Senate would potentially protect at least some bloggers , as well as traditional reporters .
The previous definition of a " journalist " as one who earns " significant " income from reporting has been replaced by a functional definition covering anyone who " regularly " engages in journalism .
But it is not clear to what extent it would shield part - time " citizen journalists " who do not routinely do original reporting .
Specter also warned that we are " on the ledge of giving the phone companies retroactive immunity , " and quipped that , given the secrecy surrounding the NSA program , it seemed " very difficult to give retroactive immunity when you 're not sure what you 're giving immunity for . "
He also chided the courts for not doing more to challenge " the assertion of the executive that the executive can ignore the law . "
The senator reaffirmed his support for allowing the government to stand - in for the telecoms , arguing that " substitution would give most of the loaf to the cause of civil liberties . "
Specter did not , however , feel obliged to remind the ACLU crowd that he had , nevertheless , voted for the Senate 's version of surveillance reform legislation , including a retroactive immunity provision .
Maybe Barack Obama felt he could n’t afford to give the correct answer .
He was asked at a fund - raiser in San Francisco about his campaign ’s experiences in the run-up to next week ’s Democratic primary in Pennsylvania .
One of the main problems , of course , is that he has n’t generated as much support as he ’d like among white working - class voters .
There is no mystery here .
Except for people who have been hiding in caves or living in denial , it ’s pretty widely understood that a substantial number of those voters  in Pennsylvania , Ohio , West Virginia and elsewhere  will not vote for a black candidate for president .
Pennsylvanians themselves will tell you that racial attitudes in some parts of the state are , to be kind , less than enlightened .
Gov. Ed Rendell , Hillary Clinton ’s most powerful advocate in the state , put it bluntly last February : “ I think there are some whites who are probably not ready to vote for an African - American candidate . ”
This toxic issue is at the core of the Clinton camp ’s relentless effort to persuade superdelegates that Senator Obama “ ca n’t win ” the White House .
It ’s the only weapon left in the Clintons ’ depleted armory .

A recent report from ABI Research highlights the rise of mobile Linux , estimating that 23 percent of the world ’s smartphones will have a Linux operating system by 2013 .
It appears that much of that growth will come at the expense of Nokia ’s Symbian , and that LiMo and Android will be the main beneficiaries .
What the report does n’t note is that last year ABI predicted that 31 percent of smartphones will have Linux by 2012 .
Either there ’s something to explain the change in numbers , or we should perhaps take our analyst reports with a grain of salt .
However , Linux is undoubtedly moving fast : 15 handsets were launched earlier this year with LiMo , and after several demos and prototypes , anticipation for the Android is running high .
But the jury is still out on which framework will win out with carriers and application developers .
LiMo has the backing of NEC , Motorola and Samsung as well as SK Telecom and Verizon .
Android , through the Open Handset Alliance , has T - Mobile , NTT DoCoMo , China Telecom , Telefonica , Google and several others .
The stated goal behind both efforts is to eliminate some of the costs associated with developing mobile applications for multiple operating systems by using open source .
It ’s a laudable goal , but the fight between the two for market share demonstrates how hard it will be to lower costs , as developers will still have to build for multiple platforms .

HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Cubans crowded shops on Tuesday to buy DVD players and electric bikes that went on sale for the first time as new President Raul Castro moved to lift many restrictions in the one - party socialist state .

Stores were authorized to sell dozens of electric goods that were previously banned , including microwave ovens , flat - screen televisions and even computers .
“ This should have been done long ago .
They should never have been banned , ” said Felipe , a 53 - year - old engineer , who lined up impatiently to buy his first DVD player .
The Philips and Panasonic DVD players were priced between $ 118 and $ 162 , much more expensive than in other countries but lower than the going rate on Cuba ’s thriving black - market .
Raul Castro succeeded his ailing brother Fidel Castro as president on February 24 , promising to lift “ excessive prohibitions ” on daily life in Cuba .
His government has since moved quickly to allow Cubans to buy cellular phones and stay at hotels previously reserved for foreigners .
The changes made so far by Cuba ’s first new leader in half a century are aimed at reducing pent up frustrations in the country of 11 million where the ruling Communist Party has a firm grip on power .
Cubans welcomed greater access to consumer goods that are available virtually anywhere else in the world .
“ After so many years of restrictions , this is great .
Now Cubans have new options and I can resolve my transport problem , ” said Raydel Leyva , 42 , the first at a Havana shopping center to buy a battery - driven moped made in China and priced at $ 900 .
“ These measures are meant to improve life and make us feel better living in our country , ” he said .
With wages averaging $ 17 a month in Cuba , many of the new goods on sale were out of reach for most pockets , but even some of those who could not afford to buy anything were happy they are now available .
“ The prices are astronomical .
But at least I have the choice , and I can save up to buy things I want .
People will work harder to buy them , ” said Gelis , a self - employed tennis coach .
COMPUTERS COMING
Computers , which until now could only be bought in Cuba by government or foreign companies , were also supposed to go on sale but none had changed hands by Tuesday afternoon .
At a shop in western Havana , Microsoft keyboards and mouses were on show , but Dell laptops and desktop computers were still in their boxes awaiting for prices to be decided .
A saleswoman said computers with 80 gigabytes of hard drive memory , 512 megabytes of RAM and a Celeron P4 chip made by Intel would sell for about $ 865 .
“ I have been saving up for three years , since I was 15 , and I think I am close to buying one , ” said Paula , a university student waiting for the new stock to come in .

Cubans have to pay for the consumer goods in hard currency CUCs , or convertible pesos , worth 24 times more than the Cuban pesos that state wages are paid in .
About 60 percent of Cubans have access to CUCs , through cash remittances from relatives in the United States , bonuses , tips from tourists and black market dealings .
Havana shops had on sale 21 - inch flat - screen television sets and home theater sets worth more than $ 1,300 .
It would take a Cuban with average six years to earn enough to buy one .
“ This is all good and fine , but my purchasing power is too low to buy anything , ” said Yaima , a teacher who earns 592 pesos a month , about $ 26.60 .
“ I ’ll have to wait until they strengthen the peso . ”

Intel , the giant chip maker and longtime partner of Microsoft , has decided against upgrading the computers of its own 80,000 employees to Microsoft ’s Vista operating system , a person with direct knowledge of the company ’s plans said .
The person , who has been briefed on the situation but requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of Intel ’s relationship with Microsoft , said the company made its decision after a lengthy analysis by its internal technology staff of the costs and potential benefits of moving to Windows Vista , which has drawn fire from many customers as a buggy , bloated program that requires costly hardware upgrades to run smoothly .
“ This is n’t a matter of dissing Microsoft , but Intel information technology staff just found no compelling case for adopting Vista , ” the person said .
An Intel spokesman said the company was testing and deploying Vista in certain departments , but not across the company .
Intel ’s decision is certain to sting Microsoft because the two companies have worked closely to align hardware and software from the earliest days of the personal computer .
Indeed , the corporate duo is known as “ Wintel ” in the PC industry .
Could Intel change its mind ?
Quite possibly .
Microsoft ’s chief executive , Steven Ballmer , has few equals as a forceful , persuasive salesman , and he and Paul Otellini , Intel ’s chief executive , meet regularly .
Word of Intel ’s lukewarm response to Vista appeared Monday in The Inquirer , an irreverent London - based technology Web site .
Intel is hardly alone in its reluctance to embrace Microsoft ’s latest operating system , which was available to corporate customers in November 2006 and to consumers in January 2007 .
Large companies routinely hold off a year or so after a new version of Windows is introduced before adopting it , waiting for initial bugs to be eliminated and for applications to be written .
“ But by 18 months , you ’d expect to see a significant uptake , and we have n’t seen that , ” said David Smith , a Gartner analyst .
“ There ’s not much excitement . ”
His Gartner colleague , Michael Silver , said that about 30 percent of corporate customers skip any given new version of Windows .
But the percentage will be higher for Vista , Mr. Silver predicted .
Gartner ’s corporate clients that plan to skip Vista , like Intel , do not see value of this upgrade , particularly since it requires new PC hardware at the time when the economy is weak and corporate budgets are tight .
Still , Microsoft does n’t seem to be suffering too much from the resistance to Vista by some large corporations .
Microsoft says there are more than 140 million copies of Vista installed on machines worldwide .
Consumers and small businesses simply get the operating system that is on a new machine when they buy a PC , and that is Vista .
Meanwhile , the Microsoft operating system engine chugs on , phasing out the old and proclaiming the new .
The company reiterated this week that , despite some customer protests , it would halt shipments of the previous version of Windows , XP , to retail stores and stop most licensing of XP to PC makers next week .
Microsoft also announced that the next version of its operating system , Windows 7 , is scheduled to go on sale in January 2010 .
While we ’ve already heard about the upcoming Knights of the Old Republic MMO – both from the leaked script and angry ex-employees – there ’s been no word on a possible release date .
Until now , that is .
Speaking to investors at a recent stock conference , EA CEO John Riccitello let slip mention of the upcoming MMO that they might be co-publishing with LucasArts .
" It 's giving us strong new entries in online .
For example , we 're funding the MMO in Austin , which is helping us a lot . "
As TotalVideoGames points out , the only EA - owned studio in that area is BioWare ’s MMORPG satellite studio .
BioWare is seen as the most likely candidate to be developing the game .
Coincidence ?
Maybe , but it still seems somewhat likely .
At least EA should n’t feel the need to include any ridiculously lame copy protection , since it ’s an MMO .

One thing that I absolutely adore is the sheer embeddability of JavaScript .
It ’s a ( comparatively ) simple language that is fiercely flexible .
I tend to liken JavaScript to water – alone it ’s painfully simple but it can take the form of its container – and mixing it with anything enhances its flavor .
Since JavaScript , alone , is so dumb ( we ’ve become spoiled by browsers which provide DOM , setTimeout / setInterval , and even a global object reference – none of which are necessarily required my an ECMAScript implementation ) we must rely upon the spice of ‘ larger ’ languages to help it gain some taste .
We can start by taking a look at some of the most popular languages that are available today : Python , Perl , PHP , Ruby , and Java — all of which have , at least , one embeddable JavaScript interpreter .
One thing is the same in all the interpreter implementations , as well , they all have the ability to introduce ( at least ) simple objects into interpreter ( from the parent language ) and extract values again .
Sometimes this may be as simple as executing a JavaScript function and getting its return value ( which is often translated from its internal JavaScript form back into the native language ) .
There ’s a couple points upon which I like to evaluate the embeddability of a JavaScript interpreter , specifically :
Object Translation :
If objects / values are passed to / from the interpreter to / from the native language – is that translation handled automatically ?
Simplicity : How hard is it to get up - and - running ?
( Is extra compilation required or is it written using native language code ? )
Bleed - through : Can JavaScript communicate to the base language or is it a one - way - street ?
The first point is the easiest one to find compatibility with – virtually all embeddable JavaScript interpreters do some form of object translation .
Some do it better ( like JE and Rhino ) but it generally should n’t be a problem for simple scripts .
PHP
» PHPJS
A flexible , pure - PHP , JavaScript interpreter that even accepts compiling to an intermediary bytecode .
There is no bleed - through but good object translation .
include " js.php " ; # Introduce a new JavaScript function , named print , # which calls a PHP function function show ( $msg ) { echo " $msg
" ; } $ jsi_vars [ " print " ] = " show " ; # Add in a new pure - JavaScript function which calls # our previously - introduced print function jsc : : compile ( " function alert ( msg ) { print ( ' Alert : ' + msg ) ; } " ) ; # Prints out ' Alert : text ' js_exec ( " alert ( ' text ' ) ; " ) ;
» J2P5 : Pure - PHP ECMAScript Engine
Probably the simplest of the available interpreters – there does n’t appear to be a clear way of communicating from JavaScript - to - PHP ( or vice versa ) .
Although , it is implemented in pure - PHP which allows for some nice cross-platform compatibility .
include “ js/js.php ” ;
The April S&P / Case - Shiller Home Price Indices are now out .
The index shows show annual declines in the prices of existing single family homes across the United States continued to worsen in April 2008 , with all 20 MSAs now posting annual declines , 13 of which are posting record low annual declines , and 10 of which are in double - digits .
The 10 - City Composite posted a new record low of - 16.3 % , and the 20 - City Composite recorded a record low of - 15.3 % .
All 20 MSAs are now showing declines with Charlotte , the last holdout during the 2007 / early 2008 period , now reporting an annual decline of 0.1 % .
Mish , it 's TC here and it's now been 2 months since I last provided you with a Case - Shiller update .
Here is the latest data based upon the today 's futures market and today 's Case - Shiller data release .
As you 've now seen in the media press releases , prices have continued lower and we 're now back to late 2003 / early 2004 prices in many areas .
What you may not hear in the media however is the pure dollar amounts of the losses ( e.g. $ 270 k in LA ) and that the futures market is increasingly making a bet that mid to late 2010 will mark the housing bottom .
This is in stark contrast to the bets of just 4 months ago when a bottom forecast for 2013 .
An interesting fact about this market timing change is that projected percentage decline has not changed .
In other words the futures market is pricing in an identical magnitude loss , but just for it to happen much faster .

If I handed you a book and asked whether it was in copyright or in the public domain , you 'd probably turn to the copyright page first .
Unfortunately , a copyright page can't answer that question definitively -- at best , it could tell you when the book in your hands was published , and who owned the rights to it at that time .
Ownership can change , though : rights revert back to authors , and after enough time has passed , the book enters into the public domain , letting people copy and adapt it as they wish .
So how much time is " enough " ?
It varies , often depending on the country , on when the book was published , and whether the author is living .
For U.S. books published between 1923 and 1963 , the rights holder needed to submit a form to the U.S. Copyright Office renewing the copyright 28 years after publication .
In most cases , books that were never renewed are now in the public domain .
Estimates of how many books were renewed vary , but everyone agrees that most books were n't renewed .
If true , that means that the majority of U.S. books published between 1923 and 1963 are freely usable .
How do you find out whether a book was renewed ?
You have to check the U.S. Copyright Office records .
Records from 1978 onward are online ( see http://www.copyright.gov/records ) but not downloadable in bulk .
The Copyright Office has n't digitized their earlier records , but Carnegie Mellon scanned them as part of their Universal Library Project , and the tireless folks at Project Gutenberg and the Distributed Proofreaders painstakingly corrected the OCR .
Thanks to the efforts of Google software engineer Jarkko Hietaniemi , we 've gathered the records from both sources , massaged them a bit for easier parsing , and combined them into a single XML file available for download here
There are undoubtedly errors in these records , but we believe this is the best and most comprehensive set of renewal records available today .
These records are free and in the public domain , and we hope you 're able to use them to determine the copyright status of books that interest you .
At Google , we 're committed to making as many books available online to users as possible while respecting copyright , and this is one example of that commitment .

My name is Addy and I'm a Flickrholic .
I 'm a window - licking voyeuse who 's been pressing her nose up against the cold glass of the lives of utter strangers , snooping through their photostreams .
And if you think I 'm weird , take a peep through their curtains .
Marvel at Polymorfo Perverso's rather delicious fetish portraits ( one caption reads " your neck is so much fun " ) or Gizmodo 's favorite tough man as meat - market mascot .
If you 're a Flickr snoopr like me , you know the giddy , naughty pleasure of it all .
If you 're not one , well , here 's how to become one in a hurry .
The beauty of Flickr is its serendipity .
I found Mr Perverso's oh - so - perverse materials by innocently typing " I love Jesus " into the search box .
Usually I 'm on the hunt for stuff at work such as " Treo unboxing , " " broken iPhone " or " computer dungeon , " which gets you some guy 's basement server farm , screenshots of PC - based RPGs , and , for some reason , a shot of a dude 's first computer , an Atari 800 .
But " dungeon " , all by itself , gets you into much more trouble : French châteaux , a shackles - and - rubber - gasmask outfit attached to a cross , a girl in stripy socks and a picture that is so NSFW I will only tell you that the person whose stream it is has a blog devoted to the art of the blow - job .
The crazy thing is that , unlike some photo sites , Flickr uploads are public and searchable .
Why are people so interested in sharing their most tender or outrageous or embarrassing moments with the world ?
My theory is that beyond friends - n- family photo sharing , many people on Flickr are amateur photographers and artists who want to show off what they can do , but beyond that there are the crazy cakes just dying to have themselves a bunch of virtual friends who will write a testimony like " April - May 's deep - throat technique just has to be seen to be believed . "
And what keeps me coming back is that it 's always changing .
A search from one day to the next can yield totally different results .

Here are some quick fun tag safaris to illustrate the point :
• Taxidermist
• Foshizzle
• Space Pants or , better still , Spacepants
• Repossession - Note the Jude Law cameo
• Disco Biscuit
• Junk In the Trunk
I get a tingly sensation looking into the private lives of random people .
Sure it 's mostly mundane stuff — weddings , parties , vacations — but on occasions you can get a sudden rush of tenderness mixed with guilt , like when stumbling on these secret stolen moments of a couple of strangers at Glasto .

There 's a knack to celebrity stalking on Flickr .
Direct searches turn up eclectic results .
Bill Gates brings up pictures of bananas , a subway escalator — even windows as opposed to Windows — before fielding a couple of shots of the actual software baron with Michael Arrington , with Steve and Walt , and , heh , with an iPhone .
There was nothing at all interesting for either Clooney or Madonna .
Hayden Panettiere turned up a few shots of the saved cheerleader licking things , if you 're into that sort of stuff .
Looking for particular celebs , it seems , is a waste of time ; you 've got to cast a wider net ( like using the actual word " celebrity " in a search " ) and just see which A - Listers ( or B - Listers or C - Listers ) get caught .
All of sleb life is here , from A ( niston ) to ( Jay - ) Z. Look !
It 's Tara Reid and Tommy Lee hanging out in a bar .
What they might lack in make - up they sure make up for in drunkenness .
Here 's a giant , beige John Goodman queuing up for some bar - b-que .
It 's Twisted Sister 's Dee Snyder actually looking cool , and Keanu Reeves actually looking irritated .
Kirk Hammet from Metallica seems to have taken the time and effort to have his shirt match the shopfront he was photographed outside of .
Here 's a great back - of - the - head shot of Paris Hilton and a wax model of Lady Di that I thought was a tranny lookalike .

You can actually play games with Flickr as well .
Rather than going on individual tag safaris like the ones above , you can embark on a sort of Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon :
How far can you get from one subject in six moves ?
I started off with Porkins , going via POTUS , Pewkus , Poker and Bummer before ending up back in Star Wars country ( sort of ) , at Clones .
I 've made some peculiar discoveries .
For one , Konaboy , whose Spring Clean picture cropped up in about 60 % of my searches , seems to be Flickr 's Kevin Bacon .
Another , Pisces Romance , showed me how to say " I wuv woo " with roses and sunsets .
Best of all ( especially Jesus ) , I found a recently - uploaded pic of — I 'm guessing here — the upcoming series of Flight of the Conchords .
It 's Brett and Jermaine in roller - disco mood .
Because , my little friends , on Flickr , it 's always Business Time .

SD CAMPAIGN ISSUES : 2008 CAMPAIGN ISSUES : 2008 Click on the titles to learn more about where the presidential candidates stand on the issues :
WAR IN IRAQ
The war in Iraq is the dominant issue in the 2008 race for the White House .
The early primary votes will be cast as the conflict completes its fifth year .
The next president will be the first to take the oath of office during an ongoing war since Richard Nixon in 1969 .
IMMIGRATION
Immigration is a highly divisive issue , as concerns about terrorism amplify the debate about border security .
Congress has failed to enact immigration legislation because of differences between supporters of tougher enforcement to limit illegal entry into the country and advocates of amnesty for illegal immigrants .
HEALTH CARE
Polls indicate that health care is one of the most important issues to voters heading into the 2008 presidential elections .
The rising cost of health insurance and the growing number of uninsured give the issue added urgency .
Several candidates have called for universal health care ; others have said these plans amount to socialized medicine .
EDUCATION
White House hopefuls are divided on the federal government 's role in education as Congress considers changes to President Bush 's signature schools law , the No Child Left Behind Act , and how to make college affordable .
ABORTION
In 1973 , the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion in the landmark case Roe v. Wade and the ruling has been the subject of heated political debate ever since .
Presidential candidates over the years have weighed in on a variety of abortion - related topics .
GAY CIVIL RIGHTS
The issue of civil rights for gay men and lesbians -- including the definition of marriage , service in the military and protection against hate crimes -- has long divided the two major political parties .
It 's not as simple as saying Democrats are for them , and Republicans are against them .

As McCain awaits , nominee will seek to unite Democrats Illinois Sen.
Barack Obama clinched the Democratic presidential nomination on the final day of an unprecedented primary season Tuesday , making history by prevailing over Hillary Rodham Clinton , the New York senator once seen as the inevitable nominee .
Obama , who will be the first person of color nominated for national office by a major party , focused largely on the general election against Republican John McCain at his victory rally late Tuesday in St. Paul .
OBAMA'S WORDS : Read the text of tonight 's speech POLITICS BLOG : Hear audio of Obama 's speech " Tonight , after 54 hard - fought contests , our primary season has finally come to an end , " Obama , 46 , said to a huge outpouring of cheers and chants at a jammed arena .
" Tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another — a journey that will bring a new and better day to America .
Tonight , I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for president of the United States . "
In New York , Clinton did n't concede the race to Obama or end her campaign , saying she would leave that decision to another day , but she did begin her speech by congratulating him and his supporters " on the extraordinary race he has run . "
She added , " It has been an honor to contest these primaries with him . "
Earlier in the day , she suggested for the first time that she was " open " to joining the ticket as his running mate .
Clinton told New York legislators that might be a way for Obama to win over Hispanics and other crucial Democratic voting blocs that have backed her , according to a key ally , Rep. Charles Rangel , D - N.Y .
Her comments injected one more twist into what already was an extraordinary day in American politics .
It included primaries in Montana and South Dakota , the final contests in a 16 - month Democratic battle that broke records for fundraising , drew more than 35 million voters to the polls and spotlighted the nation 's divisions of race , class and gender .
As Obama 's campaign tracked Tuesday 's results and unveiled a string of delegate endorsements that put the nomination in hand , he and his aides also were scrambling to deal with Clinton 's remarks and to take on his new role as the party 's presumptive nominee .
The day 's contests ended in another split decision .
Obama won Montana ; Clinton , South Dakota .
SIGHTS AND SOUNDS : Obama celebrates , Clinton waits
However , party leaders known as superdelegates , among them former president Jimmy Carter , already had lined up behind Obama and pushed him over the 2,118 delegate total needed to be nominated before the polls closed in the Mountain West , where a total of 31 delegates were at stake .
Even as Obama declared victory over Clinton , it was clear that his complicated and often contentious relationship with the former first lady was n't over .
Her remarks about the No. 2 position on the ticket put her and the millions of supporters who wanted her to become the nation 's first woman president at the top of the list of issues Obama must handle as the presumptive Democratic nominee .
Obama lavished praise on Clinton in his remarks .
Clinton 's tone was more reserved as she invited her supporters to weigh in on their views of what she should do next .
Still , she said , " I am committed to uniting our party . "
Obama 's other immediate concerns include a possible visit to U.S. troops in Iraq and the unveiling of a series of benchmark policy speeches as he launches his contest against McCain , the 71 - year - old Arizona senator who clinched his nomination three months ago .
Scott Reed , who managed Republican Bob Dole 's presidential campaign in 1996 , ticks off a list of those and other immediate demands for Obama 's attention .
" Other than that , " Reed jokes , " he 's got an easy summer . "
The general election begins Obama 's ebullient rally in St. Paul was reminiscent of the celebration , precisely five months earlier , that marked Obama 's sweep of the opening Iowa caucuses .
That win set his campaign soaring , only to be brought down to earth by a defeat in the New Hampshire primary and a furious delegate - by - delegate battle that followed .
Now , precisely five months from today , he will stand for election to become the nation 's 44th president before an electorate that is weary of the Iraq war , anxious about the economy , convinced the country has gotten on to the wrong track and paying record attention to the election debate .
Obama deliberately chose to celebrate at the Xcel Energy Center , where McCain is scheduled to be nominated at the Republican National Convention in September .
In a Tuesday evening speech in a New Orleans suburb , McCain repeatedly mocked Obama , portraying his Democratic rival as a " formidable " but flawed opponent .
" I have a few years on my opponent , so I am surprised that a young man has bought into so many failed ideas , " McCain said .
" Like others before him , he seems to think government is the answer to every problem . "
McCain distanced himself from President Bush and his own Republican Party .
" This is , indeed , a change election , " said McCain , who criticized Obama 's call for quickly withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq .
" No matter who wins this election , the direction of this country is going to change dramatically .
But , the choice is between the right change and the wrong change ; between going forward and going backward . "
Change was the word of the night .
McCain used versions of the word 33 times .
In his speech text , Obama used the word 16 times .
His new status as the presumptive Democratic nominee allows him to move full - throttle into the general election , something he could not do while he was still competing with Clinton .
Some steps are purely practical , such as putting his partisans in charge of key operations at the Democratic National Committee and the convention committee , which are both strapped for cash .
" He needs to get his arms around the national party apparatus and make sure the host committee in Denver has the resources to run a good convention , " Reed says .
Obama also needs to " fill out the substantive side " of his thinking on policy issues in meaty speeches between now and the convention , says Rand Beers , head of the National Security Network and national security adviser for Democratic nominee John Kerry in 2004 .
Among Obama 's other tasks : • Unify the party .
Perhaps most pressing , he must mend relations with Clinton and legions of women upset that she 's not the nominee .
Allida Black , a scholar on Eleanor Roosevelt and a Clinton surrogate , says she got calls through the night Monday and Tuesday from voters she had met on the trail , imploring Clinton to stay in the race .
Many were " enraged " when Father Michael Pfleger , speaking from the pulpit of Obama 's former church in Chicago , mocked Clinton as weeping because there was " a black man stealing my show . "
Black says some voters " feel that Hillary has been disparaged unfairly and that Sen. Obama has n't dealt with their concerns . "
Clinton 's remarks early Tuesday put her in the center of Obama 's vice presidential search .
" I think both of them really need each other , " Rangel says .
" It 's clear that most Democrats would want to see them together . "
On the other hand , the idea of an Obama - Clinton ticket could be undone by scars from their rivalry and the potential complications of having former president Bill Clinton as the vice president 's spouse .
Among other considerations :
Should he balance his age and experience , or reinforce his change message ?
" You could pick someone who is older and has gravitas , " says Matt Bennett , an adviser to Wesley Clark 's 2004 presidential campaign .
" Or you could pick someone young and dynamic . "
• Consider a trip to Iraq .
McCain has needled Obama about not having been to Iraq since 2006 and never having met with Gen. David Petraeus , the U.S. commander there .
Obama has weighed a return trip and may go now that the primary campaign is over .
Obama has made his opposition to the Iraq war a key part of his platform while McCain has tied his political fortunes to a victory in Iraq .
The trip would " add a credential " for Obama but might not be the best use of his limited time , Beers says .
The Kerry team debated the same question in 2004 .
" You can always learn something on the ground , although you really do have to make sure that you 're not entirely scripted " in what you can see , Beers says .
Still , " every day away " is a day the candidate can't campaign at home .
• Launch TV ads .
Obama may want to immediately counter McCain on the airwaves .
The Republican has spent $ 1.5 million over the past two months to air TV ads in key states , including Ohio , Michigan , Pennsylvania and West Virginia , according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group .
The spots aim to bolster his credibility on economic issues .
Stephanie Cutter , Kerry 's communications director in 2004 , says the Obama campaign 's deep pockets will make it easier for him to begin airing ads , too , both to introduce Obama in positive ways and to define McCain in negative ones .
Four years ago , Kerry 's reputation was tarnished and Bush 's burnished when the GOP candidate spent $ 10.5 million on ads in 16 states starting in March .
The campaign contributed to an impression of Kerry as a flip - flopper .
" You ca n't let that chipping away get any traction , " she says , because it comes back to hurt in the fall .
• Reach out to key voters .
Outreach to certain groups of voters will be a key focus .
Throughout the primaries , Clinton did much better than Obama with Hispanics and white women .
In Appalachia and the Rust Belt , she prevailed with white voters who do n't have a college education .
Curtis Gans , director of the Center for the Study of the American Electorate , says Obama was doing fine with those white working - class voters in contests in Wisconsin , Missouri , Virginia and Maryland .
When Obama made remarks about voters who are " bitter " about their economic situations and " cling " to religion and guns , however , Clinton " magnified " it into a race - class issue , Gans says .
" There 's a lot of repair that needs to be done there , but there is a shot , " he says .
" We 're talking essentially about Reagan Democrats .
They went the other way ( in past elections ) because of cultural issues . …
But they were always Democratic on economic issues and my guess is the economic issues are going to take precedence this year . "
• Deal with race .
As the son of a white mother and a black Kenyan father , Obama has no choice but to deal with the issue of race , strategists says .
For some voters , black and white , his breakthrough candidacy will be an asset .
In serendipitous timing , Obama will deliver his acceptance speech at the national convention on Aug. 28 , which happens to be the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King 's " I Have a Dream " speech on the Washington Mall .
However , he 'll also need to make his case to voters who are wary about supporting a black candidate , says Steve Jarding , a veteran Democratic consultant who teaches campaign management at Harvard 's Kennedy School .
" He 's got to show that at any level , if people are hurting , that hurt is colorblind , " Jarding says .
He says Obama 's message needs to be : " ' This race is bigger than that .
You need help and I will deliver it .
John McCain will not . ' " House Majority Whip James Clyburn , the highest - ranking African - American in Congress , endorsed Obama Tuesday .
The South Carolina Democrat told reporters he had talked to Obama after the Pennsylvania primary about how he could win more white , working - class voters .
" I said to him then , ' You have got to share with the voters your life story ; you have not talked enough about those things you had to overcome to get to where you are , ' " Clyburn says .
" Talk about being raised by a single parent .
Talk about a mother who was once on food stamps .
Talk about being handed off to your grandparents because your mother was not able to do for you what needed to be done for you .
…
" We have spent so much time talking about Sen . Obama the first African - American chair of the Harvard Law Review , " Clyburn adds .
" We have not spent enough time talking about the ordinary person raised by some extraordinary grandparents and a mother who made some significant sacrifices on his behalf . "
A ' sweet and sour ' ending " We 've got a sweet - and - sour ending , " Lawrence Jacobs , a political scientist at the University of Minnesota , says of Obama 's big night .
" He 's been able to hold off one of the most impressive political dynasties in modern American history .
On the other hand … he 's clearly been deflated " by the fierce primary campaign .
Frank Donatelli , a McCain ally installed at the Republican National Committee , says the Arizona senator starts with disadvantages that include " a very soft economy , " an unpopular war and " an incredible percentage " of people who think the country is headed in the wrong direction .
" And yet , despite all that , McCain runs roughly even with the presumptive Democratic nomination , " he notes .
Obama led McCain by a narrow 47 % - 44 % among registered voters in the new USA TODAY survey .
Donatelli says McCain and the GOP will " not let Obama talk about lofty platitudes , " but will try to pin him down on specifics in hopes of tagging him as " very liberal .
That gives McCain the opening to put together a center - right coalition . "
Some Democrats see that as wishful thinking .
" Americans are hungry for change , and we 've got a change candidate running against a more - of - the - same candidate , " Bennett says .
" We are about to nominate a young , incredibly charismatic African - American .
That is going to put a lot of wind at his back . "

CAIRO - Al Qaeda's No. 2 leader issued an audiotape yesterday accusing Iran of trying to discredit the power of the terrorist network by spreading a conspiracy theory about who carried out the Sept. 11 attacks .
Ayman al - Zawahri , Osama bin Laden 's deputy , has boosted his denunciations of Shi'ite Iran in part to depict Sunni Al Qaeda as the Arabs ' top defense against the Persian nation 's rising power in the Middle East .
The increasing enmity toward Iran is a notable change of rhetoric from Zawahri , who had previously rarely mentioned the country - apparently in hopes he would be able to forge some sort of understanding with Tehran based on their common rivalry with the United States .
Iran has long sought to distance itself from Al Qaeda .
" Al - Zawahri wanted to work with Iran , but he 's deeply disappointed that Iran has not cooperated with Al Qaeda , " said Rohan Gunaratna , a terrorism analyst and author of " Inside Al Qaeda : The Global Network of Terror . "
Now Zawahri " wants to appeal to the anti-Shi'ite , anti-Iran sentiments in the Arab and Muslim world , " said Gunaratna , head of the International Center for Political Violence and Terrorism Research in Singapore .
Zawahri appeared intent on exploiting widespread worry in the Arab world over Iran 's influence , particularly in Iraq .
He also sought to denigrate Iran 's ally Hezbollah , which has gained some popularity even among Sunnis in the region for its fight against Israel .
Zawahri's comments came in a two - hour audio posted on an Islamic militant website , the second message in weeks in which he answered hundreds of questions sent to the site by Al Qaeda sympathizers and others .
The question - and - answer campaign is a sign of the terrorist group 's sophistication in its use of the Web .
It shows Al Qaeda can post frequent messages from its leaders while keeping in touch with its base - even though the leaders are in hiding , presumably on the Afghan - Pakistan frontier .
The Web is a key tool of Al Qaeda 's central leadership to inspire and direct sympathizers , although some terrorism analysts question how much control they have over Islamic militants .
Al Qaeda branches in Iraq and Afghanistan are believed to have close ties with the network 's core , but little is known about its level of control elsewhere .
The authenticity of the audio could not be independently confirmed .
But the voice sounded like past audios from Zawahri .
Zawahri spoke on a wide range of topics in yesterday 's message .
He told a female questioner there were no women in the ranks of Al Qaeda but praised wives of mujahideen for their " heroic role in taking care of their homes and children amid the trials of exile . "
Female suicide bombers have carried out attacks in Iraq , some of them believed to be by Al Qaeda 's branch in the country .
Zawahri appeared to mean no women were among the network 's core leadership .

For trading the usage , the dedicated servers are very proficient as they can understand and tackle the massive traffic flow .
The dedicated domain hosting server services can make the companies aware of the intricacies of the process .
Now that new businesses are trying to build up customers in the online channels , they have understood the requirement of having a proper understanding of the dedicated servers .

Only then selecting and purchasing them will not be a hard task for them .
The hosting solution services provide consultations on these matters as well as control the websites as and when specified by the clients .

3 accused of using Humble corpse 's head to smoke pot 3 accused of using corpse head to smoke pot
Photo : Handout Matthew Gonzalez , left , and Kevin Jones have been charged with the ...
The Kingwood teenager 's story of decapitating a corpse and using the head to smoke marijuana was so outlandish that at first Houston Police Department senior police officer Jim Adkins did not believe it .
Yet , Kevin Wade Jones Jr. , 17 , appeared almost indifferent as he relayed the bizarre description of his and two friends ' activities at an Humble area graveyard , Adkins said .
" I just doubted it because it 's very morbid , and I could n't see anybody doing something like this , " Adkins said Thursday .
Not until police went to the home of another Kingwood 17 - year - old , Matthew Richard Gonzalez , did the officer believe the tale .
" He regurgitated in his plate of food when I asked him about it , " Adkins said .
" So I knew there was some truth to the story . "
Now , Jones , Gonzalez and a juvenile whose name has not been released are each charged with abuse of a corpse , a misdemeanor .
All three were arrested Wednesday night .
Police said a fourth suspect is wanted for questioning .
Houston police believe the teens disturbed the grave of an 11 - year - old boy who died in 1921 .
The child was buried at an unmarked cemetery believed to be reserved for black veterans and their families , Adkins said .
Under the law , a person can be charged with abuse of a corpse simply by vandalizing , damaging or treating a gravesite offensively — even if the human remains buried there are not touched , Adkins said .
The child 's skull has not been found .
If recovered later , however , such a discovery will not change the charges filed against the three suspects , Adkins said .
The teens first came to police 's attention during a vehicle burglary investigation .
While being questioned , Jones told of desecrating the gravesite a month or two ago .
Adkins said he believes the tale was intended to distract police from the vehicle break - in .
Jones claimed he and his friends used shovels to dig up the body and removed the corpse 's head with a garden tool , Adkins said .
Jones also revealed he and the other two boys took the severed head to the juvenile 's home , where they used the skull as a " bong " to smoke marijuana , the officer said .
Police made three trips to the heavily wooded , snake - infested graveyard near the Eastex Freeway feeder road and FM 1960 before finding the disturbed grave several days ago .
" The grave was uncovered , and the headstone had been thrown off the grave and broken , " Adkins said .
Because the grave is flooded with murky water from recent heavy rains , police have been unable to determine if the child 's casket is still in the ground .
All three teens gave written and verbal confessions admitting they tried to dig up a body over a two - day period , Adkins said .
But the boys told conflicting stories about whether they actually severed the head — so police are n't sure if that gruesome detail really happened .
Even so , HPD is working closely with Humble police to try and find any surviving relatives of the child whose grave was disturbed .
According to court papers , the grave belonged to Willie Simms .
" The ultimate goal will be to put this body back to rest , " Adkins said .
Little is known about the graveyard .
The Humble Bicentennial Museum could not confirm that it was reserved for black veterans , but Adkins said he observed " many , many headstones " for black soldiers killed during World War I and World War II .
The three boys , all home - schooled , have also been charged in connection with the vehicle break - in .
Jones and the juvenile are charged with credit card abuse , while Gonzalez pleaded guilty to a charge of misdemeanor theft between $ 50 and $ 500 .

The stark truth about managing our money these days is that we are mostly on our own .
Few employers want us around for 40 years , so our income is likely to have ups and downs and disappear altogether for brief periods between jobs .
Saving for retirement is now mostly our responsibility , too .
Health insurance , for those of us who have it and manage to keep it , requires increasingly large amounts of money out of our pockets .
The list goes on and on .
At the same time , all sorts of individuals and institutions have smelled opportunity and lined up to peddle their wares , resulting in an explosion of credit cards , bank products and advisers of various stripes .
Some of this is helpful because competition has led to lower costs .
But in other instances  say , newfangled adjustable - rate mortgages  the result has been painful .
Complicating all of this is the housing downturn , which has affected the largest asset in many portfolios .
Rising fuel and food prices along with tougher loan standards do not help .
Given the stakes , it is hard to avoid the persistent low - grade fear that we have made wrong choices or cannot find the right ones , even though they are out there somewhere .
" J : The British do not think that the U.S. is their ' colony / state to use and abuse at their whims . '
The key divisions here are less between states , than within them .
The problem is that the neocons have gained ascendancy both in your country and mine .
In both , there is a very visible reaction against this .
In Britain this has probably had less effect than in the U.S. at the level of high politics -- probably more at the mass level .
Tony Blair really is a neocon -- so are influential figures around the Tory leader David Cameron .
As for what used to be the conservative press : I go the Times website , and find Irwin Stelzer -- author of " The Neocon Reader " .
I go to the Telegraph website , and find Irwin Stelzer .
I open the Spectator , supposed to be the Tory ideas magazine .
Who do I find -- Irwin Stelzer !
As to Sir John Scarlett , there is an irony here -- in that he was case officer for Oleg Gordievsky , who was a double agent working for us , rather than the Russians .
This was the reverse of the situation depicted in Le Carré 's novel , where the ' bureaucratic whore ' Percy Alleline is persuaded that the Russian spook who Bill Haydon runs is our double agent , while in fact Haydon is theirs .
But the evidence produced by the Hutton Inquiry made clear that Scarlett is a ' bureaucratic whore ' -- although perhaps ' corrupt courtier ' would be a more appropriate term .
As chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee -- supposed to apply a filter of critical analysis to material produced by the agencies -- Scarlett played a key role in the dissemination of the intelligence which suggested , quite incorrectly as it turned out , that Saddam had WMD he could launch at 45 - minutes notice , and had sought uranium from Niger .
In so doing , he played a played a significant role in getting both you and us into a disastrous war .
That he should be colluding with elements in Israeli intelligence -- and doubtless , elements in the U.S. -- in what appear to be moves to soften public opinion up for another disastrous war is hardly surprising .
Unfortunately there is a lot of evidence that the rot at MI6 goes a lot deeper -- as also the rot in British journalism .
When Scarlett was appointed as head of MI6 , the Observer journalist David Rose defended him against the suggestion that his role in the Iraq intelligence fiascos disqualified him for the job .
Explaining why his colleagues had come round to think Scarlett the best man , Rose wrote : " What has changed ?
The biggest factor is the evidence to Lord Hutton , which suggests that if Scarlett did cross the politico - intelligence frontier , then others were also culpable - none more so than the current C , Sir Richard Dearlove .
On 12 September 2002 , in response to a last , desperate call for new content for the dossier , it was Dearlove who went to see Blair at Downing Street , bearing the false and fateful claim that Iraq could deploy its WMD within 45 minutes .
" At the time , there had been no attempt to assess this report by passing it to the JIC 's intelligence analysts , nor to the acknowledged WMD experts at the Defence Intelligence Staff - including David Kelly .
Supplying raw intelligence to a Prime Minister ' is just never done , ' one official says .
' It 's rule number one .
Dearlove was undermining Scarlett 's position - and it's just not fair that Scarlett alone should be blamed . '
" Moreover , the final dossier was ' signed off ' by all the members of Scarlett 's committee , Dearlove included , who had the support of all his most senior colleagues - some of them eventual rivals for Scarlett 's new job .
As for the Butler report , it will deal with methods , not individuals .
If it did , all four men who were candidates to be the next ' C ' might have been criticised . " ( see http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/may/09/davidkelly.uk.)
So it seems that even if an incoming prime minister had actually wanted to appoint a head of MI6 who would tell him the truth , rather than what he wanted to hear , he could not have found one within the organisation .
But apparently this does not worry David Rose one bit -- which is hardly reassuring , particularly as he writes for the independent Guardian group , not the Times or Telegraph .
Not long after retirement , incidentally , Dearlove signed the Declaration of Principles of a new organisation called The Henry Jackson Society , which champions the agenda for ' global democratic revolution ' beloved of the neocons , and involves both leading American neocons and their British fellow - travellers .
I suppose if one has an intelligence chief who is happy to associate himself with the memory of ' Scoop ' Jackson , whose record at threat inflation and the politicisation of intelligence is almost unrivalled , one should not be surprised that one ends up with a dysfunctional intelligence organisation .

Gene therapy is the addition of new genes to a patient 's cells to replace missing or malfunctioning genes .
Researchers typically do this using a virus to carry the genetic cargo into cells , because that ’s what viruses evolved to do with their own genetic material .
The treatment , which was first tested in humans in 1990 , can be performed inside or outside of the body .
When it ’s done inside the body , doctors may inject the virus carrying the gene in question directly into the part of the body that has defective cells .
This is useful when only certain populations of cells need to be “ fixed . ”
For example , researchers are using it to try to treat Parkinson 's disease , because only part of the brain must be targeted .
This approach is also being used to treat eye diseases and hemophilia , an inherited disease that leads to a high risk for excess bleeding , even from minor cuts .
Early in - the - body gene therapies used a virus called adenovirus — the virus behind the common cold — but the agent can cause an immune response from the body , putting a patient at risk of further illness .
Today , researchers use a virus called adeno - associated virus , which is not known to cause any disease in humans .
In nature , this agent needs to hitch a ride with an adenovirus , because it lacks the genes required to spread itself on its own .
To produce an adeno - associated virus that can carry a therapeutic gene and live on its own , researchers add innocuous DNA from adenovirus during preparation .
In - the - body gene therapies often take advantage of the natural tendency of viruses to infect certain organs .
Adeno - associated virus , for example , goes straight for the liver when it is injected into the bloodstream .
Because blood - clotting factors can be added to the blood in the liver , this virus is used in gene therapies to treat hemophilia .
In out - of - the - body gene therapy , researchers take blood or bone marrow from a patient and separate out immature cells .
They then add a gene to those cells and inject them into the bloodstream of the patient ; the cells travel to the bone marrow , mature and multiply rapidly , eventually replacing all of the defective cells .
Doctors are working on the ability to do out - of - the - body gene therapy to replace all of a patient 's bone marrow or the entire blood system , as would be useful in sickle - cell anemia — in which red blood cells are shaped like crescents , causing them to block the flow of blood .
Out - of - the - body gene therapy has already been used to treat severe combined immunodeficiency — also referred to as SCID or boy - in - the - bubble syndrome — where patients are unable to fight infection and die in childhood .
In this type of gene therapy , scientists use retroviruses , of which HIV is an example .
These agents are extremely good at inserting their genes into the DNA of host cells .
More than 30 patients have been treated for SCID , and more than 90 percent of those children have been cured of their disorder — an improvement over the 50 percent chance of recovery offered by bone marrow transplants .
A risk involved with retroviruses is that they may stitch their gene anywhere into DNA , disrupting other genes and causing leukemia .
Unfortunately , five of the 30 children treated for SCID have experienced this complication ; four of those five , however , have beaten the cancer .
Researchers are now designing delivery systems that will carry a much lower risk of causing this condition .
Although there are currently no gene therapy products on the market in the U.S. , recent studies in both Parkinson 's disease and Leber congenital amaurosis , a rare form of blindness , have returned very promising results .
If these results are borne out , there could be literally hundreds of diseases treated with this approach .

But now in Iraq , the Army has quietly decided to try going it alone for the important surveillance mission , organizing an all - Army surveillance unit that represents a new move by the service toward self - sufficiency , and away from joint operations .
Senior aides to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates say that he has shown keen interest in the Army initiative  much to the frustration of embattled Air Force leaders  as a potential way to improve battlefield surveillance .
The work of the new aviation battalion was initially kept secret , but Army officials involved in its planning say it has been exceptionally active , using remotely piloted surveillance aircraft to call in Apache helicopter strikes with missiles and heavy machine gun fire that have killed more than 3,000 adversaries in the last year and led to the capture of almost 150 insurgent leaders .
The Army aviation task force became fully operational last July with headquarters at Camp Speicher , in the north - central city of Tikrit , and focuses its efforts on insurgents planting roadside bombs .
But it also has located and attacked insurgents in battles with American and Iraqi troops , and has supported missions of the top- secret Special Operations units assigned to capture or kill the most high - value targets in Iraq .
The battalion is called Task Force Odin  the name is that of the chief god of Norse mythology , but it also is an acronym for “ observe , detect , identify and neutralize . ”
The task force of about 300 people and 25 aircraft is a Rube Goldberg collection of surveillance and communications and attack systems , a mash - up of manned and remotely piloted vehicles , commercial aircraft with high - tech infrared sensors strapped to the fuselage , along with attack helicopters and infantry .
From Conservapedia
Gender differences between men and women have been described throughout history .
Not only are our physical bodies different , but there are significant character differences as well .
This makes sense , because God made men and women " in his image " ( Genesis 1:27 ) so as to reflect his divine nature .
( Romans 1:20 )
Many languages have adjectives to describe attributes thought of as characteristic to men ( " masculine " ) or women ( " feminine " ) .
Modern feminists refuse to accept the innate differences as an explanation for the underrepresentation of women academics in math and science .
“ The feminists ' longtime , self - proclaimed goal is an androgynous society .
Repudiating constitutional intent , history , tradition and human nature , they seek to forbid us , in public or private life , to recognize the differences between men and women .
-- The Phyllis Schlafly Report , December 1996 ”
Although there are social variations apparent in different nations and times in history , broadly speaking it is possible to list traits which define masculinity and femininity .
La Griffe du Lion writes :
Men and women exhibit other behavioral differences which are apparent almost from birth .
To some extent they mirror sex - differentiated behavior in animals .
Boys are more aggressive , girls more nurturing .
Female babies react more to facial expressions , males to moving objects .
By adolescence these behaviors have morphed into girls ' interest in social relationships , and boys ' interest in machines and devices .
Obviously , such divergence of interests influences career choices .
Girls lean more toward fields like psychology , while similarly talented men incline toward engineering or physical science . [ 1 ]
" ... the possible social consequences of male / female genetic differences are a legitimate subject of scholarly research into gene / environment interactions . " [ 1 ]
Yet he view that masculinity and femininity are inherent ( God - given ) traits is disputed by feminists and some other social activists ( see Homosexual agenda ) .
Feminists have often claimed that gender differences are not innate , let alone God -given .
They do this to bolster their argument that men and women should be treated the same in society regardless of differences .
And yet this is not always the case , especially when it favors women .
For instance studies that show that men have more violent impulses than women are taken at face value .
The problem with the feminist view ( or agenda ) is that it assumes the truth of its own dogma .
It simply asserts that gender differences are a social construct , but without supplying any proof of this .
Worse , they refuse to consider any evidence in favor of innate differences .
And so when it has been shown that there are gender differences in toy selection from the earliest ages of development , this is still somehow placed under subtle societal differences instead of innate makeup .
Indeed , even male monkeys have shown the same quality . [ 2 ]
Liberals support the feminist viewpoint that people are all the same , while also supporting the viewpoint that people are merely highly evolved animals .
Yet gender differences among animals ( particularly those " lower " than primates ) are so striking that many species have distinct words for male and female : rooster and hen , stallion and mare , for example .
Cattle are so differentiated that in English there is no singular term : we must say bull or cow .
In a well known example of honesty in the acknowledgment of gender differences in 2006 , the President Lawrence Summers of Harvard University suggested ( in a private meeting ) that the lopsided proportion might not be due to prejudice or discrimination , but a simple factor such as personal inclination or aptitude .
Unfortunately , as such an admission is frowned upon by feminists and liberals , he was forced to recant his remarks . [ 3 ]
Denial of gender differences is part of the justification for the liberal position on issues including :
Homosexuality - Some homosexual activists assert that if men and women are equivalent , then man-woman and man-man unions are likewise equally valid relationships .
However , Christian egalitarians ( such as the Council for Biblical Equality ) maintain that it is possible to believe in full gender equality while still condemning homosexuality as immoral .
Equality does not necessarily imply interchangeability ( see Complementarity without hierarchy ) .
Women in combat
Education -
For men and women to ever be educated differently or separately would be considered discriminatory .
Employment - Women who refuse to undergo higher education and establish a career before having a family are considered by feminists to be victims of male domination .
Transgenderism -
To liberals all genders are one , even to the point that some advocate mixed - gender washrooms and changing rooms .
( Note , however , that unisex facilities of this type are also sometimes built for other reasons , such as to save the developer the expense of building two restrooms at the expense of gender privacy . )
Detectives said they found half - naked young women on board
An alleged mobile brothel in the US state of Florida has taken its last ride following a police sting .
Undercover detectives in Miami Beach allegedly paid a $ 40 entry fee to board the vehicle and found women offering sex acts and lap dances for money .
Six people , including the driver of the stretch limousine bus , were detained .
They face a range of charges , including transportation for the purpose of prostitution and conducting business without a licence .
The sleek black bus had allegedly been cruising the South Beach neighbourhood , popular among tourists and clubbers .
When they boarded on Sunday , detectives said they found a fully - stocked bar and several young women who stripped down to reveal G - strings stuffed with cash .
A sad pathetic excuse for a male ; not necessarily of Italian descent , but most likely ; usually native to the New York / New Jersey Tri-State area WARDROBE : tight zipper shirts , tracksuits , designer jeans , fuzzy kangol hats , tiny hoop earrings , fake gold chains , and related Euro - trash garb and tacky cheese - wear .
NATURAL HABITAT : Known to frequent Tri-State area malls looking for club gear to waste their week 's pay on ( most likely spotted shopping at " Bang Bang " in Staten Island ) .
During the day when not at their food delivery , telemarketting , or construction job , can be located at their local gym tanning or lifting weights .
Can be found nightly at mainstream danceclubs they read about online ( SF , Webster Hall , Etc. ) .
Most notable for cruising the Jersey shore in an old car ( Honda , Mustang , etc. ) which has been tinted , painted and sports $ 1,000 - $ 3,000 rims in a feeble attempt to look like new .
Guido cars usually have a boomin ' system through which cheesy music like freestyle , commercial club / trance and hip - hop ( anything KTU plays ) is loudly blasted .
GENETIC LINKS : Directly related to modern day urban - guidos , A.K.A. " wiggers , " A.K.A. " wegros ; " urban - guidos are white males who once exhibited the traits referenced above , but have now instead opted to keep it unreal , with wardrobes consisting of clothes from labels like FUBU and Rocawear which they bought on sale at Macy's .
These individuals still listen to the same music and drive the same type of car as their predecessor ; it is usually just their choice of attire and use of slang and poor speech skills that differentiate them from the classic guido .
Most guidos are distrusting of non-whites despite the fact some of their attire and music can be traced to non-white origins .
PASSTIMES / RECREATIONAL
ACTIVITIES : Guidos enjoy beating up a non-white or homosexual while assisted by a group of 5 - 10 guido friends backing them up ; engaging in date rape ; and displaying their lack of rhythm by dancing poorly in the middle of a club 's dance floor while non -guidos look on in disbelief .
いろんな人 にFPGAで遊んで欲しいのですが、初心者にはFPGAボードを買うところに大きな障壁があります。
私なりに初心者が忘れがちなところをまとめてみました。FPGA業界は、Altera社とXilinx社が大きなシェアを持っており、最初の一歩はこの2社から選ぶことになります。他社のFPGAは、Web、書籍とも情報が激減するのでお勧めしません。
開発用のPCは普通にWindowsXP/2000がお勧めです。Linuxでの開発も可能なのですが、不具合が発生したときの情報が代理店レベルでも少なく、初心者が自力で解決するのも難しいです。あとで紹介しますが、Veritakという非常に便利なシミュレータがあるので、初心者の最初の一歩はWindows上でVerilog-HDLを使うことをお勧めします。
開発環境 合成ツール FPGA で 何かをする場合、ボードとは別 にVerilog / VHDLの開発環境が必要です。プログラミング言語のコンパイラに相当する物です。正規で購入すると10万以上するのですが、AlteraはWebEditoin、XilinxはWebPackという無料で使える開発環境があります。 初心者がFPGAボードを買うときに真っ先に確認しないといけないのが、ボードに実装されているFPGAが無料の開発ツールで開発できるかどうかです。両社とも無料で開発できるデバイスは、一部のローエンド製品だけです。
対応デバイスは以下のURLで確認できますが、年々開発対象が広がっているので、購入前に最新情報を確認しましょう。
http://www.altera.co.jp/products/software/products/quartus2web/sof-quarwebmain.html
http://japan.xilinx.com/ise/products/webpack_config.htm
シミュレー タ FPGA の開発では実際のボードの上で回路を動かす前に、パソコン上でシミューレーションを行います。FPGAのシミュレータの定番はModelSimです。機能制限はありますが、無料で使えるAltera Edition 、Xilinx Editionが使えるので、最初はそれを使いましょう。
行数制限や速度面で問題を感じたときは、Veritak-Basicがあれば便利です。ソースをちょっと変えて回路の動きをみるような開発には、Veritakの方が使いやすいです。ModelSim始めプロが使うシミュレータは、普通に買うと数百万円の世界なので、この価格帯でVerilogシミュレータが購入できることは素晴らしいことです。
http://www.vector.co.jp/soft/winnt/edu/se412183.html
Veritakは仕事でも趣味でも使っていますが、全く問題無く快適に使えています。Veritakは基本的にはVerilogのシミュレータなので、VHDLの開発には向いていません。VHDLにはVeritakに相当する物はありません。フリーのシミュレータとしてiverilog等がありますが、上手く動かないときにiverilog側に問題があることもあり、初心者には茨の道でしょう。
特にこだわりがなければ、Windows上でVerilogを使って開発しましょう。
CPU開発環境 FPGA の事を調べていくと、FPGAの開発環境としてCPUが提供され、FPGAの中で動く事が分かると思います。AlteraならNiosII、XilinxならPowerPC、MicroBlazeです。Linuxも動いていて非常に魅力的に感じますが、Altera、Xilinx社とも無料の開発環境では、これらのCPUを使った開発が出来ません。（自作CPUなら好きに開発できます。）
Alteraの場合は、正規版の開発環境があればNiosIIの開発環境が使えます。また、NiosII開発キットを買うと一年間は開発環境が使えます。NiosIIのみのライセンスを買うことも出来ます。
Xilinxの場合はEDKという開発ツールが別途必要です。
Altera、Xilinxが提供しているCPU開発環境は、基本的に別途お金が必要だと思ってください。また、FPGAの中でCPUを動かす難易度は尋常ではないので、初心者にはまず無理だと言い切っておきます。
電源 AC100V のコンセントにケーブルを差せば、そのまま動くボードを選びましょう。ボードの説明書に、ACケーブルが付属しているか、海外製の物であれば日本で使えるかの確認を忘れずにしてください。プロ用のボードでは、デフォルトで「電源ケーブルは無し」です。付属品に電源ケーブルと明記してある場合のみ付いてきます。秋葉原で電源を買ってきてケーブルを自作すればよいのですが、何かあったときに危険です。ブレーカが落ちるくらいならよいのですが、感電や火災にもつながります。素直にACケーブル付属のボードを買いましょう。 ちなみにPCIカードタイプのFPGAボードは、一般的にマザーボードから電源を供給するので電源ケーブルは不要です。ただし、100％そうだとは限らないので、忘れずに確認してください。グラボと同様に、消費電力の問題で別途電源供給が必要なボードも存在します。
ダウンロードケーブ ル FPGA で作った回路を動かすには、パソコンからFPGAへデータをダウンロードする必要があります。この時に使うケーブルをダウンロードケーブルと呼びます。FPGAの開発には必須なのですが、仕事でFPGAを使っているところは何本もダウンロードケーブルを持っているので、普通にFPGAボードを買うとダウンロードケーブルはついてきません。初心者がFPGAボードを買う場合は、ダウンロードケーブル付属品を買いましょう。
ダウンロードケーブルくらい自作しろと言う人もいますが、今のUSB対応のケーブルと同じ物を作るのはまず無理です。単体で正規品のケーブルを買うと1万円を超えてしまいますので、ダウンロードケーブル付属のボードを選びましょう。
入出力 このあたりから優先順位が下がってきます。何をしたいかにもよるのですが、例えばゲーム機を作ってみたいとなると、最初からボード上にVGAのインターフェイスが載っている方が楽です。LANで何かしたいなら、LANのPortが無いと困ります。
FPGAにコネクタを追加してパックマン動かしたり、電子工作で液晶をつないだりしている人たちがいますが、彼らは全員プロです。初心者は、背伸びせずにボードに最初から搭載されているインターフェイスを動かしましょう。ボードの改造は、FPGAで何ができて、何ができないかが分かってからでも遅くないです。
メモリ これは優先順位が低いですが、心の片隅に覚えておいてください。 ある程度大きな回路を作ろうとすると外付けのメモリが必要になってきます。現在、評価ボードの主力メモリはDDRもしくはDDR2です。これらのメモリは初心者が手に負える物ではないです。正規版の開発環境があれば、メモリコントローラもAltera、Xilinxが提供している物が使えるのですが、無料の開発環境ではメモリを読み書きする回路を自力で作らないといけません。DDRコントローラを自力で作れるなら、その時点で初心者は脱出しているので何も言うことはありません。
私のお勧めは、DDRではないSDRAMが搭載されているボードです。DDRに比べると、制御が簡単、最低周波数が無い、クロック系統が少ないと良い事ばかりです。この意味は分からないと思いますが、DDRとSDRAMのボードで悩んだら、まよわずSDRAM搭載のボードを選びましょう。
お勧めボー ド DesignWave等に付いてくるFPGAボードは、価格帯は安いのですが、基本的に電子工作できる人向けなので除外します。電源やケーブルを用意しないと動きません。おまけの基板に加えて、何が必要かが判断できない人は手を出さない方がよいです。
Spartan3 開発キッ ト

http://japan.xilinx.com/products/devkits/HW-SPAR3A-SK-UNI-G.htm
http://japan.xilinx.com/products/devkits/HW-SPAR3AN-SK-UNI-G.htm
全てダウンロードケーブル、電源ケーブル付きの優れもの。
ボード毎に微妙にI/Fが違うので、価格との兼ね合いで選びましょう。とりあえず始めるなら、一番安いSpartan-3 スタータキットがお勧めです。VGAが8色なのでもっと色が欲しい人は、Spartan-3A
FPGA 、Spartan -3AN
スタータキットにしましょう。こちらは4096色です。
CycloneIII開発キッ ト
http://www.altera.co.jp/products/devkits/altera/kit-cyc3-starter.html
こちらも、ダウンロードケーブル、電源ケーブル付きです。$199でVGA無しです。Spartan3 kitに比べると若干高いです。Altera派はこのボードをお勧めします。
http://www.altera.co.jp/products/devkits/altera/kit-cyc3-embedded.htmlは、そのボードに拡張ボードとNiosライセンスが付属したバージョンです。Alteraで行こうの人が買ってますね。
Nios Development Board , Cyclone Edition 公式サイトから消えている。
私が持っている虎の子のFPGAボードです。
パラレルですがダウンロードケーブル付き、ACケーブル付き。何気にSDRAM搭載の優れもの。
購入した状態で長門 のBrainfuckが動きます。 市場には大量に出ているはずです。研究室等に転がっていれば確保しておきましょう。
DE2 開発 & エデュケーション・ボード 実物を見たことがないので、あくまで参考に 。
http://www.altera.co.jp/education/univ/materials/boards/unv-de2-board.html
AC電源の問題さえクリアーできるのであれば、スペック的には素晴らしい物があります。
LAN、VIDEOの入出力だけでなく、SDカード、キーボード、マウスが接続できます。何気にメモリがSDRAMなのも、中の人はちゃんと分かってますね。
学生の方は安く買えるので、興味を持たれたらチェックしてみてください。

Science reporter , BBC News
The Chinese earthquake on 12 May killed tens of thousands of people Nasa scientists have said they could be on the verge of a breakthrough in their efforts to forecast earthquakes .
Researchers say they have found a close link between electrical disturbances on the edge of our atmosphere and impending quakes on the ground below .
Just such a signal was spotted in the days leading up to the recent devastating event in China .
They have teamed up with experts in the UK to investigate a possible space - based early warning system .
Many in the scientific community remain deeply sceptical about whether such signals are indeed indicators of an approaching earthquake .
But Minoru Freund , a physicist and director for advanced aerospace materials and devices at Nasa 's Ames Research Center in California , told BBC News : " I do believe that we will be able to establish a clear correlation between certain earthquakes and certain pre-earthquake signals , in an unbiased way . "
The evidence suggests we 're now crossing the boundary in terms of technology readiness
Stuart Eves , SSTL
He added : " I am cautiously optimistic that we have good scientific data , and we are designing a series of experiments to verify our data . "
Despite years of searching for earthquake precursors , there is currently no method to reliably predict the time of a future earthquake .
Yet , most scientists agree that some form of early warning system could save tens of thousands of lives .
The ionosphere is distinguished from other layers of Earth 's atmosphere because it is electrically charged through exposure to solar radiation .
On a significant number of occasions , satellites have picked up disturbances in this part of the atmosphere 100 - 600 km above areas that have later been hit by earthquakes .
One of the most important of these is a fluctuation in the density of electrons and other electrically - charged particles in the ionosphere .
Early warning
One study looked at over 100 earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.0 or larger in Taiwan over several decades .
The researchers found that almost all of the earthquakes down to a depth of about 35 km were preceded by distinct electrical disturbances in the ionosphere .
The analysis was carried out by Jann - Yeng Liu , from the Center for Space and Remote Sensing Research in Chung - Li , Taiwan .
A satellite warning system could monitor for quake " precursors "
Though full details have yet to be released , the BBC understands that scientists also observed a " huge " signal in the ionosphere before the Magnitude 7.8 earthquake in China on 12 May .
The team at Nasa has also been working with Surrey Satellite Technology Limited ( SSTL ) in the UK , to investigate the feasibility of a satellite - based early warning system .
Stuart Eves , head of business development at the company , told BBC News : " The evidence suggests we 're now crossing the boundary in terms of technology readiness . "
He added : " What we do n't know is how big the effect is and how long - lasting it is before the earthquake . "
Minoru Freund believes other earthquake " precursors " could feed into this system .
These include enhanced emission of infrared ( IR ) radiation from the earthquake epicentre , as well as anomalies in low - frequency electric and magnetic field data .
Rock ' batteries '
Minoru and his father Friedemann Freund , also from Nasa Ames Research Center , developed the scientific theory behind these earthquake precursors .
It boils down to the idea that when rocks are compressed - as when tectonic plates shift - they act like batteries , producing electric currents .
" We now pretty much understand the solid - state physics of these rocks , " Minoru added .
According to their theory , the charge carrier is a " positive hole " , known as a phole , which can travel large distances in laboratory experiments .
When they travel to the surface of the Earth , the surface becomes positively charged .
And this charge can be strong enough to affect the ionosphere , causing the disturbances documented by satellites .
When these pholes " recombine " at the surface of the Earth , they enter an excited state .
They subsequently " de- excite " and emit mid-infrared light particles , or photons .
This may explain the IR observations .
Dr Mike Blanpied , a geophysicist at the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) , who is unconnected with the work told BBC News : " At this point , the connection between the laboratory phenomena and processes at work in the Earth has not been demonstrated and is the subject of research . "
He has two principal criticisms of the work .
Firstly , he said the experiments had been done on dry - or briefly soaked - rocks at room temperature and pressure .
But deep in the crust , rocks have all their voids filled with mineral solutions and are subjected to high temperatures and pressures .
Secondly , he said , the researchers ' hypothesis held that rapid changes in stress and strain in the crust began a few days before earthquakes .
Dr Blanpied , who is based in Reston , Virginia , said there had never been an observation of rapid strain changes before an earthquake , which meant precursor strains before earthquakes might be too small to have been detected .
Minoru Freund agrees that more work is needed to improve on the theory and some of the data .
But he said he was planning to work up a proposal for a low - cost , space - borne early warning system based on at least three satellites .

What are these ?
CNN Money is reporting State , city layoffs : 45,000 and counting .
With falling revenue from sales and income taxes , and property - tax declines looming , states , cities and towns have already laid off tens of thousands of government employees .
The American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , a public employees union , says about 45,000 government layoffs have been announced this year .
There are 29 states , including California , Florida and Ohio , facing a combined budget shortfall of at least $ 48 billion in the fiscal year that starts July 1 , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities ( CBPP ) , a liberal think tank .
There are nearly 20 million state and local government employees in the country .
So a 1 % decline in employment at cities , towns , schools and states would result in a job loss of almost 200,000 people , a much larger amount than we 've seen from battered sectors such as automakers or home builders in the past two years .

Bank of America To Cut 7,500
Bank of America Corp. ( BAC ) said Thursday it expects to make about 7,500 job cuts after acquiring Countrywide Financial Corp . ( CFC ) .
Affected employees will start finding out their fate in the third quarter . "
Citigroup to cut 6,500
Citigroup , America ’s largest bank , is expected to cut up to 6,500 investment banking jobs – as much as 10 per cent of its roughly 65,000 headcount worldwide .
It is believed that entire trading desks in New York , London and other cities will be eliminated .
Senior managing directors will not be immune from the layoffs .
In April , Citigroup said that 9,000 jobs would go on top of the 21,000 eliminated in the past year .
[ This is yet another 6,500 - Mish ]
175,000 Financial Cuts Coming
The world 's biggest financial firms may lose as many as 175,000 jobs by this time next year as Citigroup Inc. and other banks shed workers amid slowing revenue and billions in writedowns , executive recruiters say .
" The worst is yet to come , " Russ Gerson , head of New York - based recruiting firm Gerson Group , said yesterday in an interview .
" We are going to have a major contraction .

CARACAS , Venezuela 
A sweeping power failure left Venezuela ’s largest cities without electricity on Tuesday , snarling traffic , halting subway trains underground and mobilizing police forces here in the capital to thwart possible public disturbances .
Government electricity officials gave different reasons for the blackout , which began at 4 p.m. here and lasted more than two hours in parts of Caracas .
Initially they said it was set off by peak electricity usage on a hot day , but later said a forest fire in Guárico , a state in north - central Venezuela , had caused the shutdown .
The power failure affected at least 11 of Venezuela ’s 23 states .
Among the hardest hit was Zulia State , home of Venezuela ’s main oil fields and Maracaibo , the second - largest city .
Power remained out in most of Zulia well into Tuesday evening , according to radio reports , but it was unclear if oil output from wells around Lake Maracaibo was affected .
“ Zulia was the most affected , ” Gen . Hipólito Izquierdo , head of the country ’s electricity authority , said on state television .
“ But we have recuperated more than 60 percent of what was affected in the blackout . ”

Thank you for judging me on the CD I bought yesterday .
Our passive - aggressive altercation made me realize how conformist I am for buying an old Rage Against The Machine album .
Your condescension was just the intellectual wake - up call I needed .
I discovered a new me yesterday , and my eyes were opened in a new way .
Thanks to you , I realize now that the key to enlightenment is reading Pitchfork , watching High Fidelity , listening to Velvet Underground , having a tattoo of a star on the inside of my wrist , growing an ironic mustache , living in the Mission , and wearing a too - small sweater , multi-colored 70 ’s ski-vest , chunky plastic - frame glasses , a high school sports T - shirt , air - tight black jeans , and Nixon - era Chuck Taylors .
I had it all wrong , man .
You showed me that a skilled job and a comfortable living is just a lie .
I need to go to art school , have my parents pay my rent , join a Joy Division - influenced band , and wait for a record deal , like you .
I ’m totally missing out in life .
So thanks again for mocking me .

Mr Hu called for a " final victory " of relief efforts
Almost five million people have been left homeless by Monday 's devastating earthquake in China 's south - western Sichuan Province , officials say .
They said the extent of the problem only became clear when communications were restored .
So far , 22,069 deaths have been confirmed and thousands remain missing .
It is feared up to 50,000 may be dead .
Chinese President Hu Jintao , visiting the province , said rescue work was at its most crucial phase .
Premier Wen Jiabao said the quake was the most destructive and widespread since the People 's Republic was founded in 1949 .

Its scale was greater than that of the Tangshan earthquake in 1976 which left 240,000 dead , he said .
China has announced an investigation into why so many schools have collapsed .
Further aftershocks - one measuring 5.9 - continued to strike the area , causing landslides that buried vehicles and knocked out communications only just restored .
' Top priority ' Sichuan Vice - Governor Li Chengyun said 4.8 million people were now in " temporary shelter " following the earthquake .
Local officials said the extent of homelessness in the region only became clear on Friday .
" Before today , communications and roads to some cities and counties in the province were cut off because of the quake , " the official told AFP news agency .
Saving lives is still our top priority , as long as hope of survival still exists
Premier Wen Jiabao
In pictures : China 's rescue push Dams pose flooding risk Life in tent city " That 's why the number has increased so fast now that links have been restored with the cities and counties . "
As the search for survivors continued intensively on Friday , four people were reportedly pulled out alive .
Four days after the quake , Chinese CCTV showed pictures of a five - year - old boy , looking weak and bruised , being taken from the rubble , bandaged and strapped to a stretcher .
Meanwhile , a 23 - year - old nurse was rescued from the ruins of a hospital , and two survivors were found buried together beneath a collapsed office building in the shattered district of Beichuan , state news agency Xinhua reported .
Mr Wen , who has been in the area since the earthquake struck , said the focus of the effort was still reaching survivors .
" Saving lives is still our top priority , as long as hope of survival still exists , " he said .
Foreign rescuers
The Chinese president 's presence in the region appears to reflect the level of government concern over the scale of the disaster .
" The challenge is still severe , the task is still arduous and the time is pressing , " said Mr Hu .
" We must make every effort , race against time and overcome all difficulties to achieve the final victory of the relief efforts . "

He was speaking after arriving in Mianyang , one of the cities worst - hit by the 7.9 - magnitude earthquake , where he was to view the relief efforts and meet troops and medical personnel .
The first foreign rescuers have now arrived in the devastated region .
Thirty - one Japanese experts arrived on Friday morning , state media said , and a second team with sniffer dogs was due there later in the day .
Taiwan , Russia , South Korea and Singapore are also sending teams to help in the rescue effort .
Troops have now reached all of the affected areas , state media says .
It adds that about 159,000 people were injured in the quake and 4.8 million people have been relocated .

How earthquakes happen
But the task remains huge .
Seven schools , including two nursery schools , collapsed in the town of Mianzhu alone , burying more than 1,700 students .
In Hanwang town , about 700 students were buried when Donqi middle school collapsed .
The BBC's James Reynolds in Hanwang described seeing rescuers emerge from a building carrying two bodies , and watching parents wait at the school , hoping their children would come out alive .
' Big issues '
More than 200,000 houses have collapsed in Sichuan province , while more than four million have been damaged in some way , Xinhua said .
In Mianzhu , one of the worst - hit towns , one woman said the focus should switch to caring for the survivors .
" The focus is on saving lives , and they say food and a place to live are small issues as long as you 're alive , " Fan Xiaohua told Reuters news agency .
" In fact , they are very big issues right now , " she said .
While the government says the search is still the priority , it is stepping up the effort to get aid to the millions of people displaced or cut off by the disaster , says the BBC's Dan Griffiths in the Sichuan capital Chengdu .
Tens of thousands of Chinese troops and police are in the region to help with relief efforts but damage to roads is making it difficult to get to the worst - hit regions .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Individual Americans have a right to own guns , the Supreme Court ruled on Thursday for the first time in the country ’s history , striking down a strict gun control law in the U.S. capital .
The landmark 5 - 4 ruling marked the first time in nearly 70 years the high court has addressed the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution .
It rejected the argument the right to keep and bear arms was tied to service in a state militia .
Justice Antonin Scalia said for the majority the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with militia service and to use it for traditional lawful purposes , such as self - defense in the home .
However , he said the new right was not unlimited .
The court struck down two parts of the country ’s strictest gun control law adopted in Washington , D.C. , 32 years ago -- the ban on private handgun possession and the requirement that firearms kept at home be unloaded and disassembled or bound by a trigger lock .
The ruling marked the first time the court has struck down a gun control law for violating the Second Amendment .
The ruling won praise from President George W. Bush , Republican presidential candidate John McCain and Wayne LaPierre of the politically powerful National Rifle Association , who said , “ This is a great moment in American history . ”
It drew fire from gun control groups , which warned of new legal attacks on existing gun laws , and some Democrats in Congress like Sen.
Dianne Feinstein , who said the decision “ opens this nation to a dramatic lack of safety . ”
The four liberal dissenting justices warned of the ruling ’s consequences .
“ The decision threatens to throw into doubt the constitutionality of gun laws throughout the United States , ” Justice Stephen Breyer said .
Although an individual now has a constitutional right to own guns , that new right is not unlimited , wrote Scalia , a hunter .
He said the ruling should not be taken to cast doubt on long - standing prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill or on laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in places like schools and government buildings or laws imposing conditions on gun sales .
The Supreme Court ’s last review of the Second Amendment came in a five - page discussion in an opinion issued in 1939 that failed to definitively resolve the constitutional issue .
In the 64 - page opinion , Scalia said an individual right to bear arms is supported by “ the historical narrative ” both before and after the Second Amendment ’s adoption .
“ What is not debatable is that it is not the role of this court to pronounce the Second Amendment extinct , ” he said .
“ Few laws in the history of our nation have come close to the severe restriction of the district ’s handgun ban , ” Scalia said .
GUN POINTED AT BURGLAR WHILE CALLING POLICE
Scalia said a citizen may prefer may prefer a handgun for home defense because “ it can be pointed at a burglar with one hand while the other hand dials the police . ”

The justices split along conservative - liberal lines in the ruling , one of the most important of the court ’s current term , in deciding a legal battle over gun rights in America .
The ruling came on the last day of the court ’s 2007 - 08 term .
Bush ’s two appointees on the court , Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito , both voted with the majority in finding an individual right to keep firearms .
Bush said in a statement he applauded the “ historic decision today confirming what has always been clear in the Constitution : the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear firearms . ”
Republican presidential candidate John McCain applauded the ruling and criticized his Democratic opponent Barack Obama for comments he had made during the political campaign .

“ Unlike the elitist view that believes Americans cling to guns out of bitterness , today ’s ruling recognizes that gun ownership is a fundamental right -- sacred , just as the right to free speech and assembly , ” McCain said .
“ I have always believed that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to bear arms , ” Obama said , “ but I also identify with the need for crime - ravaged communities to save their children from the violence that plagues our streets through common sense , effective safety measures . ”
The United States is estimated to have the world ’s highest civilian gun ownership rate .
Gun deaths average 80 a day in the United States , 34 of them homicides , according to Centers for Disease Control data .
The ruling was a victory for Dick Anthony Heller , a security guard who lives in a high - crime neighborhood and who wants to keep a handgun in his home for self - defense .
For decades , the meaning of the Second Amendment has been at the heart of a political and legal debate debate over gun control .
People have argued whether it guarantees the right to bear arms to individuals or to citizens in a militia .
Written more than 200 years ago , the amendment says , “ A well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . ”
In a dissent , parts of which he read from the bench , Justice John Paul Stevens said the court left for future cases the formidable task of defining the scope of permissible gun regulations .
“ I fear that the district ’s policy choice may well be just the first of an unknown number of dominoes to be knocked off the table , ” Stevens said .
We 've seen more silly homemade electric vehicles than we care to remember , but Ben Nelson 's electric motorcycle manages to retain some of its original two - wheel charm while using only a penny of juice per mile -- roughly the equivalent of 300 mpg .
Nelson bought the bike for $ 100 and swapped out the original engine for a Briggs and Stratton 8HP DC motor he picked up on eBay for $ 500 , using four $ 160 Optima Yellowtop lead - acid batteries for power .
Nelson says he can get the rig up to a top speed of 45MPH , and he's got a range of about 20 miles before he needs to plug in -- enough to run errands around town .
Best of all , the state of Wisconsin willingly registered his bike as a " hobbyist " vehicle , which means he 's free to ( silently ) roam the streets at will .
Ben first built the bike about a year ago , so he 's accumulated a ton of useful info if you 're interested in following in his tire tracks -- hit up the read link to learn more , and check the video after the break .

( Fortune ) --
It 's 25 below outside , and the heat in the van is busted .
Randy Boyer , a burly ConocoPhillips contractor in thermal coveralls , navigates the slick ice road .
" This is nothing , " he says , keeping his eye on the thin red line running down the center of the road .
" The other week we had a whiteout , and I was stuck in my truck for 36 hours . "
Right now we 're some 250 miles north of the Arctic Circle , and it's so white outside that the distant horizon appears to blend seamlessly into the blustery sky .
Boyer pulls over into a small mobile base camp to switch trucks .
We 're deep in the tundra of Alaska 's North Slope , and you need a vehicle with tanklike treads or special tires to venture off - road .
After a bone - rattling 15 - minute ride - the tundra only looks flat - we catch up with a red truck creeping across the frozen landscape .
A worker bundled in a blue coat of Michelin - man dimensions trudges behind it , uncoiling orange cable that looks like the extension cord you might keep in your garage .
Every 100 feet or so , he plants three small blue geophones into the ground .
He 's setting up to " shoot seismic , " an oil driller 's term for a laborious surveying process that maps the earth 's subsurface .
It will take a team of 100 workers more than a week to lay a precise grid of 21,000 geophones , which act as motion detectors , along 145 miles of wire .
After that a truck known as a " vibrator " will make stops along the grid , lowering a large plate onto the ground .
The apparatus creates seismic waves - tiny earthquakes - that are recorded by the geophones .
Geologists in Anchorage will then spend six months transforming that data into a picture of the underground formations .
Some of them , they hope , will contain oil .
The folks at Conoco surveyed this slice of barren land about a decade ago .
But times are a bit desperate up here in North America 's largest oil region , and they 've come back .
" We 're looking to see if we left anything behind , " says Jim Darnall , an acquisition geophysicist for ConocoPhillips , as he brushes ice off his bushy gray beard .
" We 're trying to milk this field anyway we can . "
Is this what America 's late - 20th - century oil paradise has been reduced to - the petroleum equivalent of rooting for loose change in the cushions of a sofa ?
U.S. crude production is at its lowest since 1949 , and nowhere has that decline been steeper than in Alaska , where oil output is less than half what it was a decade ago .
The fields that since the late 1970s have provided more than 20 % of America 's oil are slowly running dry .
It 's a phenomenon that is hardly limited to Alaska .
The world 's five largest oil companies are replacing only 82 % of the oil they pump each year , as once - prodigious fields fade and state entities in such countries as Venezuela and Russia consolidate ever more control over their oil and gas .
The combination of falling reserves and $ 100 - plus oil is sparking a frenzy of oil and gas activity in Alaska the likes of which has n't been seen since the state 's initial oil boom more than three decades ago .
ConocoPhillips ( COP , Fortune 500 ) , Alaska 's biggest producer and America 's third - largest oil company , is spending huge sums to re-explore old stomping grounds like the North Slope .
The company is also investing in heavy - oil technology and early preparation for a proposed $ 30 billion natural gas pipeline .
" We think the Arctic is the new frontier , " says Conoco CEO Jim Mulva , " and it 's not just in Alaska .
The potential exploration opportunities go all the way around the Arctic Circle . "
The excitement extends even farther north , where the shrinking ice cap is helping spur a new race for territorial supremacy .
In August , Russia planted a flag 2 1 / 2 miles below sea level at the actual North Pole , laying claim to what it says are vast quantities of oil and gas .
Some experts estimate that a quarter of the planet 's undiscovered energy resources are buried at the top of the planet .
But that figure is highly speculative - much of the Arctic is unexplored - and even if you find something , how do you transport it through a sea of ice ?
In the latest fee to hit the airline industry , Delta Air Lines said Friday that it planned to begin charging a fuel surcharge of up to $ 50 for booking frequent - flier tickets under its awards program .
Delta is not the first airline to charge a fee for previously free tickets , but it is specifically attributing the step to the soaring cost of jet fuel .
The new fee takes effect on tickets booked on or after Aug. 15 .
Delta will charge a $ 25 fuel surcharge on tickets booked within the United States , and $ 50 on tickets booked for travel elsewhere , including the Caribbean , the United States Virgin Islands , Latin America and other international destinations .
Jet fuel prices have risen 83.6 percent in the last year , according to the International Air Transport Association , the global industry ’s trade group .
Airlines have responded with a variety of fees and charges for a range of previously free features , from checking luggage to beverages .
PYONGYANG , North Korea ( CNN ) -- North Korea handed over its long - awaited nuclear program declaration to officials from China on Thursday .
Workers remove fuel rods on the reactor floor at North Korea 's Yongbyon nuclear facility this year .
President Bush , who once branded North Korea as part of an " axis of evil , " welcomed the move and said he intends to remove the communist nation from the U.S. list of states that sponsor terrorism .
" The declaration says : ' We are not now engaged in any [ uranium ] enrichment activities or [ nuclear ] proliferation activities and will not engage in them in the future , ' " U.S. National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley said in Washington .
" It is a good first step in getting the kind of disclosure and transparency into North Korea 's nuclear activities as part of and a step toward their disablement , dismantlement and termination of those activities , " Hadley said .
North Korea handed over the declaration to officials from China , which led the six -nation talks that hammered out the conditions of the agreement .
In addition to China and the United States , the talks included South Korea , Japan and Russia .
Watch what 's still unknown after Pyongyang 's declaration »
Bush said he will call for the lifting of sanctions against North Korea under the Trading With the Enemy Act and notify Congress that he intends to take Pyongyang off the terror list .
That move will take 45 days .
But North Korea will have to end its nuclear activities in a " verifiable " way , Bush said in the White House Rose Garden .
" The United States has no illusions about the regime in Pyongyang , " he said .
" We remain deeply concerned about North Korea 's human rights abuses , uranium enrichment activities , nuclear testing and proliferation , ballistic missile programs and the threat it continues to pose to South Korea and its neighbors .
" Yet we welcome today 's development as one step of a multistep process . "
According to a senior U.S. State Department official , the 60 - page declaration , written in English , details several rounds of plutonium production at Yongbyon , North Korea dating back to 1986 .
North Korea acknowledges producing roughly 40 kilograms of enriched plutonium -- enough for about seven nuclear bombs , the official said .
The nation already has tested one nuclear bomb , which would have used about 6 kilograms of plutonium .
After the declaration 's submission , representatives from the United States and other members of the six - party talks will begin a process of verifying whether Pyongyang 's declarations are true .
Analyst John Wolfsthal of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said experts needed to be on the ground , taking samples and analyzing data .
" We do n't trust North Korea ; we do n't take them at their word , " said Wolfsthal , who has followed the secretive country for about two decades .
" We need to put together basically a jigsaw puzzle from pieces of data without really seeing the cover of the box , " he said of North Korea 's nuclear program .
Hadley said the declaration also should provide details on how much plutonium North Korea says it has produced , which will allow the U.S. to calculate the size of Pyongyang 's nuclear arsenal .
Hadley said that information is not included in the declaration .
Watch why the plutonium question is so important »
The United States also needs to learn more about Pyongyang 's previous nuclear activities , including the spread of nuclear technology and information to other countries , Hadley added .
" We have concerns about their past activities , " Hadley said .
" We have made those concerns clear .
The North Koreans acknowledge those concerns .
That is what is ahead of us .
" In order for this process to go forward ... we are going to need to be able to get to the bottom of these issues , with respect to plutonium , enrichment , proliferation , " he said .
The easing of U.S. sanctions on North Korea will have little practical effect .
" North Korea will remain one of the most heavily sanctioned nations in the world , " Bush said .
The agreement includes additional monitoring to assure that Pyongyang receives promised economic and energy assistance in exchange for dismantling its nuclear program .
Under the agreement , leaders in Pyongyang agreed to provide a full accounting of the plutonium , " acknowledge " concerns about its nuclear proliferation and uranium enrichment activities , and continue to cooperate with a process to ensure that no further activities are taking place .
During negotiations , the United States ultimately softened demands that North Korea admit to having a highly enriched uranium program and supplying Syria with nuclear technology , sticking points that had stalled the talks for months .
U.S. officials said the final deal was n't perfect but offered Washington its best chance to learn about North Korea 's nuclear activities .
" Multilateral diplomacy is the best way to peacefully resolve the nuclear issue , " White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
" North Korea should seize this moment of opportunity to restore its relationship with the international community . "
On Friday , North Korea is set to implode a cooling tower at its Yongbyon nuclear reactor .
Nuclear experts have begun dismantling the plant 's main reactor , but the destruction of the cooling tower is expected to be a powerful public symbol .
And it is a step that would take North Korea more than a year to reverse , according to U.S. State Department officials .
In a rare move , North Korea has invited international news organizations , including CNN , to witness the tower 's destruction .
The United States put North Korea on its state - sponsored terror list in January 1988 after its alleged involvement with the 1987 bombing of a South Korean airliner .
The Korean Air Lines flight crashed into the Indian Ocean , killing all 115 people on board .

All About North Korea • Nuclear Proliferation
Focusing on Present Conflicts
Fighting the Last War
Nation - States and Fourth - Generation Warfare
The Air Force and UAVs
The Next War vs. the War That Matters
U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has fired the secretary of the Air Force and the Air Force chief of staff .
The official reason given for the firings was the mishandling of nuclear weapons and equipment related to nuclear weapons , which included allowing an aircraft to fly within the United States with six armed nuclear weapons on board and accidentally shipping nuclear triggers to Taiwan .
An investigation conducted by a Navy admiral concluded that Air Force expertise in handling nuclear weapons had declined .
While Gates insisted that this was the immediate reason for the firings , he has sharply criticized the Air Force for failing to reorient itself to the types of conflict in which the United States is currently engaged .
Where the Air Force leadership wanted to focus on deploying a new generation of fighter aircraft , Gates wanted them deploying additional unmanned aircraft able to provide reconnaissance and carry out airstrikes in Iraq and Afghanistan .
These are not trivial issues , but they are the tip of the iceberg in a much more fundamental strategic debate going on in the U.S. defense community .
Gates put the issue succinctly when he recently said that " I have noticed too much of a tendency toward what might be called ' next - war - itis ' — the propensity of much of the defense establishment to be in favor of what might be needed in a future conflict . "
This is what the firings were about .
Naturally , as soon as the firings were announced , there were people who assumed they occurred because these two were unwilling to go along with plans to bomb Iran .
At this point , the urban legend of an imminent war with Iran has permeated the culture .
But the Air Force is the one place where calls for an air attack would find little resistance , particularly at the top , because it would give the Air Force the kind of mission it really knows how to do and is good at .
The whole issue in these firings is whether what the Air Force is good at is what the United States needs .
There is a neat alignment of the issues involved in the firings .
Nuclear arms were the quintessential weapons of the Cold War , the last generation .
Predators and similar unmanned aircraft are part of this generation 's warfare .
The Air Force sees F - 22s and other conventional technology as the key weapons of the next generation .
The Air Force leadership , facing decades - long timelines in fielding new weapons systems , feels it must focus on the next war now .
Gates , responsible for fighting this generation 's war , sees the Air Force as neglecting current requirements .
He also views it as essentially having lost interest and expertise in the last generation 's weapons , which are still important — not to mention extremely dangerous .
The classic charge against generals is that they always want to fight the last war again .
In charging the Air Force with wanting to fight the next war now , Gates is saying the Air Force has replaced the old problem with a new one .
The Air Force 's view of the situation is that if all resources are poured into fighting this war , the United States will emerge from it unprepared to fight the next war .
Underneath this discussion of past and future wars is a more important and defining set of questions .
First , can the United States afford to fight this war while simultaneously preparing for the next one ?
Second , what will the next war look like ; will it be different from this one ?
There is a school of thought in the military that argues that we have now entered the fourth generation of warfare .
The first generation of war , according to this theory , involved columns and lines of troops firing muzzle - loaded weapons in volleys .
The second generation consisted of warfare involving indirect fire ( artillery ) and massed movement , as seen in World War I .
Third - generation warfare comprised mobile warfare , focused on outmaneuvering the enemy , penetrating enemy lines and encircling them , as was done with armor during World War II .
The first three generations of warfare involved large numbers of troops , equipment and logistics .
Large territorial organizations — namely , nation - states — were required to carry them out .
Fourth - generation warfare is warfare carried out by nonstate actors using small , decentralized units and individuals to strike at enemy forces and , more important , create political support among the population .
The classic example of fourth - generation warfare would be the intifadas carried out by Palestinians against Israel .
They involved everything from rioters throwing rocks to kidnappings to suicide bombings .
The Palestinians could not defeat the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) , a classic third - generation force , in any conventional sense — but neither could the IDF vanquish the intifadas , since the battlefield was the Palestinians themselves .
So long as the Palestinians were prepared to support their fourth - generation warriors , they could extract an ongoing price against Israeli civilians and soldiers .
The Israeli -Palestinian conflict thus became one of morale rather than materiel .
This was the model , of course , the United States encountered in Iraq .
Fourth - generation warfare has always existed .
Imperial Britain faced it in Afghanistan .
The United States faced it at the turn of the last century in the Philippines .
King David waged fourth - generation warfare in Galilee .
It has been a constant mode of warfare .
The theorists of fourth - generational warfare are not arguing that the United States will face this type of war along with others , but that going forward , this type of warfare will dominate — that the wars of the future will be fourth - generation wars .
Implicit in this argument is the view that the nation - state , which has dominated warfare since the invention of firearms , is no longer the primary agent of wars .
Each of the previous three generations of warfare required manpower and resources on a very large scale that only a nation - state could provide .
Fidel Castro in the Cuban mountains , for example , could not field an armored division , an infantry brigade or a rifle regiment ; it took a nation to fight the first three generations of warfare .
The argument now is that nations are not the agents of wars but its victims .
Wars will not be fought between nations , but between nations and subnational groups that are decentralized , sparse , dispersed and primarily conducting war to attack their target 's morale .
The very size of the forces dispersed by a nation - state makes them vulnerable to subnational groups by providing a target - rich environment .
Being sparse and politically capable , the insurgent groups blend into the population and are difficult to ferret out and defeat .
In such a war , the nation - state 's primary mission is to identify the enemy , separate him from the population and destroy him .
It is critical to be surgical in attacking the enemy , since the enemy wins whenever an attack by the nation - state hits the noncombatant population , even if its own forces are destroyed — this is political warfare .
Therefore , the key to success — if success is possible — is intelligence .
It is necessary to know the enemy 's whereabouts , and strike him when he is not near the noncombatant population .
In fourth - generation warfare , therefore , unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) are one of the keys to defeating the substate actor .
They gather intelligence , wait until the target is not surrounded by noncombatants and strike suddenly and without warning .
It is the quintessential warfare for a technologically advanced nation fighting a subnational insurgent group embedded in the population .
It is not surprising that Gates , charged with prosecuting a fourth - generation war , is furious at the Air Force for focusing on fighter planes when what it needs are more and better UAVs .
The Air Force , which was built around the concept of air superiority and strategic bombing , has a visceral objection to unmanned aircraft .
From its inception , the Air Force ( and the Army Air Corps before it ) argued that modern warfare would be fought between nation - states , and that the defining weapon in this kind of war would be the manned bomber attacking targets with precision .
When it became apparent that the manned bomber was highly vulnerable to enemy fighters and anti-aircraft systems , the doctrine was modified with the argument that the Air Force 's task was to establish air superiority using fighter aircraft to sweep the skies of the enemy and strike aircraft to take out anti-aircraft systems — clearing the way for bombers or , later , the attack aircraft .
The response to the Air Force position is that the United States is no longer fighting the first three types of war , and that the only wars the United States will fight now will be fourth - generation wars where command of the air is both a given and irrelevant .
The Air Force 's mission would thus be obsolete .
Only nation - states have the resources to resist U.S. airpower , and the United States is n't going to be fighting one of them again .
This should be the key point of contention for the Air Force , which should argue that there is no such thing as fourth - generation warfare .
There have always been guerrillas , assassins and other forms of politico - military operatives .
With the invention of explosives , they have been able to kill more people than before , but there is nothing new in this .
What is called fourth - generation warfare is simply a type of war faced by everyone from Alexander to Hitler .
It is just resistance .
This has not superseded third - generation warfare ; it merely happens to be the type of warfare the United States has faced recently .
Wars between nation - states , such as World War I and World War II , are rare in the sense that the United States fought many more wars like the Huk rising in the Philippines or the Vietnam War in its guerrilla phase than it did world wars .
Nevertheless , it was the two world wars that determined the future of the world and threatened fundamental U.S. interests .
The United States can lose a dozen Vietnams or Iraqs and not have its interests harmed .
But losing a war with a nation - state could be catastrophic .
The response to Gates , therefore , is that the Air Force is not preparing for the next war .
It is preparing for the war that really matters rather than focusing on an insurgency that ultimately cannot threaten fundamental U.S. interests .
Gates , of course , would answer that the Air Force is cavalier with the lives of troops who are fighting the current war as it prepares to fight some notional war .
The Air Force would counter that the notional war it is preparing to fight could decide the survival of the United States , while the war being fought by Gates wo n't .
At this point , the argument would deadlock , and the president and Congress would decide where to place their bets .
But the argument is not quite over at this point .
The Air Force 's point about preparing for the decisive wars is , in our mind , well - taken .
It is hard for us to accept the idea that the nation - state is helpless in front of determined subnational groups .
More important , it is hard for us to accept the idea that international warfare is at an end .
There have been long periods in the past of relative tranquility between nation - states — such as , for example , the period between the fall of Napoleon and World War I .
Wars between nations were sparse , and the European powers focused on fourth - generational resistance in their colonies .
But when war came in 1914 , it came with a vengeance .
Our question regards the weapons the Air Force wants to procure .
It wants to build the F - 22 fighter at enormous cost , which is designed to penetrate enemy airspace , defeat enemy fighter aircraft and deliver ordnance with precision to a particular point on the map .
Why would one use a manned aircraft for that mission ?
The evolution of cruise missiles with greater range and speed permits the delivery of the same ordnance to the same target without having a pilot in the cockpit .
Indeed , cruise missiles can engage in evasive maneuvers at g- forces that would kill a pilot .
And cruise missiles exist that could serve as unmanned aircraft , flying to the target , releasing submunitions and returning home .
The combination of space - based reconnaissance and the unmanned cruise missile — in particular , next - generation systems able to move at hypersonic speeds ( in excess of five times the speed of sound ) — would appear a much more efficient and effective solution to the problem of the next generation of warfare .
We could argue that both Gates and the Air Force are missing the point .
Gates is right that the Air Force should focus on unmanned aircraft ; technology has simply moved beyond the piloted aircraft as a model .
But this does not mean the Air Force should not be preparing for the next war .
Just as the military should have been preparing for the U.S. - jihadist war while also waging the Cold War , so too , the military should be preparing for the next conflict while fighting this war .
For a country that spends as much time in wars as the United States ( about 17 percent of the 20th century in major wars , almost all of the 21st century ) , Gates ' wish to focus so narrowly on this war seems reckless .
At the same time , building a new and fiendishly expensive version of the last generation 's weapons does not necessarily constitute preparing for the next war .
The Air Force was built around the piloted combat aircraft .
The Navy was built around sailing ships .
Those who flew and those who sailed were necessary and courageous .
But sailing ships do n't fit into the modern fleet , and it is not clear to us that manned aircraft will fit into high - intensity peer conflict in the future .
We do not agree that preparing for the next war is pathological .
We should always be fighting this war and preparing for the next .
But we do n't believe the Air Force is preparing for the next war .
There will be wars between nations , fought with all the chips on the table .
Gates is right that the Air Force should focus on unmanned aircraft .
But not because of this war alone .

Ayveq , the walrus whose bizarre , though oddly compelling , masturbation rituals made him an international sensation at the New York Aquarium , has died .
He was 14 .
Though well - liked long before he discovered the habit that would make him a star , Ayveq ’s frequent public self - gratification made him the Coney Island institution ’s singular attraction .
“ We are all still in shock about it , ” Aquarium Director Jon Forrest Dohlin said .
“ He was an absolute delight .
He had a magnetism and a charm that was totally his own .
He loved people and he knew how to work a crowd and entertain guests .
“ And himself , ” Dohlin added .
“ He did have a raffish charm , no doubt about it . ”
The Aquarium said workers discovered that Avyeq was ailing on Sunday , June 15 .
“ On Saturday night , he was perfect — no problems at all , ” said Dohlin , “ but the next morning , we could see that he was not right . ”
Within one week , he was dead , most likely of a “ massive ” bacterial infection , Dohlin said .
“ We tried everything , but it progressed so rapidly , ” he said .
The exact cause of death will not be known until an autopsy .
Ayveq moved to the Aquarium from his native Alaska in 1994 , shortly after he and two brothers were orphaned .
His name , curiously enough , means “ walrus ” in Siberian Yupik .
The death of Ayveq comes almost exactly a year after the birth of his only ( known ) son , Akituusaq , whom he sired with the female , Kulusiq after years of unrequited courting .
I hate direct mail and normally toss the stuff but this package got my eye with its red seal .
So I bit and opened it .
This is what was inside .
I stared at it for a while and tried to find some hidden meaning .
I Googled the initials in the logo , tb , but all I got were links to tuberculosis and I doubt someone 's going to go through all this expense to send me blind mailers about a disease .
I have no idea what it is about .
I guess it could be some kind of puzzle or clue I 'm supposed to decode but , honestly , I suck at those .
But now I 'm annoyed and curious .
Anybody else get one in the mail ?
Or know what it means ?
Whatever it is , someone went through a lot of effort to get my attention .
And if the goal was to get me to post about it , I guess they succeeded .
Hopefully it's not some new hair transplant drug , cause I fell for that mailer once before and now I have toes like Chewbacca .

The flora of California , a global biodiversity hotspot , includes 2387 endemic plant taxa .
With anticipated climate change , we project that up to 66 % will experience > 80 % reductions in range size within a century .
These results are comparable with other studies of fewer species or just samples of a region 's endemics .
Projected reductions depend on the magnitude of future emissions and on the ability of species to disperse from their current locations .
California 's varied terrain could cause species to move in very different directions , breaking up present - day floras .
However , our projections also identify regions where species undergoing severe range reductions may persist .
Protecting these potential future refugia and facilitating species dispersal will be essential to maintain biodiversity in the face of climate change .

Introduction
The California Floristic Province has over 5500 native plant taxa ; 40 % of them are endemic , that is , their entire native distributions are within the Province [ 1 ] .
( By taxa , we mean distinct species , subspecies , or varieties , and we use “ species ” hereafter for simplicity [ 2 ] . )
Models project that California 's temperature and rainfall will change considerably in this century [ 3 ] .
Here , we use observed data on species ' distributions and present - day climate to build multiple bioclimatic models .
We then apply these models to project changes in endemic species ' range sizes , distribution and diversity under future climate scenarios .
Empirical examples of species ' range shifts resulting from climate change have been recorded for numerous taxa [ 4 ] – [ 5 ] .
Projecting future changes is a crucial step towards planning for and mitigating the impacts of climate change on biodiversity [ 6 ] .
Most previous attempts have focused on small subsets of species [ 7 ] – [ 9 ] or vegetation types [ 10 ] – [ 11 ] .
They incorporated varying degrees of data on physiology and dispersal .
A small number of related studies have focused on estimating changes in biodiversity [ 12 ] – [ 13 ] .
As we describe in the methods , biodiversity studies must limit themselves to species subsets restricted to the region – such as endemics [ 14 ] .
Sparse flora - wide data on physiology and dispersal has meant that studies across floras have included simplified treatments of individual species ' biology .
A recent study of two California oak species projected significant range reductions for both species [ 7 ] .
In southeastern California , a study of Yucca brevifolia that included physiological responses to increased CO 2 levels projected a slight decrease in range size [ 15 ] .
Analysis of the responses of vegetation types in California to climate change projected decreased coniferous forests in the northwestern part of the state and increases in broadleaf vegetation [ 16 ] .
In Eastern North America , models for 80 tree species project range expansions for approximately 30 species and an equal number of range contractions .
In that study , the centroids of nearly half of the species were projected to move at least 100 km to the north [ 17 ] .
Outside of North America , regional studies have addressed both range shifts and potential levels of extinction in the face of climate change .
Studies of the Proteaceae in the Cape Floristic Province – another Mediterranean hotspot — estimate that this group may lose up to 20 % of the species considered [ 8 ] , [ 18 ] – [ 19 ] .
A study of 975 endemic plant species in southern Africa projected that the Mediterranean climate portion of the study area will lose the highest proportion of species [ 20 ] , while flora - level studies from Europe have projected that as many as half of the species studied will be threatened [ 12 ] – [ 13 ] , [ 21 ] .
Currently , there are no published assessments of potential impacts of climate change on regional endemic floras for any part of North America .
California is particularly well suited to such a study , as it has high endemic plant diversity and the quality of plant distribution and climate data across the region are excellent .
California also provides an interesting case study because of its topographic complexity , extensive urban and agricultural land use , and Mediterranean climate characterized by distinctive rainfall and temperature patterns .
We assess 8 different potential scenarios for the future of the California flora in the face of climate change .
These are the combinations of three pairs of possibilities .
First , we compared two projections of future emission levels from human activities .
One is higher , with global CO 2 emissions reaching almost 30 GtC per year , or 4 times present - day levels , by 2100 ( SRES A1FI ) while the other emission scenario is lower , with CO 2 emissions rising slightly by mid-century before dropping to below present - day levels by the end of century ( SRES B1 ) [ 22 ] .
By 2100 , global atmospheric CO 2 levels reach 550 and 970 ppm under the lower and higher emissions scenarios , respectively .
Second , we compared projections centered 80 years from now ( 2070 –2099 ) from two global climate models with higher and lower sensitivities to atmospheric greenhouse gas levels .
The U.K. Meteorological Centre 's Hadley Centre Coupled Model version 3 ( HadCM3 ) model [ 23 ] – [ 24 ] is moderately sensitive to increases in emissions , while the DOE / NCAR Parallel Climate Model ( PCM ) is less sensitive [ 25 ] .
Third , we explored two distinct and widely used dispersal scenarios : one where plants exhibit unrestricted movement to new locations , and one with no movement [ 26 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 18 ] .
Projecting the impacts of climate change to an entire endemic flora is complicated by scarce and variable distribution data .
Studies conflict on how many geo-referenced specimens are necessary to obtain robust species projections [ 27 ] , [ 28 ] .
Including poorly known species risks biasing projections of biodiversity patterns if the error is directional .
In contrast , poorly known species may have smaller ranges , and small ranged species are known to be more vulnerable to extinction [ 29 ] .
Excluding such species may be equally inappropriate .
A recent study recommends using Maxent and at least 30 non-validation specimens for robust species projections [ 28 ] .
Following these recommendations , we model and evaluate the 591 out of 2387 California Floristic Province endemic species that have at least 42 specimens using Maxent [ 30 ] .
Specimen records were obtained from the Consortium of California Herbaria , a centralized portal accessing over 959,000 specimens from 16 herbaria [ 31 ] .
To address whether poorly known species tend to have small ranges , we compile an independent dataset of range maps for each species to compare with the number of specimens .
( We refer to these as TJM1 range maps , see Materials and Methods . )
To assess whether excluding poorly known species biases diversity patterns , we build a multilevel generalized linear model ( MLGLM ) [ 32 ] incorporating all 2069 species with at least 2 specimens .
This model simultaneously estimates relationships between the probability of a plant being found in a location , and climatic variables .
It does so both at the level of each species as well as the entire flora .
The hierarchical structure of this model gives an unbiased predictor of climate influences on presences , and allows poorly known species to draw inferential strength from the flora as a whole [ 33 ] .
As a result , the model is informed by data from all species , but the influence of poorly known species is properly weighted against the flora .
We then compare biodiversity patterns from this hierarchical approach with Maxent projections from the best known 591 species .
To summarize the impacts of climate change on the California flora and to compare the projections with other studies , we ask four questions .
First , where will endemic species diversity be most influenced by climate change ?
Second , if species are permitted to move , where will they go ?
Third , how do we project range sizes to change ?
Fourth , where do we expect future refugia — locations where species at risk from climate change will persist under future climates ?
To date no studies have mapped the locations of such refugia .
Look at the last few months , he said : President Bush went to the Middle East in January , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice went in February , Vice President Dick Cheney went in March , the secretary of state went again in April , and the president is there again this week .
After all that , oil prices are as high as ever and peace prospects as low as ever .
As Mr. Miller puts it , America right now “ cannot defeat , co-opt or contain ” any of the key players in the region .
The big debate between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is over whether or not we should talk to Iran .
Obama is in favor ; Clinton has been against .
Alas , the right question for the next president is n’t whether we talk or do n’t talk .
It ’s whether we have leverage or do n’t have leverage .
When you have leverage , talk .
When you do n’t have leverage , get some  by creating economic , diplomatic or military incentives and pressures that the other side finds too tempting or frightening to ignore .
That is where the Bush team has been so incompetent vis -à - vis Iran .
The only weaker party is the Sunni Arab world , which is either so drunk on oil it thinks it can buy its way out of any Iranian challenge or is so divided it ca n’t make a fist to protect its own interests  or both .
We ’re not going to war with Iran , nor should we .
But it is sad to see America and its Arab friends so weak they ca n’t prevent one of the last corners of decency , pluralism and openness in the Arab world from being snuffed out by Iran and Syria .
The only thing that gives me succor is the knowledge that anyone who has ever tried to dominate Lebanon alone  Maronites , Palestinians , Syrians , Israelis  has triggered a backlash and failed .
“ Lebanon is not a place anyone can control without a consensus , without bringing everybody in , ” said the Lebanese columnist Michael Young .
“ Lebanon has been a graveyard for people with grand projects . ”
In the Middle East , he added , your enemies always seem to “ find a way of joining together and suddenly making things very difficult for you . ”
Questa sera poco prima di cena mi chiama una mia amica e , dopo un pò che
chiaccheriamo , la telefonata arriva ad un punto cruciale :
F ohiiii…….senti…..una info di servizio
P eh….. dimmi
F tu hai mai fatto sesso a tre ?
P scusa ???? ma ke domande fai ?
F ma no sai ….. la persona che frequento mi ha fatto capire che la cosa potrebbe stuzzicarlo …
P e quindi ? da me ke vuoi ?
dovrei essere io il terzo ?
F ma noooo ….. chiedevo , giusto per avere un ’ opinione …….
P da me ?
F eh … .. non si sa mai……………
P ma ke sono la cicciolina dei poveri ??? ”
…omissis…..omissis……omissis
Pur non ritenendomi bigotta , ammetto di non aver mai avuto un ’ esperienza del genere .
E’ un male se non mi intriga ?
Non credo .
Probabilmente è proprio questo il motivo per il quale non capisco le persone che ne rimangono affascinate , così come non capisco le persone che praticano lo scambio di coppia .
Il sesso va bene praticato in tutte le sue forme …..o quasi …..
Diciamo che il rapporto a due è uno dei “ modus canonici ” ammessi di buon grado . 😀

SAVE AND SACRIFICE
A large part of the war propaganda effort demanded sacrifice in terms of daily activities - saving waste fats for use in explosives , saving tin cans , eating leftovers , recycling paper , growing vegetables and canning them for home use , saving gasoline by driving cars slower and less often .
Appeals directly to women became a major element in poster propaganda , from asking women to enlist in the armed forces to encouraging housewives to conserve home resources .
The government fought price fixing and black market prices with rationing .
All Americans needed to share in the burdens of shortages equally .
Not to share in sacrifices for victory was an unpatriotic act , and often was reported .

In 1900 , the body of an unidentified young woman ,
an apparent suicide , was pulled from the river Seine in Paris .
Enchanted by the mysterious corpse ’s beauty , a morgue worker made a
plaster cast of the woman ’s face .
Copies of this “ drowned Mona Lisa , ”
as Camus would later describe her , soon proliferated across Paris ,
appearing first in the city ’s salons and finally in its literature .
Nabokov wrote a poem titled “ L’Inconnue de la Seinne . ”
Rilke mentioned
her in his only novel .
Man Ray photographed her .
A character in Louis
Aragon ’s novel Aurélien tries to resurrect her .
In the The Savage God : A Study of Suicide , Al Alvarez writes , “ I am told that a whole generation of German girls modeled their looks on her… the Inconnue became the erotic ideal of the period , as Bardot was for the 1950s . ”
In 1958 , the Inconnue was used as the model for the face of Rescue
Annie , a popular CPR training mannequin still in use today .
Hers is
perhaps the most kissed face of all time .
The findings run counter to a prevailing view that the change happened abruptly , within a few centuries , about 5,500 years ago , marking the end of the “ African Humid Period ” when monsoon rains poured down on the region .
That view arises from ocean sediment cores drilled off the coast of Africa , to the west of Mauritania .
In 2000 , analysis of the cores by researchers led by Peter B. deMenocal of Columbia University ’s Lamont - Doherty Earth Observatory showed a sudden rise in the dust blown off Africa at that time .
Dr. Kröpelin did not dispute the ocean core data , but said it had been “ overinterpreted . ”
Data about what was happening on land is sparse , because sands blow around and do not preserve a clear geological record the way lake sediments do .
But at Lake Yoa , the water that filled underground aquifers during the humid period , which began 14,800 years ago , is still flowing out into the 80 - foot - deep lake .
The groundwater is enough to offset the six meters of water that evaporates out of the lake every year , Dr. Kröpelin said .
Only a few millimeters of rain fall a year .
Dr. Kröpelin said he hoped to return to Lake Yoa next year to drill a deeper core that could trace the climate history back 12,000 years .
Dr. deMenocal praised Dr. Kröpelin ’s research .
“ I think it ’s a very good body of work , ” he said .
“ It ’s really the only thing of its kind from the arid interior . ”
But he wondered , he said , whether the pollen might have come from the area just around immediately surrounding the lake and not the larger Sahara .
“ On the face of it , it ’s puzzling , ” said Jonathan A. Holmes , director of the Environmental Change Research Center at University College London in England .
Dr. Holmes said both sets of research had been carefully done , and the challenge will be to put together a more complex history of the Sahara ’s climate .
I guess I 'd consider these " Best of The Sneeze " runners - up .
Pretty Ducked Up
I heard Ernie singing the " Rubber Duckie " song on Sesame Street this morning .
I guess I had never paid close attention to the lyrics before , because in the second verse Ernie sings : ********************
" Rubber Duckie , joy of joys
When I squeeze you , you make noise
Rubber Duckie you 're my very best friend , it 's true " ********************
What about Bert ?!
Does he know about this ??
I can just see poor Bert at home , making Ernie 's bed with the TV on in the background .
This song comes on while he 's fluffing Ernie 's pillow just so .
Then Ernie happily confesses that after all this time a cheap rubber toy is actually his " very best friend , " and Bert 's little muppet world comes crashing down around him .
Later
Bert desperately tries to figure out where he went wrong as he sits in the kitchen , sobbing and sipping chamomile tea .
His felt cheeks soaked with tears .
Way to go , Ernie , you giggly orange prick .
The Search Engine That Cares
As a kid I was obsessed with the Guinness Book of World Records .
It was the greatest .
I would order it every year at school .
I 'll proudly admit , I did n't care much about the amazing feats of the record - holders , so much as I just liked gawking at the pictures of freaky people .
One image burned into my memory for life was the fat twins riding motorcycles .
Here they are .
Billy and Benny McCrary .
All 1300 pounds of them .
They also went by the stage names Billy and Benny McGuire .
Surely this allowed them to avoid recognition while not performing .
When I first tried searching for the above picture , I googled the phrase " World 's Fattest Twins . "
Good ol '
Google served up a few links , but also gently tried to help me not be such a lame weirdo .
It suggested that maybe I meant to be looking up other things , and that we could just chalk this up to a typo .
Thanks , Google .
I appreciate it , but at this point you 're too late to help me .
Human Ripeness Chart
I 'm in my 30's , and things are not what they once were .
While I was staring at my face playing a fun new game called " Freckle or Cancer " I came to the conclusion that we are all just rotting fruit .
We go about our lives , have jobs , kids , do whatever it is we do -- but at the end of it all , I 'm not sure there 's much difference between us and that bowl of aging bananas sitting in your kitchen .
I 've prepared the following Banana / Human Ripening Chart to help illustrate my point ( and make myself feel even worse ) .
***********************************
Childhood
We all start off as babies , and bananas are no different .
You 've heard of a beginner or a novice described as being too " green ? "
Well , there you go .
There 's really not much you can do with a banana at this age except keep it safe and wait .
If for some reason you find bananas this age inviting , there 's something wrong with you .
If you find humans this age inviting , there 's something extremely wrong with you .
Teenage Years
This banana is coming along nicely , but is still pretty immature .
It 's in that awkward stage , but its complexion is about to clear up and there 's a very bright future ahead .
20's Here 's a banana that 's coming into its own .
Firm and ready for action .
What path will it take ?
A smoothie ?
A cereal topping ?
A sexual aid and then a cereal topping ?
So many possibilities .
The world is this banana 's oyster .
30's - 40's
This is a banana that 's peaking .
It is at the top of its game , but small brown spots are starting to appear on its skin .
It tends to get bruises more easily now .
These are the tell - tale signs of future demise .
50's - 60's
This banana is getting on in age , but is by no means useless .
While it 's not what it used to be , it is actually ideal for being around younger bananas to help them get ripe .
Not unlike a teacher .
Old Age Just like a sweet old lady , this banana is n't good for much more than a cake , or maybe some muffins .
Oof
We 've reached our final destination .
Hope you enjoyed the trip .
See you all in the compost heap .

The other day I bought lunch at McDonald's .
My receipt was attached to the bag with a small sticker proudly proclaiming their latest slogan : " i'm lovin ' it . "
As I gnawed on a so - so fry , I wondered exactly who was lovin ' what .
Apparently I was lovin ' McDonald 's , I guess .
I do n't remember being consulted , but there it was in sticker - form .
It was even trademarked , so I guess my lovin ' must be heartfelt and true .
Granted , McDonald 's and I have a history , but is n't this all a little presumptuous ?
And do they really need to be dragging the L word into it ?
They did n't even have the courtesy to say they were lovin ' me back !
( I wo n't lie .
It stings . )
I thought I 'd help Ronald out and whip up my own set of McStickers that cover a slightly larger emotional spectrum ...

Taste the Rainbow of Frustration
It has been my experience that when a cute girl is flirting heavily with you and then she takes her shirt off , you are about to do sex .
This , however , is not the case at strip clubs and it's part of my problem with them .
I 'm especially not a fan of the mostly - naked girls talking to the patrons .
To me , engaging in a conversation with women and their nipples who are only interested in my money , is a weird and frustrating experience .
I 'm fully aware that they are doing this flirting to get more money .
But when it 's happening , all I can think about is that I know this flirting is fake , but they do n't really know that I know the flirting is fake .
And how dare they think I 'm just a gullible idiot who does n't understand the flirting is fake ?
My friends say I 'm overthinking .
That it does n't matter that it 's fake .
That I should just relax and enjoy it .
That when you go to Disneyland and see Mickey Mouse walking around , you know he 's not real either , but it 's still good to see him .
That all makes sense , but I still feel like I 'm going to a restaurant and paying to smell the steak .
Luckily I love my wife and once you get married you 're no longer attracted to any other woman anyway ( especially Jessica Alba ) , so none of this is really an issue .
But what I 'm really trying to say here is , I do n't like the new Skittles Gum .
Skittles gum has perfectly replicated the Skittles experience .
Except you can't eat them .
They are the same shape and size of real Skittles .
The flavor is identical to real Skittles .
And even though it 's gum , the texture is still bizarrely close to real Skittles .
The whole thing is like candy torture .
I tried convincing myself that they are brilliant .
That they 're the closest thing to an Everlasting Gobstopper , like Skittles that just last a really long time .
Except that every two chews , all I want to do is swallow it .
I think when I want to " taste the rainbow " I 'll stick to real Skittles .
And not Skittles gum : the strippers of candy .

Sumitomo Electric has developed what is being called the world 's first automobile powered by a superconducting motor .
The electric passenger sedan ( a modified Toyota Crown Comfort ) , which is powered by a high - temperature superconducting motor cooled by liquid nitrogen , was unveiled in Osaka on June 12 and will go on display at the Hokkaido Toyako G8 Summit on June 19 .
Superconductors -- energy - efficient materials that can carry electrical current without resistance -- are used in applications ranging from medical devices to linear motors for trains .
Until now , however , they have never been used to power an automobile , says Sumitomo , who developed an ultra-powerful 365 - kw superconducting motor last year .
Sumitomo's motor uses high - temperature superconducting wires instead of the copper wire typically used in the coils in electric vehicle motors .
When cooled to - 200 degrees Celsius , electrical resistance and current loss are reduced to nearly zero , so the motor can operate with greater energy efficiency and torque -- in other words , the motor uses less electricity to do the same amount of work .
The company says the prototype vehicle can travel more than 10 % farther than conventional electric vehicles running on the same type of battery .
The development comes as demand for electric vehicles grows , and as manufacturers step up efforts to improve battery and motor performance to increase the distance that vehicles can travel on a single charge .
Sumitomo intends to further improve the motor with the aim of putting a vehicle on the market in the not - too - distant future .
The company is looking to develop superconductor motors for buses and trucks as well .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A U.S. anti-drug aircraft strayed into Venezuelan airspace Saturday night , the United States acknowledged Monday , ratcheting up tensions between the two nations .
Ministers Gustavo Rangel Briceno , left , Nicolas Maduro , center , and Gen. Jesus Gonzalez denounce the incursion .
The pilot " recognized his error and contacted a Venezuela tower to acknowledge that , " said Tom Casey , spokesman for the U.S. State Department .
He said the pilot realized a " navigation error " had occurred and told the tower " he would immediately return to international airspace . "
However , at a news conference in Caracas , Venezuela , Defense Minister Gustavo Rangel Briceno said Venezuela believes that the U.S. military intentionally breached the country 's airspace , adding that the U.S. ambassador will be summoned to the Foreign Ministry to explain the incident .
" It 's likely that this sort of thing has happened before and it was n't detected or was n't condemned , " Rangel Briceno said .
" It 's probable , too , that they are testing us , but we should make it clear that these days , we do have the equipment to confront them and to cover all of our airspace . "
While acknowledging that the American pilot told air traffic controllers at Venezuela 's main Maiquetia airport that he " was n't aware of his location , " Rangel Briceno said that " we believe that that 's not the case . "
" We believe that this was a conscious action on the part of the United States Navy , that it 's no more than another link in the chain of provocations that they want to ensnare our country in , " he said .
Casey said Venezuela had not formally contacted the U.S. Embassy in Caracas about discussing the incident .
The U.S. , he said , is " happy to speak about this with the Venezuelan government authorities . "
Casey called it an " isolated incident " that was " simply an issue where an error was made and acknowledged at the time . "
There is no change in U.S. policy toward Venezuela , he said .
The Navy S - 3 Viking had taken off from a base in Curacao as part of Joint Interagency Task Force South , which conducts counter - drug operations in South America , a U.S. military official told CNN .
The official declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak publicly about the event .
The official said the plane had been experiencing " intermittent navigation problems . "
The crew was told by controllers in Curacao to switch frequencies to a control center in Venezuela .
At that point , the Venezuelan air controllers accused the Navy crew of flying into their airspace , the official said .
The Navy crew gave all information about its identity and location to the Venezuelans during a three - minute radio call between both sides .
The official said the conversation was " polite " but there were some " language barriers . "
Tensions between United States and Venezuela have risen in recent years , with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez accusing the Bush administration of covert activity and strong - arming United Nations members .
The United States views Chavez -- who has called President Bush the " devil " -- as a negative force in the region and protested its bid for a seat on the U.N. Security Council .
Curacao is an island that is part of the Netherlands Antilles , just off the northern coast of Venezuela .

Social software sites like Flickr and Digg are n't just distracting you from your job — they could actually make your job disappear in the next high tech economic revolution .
Get ready to retrain yourself right now .
A new book by NYU interactive telecommunications professor Clay Shirky , Here Comes Everybody : The Power of Organizing without Organizations , is a good place to start .
Although Shirky predicts the demise or extreme downscaling of a lot of familiar jobs right now — everything from design to procedural legal work — he 's also got a lot of telling observations about the future of work , social relationships , and even politics , based on years of researching how people communicate online .
We cornered Shirky on IM and asked him about the future of our jobs in a world where everyone can publish and collaborate online for free .
Advertisement
io9 : So you 're talking about these social tools , and how communities can use them , but of course you 're also talking about " user generated content , " which is one way of saying " get people to work for you for free . "
CS : Depends on your frame of reference .
io9 : Are we looking at a future where getting a job means working for free for many years before you get to be a developer or producer for cash ?
Advertisement
CS : If we think of Flickr as being like a newspaper , then yes , the content that was previously paid for is now free .
But if you think of flickr as being like a bar , then what you get instead is that the user conversation now creates value for people out of earshott .
No one complains that the bar marks up its booze prices because it's a place for people to get together .
io9 : So the bar gets paid for your conversations ?
CS : I think the whole ' you work , we collect the money ' model has been over - emphasized by the fact that professional media covering these new tools will of course be biased to take the current media model as the ' correct ' one .
Merchants , a bar in Manhattan , charges $ 17 for a martini .
Know what goes into a $ 17 martini ?
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
io9 : What ?
CS : $ 3 of gin and $ 14 of " I 'm in a bar where people pay $ 17 for a martini ! "
io9 : But that makes Flickr sound like an elite place where you pay to be around beautiful rich people .
Advertisement
CS : So the change in the price of drinking gin at home alone , or in a bar with others , is mainly a metric of social value , and we 're quite used to paying the platform operator , which in this case would be the bar owner , for making a site where that value can accrue .
Of course the whole ' is it a newspaper or a bar ' thing is even one level too shallow .
The thing Flickr is most like is Flickr .
It has all kinds of novel characteristics which are exactly the things that get obscured by metaphor .
So when media people look at Flickr ( or Digg or YouTube ) as new competitors in an existing media ecosystem , instead of a new ecosystem , they create bias towards old metrics .
Oh , and to your earlier comment , I do n't mean to suggest that Flickr always equals merchants , just that we are more than used to business models where almost all of the value in the establishment comes from value the patrons create for themselves .
It 's just that the press doest see ( or sees and does n't like ) that comparison , because its hard to argue that some injustice is being doen when viewed in the light of social life rather than media production .
Advertisement
io9 : The problem I guess with the bar analogy is that the most " valuable " bars to be in are often valuable because they are full of elite people — which is sort of the opposite of what I think you 're hoping for in this book .
CS : Well , even a $ 2 well drinks dive has the same economics .
Consider happy hour .
There is a discount on the nominal product precisely to create the necessary bit of social value .
Advertisement
io9 : So to get back to the question of getting paid .
Sounds like you 're saying that we 're tending toward a model where the people who make content ( or art or writing ) do n't get paid ,
but the people who make the tools that let them express themselves do .
CS : That is one part of the effect .
Another part is that , on average people wo n't get paid , because the pool of creators has gotten too large .
But significant talent will still be rewarded .
Wedding photographers and stock photo people are going to get creamed .
But Herb Ritts ' fees may go up .
When the bottleneck is not longer worth paying for ( because it mostly does n't exist ) talent becomes the only differentiating metric .
Advertisement
io9 : So the elite content producers may get more ?
CS : I think so .
io9 : Obviously a lot of people are decrying this idea , particularly in the media — " oh no we 're losing taste makers ! "
Advertisement
CS : We 're not losing taste makers !
I hate that argument — we 're gaining taste makers , at an unbelivable rate .
We 're losing scarcity .
io9 : So do you think in the end we 'll get a world where more people will be compensated to do creative work ?
Or that creative work will become more lilke cooking , where everybody does it ?
Advertisement
CS : More people overall , maybe , but many fewer on average .
And most of the ones who do get compensated do n't have it as their main source of income .
io9 : Which other industries do you see this change affecting ?
CS : Anything where there is a production bottleneck .
So the obvious ones are non-litigation lawyering , librarians , anyone in the media distribution business , but also the info managing pieces of things like industrial design , medical decision making , etc .
Advertisement
io9 : Are you worried at all that people might use your book to exploit users ?
CS : Most of the uses of this sort of group - forming are hard to fake over any length of time ( imagine a fake open source project — the coders would bail in a matter of weeks ) , but the uses of social tools for groups from Al Qaeda to the pro-anorexia kids seems to me to be the biggest social threat that will come from the medium .

For the first time , a study combines measurements of abnormalities in the eye with models for assessing how well an individual can see , meaning it may be possible to program a machine to automatically produce prescriptions for corrective lenses .
The model for predicting visual clarity — based on measurements taken by today ’s highly accurate aberrometers — could also enable surgeons to more accurately assess and correct the vision of patients undergoing lasik or refractive surgery .
New technology in aberrometers means ophthalmologists and others can accurately measure refractive error and other abnormalities in the eye ’s optics .
But these instruments cannot use these measurements to predict visual acuity , or how well a person can actually see .
Usually , ophthalmologists and optometrists rely on a patient ’s ability to identify characters on an eye chart to determine visual clarity .
A study recently published in the online , peer - reviewed Journal of Vision ( http://www.journalofvision.org/8/4/17), published by the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology ( ARVO ) evaluates the performance of several simple metrics that predict visual acuity from wavefront aberrations — the eye measurements provided by an aberrometer .
To do so , authors Andrew B Watson and Albert J. Ahumada Jr ( both of NASA Ames Research Center , CA ) make a clear distinction between a metric and model .
“ A metric is a formula that describes a quantitative relationship , ” explains Watson .
“ It is accurate but not necessarily adaptable to different situations .
A model is a mechanistic description that explains why a relationship exists .
If the parameters of a model change , one can make predictions of how an outcome will change . ”
The authors developed a model that successfully predicts visual acuity using both wavefront aberrations and simulations of the complex task of identifying individual letters from the widely used Sloan letter set .
They then designed a simple metric that performs as well as the more elaborate model .
The metric could be used internationally .
Explains Watson : “ The same metric , because of its generality , can predict acuity measured with other symbol sets , such as Chinese characters .
“ With this metric , the aberrometer will be able to give direct predictions of visual acuity , and could also provide an automatic optimal refractive prescription for the patient . ”

PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama has , for the moment , re-established a double - digit lead over Hillary Clinton in national Democratic voters ' nomination preferences in Gallup Poll Daily tracking , 52 % to 42 % .
Since just after the North Carolina and Indiana primaries , Obama has led Clinton nearly every day , including a stretch of double - digit leads in the May 18 - 22 Gallup Poll Daily tracking releases .
Since then , his advantage had been slightly less , at five to eight percentage points , but is back to a 10 - point lead in the latest data .
( To view the complete trend since Jan. 3 , 2008 , click here . )
Just three primary contests remain , and news reports suggest that the dispute over the Michigan and Florida convention delegations will not be resolved in the best possible way for the Clinton campaign .
The Democratic National Committee will meet this weekend and likely allow either half those states ' delegates to attend , or the full delegations to attend , but with each member given half a vote .
Thus , it is a near certainty that Obama will have clinched enough delegates to win the nomination under the current rules , and Clinton 's only hope of winning the nomination may reside in lawsuits or a convention floor fight .
In a bit of a change from recent days , Obama and Clinton are both running similarly versus John McCain in the general election .
Clinton had fared better in recent trial heats than Obama , but the latest update shows both races as statistical ties -- Clinton 47 % , McCain 45 % and Obama 46 % , McCain 45 % . -- Jeff Jones
Survey Methods
For the Gallup Poll Daily tracking survey , Gallup is interviewing no fewer than 1,000 U.S. adults nationwide each day during 2008 .
The Democratic nomination results are based on combined data from May 25 and 27 - 28 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 1,279 Democratic and Democratic - leaning voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
The general election results are based on combined data from May 23 - 25 and 27 - 28 , 2008 .
For results based on this sample of 4,365 registered voters , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±2 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

ADDICTS BECAME STABLE ON PRESCRIBED HEROIN
For Many , Intake Of Drugs Declined
For many hardcore heroin addicts , the hustling begins first thing in the morning .
They wake up with one thing in mind : how to get their next fix .
Some turn to panhandling , prostitution or crime to come up with the cash .
But a heroin study seems to have changed that for some Montreal addicts .
North America 's first research study on medically prescribed heroin will wrap up in a few weeks .
The goal of the North American Opiate Medication Initiative , funded by the Canadian Institute of Health Research , is to examine harm reduction and the treatment of illicit drug use .
The $ 8 - million clinical trial started in 2005 in Montreal and Vancouver , the site of Insite , North America 's only safe - injection site .
As the project winds down , Quebec is considering setting up a safe - injection facility in Montreal , Health Minister Philippe Couillard said Wednesday .
But unlike a safe - injection site , where addicts inject themselves with their own illegal street drugs under the supervision of a nurse , the research study uses medically prescribed pharmaceutical - grade narcotics .
Although the findings will not be published until the fall , the preliminary results are promising , said Suzanne Brissette , one of the study 's doctors and the lead investigator in Montreal .
In Montreal , addicts were allowed to come to the clinic three times a day to get their fix .
They had to have repeatedly failed the standard treatment of oral methadone , a morphine - like substitute for heroin .
" What was surprising was that as their lives gained stability , many came only twice a day , " Brissette said .
In addition , the maximum heroin dose allowed was about 400 milligrams , but on average , addicts chose to take only 170 milligrams at a time .
" Because the heroin was free , people thought an escalation in use would occur .
But this did n't happen , " Brissette said .
Many users also put on weight and some managed to find jobs , Brissette said .
" Instead of worrying about their next fix , they had time to worry about far more important issues , like their health and finding a job or an apartment , " Brissette said .
Martin Schechter , principal investigator in Vancouver , has said in the past that women have thanked researchers because they no longer have to sell their bodies for drugs .
Although the study has a team of doctors , nurses and social workers to counsel participants about their options once the study ends , the future for the most serious addicts is grim .
The study required an exemption from the federal Controlled Drugs and Substances Act .

PESHAWAR , Pakistan ( Reuters ) - A pilotless U.S. drone was suspected to have fired a missile into a Pakistani area on the Afghan border on Tuesday , but there was no word on the target or casualties , a government official said .
The missile was thought to have been fired into the Mohmand ethnic Pashtun tribal area in northwest Pakistan where this year , U.S. - controlled Predator aircraft have struck at least four sites used by al Qaeda operatives , killing dozens of suspected militants .
“ There was an attack by a spy plane close to the Afghan border but we do n’t have information about casualties or damage , ” said the government official based in the region .
He declined to be identified .
Mohmand has not been a hotbed of support for al Qaeda and the Taliban but militants are known to operate there .
A Pakistani military spokesman said there had been a clash in the area but on the Afghan side of the border , where Afghan forces had been battling militants .
Neither U.S. nor Pakistani authorities usually confirm U.S. missile attacks on Pakistani territory , which would be an infringement of Pakistani sovereignty .

Both the Obama and McCain camps are involved in heated exchange over whether or not John McCain intentionally distorted , or just did n’t know the troop levels in Iraq .
The McCain camp ’s defense seems to be to blame Obama , and say that he knew what McCain meant .
Here is the video of what McCain originally said :
Advertisements
His campaign put out a statement accusing Barack Obama of weak leadership , “ Clearly John Kerry and Barack Obama have very little understanding of troop levels , but considering Barack Obama has n’t been to Iraq in 873 days and has never had a one on one meeting with General Petraeus , it is n’t a surprise to anyone that he demonstrates weak leadership .
What informed people understand , John McCain included , is that American troops are not even close to Surge levels . ”
The Obama campaign responded by asking McCain to explain why he got the numbers wrong , “ The McCain campaign still ca n’t explain why John McCain could be so clearly and factually wrong in stating that our troops are at ‘ pre- surge ’ levels .
They are not , and anyone who wants to be Commander - in - Chief should know better before launching divisive political attacks .
Once again , Senator McCain has shown that he is far more interested in stubbornly making the case for continuing a failed policy in Iraq than in getting the facts right . ”
The McCain campaign is going to keep singing this song about Obama not going to Iraq , not only because it plays into their narrative that Obama is too inexperienced to be president , but also it allows McCain to make the case things are changing in Iraq .
The problem is that the American people have been hearing about how things are getting better in Iraq for four years now .
2/3 of the American people oppose this war , so please McCain , keep trying to sell staying in Iraq .
These factual errors are becoming more common on the campaign trail for McCain .
This leads me to wonder if he is intentionally distorting the facts , or is he having senior moments ?

Everyone is talking about the new Quinnipiac University poll that shows Obama leading McCain in swing states Ohio , Florida , and Pennsylvania .
While his leads in Ohio and Florida are close to the poll ’s margin of error , his 12 point lead in the Keystone State leaves little doubt that this former Clinton state is moving towards Obama .
The question is what is fueling this movement ?
In Pennsylvania , Obama leads McCain 52 % - 40 % .
Obama ’s lead is being built on the support of Independents and women .
Among women , Obama leads McCain 57 % - 34 % .
Obama leads with Independents 50 % - 39 % .
It is no coincidence that Obama ’s lead with this critical group almost exactly mirrors his statewide margin .
At first it might appear to be a surprise that Obama leads McCain with white men 47 % - 44 % , but when you consider that the issue that is most important to these voters is jobs then the numbers make sense .
It also looks like McCain can forget about getting the support of Clinton voters in the state .
66 % of Clinton supporters in the state say that they now support Obama .
Only 24 % of the former Clinton supporters say that they will support McCain .
Obama also leads McCain with two core Clinton constituencies , white voters without college degrees , and older voters .
Obama leads McCain 47 % - 44 % among voters who do n’t have college degrees .
He also leads McCain 48 % - 43 % with voters over age 55 .
Advertisements
Obama now leads or tied with McCain in every part of the state .
Obama leads McCain on the top issues of the economy ( 56% - 37 % ) and the war ( 59% -30 % ) , and seventy five percent of the state ’s voters said that they have made up their minds about which candidate they are going to support .
In simple terms , Obama has built his lead in the state because the Hillary Clinton supporters that powered her to victory in the primary have moved to him .
He was helped in the state by Clinton ’s strong endorsement , and his campaign ’s shift to talking about the economy and jobs .
As long as Obama keeps his focus on the economy , McCain has no chance in this state .
I do believe that the 12 point lead is a little high for Obama right now , but there is no reason why he can’t win in November by the same nine point margin that Hillary Clinton won the primary by .

So shady is the “ suicide ” of Deborah Jeane Palfrey , even Fox News has questions .
For instance , Kimberly Guilfoyle , a former prosecutor and talking head on Fox News , does n’t buy the now commonly accepted — on corporate media venues , anyway — assertion that Ms. Palfrey was so depressed she went out in the car port of her mother ’s mobile home and hanged herself .
Guilfoyle made mention of Palfrey ’s appearance on the Alex Jones Show where she declared she would not commit suicide .
But Palfrey ’s vow was not mentioned anywhere on the corporate media , with the recent exception of Fox News .
As Alex said on his show this morning , it is indeed a “ strange world we live in ” now that Fox has allowed Guilfoyle to cast apsersion on the official version of reality .

But Chairman Mao was famously ambiguous about such weapons , once calling them “ paper tigers ” .
Over the years the country ’s nuclear arsenal has become more of a symbol of its great power status than a flexible adjunct to its military capabilities .
Screwy logic , biopiracy and Big Pharma scams
Was it a move out of financial desperation ?
We must either stop the FDA , or lose all access to herbs and supplements
( Natural News ) Big Pharma is constantly finding new ways to destroy the natural supplements market , in much the same way that the American Medical Association once sought to destroy the chiropractic industry ( for which it was later found guilty of conspiracy in U.S. courts , by the way ) .
The latest attack against vitamins comes from an FDA petition filed by Medicure Pharma , Inc. , which has astonishingly asked the FDA to ban the sale of Vitamin B6 !
Vitamin B6 , of course , is a naturally - occurring nutrient found in numerous vegetables , nuts and whole grains .
Its natural form is calledorfor short .
It 's an essential nutrient for expectant mothers , growing children and anyone who wishes to be healthy .
It 's absolutely crucial for healthy blood cell function , and it's used in over 100 enzymatic reactions involving protein metabolism .
So why would a pharmaceutical company petition the FDA to outlaw the sale of this essential nutrient ?
It 's simple : BecauseMedicure Pharma , Inc. , has been studying the clinical effects of Vitamin B6 ( which they call " MC - 1 " ) on humans .
This is part of a process for receiving FDA approval on MC - 1 as a " drug , " and then marketing this drug through the conventional medical system ( and selling it at markups that can reach 500,000 % over the cost of the actual ingredients ) .
This issue was reported by the , an outstanding health freedom organization that deserves your support .
You can read about this Vitamin B6 issue ( along with links to the petition ) at : Obviously , it is in the financial interest of Medicure Pharma , Inc. to not only receive FDA approval for their " MC - 1 " version of Vitamin B6 ; it 's also crucial to eliminate the competition .
After all , if people knew MC - 1 was just Vitamin B6 , they could go out and buy it on their own , for a fraction of the price of a prescription drug .
This is most likely why Medicure Pharma petitioned the FDA to outlaw Vitamin B6 supplements :
It 's the simplest and easiest way to eliminate the competition and guarantee profits !
So what 's the logic behind banning Vitamin B6 ?
It 's simple : Medicare Pharma wants the FDA to declare Vitamin B6 to be " adulterated " because it contains a drug .
Which drug does it contain ?
Well , MC - 1 , of course !
Do you see the circular reasoning here ?
Vitamin B6 is a naturally - occurring vitamin , but if a drug company gets FDA approval on Vitamin B6 ( with a different name ) , then that very same drug company can petition the FDA to ban Vitamin B6 , claiming it contains their drug !
I know this sounds incredibly stupid .
And it is .
But it is n't unprecedented .
In fact , the very same thing happened withA few years ago , drug companies discovered that red yeast rice ( a natural supplement ) contained powerful , natural compounds that balance cholesterol levels .
These compounds are called ( sound familiar ? )
Drug companies ripped off the lovastatin molecules from red yeast rice , then patented them .
Once they achieved FDA approval for their " statin drugs , " it was easy to file a petition requesting the outlawing of red yeast rice , claiming the supplement was " adulterated " with drugs !
Which drugs ?
Statin drugs , of course -- the very same drugs that were isolated from red yeast rice in the first place !
This is why the FDA has been on a terror campaign to outlaw red yeast rice supplements .
They 've sent warning letters to online retailers and threatened numerous companies with legal action .
The point of all this is to .
And it 's the exact same strategy now being following by Medicure Pharma in its attempt to get the FDA to ban Vitamin B6 .
Medicure Pharma , by the way , is losing its shirt .
It recently received notice from the American Stock Exchange that it would be " delisted " because it no longer meets the minimum requirement for shareholder equity vs. ongoing fiscal losses .
In other words , the company is losing too much money and has too little shareholder equity to even stay listed in the American Stock Exchange .
This might explain its decision to petition the FDA to outlaw the sale of Vitamin B6 ( P5P ) .
If consumers were unable to buy the vitamins , many would have no choice but to seek out the company 's own patented , high - profit MC - 1 version of the vitamin , and that would generate a windfall of profits !
Making money in the pharmaceutical industry , you see , is not about helping people in any real way ; it 's about limiting their options , controlling the marketplace , and This is , in fact , the underlying business model of the entire pharmaceutical industry :
Selling drugs at monopoly prices while outlawing competing products .
Any approval by the FDA is , in effect , a license to engage in monopolistic market practices .
And remarkably , the FDA even enforces this monopoly by threatening , intimidating and raiding the warehouses of competing product companies , especially if they 're in the " natural " products industry .
Even more remarkably , the FTC , which claims to protect fair market practices in the United States , has utterly ignored the monopoly practices of Big Pharma .
Yes , the same government office that went after Microsoft for creating a " monopoly " user interface in Windows seems to have no interest whatsoever in going after drug companies engaged in widespread , fraudulent monopoly marketing practices that are bankrupting the entire nation !
( How 's that for selective enforcement of trade practices ? )
Do you see where all this is ultimately headed ?
If the FDA is allowed to keep banning nutritional supplements while promoting the very same drugs synthesized from those natural sources , it could allow Big Pharma to commit widespread biopiracy , stealing all the good medicine from nature , claiming patent protection on the useful molecules , and getting the FDA to outlaw virtually all the natural substances from which those medicines were first derived .
It 's not a particularly brilliant strategy , but it is exceedingly effective at defrauding the public out of trillions of dollars in dishonest profits .
And the fact that this is going on today gives additional support to something I 've proposed for quite some time : I say , .
And yet today 's conventional medical system is set up precisely to profit from the ongoing disease of the People .
It is a system that offers no cures , no education and no honest information to the public about real health solutions .
It only offers a lifetime of ever - more - expensive patented pharmaceuticals that lead to a downward spiral of bad health and bad debt until more and more American families are left diseased and penniless , victims of a profiteering system of medicine that trades lives for profits as the foundation of its business model .
It is time for radical -- revolutionary , in fact ! -- changes to our system of medicine , and I believe that begins by ending all patent protection for medicines , genes and seeds .
These things belong to ALL the People , not just the rich , white fat cats who take home $ 300 million annual salaries by fraudulently selling dangerous prescription medications to people who are only harmed by them .
Watch NaturalNews tomorrow , for I 'll be publishing a grassroots action article that dares to call for revolutionary action designed to rebuild a new health care system following the coming collapse of the American Empire .
You sense it coming , do n't you ?
A year ago , you were skeptical , but now you know it 's true : Skyrocketing fuel prices , hiking food prices , collapsing real estate bubbles , the demise of the U.S. dollar in international markets , failed wars and massive inflation caused by the Fed 's bailout of rich white bankers ... these are all signs of a modern Roman Empire that 's about to collapse under the weight of its debt , disease and disastrous war mongering .
The end of American as we know it is coming .
And it will be replaced by a new nation , built upon the ideas of people like you and me ( those of us who can still think clearly because we 're not all drugged out on Ambien ... )
So read Natural News tomorrow to learn about what we need to doto rebuild a nation based in individual liberties , Free Speech , true health and respect for nature .

This principle could pave the way to a brighter future regardless of your stance on Global Warming .
The full report with sources and calculations is available for download in PDF format .
All numerical sources were obtained directly from publicly available government reports .
The calculations using this data are illustrated in the second appendix .
In the year 2006 , The United States generated 22 % of its electricity from petroleum products , 20.78 % of which was imported .
This breaks down to 20 % from Natural Gas , 18.78 % imported and 2 % from imported Crude Oil derivatives .
These totals accounts for 813 Billion kWh for Total Natural Gas , 763 Billion kW for imported Natural Gas and 81.3 Billion kWh for imported Crude Oil This translates into 844.3 Billion kWh of electricity created using petroleum imports .
To generate 763 Billion kWh of electricity using imported Natural Gas requires 3,177,260,000,000 ft^3 of Natural Gas at an electrical conversion rate of 240.26 kWh per 1000 ft^3 .
At a cost of $ 7.11 to convert 1000 ft^3 of Natural Gas to electricity equates to a cost of $ 22,590,318,600 .
This number is then added to the cost of importing this quantity of Natural Gas at a cost of $ 6.88 for 1000 ft^3 which calculates to $ 21,859,548,800 .
This result yields a total cost of $ 44,449,867,400 to produce 763 Billion kWh of electricity using imported Natural Gas .
To generate the Crude Oil contribution of 81.3 Billion kWh of electricity requires 57,448,117 bbls of Crude Oil at an electrical conversion rate of 1415.19 kWh per 1 bbl and accounts for 3.1 % of the Crude Oil deficit .
To convert 1 bbl of Crude Oil to electricity costs $ 58.80 and translates into a cost of $ 3,377,949,251 for the deficit amount .
This number is then added to the cost of importing this quantity of Crude Oil at a cost of $ 59.10 per 1 bbl resulting in an expenditure of $ 3,395,183,686 .
The combination of these calculation yields a total cost of $ 6,773,132,936 for producing 81.3 Billion kWh of electricity using imported Crude Oil .
At this juncture the final deficit is $ 51,223,000,336 a year to import and then generate 20.78 % of the US 's electrical output .
The objective now turns to the possibilities of creating this 20.78 % from other greener sources while still remaining economically viable .
A wind turbine manufactured by General Electric can produce 1,500 kW,2,500 kW and 3,500 kW depending on the model and geographic location of installation at a cost of roughly $ 1,680 per kW .
It is also estimated that any given windmill will operate at 25 % efficiency year round .
Using these figures to replace imported Natural Gas ' electrical production of 763 Billion kWh with Wind Power will cost approximately $ 585,196,924,101 ; while the cost to replace imported Crude Oil 's production of 81.3 Billion kWh with Wind Power is $ 62,324,435,318 .
The grand total required to establish this enormous Wind Power infrastructure would be $ 647,521,359,420 .
Using the three GE models requires between 179,867,044 , 259,008,544 and 431,680,906 turbines .
If we also acknowledge the fact that energy can be resold at a rate of approximately 2¢ / kWh - 10 ¢ / kWh additional funds can be raised .
According to the US Department of Energy the average resale value for wind power is $ 36 / MWh ( 3.6 ¢ / kWh ) and would equate to a resale value of $ 32,194,800,000 a year .
Based on these figures Wind Power could replace Fossil Fuel imports and recoup capital after 7.93 years if interest rates and inflation are ignored and even faster if they were considered .
The region in which a wind turbine is installed is an important factor to consider in achieving adequate electricity generation ; for this section we will use farmland as an estimate because it is often flat and therefore windy as well as easily accessible .
In 2002 there were 938.28 Million Acres of farm land in the US .
Using this information and the requirement for between 179,867,044 , 259,008,544 and 431,680,906 turbines to replace the electricity generation power of imported Petroleum leads to a turbine per acre ratio of .487 , .292 and .203 respectively for the 1,500 kW,2,500 kW and 3,500 kW models when applied to farmland data .
If these same turbine quantities are applied to total land in the USA the numbers then become .202 , .121 and .084 respectively for the 1,500 kW,2,500 kW and 3,500 kW models .
The kWh need per acre of farmland is 953.127 kWh and the ratio per acre for all land is 395.016 kWh in order to overcome the 844.3 Billion kWh produced from petroleum .
The information provided in the body of this report clearly shows that replacing petroleum imports with wind power could be an economically viable option capable of alleviating the USA 's dependence on foreign petroleum imports for electricity production .
This environmentally friendly approach would greatly reduce hazardous emissions released when petroleum is processed ; these same emissions disrupt the ozone layer and theoretically contribute to global warming .
But despite its excellent economic outlook there exist inherent issues that need to be addressed .
The turbine per acre ratios are simply too large to warrant serious consideration for installation on either farmland or for total land in the USA .
For this project to become a reality it would require mass adoption by the general public which raises additional concerns .
The baseline issue would be the steep initial cost preventing adoption by the working class while fundamentally benefiting the wealthy .
A system would have to be devised that would level the playing field for all demographics .
Two main proposals rise to the top .
The first would be to force all farmers to install the required number of windmills on their property , the installation and equipment would be paid for by the government , and the government would reap the resale profits of electricity sales .
However those resale profits would go directly into the farmer subsidy fund and if a given farmer qualified they would receive financial assistance , similar to the current system , but preferably with larger benefits because they are sacrificing some of their resources , mainly land , to provide energy to the country .
If the guidelines for farming assistance are not met , the government would simply be allowed to add that money to the budget .
There could be different tiers of commitment for the farmers to choose each with different subsidy options requiring certain threshold turbine per acre ratios to be met .
The second proposal would function in accordance with how the current electricity buy back laws work .
If a citizen generates excess electricity the utilities are required to buy it back .
In this situation the owner of the windmill would directly reap the profits of the electricity resale , but they would also be required to fund the initial investment .
This approach increases the time required for the government to breakeven but would also increase the focus on renewable energy and a stronger long term economic outlook .
This plan would require moderation to prevent only the rich from benefitting .
There could be a set number of windmills that all citizens were entitled to build or there could be some sort of moving multiplier , similar to the tax code that would place a cap on resale returns .
In either case the Department of Energy could regulate the process and have the power to make exceptions where necessary .
If a combination of these two proposals were applied wind power could replace imported petroleum for electricity generation in the USA and create an infrastructure of clean , renewable energy for years to come .
The only down side to such a proposal is the lack of analysis on other alternatives such as Solar Power that could potentially provide a greater advantage in cost and viability .
To provide an alternative comparison to Wind Power , the next publication will focus on the viability of Solar Power .
The results of our research align with the proposals put forth by the American Wind Energy Association and their goal for Wind Power to provide 20 % of America 's electricity by the year 2030 .
Update :
The objective and methods described in this plan match closely with that of a proposal presented by Al Gore on July 17th .
Al Gore 's plan calls for the replacement of fossil fuel generated electricity through the renewable resources of wind , solar and geothermal .
While our paper focuses strictly on how wind power could replace fossil fuels , the paper also provides detailed information pertaining how the USA uses fossil fuels to generate electricity and its associated cost .
The math behind Al Gore 's plan can be found in the second appendix .
Norman Baker is an American hero who has been detained against his will for more than three years .
His " crime " : owning too much property .
His sentence : a court - appointed guardianship on the brink of costing him everything he spent his life building .
His rights in this case : virtually none , significantly less in many ways than an actual law - breaking criminal .
His future if this continues : long - term de facto imprisonment , followed by abject poverty , if he has anything left at all .
A retired firefighter who once helped save a child 's life , Norman Baker is not suspected of terrorism .
He has never been charged with any statutory infraction , and has never been in any kind of trouble with the law .
But he has been stripped of his right to vote and access to his own assets , which appear to have been weel in excess of $ 1 million as little as three years ago .
Until he was placed in a nursing home against his will by the court - appointed attorney he is trying to reject , Norman Baker owned and managed two dozen rental properties , many of which he designed and built himself .
He also owned a 33 - acre farm , with four horses , an array of tractors and other heavy farm implements , a carefully preserved century - old barn , a restored farmhouse from which he drew steady rental income , and a 3,000 - square - foot brick home , which he also designed and built .
All Norman Baker 's properties were free of any liens or mortgages .
Before he was confined against his will to a nursing home , Norman Baker also had some $ 250,000 in cash and liquid investments above and beyond his real estate holdings .
He rented his properties and lived a quiet , private life .
Today , without writing a check or using a credit card or making a single bad investment , Norman Baker has less than $ 20,000 in cash .
Most of his rental properties are vacant .
Some have been flooded .
In one , a broken pipe has resulted in a water bill in excess of $ 19,000 .
Nearly all his properties , which were once entirely rented , are now vacant .
Some have been seriously vandalized .
A rental property business , which yielded a steady cash flow , is now bleeding cash every month .
Baker 's farm implements — including a tractor owned by his brother --- were sold by his unwanted guardian without his permission .
The guardian also sold the slate off the roof of Norman ’s carefully preserved antique hay barn , which may now be ruined by rainwater .
The roof of his farm house has also been damaged and left unmended .
The comfortable brick ranch home Norman built by hand is boarded up and rotting .
Its plush carpeting has apparently been stripped out .
Its interior fixtures are gone or rotting .
The concrete backyard swimming pool whose construction Baker oversaw is cracked and in ruins .
When we visited the property , Baker could only peer into the windows of his wrecked home .
It is posted against " trespassers .
" At one point in his involuntary guardianship , a medical examiner hired at Norman 's expense found him competent and recommended that he no longer need a guardian .
But the attorney running Baker 's guardianship refused to surrender control of Norman ’s assets .
He then brought back the same medical examiner for yet another examination .
This doctor then proclaimed he " changed his mind " and that Norman needed a guardian after all .
Norman was then billed some $ 2,000 for both examinations .
Since then , a Harvard - trained medical examiner has repeatedly tested Baker , who just turned 80 .
This doctor , whose most recent examination has been videotaped , has consistently found Baker competent to manage his own affairs and to hire his own professional help .
More than a year ago , a physician for the nursing home where Norman has been confined recommended that he be given an immediate discharge to the community .
Baker walks three miles a day inside the home , and does his own laundry .
He is dependent on no medications .
Norman Baker 's case is not an isolated one .
Usually guardianships are necessary where someone has no assets or no family and there has been no estate plan appointing a fiduciary .
However , throughout the United States , tens of thousands of elderly citizens with significant assets have been placed under court - appointed guardians .
Though regulations vary from state to state , the attorney - guardians are required to report periodically to the county probate court on the disposition of the assets .
Commonly , the attorneys charge fees for " managing " the property of their wards .
The law requires a guardian to act in the ward ’s best interests .
But often that is a major issue between the guardian and his ward that must be balanced by the Probate Judge , who is expected to act as the " superior guardian " .
By and large , legal guardians are expected to pay regular visits to their wards .
According to Baker , his court - appointed attorney has visited him just twice in more than two years .
Norman Baker has continuously requested that he have input in to the property management of his estate .
But he has been ignored .
Decisions have been made about Norman ’s bank account and his properties without his knowledge or input , and over his continued objections and complaints .
Baker 's court - appointed guardian was recently more than six months late in providing the court with a report on the status of Norman ’s assets .
Such reports are required by the Fairfield County court every two years , although the better practice is an annual account .
Baker 's cash assets have been drained , and many of his properties have been brought to the brink of ruin .
But it is unclear whether or not all his bills have been properly paid .
Acting on his own , Baker has managed to contract with independent counsel .
Susan Wasserman and Lewis E. Williams of Columbus have asked , on his behalf , that Fairfield County Probate Court Judge Stephen Williams set Baker free of his guardianship .
But Judge Williams has refused and Norman Baker remains confined to a nursing home against his will .
Baker 's troubles began in January , 2005 , when he suffered a urinary tract infection .
Reports for elder abuse are confidential and it is unclear who made the recommendation that his affairs be turned over to a guardian .
Whatever the situation at that time , Baker has long since recovered .
But he still remains under a guardianship established at a hearing in front of Judge Williams where Norman was not represented by legal counsel , and was not in the presence of a blood relative .
This fall , after numerous attempts to terminate the guardianship , Attorneys Wasserman and Williams moved in the Fairfield County court that Baker 's guardianship be vacated .
Ohio law stipulates that someone being subjected to a guardianship has the right to have his closest relative from within the state be present at the determination hearing .
Norman Baker ’s daughter was not notified because she was out of state , and notification to her was therefore not required by law .
But it was mandatory under the law that Norman Baker 's brother Robert be noticed , as he lives in - state and is " next of kin .
" Because guardianships are invasive proceedings , strict requirements are meant to safeguard situations in which a probate court has such unfettered power over a human being .
Norman ’s brother , Robert Baker , of Celina , Ohio , has since stated under oath that he would have attended the hearing had he known about it , and that he would have argued then --- as he does now --- that his brother did not want or need a legal guardian then , and does not want or need one now .
Robert Baker also charges that the attorney appointed by the court to be his brother 's guardian sold his own personal antique tractor --- inherited from his father --- from his brother Norman 's farm , and has never accounted for the proceeds .
Norman Baker 's farm has also been stripped of many of its accouterments without a full accounting .
Its buildings have been left to rot .
The land itself may be worth a million dollars or more .
Baker 's guardian has stated that he has gotten numerous calls from developers wanting to buy it .
Judge Williams has repeatedly refused to vacate the guardianship .
Nor has he set for hearing the objections filed by Baker to the late and incomplete accounting as to what precisely the Guardian has accomplished on his behalf .
By Ohio law , such an accounting was many months overdue until Norman Baker demanded that the account be filed .
In December , 2007 , at Norman Baker 's behest , Attorneys Wasserman and Williams filed a motion with the Chief Justice of the Ohio Supreme Court , Thomas Moyer , asking that Judge Williams be removed from the case .
Baker 's chosen attorneys argued that Judge Williams 's handling of the case " gives the appearance " that there is little hope of Norman Baker escaping his unwanted guardianship , and regaining his freedom with due process of law as guaranteed under the Ohio and U.S. constitutions .
Chief Justice Moyer has recently established a high - level commission charged with looking into the guardianship system in Ohio .
Nationwide , hundreds of cases similar to Norman Baker 's have been reported at places such as the www.stopguardianabuse.org web site .
The Los Angeles Times ran a major expose several years ago which has resulted in reform in many states .
Extreme as Baker 's case may seem , numerous state and local court records are filled with cases of guardianship discord .
Moyers turned down the request that Judge Williams be removed from the case .
An appeal on Judge Williams ’s denial of the motion to vacate the guardianship has been filed in the Ohio Court of Appeals , Fifth Appellate District .
Thus far , Norman Baker has been in constant litigation for three years against the guardian appointed over him by the court .
Norman ’s guardianship was imposed in a hearing at which he was unpresented by counsel , and had no relative at his side , even though his brother lives in the state .
He is no longer allowed to drive a car or vote .
He has been deprived of the management of his properties and of his cash accounts , which by all indications have been seriously mismanaged .
The home Norman built with his own hands has been largely ruined through neglect .
He has been unable to obtain a full accounting of what has been done with his assets .
In essence , someone who has committed a murder or robbed a bank has more rights than have been granted Norman Baker .
Though the furthest thing imaginable from a terrorist , Norman Baker has no access to habeas corpus , or to a speedy trial .
Every night , Norman Baker goes to bed in his unwanted nursing home , praying for his freedom .
If anything , his case stands as a bizarre warning against getting inconveniently ill , even briefly , while being in possession of enough assets to attract a legal guardian to " protect " you in your later years .
As a Franklin County firefighter , Norman Baker worked to save lives .
Now he must fight to save his own .

This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
In a comment I posted in the discussion that followed my Character Progression in Elements Eight entry , I hinted ( rather blatantly ) at a future essay about open versus closed die rolls for conflict resolution .
This is that essay .
what “ open ” vs. “ closed ” means
My use of the terms “ open ” and “ closed ” , in this case , refers to the statistical limits of one ’s die rolls .
For instance , in the simplest case , a d20 roll in D&D or Pathfinder results in a strict statistical limit on the results of the roll , in the range of 1 - 20 .
The probability curve for that roll is completely flat ; every single possible number in that range has a 5 % chance ( assuming an unweighted , random die roll ) of being the result .
While modifiers can change those results , the modifiers ( except in cases of fudging results ) exist before the roll is made — resulting in a series of twenty possible results , again in a flat curve with a 5 % chance per possible result .
All the modifiers do is shift the curve to the right or to the left — the curve itself is not changed at all .
This is a closed die roll .
An open die roll is one like , for instance , the 7th Sea system .
You roll Nd10 , where N is a number determined by your character ’s attributes and skills , and if you roll 10s you get to roll more dice to add onto the total .
There are circumstances where you are n’t allowed to add more dice , of course , and they qualify as closed rolls ( though more complex than the D&D example ) — but we ’ll stick with 7th Sea ’s open rolls for this example .
They ’re “ open ” because there is no theoretical limit to how high your roll can go — there ’s only a probabilistic limit .
It ’s somewhat improbable you ’ll get more than a 10 % boost to your total on such rolls , on average , and the probability drops off rapidly as the considered boost gets bigger .
There are other systems that offer open - ended results as well , and also systems that offer results that are superficially open but have hard limits ( such as the rule in Rifts that if you get a starting attribute of 16 or more you add d6 to the total , but it stops there ) .
how a closed roll affects the game
Closed rolls inherently tend to limit the realism of a game .
For instance , if someone has an AC of 30 in D&D , and two characters attack — one a sixth level fighter with a Strength of 16 and no other bonuses or penalties to the roll using a longsword , and the other a first level wizard with a Strength of 4 and no other bonuses or penalties to the roll using a dagger — the chance of hitting is exactly the same .
In each case , the character has a 5 % chance of hitting .
Realistically , you ’d expect two characters who vary so greatly in combat prowess to have differing chances of striking the enemy , but the closed roll system makes that impossible .
In some systems , rather than both of them hitting on a 20 and only a 20 , they might both just have zero chance of hitting at all , while in other systems they would both be able to hit within the same range ( in GURPS you succeed on a low roll , so a 3 - 4 automatically hits , or maybe a 3 - 5 — I have n’t played GURPS since 2001 ) .
In each case , though , the result is an unrealistic similarity of the chances of hitting even when comparing a skilled , experienced warrior with a combat incompetent , just because the enemy is good at dodging or otherwise presents a formidable challenge for to - hit rolls .
Obviously , there comes a point at which the difference in chance of hitting between two characters is so vanishingly small that it does n’t really matter — but that should only be the case when the chance of hitting itself is so vanishingly small that it does n’t really matter .
A skilled , experienced warrior should , up to that point , still have a better chance of hitting than the combat incompetent standing next to him .
It gets worse when you start incorporating critical hit and miss rules .
For instance , in D&D , you get a critical “ threat ” based on your raw die roll — which means everyone using the exact same type of weapon has the exact same chance of achieving a critical threat .
The actual confirmation of a critical hit might vary depending on individual character skill , of course , which helps somewhat to mitigate the unreality of it — but against high - AC opponents ( such as the 30 AC character in the previous example ) , the chance of a critical hit is again exactly the same between the two characters .
. . . but wait , there ’s more !
Beyond a specific disparity in combat stats , where the target ’s AC is sufficiently higher than the to - hit capabilities of the attacker , the chance of hitting and the chance of getting a critical threat are identical .
AC does n’t come into play in that at all — and increasing AC beyond that point does n’t affect the chance of being hit , or the chance of being subjected to a critical hit , at all .
Why should your chance of getting hit never be allowed to drop below 5 % , even if you are ( according to your stats ) ten times as difficult to hit as another character whose chance of getting hit by a given attack is also 5 % ?
some problematic open rolling systems
Most game systems that employ an open die roll system do a piss - poor job of it .
The same can be said of systems that superficially appear open , but are actually closed .
This is because most systems involve rolling dice , then adding more dice based on how the original dice were rolled , and adding together the results — and such systems tend to overlook the effects their mechanics have on statistical curves .
For example , in the Rifts attribute rolling case , you simply cannot have a character with an attribute roll of 16 .
If you roll a 16 in the initial roll , you eliminate that number by adding another d6 roll to it .
As a result , your possible attribute values , based solely on the roll , are 1 - 15 and 17 - 24 .
This kind of thing plays havoc with probability curves , essentially breaking them — and while many players never notice , it does have an effect on the flavor of the game ( as does every other game mechanic used ) .
In the 7th Sea system , probability curves are not smooth because of the extra dice rolled in cases of rolling tens .
This lends itself to min/max optimization on the part of intelligent players , as they realize that certain optimizations can be made to maximize the benefits of the expenditure of resources such as experience points , to say nothing of subtle skewing of success chances that directly result from the lack of smoothness in the probability curve ( it has “ bumps ” in it ) .
The old FASA Shadowrun system with its open - ended multi-d6 rolls suffered a similar problem .
If the problem is not apparent to you yet , consider that it ’s similar to the effect you get from the way attribute modifiers work in D&D : for every even number above 10 , you get an additional +1 to actions affected by that attribute .
For even the least powergaming prone of intelligent gamers , the temptation to maximize for advancement to even attribute numbers is difficult to resist — as improving your strength from 13 to 14 gets you far more benefit ( in the short term at least ) than improving your intelligence from 16 to 17 , even if your character is a wizard .
The D&D attribute system ’s modifiers comprise a problem big enough to deserve its own treatment , of course , but for now this should serve as an example of the largely psychological negative effects a “ bumpy ” curve can have on the gaming experience — leaving aside the purely mechanics oriented effects a discontinuous probability curve in a roll can have .
better open rolling systems
The challenge , then , is to come up with a system that allows for open ended rolls without hosing up your smooth probability curves .
I ’ve played a few games over the years that employed systems that succeeded in this regard , and I ’ve created more such systems than I ’ve played that were created by others .
The White Wolf system used in the original World of Darkness games ( I do n’t know , or much care , what new system might be used since the “ reinvention ” of the World of Darkness ) was well - designed in this regard .
Instead of rolling dice , adding up all numbers , and comparing to a target number to determine a single result , one would instead roll Nd10 where N is determined by one ’s attribute and skill numbers ( I ’m using generic terms — do n’t bother reminding me of talents and knowledges , please ) .
Each individual die roll would be compared to a target number , and a number of successes ( if any ) would be determined .
The general rule was that one success would be enough to achieve your end , barely , and three successes ( or more ) would be a more substantial overall success .
Rolling 10s on those dice allowed you to roll additional dice , which could then provide additional successes .
Another option is to have a simple “ critical die ” system , where you make your roll as normal ( e.g. a d20 to hit ) and roll a second die ( e.g. a d10 ) to determine whether you get a critical threat .
What you do when you roll a 10 on that second die is up to the imagination of the person creating the system — perhaps your base attack bonus is doubled , and you roll another d10 to see if you get to double it again ; perhaps you double your total roll and roll another d10 to see if you get to double it again ; et cetera .
It occurred to me back in about 1991 that every time you add another die to a total for a roll , you shift the upper limit of the curve quite a bit more than you shift the center of the curve — and , as such , it makes sense to add more dice to a roll if needed to open up the roll .
To get around the problem of a broken curve , you could allow extra dice to be added not when you rolled the highest number on the die , but the lowest instead .
With a sufficiently “ small ” die , you could actually do this without sacrificing any reasonable chance of getting a good roll when you get additional dice .
For instance , if you roll d20 to attack in D&D , adding another d20 whenever you roll a 1 is kind of pathetic : you only have a 5 % chance of getting a result that adds up to nothing more than shifting the possibilities from 1 - 20 up to 2 - 21 .
Who cares — right ?
With a d6 , though , you have a one in six chance of getting 2 - 12 .
Wait — you get a one in thirty - six chance of getting 3 - 18 .
No , wait — it keeps on going .
What if the base roll is 3d6 ?
Suddenly , you have a decreasing probability over an expanding curve of getting extra dice .
It ’s a slow progression , but depending on how difficult you want it to be to hit someone with an AC higher than 20 or so , that might work out perfectly for you .
If you want a greater chance to get higher numbers , you can use something like 4d4 or 5d4 instead of 3d6 ( and keep in mind that 3d6 actually tops out at 18 instead of 20 , which might imply a greater effectiveness of armor and Dexterity , perhaps offsetting the chance of getting higher numbers offered by an open ended attack roll — all consequences of changing the game system that have to be considered by a conscientious GM ) .
With Nd4 instead of Nd6 , the per - die chance of getting a 1 result on any given die is even higher , opening up the high end of the probability curve a bit more , but at the same time forcing the bulk of the probability in the total roll further toward the center of the curve .
Dealing with critical rolls in open roll systems can be interesting .
Obviously , you ca n’t usually just say “ If you roll the maximum , you get a critical hit . ”
There is no maximum .
Something I like to use as a determiner for critical hits is a comparison of the final roll with the target number , where a roll that adds up ( with all modifiers ) to double the target number means double damage , triple means triple damage , ad infinitum .
This especially works well with standard hit point systems , where you not only want to make it possible for an attacker to hit a higher level character without trivializing just how much higher level the defender is , but also want to give that attacker at least a snowball ’s chance in hell of winning .
In fact , this allows for the elusive one - hit kill — something sorely lacking in standard D&D above , say , third level — without making one - hit kills so common as to make the game almost too lethal to ever bother playing .
It even helps mitigate the problem with linearly quantified damage systems such as in Pathfinder and D&D somewhat .
one for the future
I have another open die roll system up my sleeve that I ’ll be using in Pathfinder in the future , coupled with the vitality / wounds system for handling damage , which I ’ll describe in a future essay .
I came up with it more recently because of the specific needs I have for improving on the mechanics of D&D / Pathfinder right now .
The multiple smaller dice idea was something I came up with to deal with shortcomings more specific to how 2nd Edition AD&D handled things , way back in the day .
Dec. 18 , 2006  --
Weeding through the value of the nation 's cash crops , a study released today states that marijuana is the U.S. 's most valuable crop and promotes the drug 's legalization and taxation .
Drug enforcement officials say the equation is not that simple .
The report , " Marijuana Production in the United States , " by marijuana policy researcher Jon Gettman , concludes that despite massive eradication efforts at the hands of the federal government , " marijuana has become a pervasive and ineradicable part of the national economy . "
In the report , Gettman , a marijuana - reform activist and leader of the Coalition for Rescheduling Cannabis , champions a system of legal regulation .
Contrasting government figures for traditional crops -- like corn and wheat -- against the study 's projections for marijuana production , the report cites marijuana as the top cash crop in 12 states and among the top three cash crops in 30 .
The study estimates that marijuana production , at a value of $ 35.8 billion , exceeds the combined value of corn ( $ 23.3 billion ) and wheat ( $ 7.5 billion ) .
Pot Tax ?
To activists for marijuana legalization , the study confirms a position they 've held for years , and uses government stats to support their claim .
" The fact that marijuana is America 's No. 1 cash crop after more than three decades of governmental eradication efforts is the clearest illustration that our present marijuana laws are a complete failure , " says Rob Kampia , executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project in Washington D.C. , a group that focuses on removing criminal penalties for marijuana use .
Kampia , whose comments were included in the study 's press release , adds , " Our nation 's laws guarantee that 100 percent of the proceeds from marijuana sales go to unregulated criminals rather than to legitimate businesses that pay taxes to support schools , police and roads . "
A 2005 analysis by Harvard visiting professor Jeffrey Miron estimates that if the United States legalized marijuana , the country would save $ 7.7 billion in law enforcement costs and could generated as much as $ 6.2 billion annually if marijuana were taxed like alcohol or tobacco .
Miron 's report on the costs of marijuana prohibition was signed by more than 500 leading economists , most notably the late Nobel laureate Milton Friedman , who served as an economist in both the Nixon and Reagan administrations .
The Dangers of Legalization
Aside from the health debate over legalizing marijuana , Garrison Courtney , spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Agency , says groups that advocate its taxation sometimes paint too rosy a picture .
" It 's still a drug , " Courtney says .
" Just because it 's a good cash crop does n't mean you should legalize and tax it . "
" It 's not these cute mom-and - pop bong shops anymore , " Courtney continued .
" It 's violent drug - trafficking groups that are doing all these grows . "
Local marijuana growers , he says , are the tentacles of international drug - trafficking organizations that bring weapons , violence and a slew of other drugs into the market .
" You ca n't tax a Mexican drug trafficking group , " Courtney explains .
" That 's the side a lot of people do n't focus on . "
The Prius has become damn - near ubiquitous in the decade since Toyota introduced it , and now there are more than 1 million of them on the road .
You can bet that number will keep rising right along with fuel prices .
Toyota says cumulative worldwide sales of the Prius hit 1,028,000 last month – when sales jumped 67 percent amid record gas prices – and claims the cars have eased global warming " by producing approximately 4.5 million tons less C02 when compared with gasoline - powered vehicles in the same class . "
Despite Toyota 's impressive sales figures , hybrids are still just 2.3 percent of the U.S. market .
That number is sure to change as consumers ditch their gas - guzzlers .
Hybrid sales rose 38 percent last yeareven as overall vehicle sales fell , and with gas prices approaching four bucks a gallon , Toyota 's having trouble meeting demand for the Prius .
Priuses ( some say the plural is Priora ) are getting harder to find in showrooms and buyers are paying more for them .
Toyota says domestic inventory is limited by production capacity in Japan , which is shared by the Asian and European markets .
The U.S. supply is at its lowest level in two years , according to Bloomberg , and things will only get worse as demand rises .
" This is a special vehicle , and as fuel prices keep rising , it gets more special , '' Toyota spokesman John Hanson told Bloomberg .
" Right now , U.S .
customers can get a Prius .
Next month or the month after that , it 's tough to say . ''
With demand rising and supplies falling , Toyota has - surprise ! - cut incentives and raised prices .
The Prius goes for an average of $ 25,274 , up $ 869 from a year ago , according to JD Power .
It 's hard to believe it now , but the Prius was a hell of gamble when Toyota unveiled in in 1997 , when gas was cheap , SUVs ruled the earth and global warming was only beginning to penetrate mainstream consciousness .
Today the Prius is the gold standard for eco-friendly vehicles and Toyota has expanded its hybrid line to include the Camry and Highlander .
But the Prius is the cash cow , and Toyota will unveil the next - generation model at the Detroit auto show in January .
Auto Observer says it will be bigger , cleaner and more fuel efficient .
Toyota also is developing a plug - in version that could be in showrooms by 2010 .
There 's no word on a convertible model .

Just like humans , liver cells love doughnuts , but these are polystyrene ring “ doughnuts ” , just a few microns across , and they might give scientists a new way to deliver drugs selectively , potentially eliminating nasty side effects of life - saving treatments such as chemotherapy , according to chemists writing in Chemical Communications .
Mark Bradley and colleagues at the University of Edinburgh , UK , serendipitously made the polymer doughnuts while studying potential drug- carrying microparticles .
While synthesising micro-spheres , the team added a small amount of dioxane to their usual ethanol solvent .
To their surprise , the resulting microparticles were regular in size and shape , with a hole through the middle like a doughnut .
SEM images of the micro-doughnuts .
“ Their unique and highly uniform structure was immediately interesting to us and we considered the possible applications they may have – one of which was as carrier particles for cellular delivery , ” said Bradley .
When they tested the uptake of the doughnuts into different types of cells , the team found they had an overwhelming preference for liver cells .
The high cell specificity these doughnuts showed led the team to conduct extensive in vivo testing in rats .
The doughnuts were injected into the tail and within four hours they were detected solely in the liver region ( yellow in image ) , with no adverse effects observed in the animal after the experiment .
Optical whole body image ( Kodak FX - PRO Reflectance System using multi-spectral un-mixing software ) of Cy7 labelled doughnuts ( yellow ) in the liver .
Food ( chlorophyll – green ) is shown in the gut .
Bradley believes there are other uses for the micro-doughnuts besides drug delivery , such as filtration or purification devices , but the team will be keen to develop their ability to selectively deliver drugs into cells .
The Scottish Socialist Party ’s campaign for free public transport is an ``audacious , eye - catching idea '' according to Douglas Fraser , political editor of The Herald newspaper .
In the Belgian city of Hasselt , which covers an area double the size of Dundee , congestion was eliminated in the late 1980s after the introduction of a totally free public transport system .
Free public transport would be the biggest single pro-environment policy enacted by any national government anywhere on the planet , dramatically slashing car use and CO2 emissions .
Free fares would represent a major shift of wealth in favour of the many thousands of people who currently pay sky - high fares to subsidise the transport companies .
Boosting public transport through free travel is a concrete means of tackling global warming .

The people of Great Britain are today willingly locking themselves up and throwing away the keys as they mark the death of Magna Carta , which passed away this week after being set upon in the Houses of Parliament .
Magna Carta , the eight - hundred - year - old document in which were enshrined some of the fundamental liberties of the people ( 1 ) , was born in 1215 , after the brooding , treacherous and incompetent King John got drunk on power one night and was accosted by a large group of rebellious barons whilst on his way to meddle with the forest law , increase scutage ( 2 ) and have one of those kebab things the crusaders kept banging on about .
It was when the King awoke the following morning in a damp field in Surrey that he discovered that not only had he given birth to one of the earliest examples of constitutional law and sewn the tiny seed from which democracy might one day flower , he had also lost most of his power and inadvertently given Englishmen the right to equality under the law and not to be locked up without trial .
Given the circumstances of its birth , it is unsurprising that Magna Carta proved to be an unloved child .
No sooner had it been born than its father attempted to disown it , even getting the Pope to annul large parts of it as " shameful and demeaning " and forced on the King by " violence and fear " ( 3 ) .
Yet despite this , Magna Carta refused to go unnoticed .
Thanks to its provisions , for the first time a council was set up to represent the people of England ( or at least as many of them as happened to be rich and powerful and have a significant body of knights to back them up ) rather than merely to serve the King .
It was Magna Carta that first granted the right to be tried by one 's peers and insisted fines should be proportionate to the offence , as well as decreeing that only competent people should be appointed to ruling posts ( a provision which sadly does not extend to the roles of England Football Manager , Heathrow baggage handler or successful candidate on The Apprentice ) .
As time passed , the popularity of Magna Carta was to grow .
By the reign of Elizabeth I it was being hailed as the embodiment of ancient English liberties , by the time of her Stuart successors as an indispensable limitation upon the powers of the Crown and it was under Magna Carta 's banner that Parliament was to seize power from Charles I .
Indeed , so useful was it in overthrowing the country 's leader that , upon becoming that leader himself , Oliver Cromwell immediately started slagging it off to anyone who would listen , memorably describing it as " Magna Farta " .
Despite such attacks , Magna Carta fought on , travelling alongside the common law to all parts of the British Empire and influencing the laws of countries from America to Zambia and encouraging our Georgian and Victorian ancestors to proclaim the superiority and nobility of the British system , even as they sold people into slavery , nicked their land and exported assorted criminals to Australia , where their descendants would one day be responsible for giving us Neighbours and Home and Away in return .
Throughout the 20th Century ( aside from a brief funny turn in the 1970s when the British Government decided to help the IRA recruitment drive by locking up without trial anyone in Belfast who pronounced " H " as " haitch " on suspicion of being a terrorist ) Magna Carta was hailed as a hero .
Yet heroes are not always universally popular ( 4 ) .
By the early Noughties , politicians in such enlightened countries as America , Britain and Zimbabwe found themselves publicly questioning Magna Carta 's role .
The aged document was said to be looking dowdy and old - fashioned , ill - fitted to a modern world where Presidents and Prime Ministers might need to lock people up in order to defeat terrorism / steal elections and / or look really tough in the pages of the tabloids and the bulletins of Fox News .
In America , Magna Carta found itself hooded , locked up and " questioned " without trial for giving succour to terrorists .
In Zimbabwe it was quietly shot for giving succour to people who were n't Robert Mugabe .
In the UK it staggered on , forced year by year to turn an ever more scarred cheek as its provisions were slowly whittled away by those whose job it was to defend it .
Just as it was born , so Magna Carta was to die .
On 11 June 2008 an incompetent and much - disliked leader was to find himself locked in a room with a group of privileged people of negotiable morality eager to extract any concessions they could .
Mere hours later , the body of Magna Carta was found bruised and bleeding its last on the floor of the House of Commons .
Magna Carta will be buried under several promises of knighthoods , the odd multi-million pound bribe , an " Ulster Says No " badge and a populace ever more eager to see their last freedoms destroyed in the name of an unwinnable and illogical " war on terror " .
It is survived - somewhat surprisingly - by former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis .
(1 ) as well as not - so fundamental rights relating to the ability of widows to inherit fiefdoms , the duties of towns to build bridges and the like , and a complete ban on any member of the D'Athée family being made a royal official .
( 2 ) a medieval tax , relating either to the right of a knight to buy himself out of feudal service or , possibly , to the use of obscure and long - disused words whilst playing Scrabulous on facebook .
(3) By strange coincidence , these are the same reasons given by many people for wanting to expunge all memory of their renditions of " Uptown Girl " at " the karaoke last night " .
(4) As anyone who has ever played a licensed computer game tied - in to the release of the latest superhero blockbuster can affirm .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Wall Street sank Wednesday - with the Dow briefly falling below 12,000 for the first time in 3 months - as oil surged in afternoon trading ahead of a key options expiration day .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) closed down nearly 1.1 % and the broader Standard & Poor 's 500 index ( SPX ) was down 0.9 % .
The Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) was also down about 1.1 % at the end of a volatile trading day .

" Quadruple witching " refers to the day - four times a year - when a range of options expire .
The markets began to sell off Wednesday morning following weak quarterly results from FedEx and Morgan Stanley .
The selling accelerated in afternoon trading as financial stocks joined in Morgan 's disappointment .
" A couple of household names have come out showing how difficult it is to make money in this market , " said Art Hogan , chief market strategist at Jefferies and Company Inc .
Oil prices are also wrecking havoc on investors , with Hogan noting that crude futures are more than twice as expensive than they were this time last year .
" It is impossible to separate corporate America from energy prices and although we are down today and that is good news , we are being reminded that the high energy prices affect business , " said Hogan .
Thursday brings a number of economic reports .
The Labor Department reports initial claims for unemployment benefits before the opening bell .

" We have the twin worries coming together there - energy prices and slowing overall consumer demand . "
Morgan Stanley leads the financials down : Profits at Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) fell by more than half last quarter , hurt by a decline in its investment banking and sales and trading businesses , the company reported .

In a nearly $ 5 swing from its lows , crude prices ended sharply higher Wednesday following a report that Nigerian oil workers are threatening to go on strike .
U.S. crude for July delivery rose $ 2.67 to settle at $ 136.68 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
Oil traded as low as $ 131.82 shortly after the government released its weekly inventory report before starting the dramatic rebound in the afternoon .
Bush : U.S. " must produce more oil " Congress must face a hard reality , " the president said .
" Unless members are willing to accept gas prices at today 's painful prices or even higher , our nation must produce more oil , and we must start now . "
The remarks highlighted the growing political pressure to reduce dependence on foreign oil and deal with rising gas prices .
Gas prices fall : Retail gasoline prices eased for the second day in a row , retreating slightly from their record high , according to a daily survey released by auto club AAA .
The national average price for a gallon of regular gas fell three - tenths of a cent to $ 4.075 , according to AAA .

The young man who gave his name only as Wilson wanted just one thing from yesterday 's presidential election in Zimbabwe : the indelible red ink on his little finger to show he had voted .
" They said they would come to see if we voted , " he said after casting his ballot in a tent in a Harare suburb .
" They know if we went to vote we would have to vote for the president .
They were watching . "
Who are " they " ?
" The ones who made us go to the meetings at night .
The ones who told us we must be careful to correct our mistake . "
Wilson voted for Robert Mugabe yesterday , against his will but judging that it was the best way to save himself from a beating or worse .
So did many other Zimbabweans , driven to the polls by fear after a bloody and relentless campaign of beatings , abductions and murders against the voters by the ruling Zanu - PF to reverse Mugabe 's humiliating defeat at the hands of Morgan Tsvangirai , the Movement for Democratic Change leader who beat him clearly in the first round of voting three months ago but without an outright majority .
The state - run Herald newspaper yesterday predicted a " massive " turnout in support of Mugabe .
There were few signs of that in Harare although those who stayed away from the polls in the more upmarket parts of the capital tended to be the homeowners .
Their maids and gardeners , subjected to nightly forced political meetings by Zanu - PF , were taking no chances .
The Zanu - PF militia was out early in Chitungwiza , one of the Harare townships where the ruling party unleashed its violent campaign of retribution to " reorient " people who voted for the opposition last time .
They moved from house to house at dawn , singing liberation war songs and banging on doors to warn people to vote .
Near some polling stations in the township , voters were directed to buildings where ruling party activists told them to record the serial numbers of the ballot paper they received at the voting booth and to return with it .
Zanu - PF set up tents close to some polling stations in Harare where people were expected to show their identity cards so their names could be ticked off as having voted .
But some people remained defiant .
" I refuse to vote , " said Blessed Manyonga in Chitungwiza .
" If they ask me I will say I lost my identity card .
I will not vote for my own oppression . "
Others said they spoiled their ballot papers .
" I put a question mark next to Robert Mugabe , " said a man who gave his name only as Tendai .
" It 's a joke . "
In Harare , one man said he had not voted at all and instead smeared his finger with ink from a ballpoint pen .
But in many rural areas people were being driven en masse to the polls and left in no doubt about what they were expected to do .
Opposition officials said some voters reported having their identity numbers written on the back of their ballot papers .
In other places they were forced to show how they had marked the ballot before they dropped it in the voting box .
Still others were handed pre-marked ballots by ruling party activists and told to hand back the blank ones they received inside the polling booths to prove they had not voted for the opposition .
Pishai Muchauraya , an opposition MP in Manicaland , said he witnessed a low turnout in Mutare , the province 's main city , but had received reports of voters being forced to the polls and intimidated in large numbers in rural areas where the vote swung against Mugabe in March .
" Here in the urban areas people have just stayed at home .
They are defiant .
In rural areas like Buhera and Makoni people are being forced to go and vote .
They say we will check your finger and if you do n't vote ... " he said .
" They are also expected to say they cannot read and write , and to ask for assistance to vote .
People were forced to sleep at Zanu - PF bases and then taken to vote .
All that kind of coercion . "
Opposition activists in Mashonaland said whole villages had been warned that if there was anything short of a substantial victory for Mugabe when the count was made at local polling stations , then those who voted there would be collectively punished .
But there were those who voted for Mugabe more than willingly .
" Why should we vote against our president when he liberated this country ? " said Agnes Tapera in Chitungwiza .
" What is Tsvangirai ?
Did he fight in the liberation war ?
Why is he so friendly with those white farmers ?
Why does Britain support him ?
Tsvangirai is not a president .
He runs away every time it gets difficult .
Right now he is hiding in that [ Dutch ] embassy .
Mugabe stays and fights .
He fought Ian Smith and the British and he is fighting Tsvangirai and he will win . "
It was all in stark contrast to the first round of presidential elections three months ago when Mugabe 's opponents briefly believed they might finally remove him from power simply by marking a ballot paper .
There was no such illusion yesterday .
Mugabe emerged from voting in Highfield township in Harare proclaiming himself " very optimistic " and " upbeat " that yesterday 's ballot would reverse his first round defeat .
That was one thing Zimbabwe 's president for the past 28 years and the opposition agreed on - that there 's little doubt Mugabe will be declared the winner .
His Zanu - PF party says it is a popular response to its campaign for " 100 % empowerment and independence " from British imperialism .
The ruling party chairman , John Nkomo , made a televised appeal to Zimbabweans to support Mugabe by portraying support for the opposition as akin to recolonisation and Tsvangirai as a Downing street puppet .
" Our statehood and our nationhood are under severe threat .
The question before each and every one of us is whether , advertently or inadvertently , we will go down in the annals of history as defenders of our motherland or as traitors who unabashedly volunteered for servitude , " he said .
" The ferocity of the anti-Zimbabwe campaign underscores what is at stake - our independence and future as a nation .
Evidently this onslaught is being directed from London and Washington . "
Even the Queen - or what the Herald called the High Priestess of England - got dragged in for stripping Mugabe of his honorary knighthood this week .
The paper said it was a welcome development ahead of the election which confirmed the need to support " total independence " .
" No one has ever referred to our president as ' Sir ' Robert Mugabe .
He is known as ' Comrade ' Robert Mugabe and that says it all , " said the Herald .
Tsvangirai , who pulled out of the race because of the systematic violence that has virtually wiped out his party 's structures on the ground but who remained on the ballot paper , urged his supporters to stay away from the polls .
But he said they should vote for Mugabe if that was necessary to save their skins .
" What is happening is not an election , " he said yesterday .
" It is an exercise in mass intimidation with people all over the country being forced to vote .
Fortunately , Zimbabweans are attempting to stay away from the polls as they can tell the difference between democracy and a dictatorship desperate for the illusion of legitimacy . "
But Tsvangirai said the vote would strip Mugabe of the last vestiges of legitimacy as president whatever the outcome of the election .
" Zimbabweans know that there is nothing legitimate about this election and they know that there will be nothing legitimate about the result .
This is a view shared by many African and world leaders , " he said .
" The end of this terrible , violent dictatorship is now assured , the people 's victory may have been delayed by this sham election but it will never be denied . "
Many of the voters are not so confident .
" It was our mistake to think we could get rid of Mugabe , " said Wilson .
" He is right when he says only God can get rid of him .
I want to ask God if he is on our side . "
All the intimidation may in the end prove academic because ultimately what matters is the numbers on the final returns , and Zimbabwe 's state - controlled election commission will decide what they are beyond the reach of prying eyes .
The violence not only scared the voters but drove opposition and independent local election observers away from monitoring the polls .
MDC polling agents have been systematically beaten up , thrown into jail , abducted and murdered .
The thousands of independent local observers who oversaw the election three months ago have also been terrorised into staying away , leaving the voting and the count largely unscrutinised by outside witnesses .
Only a few hundred observers from African organisations are monitoring the poll and they were hard - pressed to cover more than 9,000 polling stations .
Many of those observers have seen enough to decide that the election was anything but free and fair , and seem ready to say so .
Mugabe plans to attend an African Union summit in Egypt next week as Zimbabwe 's newly re-elected president , and he will defy any of the continent 's leaders to question his legitimacy .
" When I go to the AU meeting next week , I am going to challenge some leaders to point out when we have had worse elections , " Mugabe told a final election rally on Thursday .
" I would like some African leaders who are making these statements to point at me and we would see if those fingers would be cleaner than mine . "
That is largely irrelevant to the voters , who just wanted to get through the day in one piece .
But the end of balloting did not necessarily bring relief .
In some parts of Harare , the voters were told to report back to the polling station after dark and to wait for the count to be completed .
They were warned that if the numbers were not right , there would be a price to pay .
" I hope everybody did what I did and voted for Mugabe , " said Wilson .
" Otherwise we 're all in trouble . "
@eeedlef : No , not a chance in the world .
The most obvious reason being genetic damage is normally a lifelong deterioration of specific genetic markers ; cellphones just have n't been a widely used technology for long enough to make any determination of cause on what is a decades long process .
That said , we may all be fucked in 60 years , but no study now is going to prove that .
Experts are concerned by children 's increased use of mobile phones
Two children in Spain have been admitted to a mental health institution to be treated for addiction to their mobile phones , Spanish media report .
The children , aged 12 and 13 , were sent to the clinic by their parents , who said they could not carry out normal activities without their handsets .
They were doing badly at school and lying to relatives in order to get money to spend on their phones .
They have been learning to cope without their phones for three months .
Dr Maite Utges , who runs the Child and Youth Mental Health Centre in Lleida , near Barcelona in north - eastern Spain , said it was the first time the clinic had treated children who were dependent on their mobile phones .
" They both showed disturbed behaviour and this exhibited itself in failure at school .
They both had serious difficulties leading normal lives , " she was quoted in Spanish papers as saying .
The children had owned their phones for 18 months , and their parents had made little effort to restrict their use before noticing how serious their dependence had become .
' Tip of iceberg ' Dr Jose Martinez - Raga , an expert in addictions , said children who developed a dependency on mobile phones , like those who over - used video games , often became irritable , withdrawn and antisocial , and their school performance deteriorated .
He warned these cases could be the " tip of the iceberg " , and that mobile phone addiction " could definitely be a danger in the future " .
Fears have been raised in a number of countries about the adverse effects mobile phone use may have on children .
Dr Utges recommended that parents not allow their children to have mobile phones until they reached 16 years of age .

This article will help you in using the Mandriva rescue mode to get the situation back to normal ...
Oops !
I did it again ...
You know the story , it is late , you are starting something you are not familiar with ( to say the least ) , and of course , that fails .
Most of the time , when you can go to a console and have some knowledge ( or a friend to mail to ) , you can easily roll back from a bad situation .
However , in cases where you can even not boot to your system , you are stuck .
In fact , not completely , the rescue mode is there for you !
Entering the rescue mode
Boot the installation CD / DVD and select “ rescue mode ” select “ go to console ” For loading some modules ( like for instance the modules needed by a RAID instalation ) , type : modprobe dm- mirror
modprobe ahci
dmraid - a y Run dmesg , it should display at the end a message concerning your
partitions .
Examining if the hardware is correctly handled
Run lsparts , it should now correctly display your partitions ...
Type mount / dev/sdXY / mnt , here X is the drive letter ( should be a ) , and Y is the partition number ( probably 1 ) cd into the partition and copy the appropriate file to a floppy or USB key ( you may also need to mount them manually using mount ) .
Recreating the initrd and / or installing a new kernel
Creation of the initrd has already been detailed in this article .
If you need to install a new kernel , before going to the rescue mode , put on an USB stick the desired RPMs ( at least kernel - desktop , kernel - desktop - devel ) .
Create a / mnt / usb directory mkdir / mnt/usb and mount the USB stick mount / dev/usb /...
/ mnt/usb
Copy the files to the temporary directory : cp /mnt/usb/kernel* /tmp
Enter in a virtual system ( the one where your installation lies ) : mkdir / mnt / disk ; mount / dev/ sdX / mnt / disk ; chroot / mnt / disk ; mount / proc ; mount / boot ( optionally )
Install the new kernel : urpmi kernel - desktop kernel - desktop - devel .
This step should create a correct initrd and a new bootloader entry .
Exit from the virtual system : umount / boot ; umount / proc ; exit
Reboot and select the new entry .
If that fails

Several Fonda - Fultonville school district residents on Tuesday criticized the use of a Planned Parenthood educator to conduct sex education classes for seventh - and eighth - graders beginning today .
Point of view Read Mark Robarge ’s view as a parent of sex education in the schools in his blog , “ Off the Beaten Path , ” by clicking here .
The parents said they had collected 163 signatures of residents opposing the introduction of Planned Parenthood materials or organization - developed instruction in the school .
The group developed a Web site , www.notinourschool.com, which lists financial earnings of Planned Parenthood and other details of the organization .
Deborah Young said she started researching Planned Parenthood education guidelines and found passages that suggested masturbation is a source of pleasure .
“ I went in , I could not believe what I saw , ” Young said .
Arlene Whittingham said she did research as well and found educational materials directed to children between the ages of 5 and 8 which indicate that girls and boys have body parts that feel good when touched .
Whittingham said she found it “ quite unconscionable ” that an organization could suggest sharing such information with school students .
The district held a special meeting last month for parents to outline presentations for seventh and eighth grade this year and to announce a sex education curriculum will be developed over the summer .
Officials at the time said several program possibilities were reviewed and they chose Planned Parenthood ’s program .
Opponents are suggesting the selection was steered by administrators and failed to include a broader array of possible choices .
The incidence of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease prompted school officials to consider implementing a program to cover topics like the repercussions of sexual activity , types of birth control and sexually transmitted diseases .
State Health Department statistics show Montgomery County has a birth rate of 42.4 per 1,000 among 15 - to 19 - year - olds between 2002 and 2004 .
That rate was surpassed in New York state only in the Bronx , which logged a rate of 53.5 teens per 1,000 giving birth .
Dr. Michael Rochet , a physician , said the school district should search for alternatives for Planned Parenthood programming because he believes the instruction will facilitate curiosity among students .
“ It will lead to more sexual activity , ” he said .
Rochet said he wants parents and educators to get together and work on a program for the coming school year that can be molded to the community ’s needs , as opposed to taking on programming of an organization that ’s already developed .
“ We do n’t have to follow everybody else .
Let ’s lead the pack , ” Rochet said .
In an effort to ensure parents would have a say in their children ’s participation , the district issued forms so that parents could decide to have their children excluded from the instruction .
District Superintendent James Hoffman said among seventh - graders , parents of 30 students out of a total of about 105 students have opted out of instruction .
In the eighth grade , of more than 90 students , parents of six opted out , he said .
Hoffman said district officials are aware of the parents ’ concern .
He said the Planned Parenthood educator was told not to mention abortion or abortion rights .
A teacher will be directed to start developing a new curriculum during the summertime , Hoffman said .
ABSALOKA MINE , Montana ( Reuters ) - Underneath Montana lies an estimated $ 1.5 trillion of coal , but with uncertainty about future environmental rules , investors are wary about opening new mines in the rugged Western U.S. state .
Many say a big boost to Montana coal production can only follow November ’s national election , when a new president could lead the way in clarifying environmental laws and encouraging cleaner coal technology .
Montana ends the long U.S. state - by - state presidential primary process on Tuesday .
“ Nothing is going to happen until we have a carbon law , that ’s the bottom line , ” Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer told Reuters .
“ It needs a new president . ”
“ But what ’s happening right now is the partnerships are being formed , the capital is being raised , the coal is being acquired , so everybody is ready to move as soon as we have a carbon law . ”
The state produced 43.4 million tons of coal in 2007 , up 3.7 percent on the year , the biggest growth rate of any state .
That output is just a tenth of that in neighboring Wyoming , where coal is generally easier to extract and transport .
Yet Montana , which borders Canada , sits on America ’s greatest coal reserves : 120 billion tons , worth about $ 1.5 trillion at current prices , according to Jay Gunderson , a research geologist at the Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology .
“ Coal demand is up all over the world , ” said John O’Laughlin , Westmoreland Coal Company ’s vice president , coal operations .
“ With the price for a barrel of oil , there ’s a lot of interest in Montana coal .
But we ’ve got to figure out a way to sequester the CO2 .
That ’s what is holding us back . ”
The company ’s 34 - year - old Absaloka mine in southeast Montana reached a record 7.35 million tons output last year .
In 2009 , it plans to expand into adjacent Crow Indian reservation land for the first time .
All the presidential candidates back an expansion of some form of coal using more environmentally friendly technology .

“ We ’re sitting on the world ’s largest supply of energy in our coal resources , ” presumed Republican nominee Sen. John McCain said recently .
“ That has to be one of the fundamental components of energy independence . ”
Among the Democrats , Sen. Barack Obama has said he would increase resources for commercialization and development of low - emission coal plants , and Sen. Hillary Clinton has called on industry to implement clean coal technology .
“ It has been kind of refreshing to hear Hillary and Obama talk about clean coal , ” Westmoreland ’s O’Laughlin said .
“ There is at least a glimmer of acceptance . ”
INTEREST BUT CAUTION
Montana has not opened a new coal mine in decades .
“ Companies are reluctant to invest billions of dollars in infrastructure not knowing what the government is going to do about CO2 , ” said Gunderson at the Bureau of Mines and Geology .
At Absaloka , a single machine -- a dragline excavator that scoops out slabs of rolling countryside to get near the coal -- costs $ 120 million .
Elsewhere , workers dynamite sections of earth and expensive trucks with wheels taller than people carry away coal to be crushed in a vast facility before transport .
Great Northern Properties is the largest private holder of U.S. coal reserves with 20 billion tons , mostly in Montana and North Dakota .
Chuck Kerr , president of the Houston - based company , said the nation will eventually tap Montana ’s coal .
“ It ’s not a matter of if , it ’s a matter of when , ” he said in an interview .
“ The silent majority back coal development because it ’s a very cheap source of fuel . ”
Gov. Schweitzer has long championed Fischer - Tropsch technology to convert coal into liquid fuels that can be burned in a greener way than traditional coal , but no one has yet invested the many billions needed for such a plant .
“ It is incredibly expensive to deploy , ” Kerr said .
But there are signs of other new projects .
John DeMichiei , president and CEO of Bull Mountain Coal Mining Inc , expects to get private financing by July 15 for what he said could be the largest underground coal mine in the world , located 35 miles north of Billings , Montana .
“ It takes extreme capital investment , ” he said .
“ With these sales prices starting to at least support this type of capital investment , I think you will see more investment in Montana in terms of coal . ”
DeMichiei hopes to begin large - scale production at Bull Mountain by September 2009 , with production of 14 million tons a year .
The mine , with 430 million tons in reserve , now produces just 40,000 tons a month , he said in an interview .
The company ’s main investor is Airlie Group of Greenwich , Connecticut .
“ We are in discussions with a number of parties to get the mine fully financed and build a railroad and get it to be one of the largest long wall mines in the United States , if not the largest , ” Airlie Managing Director Andy Dwyer said .
But he added : Wyoming ’s “ Powder River Basin has established rail lines and transportation hubs and the ability to substantially expand .
So if there is n’t going to be any substantial increase in demand then quite frankly the Powder River Basin can meet a good deal of that demand . ”
Schweitzer said despite its greater reserves and plans for expansion , Montana may never surpass Wyoming in production .
“ The world of hydrocarbons will be over and we ’ll still have 90 percent of our coal in the ground , ” he predicted .
“ Wind and solar and hydrogen -- they ’ll be the energy sources of the future .
Forty , 50 years from now hydrocarbons wo n’t be an energy source of any large quality . ”

The major earthquake that devastated China last month was something of a seismological oddity , seismologists report in a new analysis .
The faults that caused the temblor rarely rumble .
More than 69,000 people are confirmed to have died from the magnitude 7.9 quake that struck China 's Sichuan province around noon on May 12 , leveling school buildings and other poorly - constructed structures .
The earthquake was also a complete surprise to scientists .
MIT seismologists who had been operating an array of 25 seismograph stations in the region for more than a year had found no hints that a large temblor might hit .
" Nobody was thinking there would be a major seismological event , " in that area , said MIT 's Leigh Royden .
" This earthquake was quite unusual . "
The region is extremely unusual geographically , Royden said , because of the very steep slopes at the boundary between the Sichuan Basin to the east and the Tibetan Plateau to the west .
The elevation rises by more than two miles ( about 3.5 kilometers ) in a span of just 30 miles ( 50 kilometers ) .
The area is at the boundary between the Indian and Asian tectonic plates , which are engaged in an ongoing collision that has created the Himalayas and the Tibetan plateau .
In central and eastern Tibet , unlike most other areas where two continental plates are colliding , the movement of the crust is hidden .
Instead of folding and faulting , the surface of the eastern Tibetan plateau is undeformed and being lifted upward by the thickening of a weak crustal layer more than 9 miles ( 15 km ) below the surface .
The crust in this layer is flowing rapidly eastward away from central Tibet .
But in the area where the earthquake occurred , it is obstructed by a major obstacle , the Sichuan Basin .
" The crust and mantle beneath the basin appears to form a hard , cold knot , " Royden said , which forces the flow to " wrap around the knot . "
The huge elevation differences between the surface of the plateau and the Sichuan Basin provided the underlying stress that led to the quake , she added .
Similar events in the area occur only once in every 2,000 to 10,000 years on average , the researchers say , though they caution that because earthquakes can sometimes occur in clusters , residents and officials should still be wary of another possible large - scale earthquake .
The new analysis is detailed in the July issue of GSA Today , a publication of the Geological Society of America .
The research was funded by the National Science Foundation .

Mobile flowers are visited by more insects , scientists discovered Flowers " wave " at insects to get their attention , scientists have discovered .
The finding helps explain why many flowers waft in the breeze , and reveals a hitherto unknown trick used to attract pollinators .
Scientists made the discovery while studying common wildflowers known as sea campion on the Welsh coast .
Mobile flowers are visited more often by insects and also produce more seeds , they report in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology .
Moving flowers also attract a wider variety of insect species than more static blooms .
For years , biologists have known that flowers use striking colours , fragrances , elaborately shaped petals and nectar to attract pollinating insects such as bees and flies .
Yet no - one had ever seriously considered whether wafting in the wind acted as a similar signal .
Beachside inspiration " I was lying on the beach watching flowers wave in the wind at my daughter 's birthday party , and I wondered why they have stalks and risked getting damaged in such an exposed habitat , " recounted John Warren from the University of Aberystwyth .
Only flowers that wobble the right amount are successful in setting seeds
John Warren
So he looked at what research had previously been done , and found very few answers .
" The only reference I found to motion in attracting pollinators says it 's unlikely to be important , because insects are not good at detecting movement ; which is clearly rubbish . "
To find out more , Dr Warren and colleague Penri James experimented with sea campion ( Silene maritima ) growing on an exposed coast within a Site of Special Scientific Interest in Cardigan Bay in west Wales .
They observed 300 specially grown flowers of varying stem lengths , recording how much each flower moved in the wind , how often it was visited by insects and for how long , and how many seeds it went on to produce .

Their experiments reveal that flowers mounted on long , thin stalks move around more in the wind .
This acts as a powerful signal to passing pollinators , allowing the plant to attract more insects than less mobile flowers growing atop short , thick stems .
" We found wavy flowers are more visible to insects , and thus attract more pollinators and set more seeds , " said John Warren .
But flowers ultimately face an evolutionary trade - off , he believes .
" Short , fat - stalked flowers do n't wobble enough and are less attractive to pollinators ; yet very wobbly flowers are just too wobbly for the insects to handle , as the insects cannot land on them .
" Only flowers that wobble the right amount are successful in setting seeds . "

WHEN a 16 - year - old girl assaulted her mother with a knife , she was sent to juvenile detention .
She was just eight the first time she threatened her mother with a knife .
She had also similarly threatened her foster carer , attacked a teacher and stabbed a fellow student .
She appeared to have a fascination with knives , the Supreme Court heard yesterday .
Now 25 , the woman is suing the state for allowing her access to the knife she used to kill a teacher , Scott Bremmer , in a cooking class at the Yasmar detention centre .
The court heard she was allegedly sexually abused as a child , had been assessed as retarded and suffering from intermittent explosive disorder .
Since she was sent to Yasmar at 16 , she has assaulted her solicitor , doctor , psychiatrist and two teachers , one of whom was attacked with a leather working tool in July 1999 .
Two days later , she was allowed to participate in the cooking class , despite staff allegedly raising concerns that she appeared " hyped up " .
Her handcuffs were removed and she was given cooking implements , including knives .
During a break , she allegedly showed " heightened interest in knives " , and after returning to class , she fatally stabbed Mr Bremmer .
She was charged , and eventually sentenced to a limiting term of 10 years under the Mental Health Act .
She has been held in isolation for most of that time , has assaulted guards and tried to harm herself in custody .
This work was originally developed as a series of experiments for the project " Celestial Mechanics " by colleagues Scott Hessels and Gabriel Dunne at UCLA .

PITTSBURGH ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama vowed on Monday to get tough with China over its undervalued currency , saying he would threaten to limit access to the U.S. market as a bargaining tool with the Chinese .
“ What we need to do is just be better bargainers and say ‘ Look , here ’s the bottom line :
You guys keep on manipulating your currency , we are going to start shutting off access to some of our markets , ” he told a large crowd of unionized steelworkers in the industrial city of Pittsburgh .
“ If you are doing the right thing and not trying to manipulate your currencies to our disadvantage then you will have access , ” Obama said to raucous applause from the United Steelworkers and other industrial workers from Pennsylvania .
U.S. President George W. Bush , whose administration has opposed attempts by the U.S. Congress to pass legislation to force China to revalue its currency , was a tough - talking “ patsy ” on trade negotiations , said the Illinois senator .
“ America and the world can benefit from trade with China .
But trade with China will only be good for you if China itself plays by the rules and acts as a positive force for balanced world growth , ” he said .
Obama was speaking at a forum hosted by the Alliance for American Manufacturing , which has launched a statewide “ China Cheats .
Pennsylvania Loses ” campaign for the April 22 Democratic primary election .
Democratic rival Hillary Clinton will also attend the rally on Monday .
The AAM said that Pennsylvania has lost more than 207,400 manufacturing jobs since 2000 -- almost one quarter of roughly all Pennsylvania factory jobs .
It cited a study as saying the mushrooming U.S. trade deficit with China alone cost Pennsylvania more than 78,000 jobs between 2001 - 2006 .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Energy company BrightSource Energy
Inc said it will open a solar “ power tower ” in Israel this week to test new technology it will use when building power plants next year in California .

California utility PG&E
Corp signed contracts with BrightSource in April to buy up to 900 megawatts of solar thermal power in the next few years , enough to power about 630,000 homes .
The move is part of a PG&E push to comply with California ’s requirement that at least 20 percent of its electricity supplies come from renewable energy by 2010 .
A global race is on to find energy alternatives to replace fossil fuels , and entrepreneurs are scrambling for a slice of a clean energy market that analysts estimate was worth nearly $ 150 billion last year .
BrightSource ’s development centre , with its 60 meter - high ( 60 foot ) tower and some 1,200 mirrors , sits on about 12,000 square meters ( three acres ) of Israel ’s southern Negev Desert , chairman Arnold Goldman said .
BrightSource did not release financial details of the complex , but said its systems are more cost - efficient than other solar power plants .
The new power tower , which is capable of generating 1.5 megawatts , will not produce electricity for public use , but rather test the technologies that will power future plants , including a 100 megawatt plant in California ’s Mojave Desert scheduled to be completed by 2011 , Kroizer said .
The 100 megawatt plant will be about 50 times larger that the Negev centre .
BrightSource CEO John Woolard said competitors , like Spanish building and energy group Acciona , were still using similar technologies to those used by BrightSource 20 years ago .
“ The new power tower based technology , we do n’t see any serious competition , yet , in that area , ” Woolard told a news conference in Jerusalem .
HIGHER TEMPERATURE , HIGHER PRESSURE
Solar power towers , which have been used for decades , use mirrors to reflect and intensify sunlight , much like using a magnifying glass to start a fire .
Traditionally , the system contains rows of large , curved mirrors , sometimes reaching 100 meters in length .
The sunlight is aimed at a boiler on top of the tower and is hot enough to boil the water into steam that passes through turbines and produces electricity .
The new power tower is surrounded by a system of smaller , flat mirrors , each with an enhanced guidance system to track and reflect the sun more effectively than the trough - like systems , Goldman said .
“ It takes huge amounts of electronics and controls and gears .
The electronics industry has driven those costs down so much that you can do that today , ” Goldman said .
It also requires about a third of the steel and cement , he said .
BrightSource ’s mirrors reflect about 50 percent of the sunlight , while standard systems reflect 35 - 40 percent , Goldman said .
As a result , the temperature and pressure in the boiler is higher and energy is produced more effectively .
“ Historic troughs can put the equivalent of about 20 suns on the tower .
We have a maximum of 600 suns , ” Goldman said .
Woolard also said the new power tower works at half the cost of photo - voltaic solar panel plants because it produces energy about twice as many hours in a year .
New research suggests that teens are n't using oral sex as a substitute for sexual intercourse .
Now our challenge is to develop programs addressing the reality of teen sexual behavior rather than speculating over the myth of " technical virginity . "
When a 2005 Center for Diseases
Control study of 15 to 19 year olds reported that one in four teen virgins
had engaged in oral sex , public response was intense — to say the least .
Many news outlets reported that teens were engaging in oral sex so that
they could claim that they were still technically virgins , while talk
shows warned of teens casually engaging in oral sex at parties with
multiple partners .
Some speculated that the apparent
rise in oral sex among teens was the result of the Clinton political
scandal that put into question whether oral sex was really sex .
Others wondered whether teens
chose oral sex over vaginal or anal intercourse in response to a fear
of pregnancy and / or sexually transmitted infections .
The teens I work with constantly remind me that teen attitudes towards sex
have changed since I was their age .
A class does n’t go by without
my students responding to something I say with a good - natured eye roll
and an explanation of how folks " do it different now " or " do n’t
think that way anymore . "
My students are teen mothers or pregnant
teens and we discuss sex openly during our women ’s health classes .
Even so , I was surprised in 2005 when the CDC ’s findings appeared to indicate that teens were engaging in oral sex because
they did n’t define it as sex and as an alternative to sexual intercourse .
My student ’s did n’t share that they thought oral sex was n’t sex
or that is was an alternative to sexual intercourse .
Instead ,
they spoke of oral sex as part of a sexual relationship or part of sexual
exploration .
But the results of the CDC
study released in 2005 suggested that more than half of those
teens surveyed responded that they were engaging in oral sex .
Although researchers did not ask about the circumstances in which oral
sex was taking place , many people interpreted the data to mean that
teens were engaging in oral sex because they did not view it as sex
and felt that oral sex was a way to remain " technical virgins . "
In other words , the study claimed
that one in four teens was using oral sex as a substitute for sexual
intercourse .
Could it be that teens were responding to abstinence - only curricula by opting for oral sex over intercourse ?
Or was
it that teens were avoiding sexual intercourse because of lack of access to contraception ?
Was this apparent teen
oral sex epidemic a good thing or a bad thing ?
Well , it turns out that all
the speculation was likely in vain .
A new study from the Guttmacher
Institute challenges the facts of and conclusions drawn from that 2005
CDC report .
As reported by Amie Newman in Teen Myth Busting :
Study Shows Oral Sex No Substitute For Vaginal Intercourse , the Guttmacher report found that the
conclusion that teens frequently substitute oral sex for sexual intercourse
is flawed – oral and anal sex are significantly more common
among teens who have already had vaginal intercourse than among those
who have not .
In other words , teens are more likely to
explore a range of sexual activities as they become sexually active
and are not likely to substitute one activity for another .

Now that we know that teens
are n’t using oral sex as a substitute for sexual intercourse and that
they are engaging in a variety of sexual activities when they become sexually active , we must use this new data clarifying
teen sexual behavior to address the increase in teen
sexually transmitted infection and re-infection
rates .
The
challenge is to work with the reality of teen sexual behavior rather
than speculate over the myth of technical virginity .
For direction
we can look to the example of programs like Sexual Awareness for Everyone
( SAFE ) , which has had success
in reducing STI re-infection rates among the high - risk teenage women
of color participants
in the program .
A study of the SAFE program
conducted by Andrea Ries Thurman of the University of Texas
Health Sciences Center - San Antonio
and her colleagues followed a group of 14 to 18 year old black and Mexican - American
participants .
SAFE offers comprehensive STI counseling and education .
Participants in the study attended small groups that included role - playing sessions ,
interactive video sessions , reviews of written material and group discussion
that addressed strategies for prevention like abstinence and monogamy
while explaining the importance of sticking to STI medication regimens
as prescribed .
Graduates of SAFE are less
likely to engage in high risk sexual behavior and have a lower incidence
of recurrent gonorrhea and chlamydia as compared with teen women in
a control group who received only 15 minutes of individual counseling .
The cumulative STI re-infection rate for teen women who participated in SAFE was 24 percent , for the control group this number skyrocketed to 40 percent .
As Emily Douglas wrote in response
to the data that one in four teen women have an STI , all four out of four teen
girls need better sex education
and better sex education requires a deeper understanding of the reality
of teens and their lives .
Reproductive justice activists who work
with teens know that pro-knowledge programs built on solid data like
SAFE help to address the real risks teens face when they are sexually active .
Looking back , it is clear that the problem with the 2005 CDC teen oral
sex study was n’t in the data but with the speculation that followed .
Programs like SAFE and their undeniable success in reducing risk demonstrate
that comprehensive sex education remains the key to empowering teens .

Traffic jams are affecting visibly commuter traffic in Spain with Madrid , Barcelona and Valencia being hardest hit .
The National Guard has been escorting oil products convoys both to Madrid and Lisbon , densely populated areas that could rapidly dry out of fuel .
This morning many filling stations in the northern suburbs of Lisbon had already ran out of diesel and 95 octane petrol .
Diesel especially is becoming scarce in many filling stations all across the Peninsula .
The Algarve seems to be on of the most hit regions , to where many people travelled taking the chance of an extended weekend to spend a few days in the southern warm shores .
Many factories are closing operations for lack of supply of all varieties of goods .
Car factories , an important sector in the Peninsula , are already paralysing , lacking parts to continue operations .
Fresh goods are disappearing from the supermarket shelves .
Yesterday fresh fish was already impossible to find .
Milk will be unavailable in less than two days .
Producers and storage facilities are dumping milk they can't send to the markets .
Poultry producers are running out of feedstock .
A massive die off could take place if new supplies do n't arrive in the next few days
Fuel supplies were suspended at the Lisbon airport , but up to the moment no flights have been cancelled .
Air line companies have been filling their aircrafts at other airports in Oporto and Funchal .
Spotty shortages of fresh goods , petrol and diesel are still enduring .
This morning the radio reported that the route connections between Algarve and Andalucía were still being blocked , disrupting fuel supplies to the former region .
In Spain fresh goods are still a problem in some supermarkets , with picket lines now blockading access to central warehouses that supply retailers .
It is likely that these products will see price hikes during the following days , as supply falls from normal levels .
Up to this fifth day of strike there have been more than 1000 protesters detained by the police and 600 others have been fined for ill driving practices .
But on the overall order seems to have been restored and life appears to coming back to normal for the regular citizen .
With 800 thousand people deciding the fate of almost 500 million , the news on the hauliers strike are fading away into background noise .
Strikers tiredness and lack of interest by the media will probably give the fatal blow to the protest , by Monday we 'll know for sure .
Tonight Europe goes to bed with another institutional crisis in its hands .
The big difference this time is that Peak Oil and the associated economic hardship wo n't wait .
Life is slowly coming back to normal in Spain .
A deal was struck between government and representatives of the vast majority of hauliers during last nigh , granting several fiscal and social benefits to the industry , but leaving diesel taxes untouched .
The hauliers ' associations behind the blockade reunited today after lunch and rejected the government 's proposals , vowing to continue protests ( the main claim for a minimum service fare remains unattended ) .
Check striker 's demands and the government 's offers [ hat tip Migeru ] .
The police is on the roads , clearing blockaded routes and facing the picket lines all around the country ; there have been insistent reports of arrests throughout the day .
Escort is being provided by the police to hauliers that request so , protecting lorries from raging blockaders .
There 's an all round improvement in traffic .
Today 's reported actions have been mainly of slow marches that did n't had much impact on the returning normality .
Stores are getting shipments again , although still rationing some high demand fresh goods .
Factories are slowly coming back to operation , even if partially , and fuel is reaching filling stations again .
For tomorrow the Spanish association of taxi drivers is calling for a national strike , claiming a fare hike of at least 3 euro cents per kilometre .
Negotiations will take place still today to avoid the stoppage .
A few hours ago the Portuguese government yielded , striking a deal with protesting hauliers .
While taxes on diesel remain in place , a package of measures was presented by the government that includes reduced toll fares and income tax exemptions , representing a substantial subsidy to the industry .
Economic activities non dependent on Spanish trade routes should go back to normal in the next 48 hours .
Meanwhile in Spain a deal has been struck with some hauliers organizations , but not with those in action .
Reports of violence are increasing , pierced tires , broken wind shields , cargoes destroyed ; yesterday some lorries were set in fire during the night , resulting in serious burns on at least one driver asleep inside .
The Spanish government is calling for “ cogent ” action by police forces against the picket lines .
There are several hundred lorries stranded in Spain , many of them Portuguese .
Those holding fresh cargoes are running out of fuel to maintain their goods .
Speaking to the media some of the drivers stranded considered leaving their lorries on the road and simply return home by other means .
Elsewhere , Irish fishermen are suspending the blockade to the ports of Cork and Waterford .
Belgian drivers are planning action against high fuel prices for the 19th and 20th of the month , considering a blockade of Brussels [ hat tip Migeru ] .
Lisbon ran out of diesel during the afternoon and petrol will run out still today .
Milk , vegetables and fruit are becoming very scarce in stores .
Towing lorry operators have also paralysed south of the Tagus , impairing all on road assistance to motorists .
Cars with engine problems are piling up on the road sides all across Alentejo and Algarve .
Farmers and fishermen were also in protest today in Spain , setting demonstrations in several cities of the country .
TVE had some sad pictures to show today , with confrontations between the police and demonstrators resulting in numerous injured .
At least Madrid is also feeling the same kind of shortages in supermarkets as in Lisbon ; fresh meat is becoming an especially scarce product .
High oil prices are impairing one of the most important industries in Europe , road freight transport .
Present diesel prices ( of which about 60 % are taxes ) are eating the profit margins of lorry owners .
Last Friday a strike started in Spain claiming for help from the government , with some 12 000 transport companies adhering .
During the weekend in Portugal lorry owners called a strike at a national meeting with the main intention of joining the announced actions by the Spanish unions .
But at the same time the employed lorry driver 's Union was ( and still is ) in negotiations with the Portuguese government .
The Union called on its members to not go on strike so negotiations could continue .
Feeling isolated the lorry owners transformed the strike into a blockade .
These owners are mainly small businessmen that operate with their own lorry , the big companies do n't seem to be involved .
Less than one fourth of the country 's drivers are in the protest but the blockade is affecting most of them , the main connections to Spain have been blocked as so the major oil products storage facilities .
The objective is clear : bringing the country to a halt .
In many blocking spots protesters are menacing to stone those who may try to break it .
Old tyres have been set to fire at road junctions and boarder crossings .
In Spain mobilization seems to be more deeper , yesterday several access roads to Madrid were blocked .
As here , main border routes are being blocked , accumulating lorries in a kind of no man 's land .
In some places where bolder drivers tried to break the blockade the protesters managed to halt lorries and dumped their cargo .
There are news of roads blocked also in the northern side of the Pyrenees , with French protesters mobilizing at least as far as Bordeaux .
Yesterday things heated up between protesting drivers and those eager to deliver their cargoes .
One protester was killed in Alcanena , Portugal when a driver tried to break a blockade at an important freight route .
Hours later a similar situation happened in Granada , Spain when a van hit a blocking picket also killing one protester .
A video digest of Tuesday 's protests can be found at Euronews From a round on the media these are the main impacts to normal life : Today other states will join the protest .
Irish fishermen are set to blockade Cork 's port and Scottish lorry drivers will take the road from Glasgow to Edinburgh on a slow pace , disrupting traffic in Scotland 's most transited highway .
How all these actions can impact oil production in Saudi or Russia is hard to envision .
Governments will either capitulate and reduce taxes ( something that up to now no one seems willing to do ) or recur to force and send the guard and the police against the drivers .
No option is pleasant , and none will bring the international oil market back into balance .
I can't help feeling that for road transport these are the last breaths of a dying industry .
Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter is appointing the Recording Industry Association of America 's top litigator to the Colorado Court of Appeals .
Richard Gabriel , who prosecuted the Jammie Thomas case , is a partner in the Colorado office of Holme Roberts & Owens .
Gabriel , who assumes the $ 124,000 annual post July 1 , was a convincing litigator in the Thomas case , the nation 's first RIAA lawsuit against an individual for file - sharing that went to trial .
The Minnesota jury took five minutes to conclude Thomas was liable and a few more hours to ding her $ 222,000 .
Thomas ' attorney , Brian Toder , said he recently got a call from Colorado officials who were vetting Gabriel for the appellate post , which is one court above the state trial courts and one below the Colorado Supreme Court .
" I gave him a very favorable rating .
I think he 's a standup guy and a good lawyer .
And I think he would be a good judge , " Toder said .
The Pirate Party of the United States took a different position .
" Being the lead counsel in a multi - year campaign of extortion , pretexting , and sham litigation should not be rewarded with a seat in any court , except perhaps as a defendant , " said the party 's chairman , Andrew Norton .
UPDATE
In a telephone interview , the 46 - year - old Gabriel said " I saw an opportunity to serve and thought I would throw my hat in the ring and see what would happen . "
Gabriel added that " I love the practice of law .
There are parts of it that I will very much miss .
I 'm looking forward to the next challenges and next phase in my life .
I very much enjoyed being in a courtroom representing my clients to the best of my ability . "
There was no immediate word on who would replace Gabriel as the RIAA 's top litigator .
The RIAA has sued more than 20,000 individuals for allegedly file sharing copyrighted music .

Wal - Mart Stores Inc. quietly launched a free Internet classified service , as the retailer goes beyond selling its own offerings on the Web to posting the products , pets and paraphernalia of virtually anyone who wants to list .
The Bentonville , Ark. , retailer debuted Walmart.com Classifieds last week through classified Web site Oodle.com .
The service , which the retailer described as a pilot test , carries 30 million items , including foreclosed homes , basset hounds , Madonna concert tickets and a 1981 Ford Firebird , as Wal - Mart tapped into Oodle Inc . 's menagerie of listings .
The service does n't charge the seller or the buyer and is accessible through Walmart.com , the site the company uses to sell its own products .
Wal - Mart said the new offering " further connects our community of 130 million customers who shop the Wal - Mart brand each week . "
A spokesman declined to comment on financial details of the relationship or on the length of the pilot test .
In the past , it has test - marketed online sales of movie downloads only to later discontinue the service .
Oodle.com was launched three years ago in the San Francisco area by former eBay Inc. and Excite executives .
Myth one : Organic farming is good for the environment
The study of Life Cycle Assessments ( LCAs ) for the UK , sponsored by the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , should concern anyone who buys organic .
It shows that milk and dairy production is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions ( GHGs ) .
A litre of organic milk requires 80 per cent more land than conventional milk to produce , has 20 per cent greater global warming potential , releases 60 per cent more nutrients to water sources , and contributes 70 per cent more to acid rain .
Also , organically reared cows burp twice as much methane as conventionally reared cattle – and methane is 20 times more powerful a greenhouse gas than CO2 .
Meat and poultry are the largest agricultural contributors to GHG emissions .
LCA assessment counts the energy used to manufacture pesticide for growing cattle feed , but still shows that a kilo of organic beef releases 12 per cent more GHGs , causes twice as much nutrient pollution and more acid rain .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Life Cycle Assessment ( LCA ) relates food production to : energy required to manufacture artificial fertilisers and pesticides ; fossil fuel burnt by farm equipment ; nutrient pollution caused by nitrate and phosphate run-off into water courses ; release of gases that cause acid rain ; and the area of land farmed .
A similar review by the University of Hohenheim , Germany , in 2000 reached the same conclusions ( Hohenheim is a proponent of organic farming and quoted by the Soil Association ) .
Myth two : Organic farming is more sustainable
Organic potatoes use less energy in terms of fertiliser production , but need more fossil fuel for ploughing .
A hectare of conventionally farmed land produces 2.5 times more potatoes than an organic one .
Heated greenhouse tomatoes in Britain use up to 100 times more energy than those grown in fields in Africa .
Organic yield is 75 per cent of conventional tomato crops but takes twice the energy – so the climate consequences of home - grown organic tomatoes exceed those of Kenyan imports .
Defra estimates organic tomato production in the UK releases almost three times the nutrient pollution and uses 25 per cent more water per kg of fruit than normal production .
However , a kilogram of wheat takes 1,700 joules ( J ) of energy to produce , against 2,500J for the same amount of conventional wheat , although nutrient pollution is three times higher for organic .
Myth three : Organic farming does n't use pesticides
Food scares are always good news for the organic food industry .
The Soil Association and other organic farming trade groups say conventional food must be unhealthy because farmers use pesticides .
Actually , organic farmers also use pesticides .
The difference is that " organic " pesticides are so dangerous that they have been " grandfathered " with current regulations and do not have to pass stringent modern safety tests .
For example , organic farmers can treat fungal diseases with copper solutions .
Unlike modern , biodegradable , pesticides copper stays toxic in the soil for ever .
The organic insecticide rotenone ( in derris ) is highly neurotoxic to humans – exposure can cause Parkinson 's disease .
But none of these " natural " chemicals is a reason not to buy organic food ; nor are the man -made chemicals used in conventional farming .
Myth four : Pesticide levels in conventional food are dangerous
The proponents of organic food – particularly celebrities , such as Gwyneth Paltrow , who have jumped on the organic bandwagon – say there is a " cocktail effect " of pesticides .
Some point to an " epidemic of cancer " .
In fact , there is no epidemic of cancer .
When age - standardised , cancer rates are falling dramatically and have been doing so for 50 years .
If there is a " cocktail effect " it would first show up in farmers , but they have among the lowest cancer rates of any group .
Carcinogenic effects of pesticides could show up as stomach cancer , but stomach cancer rates have fallen faster than any other .
Sixty years ago , all Britain 's food was organic ; we lived only until our early sixties , malnutrition and food poisoning were rife .
Now , modern agriculture ( including the careful use of well - tested chemicals ) makes food cheap and safe and we live into our eighties .
Myth five : Organic food is healthier
To quote Hohenheim University : " No clear conclusions about the quality of organic food can be reached using the results of present literature and research results . "
What research there is does not support the claims made for organic food .
Large studies in Holland , Denmark and Austria found the food - poisoning bacterium Campylobacter in 100 per cent of organic chicken flocks but only a third of conventional flocks ; equal rates of contamination with Salmonella ( despite many organic flocks being vaccinated against it ) ; and 72 per cent of organic chickens infected with parasites .
This high level of infection among organic chickens could cross-contaminate non-organic chickens processed on the same production lines .
Organic farmers boast that their animals are not routinely treated with antibiotics or ( for example ) worming medicines .
But , as a result , organic animals suffer more diseases .
In 2006 an Austrian and Dutch study found that a quarter of organic pigs had pneumonia against 4 per cent of conventionally raised pigs ; their piglets died twice as often .
Disease is the major reason why organic animals are only half the weight of conventionally reared animals – so organic farming is not necessarily a boon to animal welfare .
Myth six : Organic food contains more nutrients
The Soil Association points to a few small studies that demonstrate slightly higher concentrations of some nutrients in organic produce – flavonoids in organic tomatoes and omega - 3 fatty acids in organic milk , for example .
The easiest way to increase the concentration of nutrients in food is to leave it in an airing cupboard for a few days .
Dehydrated foods contain much higher concentrations of carbohydrates and nutrients than whole foods .
But , just as in humans , dehydration is often a sign of disease .
The study that found higher flavonoid levels in organic tomatoes revealed them to be the result of stress from lack of nitrogen – the plants stopped making flesh and made defensive chemicals ( such as flavonoids ) instead .
Myth seven :
The demand for organic food is booming
Less than 1 per cent of the food sold in Britain is organic , but you would never guess it from the media .
The Soil Association positions itself as a charity that promotes good farming practices .
Modestly , on its website , it claims : " ... in many ways the Soil Association can claim to be the first organisation to promote and practice sustainable development . "
But the Soil Association is also , in effect , a trade group – and very successful lobbying organisation .
Every year , news outlets report the Soil Association 's annual claim of a big increase in the size of the organic market .
For 2006 ( the latest available figures ) it boasted sales of £ 1.937bn .
Mintel ( a retail consultantcy hired by the Soil Association ) estimated only £ 1.5 bn in organic food sales for 2006 .
The more reliable TNS Worldpanel , ( tracking actual purchases ) found just £ 1bn of organics sold – from a total food sector of £ 104bn .
Sixty years ago all our food was organic so demand has actually gone down by 99 per cent .
Despite the " boom " in organics , the amount of land being farmed organically has been decreasing since its height in 2003 .
Although the area of land being converted to organic usage is scheduled to rise , more farmers are going back to conventional farming .
The Soil Association invariably claims that anyone who questions the value of organic farming works for chemical manufacturers and agribusiness or is in league with some shady right - wing US free - market lobby group .
Which is ironic , considering that a number of British fascists were involved in the founding of the Soil Association and its journal was edited by one of Oswald Mosley 's blackshirts until the late 1960s .
All Britain 's food is safer than ever before ,
In a serious age , we should talk about the future seriously and not use food scares and misinformation as a tactic to increase sales .

Wait , what ?
Google ’s Android mobile OS is running on a handset designed with Symbian as the underlying mobile platform ?
Yep , at least that ’s what it looks like from what we can see in this here video .
Apparently , some enterprising Android fan has managed to get what seems to be Android up and running on their Nokia N95 .
The videos are n’t exactly of the best quality ( read : crap ) , but we can clearly see the Android - based Google Maps application grabbing positional data and the Android dialer making a voice call .
The first video shows the dual - boot setup this guy has setup , allowing him to boot up in to Android or Symbian .
The second video shows the Nokia N95 running Google Maps and making a phone call on Android .
Now , given the lack of information we have on this video , it ’s hard to say whether this video is showing a real - deal Android installation on Nokia N95 hardware , or if it ’s just some clever UI demo cobbled together by someone with too much time on their hands .
In either case , we ’ve got to hand it to “ 0 Munch0 ” for putting together an impressive Android demonstration .

Something quite interesting happens in the first few minutes of Ninja Gaiden II :
The dead people do n't vanish .
About five minutes into the game , I finished my first battle , and it was a grisly spectacle of carnage .
I 'd killed about seven guys , and their corpses lay scattered about .
Then I went around the corner to save my progress at the " sacred statue . "
When I turned around ... the bodies were still there .
All seven of them .
Everything was intact : the fractal flowers of blood on the walls , the body pieces I 'd severed from their hosts – a couple of legs , a stray arm – scattered like doll parts .
Why was this so weird ?
Because the bodies were n't gone .
In the originalNinja Gaiden , every time you killed someone , within a few seconds the body would poof away in a cloud of eldritch smoke – leaving nothing behind , not even a bloodstain .
You 'd dispatch 20 guys , go around the corner to snare some loot , and when you came back a few seconds later , the fight scene was as clean and sterile as an operating room .
This phenomenon is not limited to the first Ninja Gaiden .
Over the years , I 've noticed that most of the seriously violent games I love deal with the corpses by simply whisking them away .
Take the recent Grand Theft Auto IV : I 'd butcher my way through a gunfight , wander off to admire the view out a window , then on the way back to my car discover that the bodies were gone , neatly as if they 'd been Raptured .
Nothing left behind but their ammo !
On the one hand , this vanishing - body thing is such a blasé convention of gameplay that it 's barely worth mentioning .
No big deal , right ?
Often the designers make the bodies disappear for reasons of gameplay , because leaving all the bodies piled up is ludologically impractical :
If every monster killed in World of Warcraft hung around forever , Azeroth would be so chest - deep in stinking corpses that you could n't walk anywhere .
The sheer metric tonnage of killing in our favorite games essentially requires that there be some sort of cleanup crew .
But still , I wonder if there is n't a moral effect here , too .
I mean , I 've been gaming for 25 years .
How many people – or monsters , or entities , or robots , or whatever – have I killed ?
If you add up all those gunfights , laser battles , BFG attacks , crazy Japanese RPG spellcasting deaths , throat - slittings from behind , starcraft pulverized by plasma missiles : Man , it 's probably nearing a million or something .
That 's war criminal territory .
So when you put it that way , this idea – that the bodies of everyone we kill just sort of wink out of existence – is so hilariously pregnant with misplaced dread that it 's practically Freudian .
It 's as if our violent games can't quite bear to have us face up to the dimensions of what we 're doing .
So they just get rid of the evidence .
Now , I 'm not saying that games turn us into killers , or that I 'm going to stop playing these things .
I 'm just ... sayin' .
All of which brings me back to Ninja Gaiden II , the Xbox 360 game that hit stores Tuesday .
Unlike in its prequels , the bodies hang around .
Indeed , they hang around for a good long while .
After I 'd killed my way through about seven battles , I experimentally backtracked all the way to the beginning , and sure enough – every body was still lying there , every blood fleck on the ceiling intact .
I peered off the edge of a promontory to spy a battleground far below and , yep :
There 's that guy I disemboweled .
Still dead .
Now , did this change the emotional , or even moral , timbre of the game ?
In some ways , yes .
You really do get a better sense that you 're a sociopath when the evidence of your crimes is stacked around you .
( The human bodies , anyway ; magikal beasts still vanish in a puff of smoke , but since they were probably undead in the first place , you could mount some legalistic argument that you did n't technically kill them .
Or something . )
On the other hand , you could argue that the moral and aesthetic content of all those racked - up corpses is n't negative .
It can be meaningful in a sneaky way :
As I meandered back over the scenes of my previous slaughters , the preposterously huge body count sometimes had a Wagnerian feel to it – all this senseless , tragic death !
Other times it felt self - parodic .
The jumbled piles of cut - off legs felt more like the severed - limb knight scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail , or maybe Ovid 's gore - flecked parodies of Greek combat in The Metamorphoses .
By leaving the bodies in , the game manages simultaneously to take the violence more seriously , and less .
We 're going to see more and more of this – because unless I 'm mistaken , the new trend seems to be to leave the bodies onscreen .
Maybe it 's the stronger pixel - pushing abilities of next - gen consoles , which makes it easier to leave the bodies around for Halo - style looting .
Personally , I applaud this trend , because it brings these hidden moral and narrative dimensions to the fore , at least slightly .
Let the dead lie .
We 'll learn something about them – and , maybe , ourselves .

Some super heroes are born with special powers ( Superman ) , some are transformed by a tragic and improbable scientific accidents ( Spiderman , Hulk ) and some just kick butt with their amazing gadget hacking skills ( Batman , MacGyver ) .
You 'll need precisely one guess to know which we prefer here at Gadget Lab .
That 's why we 've put together a list of ways that you , too , can become a schizophrenic , Lycra - clad crime fighter .
a Grappling Hook
The ATLAS Powered Rope Ascender is small enough to be carried on a utility belt and , when deployed , can drag you to the top of a tall building in a single 10 feet per second bound .
Designed by MIT student Nate Ball , the reverse rappelling device is now being manufactured by military supplier Atlas Devices .
Combine this with the Tactical Pneumatic Launch System , which will throw a line up 120 feet and you can get your Spidey on .
Check a – video of it in action at Danger Room .

Flying
The human body is good at many things , but racing through the air is n't one of them .
To get airborne , we ugly - bags - of - mostly - water need some help .
Thankfully , there have been a few birdmen willing to risk their meatsacks for us , and the gizmos they came up with will let us fly through the air , although maybe not with the greatest of ease .
The jetpack is the classic one - man flying machine .
For $ 125,000 you can buy this rocket belt from Technologia Aeroespacial Mexicana .
The price includes training and " a special machine to make your own unlimited supply of rocket fuel . "
You can keep the whole lot in your underground super hero 's lair .
Yes !

X - Ray Vision
What good is a super hero without X - Ray vision ?
It 's full of practical uses , as Superman showed us when he used it to see through Lois Lane 's clothes .
But X - Rays probably are n't the way to go , unless you want to send everyone around you off to the oncology ward .
The T5000 from Thruvision is a terahertz imaging system which can see through clothes .
Designed for use in airports , it 's not quite portable enough to fit into a pair of specs just yet , but you could easily mount one on your Batmobile .
The T5000 will spot concealed explosives , liquids , narcotics , weapons , plastics and ceramics from 80 feet .
Unfortunately , it wo n't tell you the color of Lois ' panties .

Batarang
The Batarang is clearly based on the boomerang , the antipodean airfoil .
These are thought to have been used for combat , but with a real boomerang you 'll have to choose whether you want to knock the gun out of the Joker 's hand or to have the boomerang return to you .
It ’s unlikely you could manage both .
According to Wikipedia , boomerangs were used for hunting , but only to scare small animals out of hiding .
There 's another big problem with Batman 's favorite shuriken , too .
If it 's sharp enough to cut through rope , and heavy enough to break through glass , who wants to catch it ?

NEW YORK , Jan 30 ( Reuters ) - Timeshare is not quite the investment that Patricia Uhler had hoped it would be .
While companies like Wyndham Worldwide Corp , Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc and Marriott International Inc are doing great business around the world selling timeshare , Uhler has not been so fortunate .
Finding that she has less time and money for vacations than she expected , and with combined maintenance fees climbing to nearly $ 1,200 a year , Uhler has sought to sell two weeks of timeshare that she had hoped would be a nice investment in prime resort real estate .
But in her six - month effort to sell a week at a resort in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina , and another week at a property near Walt Disney World in Orlando , Florida , the mother of two has encountered dubious brokers and the realization that most of her money is probably gone .
Buyers on the timeshare resale market are scarce , and experts say sellers are lucky to get 10 percent of the original price .
It could be even less : timeshares are routinely offered for sale on auction site eBay starting at 1 cent .
VACATION NOT INVESTMENT
The problem for many buyers like Uhler is they believe timeshare is a slice of real estate , which they hope will increase in value .
High - pressure , glitzy sales pitches can add to the confusion .
In fact , they have no ownership of the underlying property .
Rather , they ’re buying only the right to use it -- typically , a one - or two - bedroom apartment -- for a set amount of time each year .
The industry is quick to point out that timeshare is a pre-paid vacation , not an investment .
The slump in the U.S. real estate market has made things even harder for people , like Uhler , whose timeshares are in the United States .
But the resale difficulties are worldwide .
“ Timeshare is a kind of stupid , complicated thing to get involved in , ” said Briton Annie Galvin , who owns two weeks at a development in Stratford - upon - Avon , William Shakespeare ’s birthplace .
“ We ca n’t sell it even if we find an idiot to buy it , ” said the substitute school teacher from Northwood , Middlesex , who bought the weeks for a total of about $ 5,000 seven years ago .
“ We realize that we ’ve lost our investment . ”
With a generation of adults approaching retirement and looking to kick back , sales of new U.S. timeshares -- the world ’s biggest market -- have nearly doubled over the last five years .
U.S. sales hit $ 10 billion in 2006 , about five times the rate a decade earlier , according to the American Resort Development Association , the industry ’s leading trade group .
About 4 percent of U.S. households own timeshares .
In Europe , more than 1.4 million people own timeshare , with annual sales of over $ 1.5 billion , according to trade group Organization for Timeshare in Europe .
Wyndham Worldwide Corp WYN.N is the market leader in the United States , while Starwood HOT.N , Marriott MAR.N , and Walt Disney Co DIS.N are also major players here .
Wyndham , Starwood and Marriott also have timeshare resorts overseas , where the market is more fragmented .
Big lodging companies are counting on timeshare for growth , as the slowing U.S. economy threatens to put an end to the boom in the hotel business .
The Dow Jones U.S. Hotels index .
DJUSLG has fallen 32 percent drop since hitting an all - time high in July .
NO EXIT
Harry Taylor , secretary general of The Association of Timeshare Owners Committees , which is based in Birmingham , Britain , said reselling timeshare is fraught with difficulty .
“ It ’s a very poor marketplace , ” he said .
Some people are even trying to give their timeshare away in order to get out from paying the annual maintenance fees , Taylor said .
“ When they ’ve signed , they ’ve signed it for perpetuity -- you know , forever , ” said Taylor .
“ If they die , it goes to the son .
He ’s got to pay it .
There ’s no exit policy . ”
The never - ending maintenance fees and the slowing U.S. economy has pushed more timeshare than usual onto the resale market , said Ed Hastry , who runs the Maryland Timeshare Owners Association in the United States .
He said it is the worst market for timeshare sellers that he ’s seen since he started following the industry in 1988 .
But for others , the glut translates into opportunity .
“ This is the time of year when you get your best deals , because the fees are due , ” said Fran Korwek , who has bought several weeks of timeshare in Florida on the resale market .
He said he bought the weeks for less than 10 percent of their retail value .
Leading timeshare site RedWeek.com ( www.redweek.com/), which helps owners sell as well as rent their units , is finding that the developing rental market is attracting some buyers .
“ We see a growing number of individuals who buy timeshare and rent them , ” said John Locher , RedWeek ’s vice president of marketing and sales .
“ It becomes a bit of a business for them . ”
FRAUD
The desperation of resellers like Galvin has opened the door to con men , looking to exploit the hopes for big money from the murky resale market .
“ It is a huge area of fraud , ” said Peter van der Mark , secretary general of the Organisation for Timeshares in Europe , a trade group .
The typical scam involves an alleged timeshare broker , claiming to have found a buyer willing to pay a good price for the owner ’s timeshare .
The broker says he needs an upfront fee to arrange the transaction , which then never materializes .
The timeshare industry recognizes that a hobbled and fraud - ridden resale market could give the industry a bad reputation and eventually hit sales at new resorts .
The Organisation for Timeshares in Europe said it is working with authorities and has helped shut down more than 40 fraudulent timeshare brokers in Europe .
Howard Nussbaum , the president of the American Resort Development Association , likened the resale market to the used car market of the 1960s , where unscrupulous salesmen could fleece naive consumers .
He says the industry is working to create more regulation and standards for the market .
“ The health of the resale market is very important to us , ” said Nussbaum .
“ We have a dog in the fight . ”
He advises consumers looking to sell their timeshare to contact their developer or his association for help in finding reputable timeshare brokers .
Uhler , who lives in Sykesville , Maryland , and has her own driver education business , paid $ 1,200 for the week in Myrtle Beach three years ago and $ 2,500 for the Orlando timeshare , a year ago .
She can expect “ very , very , very little ” for her weeks , according to Hastry of the the Maryland Timeshare Owners Association , who is helping Uhler sell her timeshare .
Uhler , who bought the weeks as an investment and has never used them , said she has been approached by companies asking for upfront fees as high as $ 1,800 .
“ I ’ve talked to a lot of different companies that sell timeshare , but they all want money upfront , ” Uhler said .
“ I did n’t realize the deceivingness of it . ” ( Reporting by Chris Reiter ; Editing by Eddie Evans )

Ray Tracing in Haskell
I ’m giving a talk at a user group meeting next week on how to program in Haskell .
Rather than just listing off language constructs , I wanted to motivate the whole thing with an actual application .
So that ’s how I ended up spending yesterday afternoon writing a ray tracer in Haskell .
I ’m certainly not the first to do so , nor the best , but I am writing this blog post to explain the process I went through .
I ’ll try making this a literate Haskell post , so you can copy and paste it into a source file ( extension .lhs ) and run it .
The actual code is split into three ( very short ) modules , but this should work .
Some imports to start us off :
> import Data .
Maybe ( mapMaybe ) > import Data .
Function ( on ) > import Data .
List ( minimumBy ) > import Data .
Ix ( range ) > import Control .
Monad ( forM_ ) > import Graphics .UI .
Gtk hiding ( Color , Point , Object ) > import qualified Graphics .
UI .
Gtk as GTK
First , I built a couple basics of vector math .
Out of a desire to demonstrate some list manipulation functions in the presentation , my Vector type is simply [ Double ] .
> type Vector = [ Double ] > > ( <+>) = zipWith (+ ) > (<->) = zipWith ( -) > ( <*>) = zipWith ( *) > vlength u = sqrt ( sum ( map ( ^2 ) u ) ) > normalize u = map ( / vlength u ) u > u .*. v = sum ( u <*> v ) > k #* v = map ( *k ) v
Since vectors do n’t really even approximate a ring , it seems quite inappropriate to call them Num .
Therefore , I ’ve invented my own operators .
The operators in angle brackets are component - wise , while the normal dot and scalar products are given their own operators , .*. and #* , respectively .
I found this to be quite usable , though it would be equally reasonable to eschew operators , and define these as named functions to be used in infix notation .
I then define a few precedences , to make these easier to use .
> infixl 6 <+> > infixl 6 <-> > infixl 7 <*> > infixl 7 .*. > infixl 7 #*
I ’ll treat points as displacement vectors from an origin , and colors as vectors in a color space , but it helps to use separate names for them when writing type signatures :
> type Point = Vector > type Color = Vector
Now for a few real data types .
The idea is that an object has some general - purpose properties , plus a shape .
The shape could be arbitrary , but is currently limited to only spheres and infinite planes .
( Hey , this talk is only an hour and a half long ! )
So I ’ve separated it out .
The other properties I ’ve got are material properties : how shiny ( that is , reflective ) is the surface , and what is its color .
These are defined as functions from a point in space to the desired values , but in practice I ’m just going to use const .
> data Object =
Obj { shape :: Shape , > objectColor :: Point ->
Color , > objectShine :: Point -> Double } > > data Shape = Sphere { center :: Point , radius :: Double } > |
Plane { point :: Point , normal :: Vector }
And lights are important to .
Right now , I ’ve got point lights and ambient lights .
Adding directed lights ( e.g. spot lights ) would n’t be too difficult , but it is neither of critical importance nor necessary to demonstrate a Haskell language idea , so I ’ve left it out .
> data Light = PointLight { lightPt :: Point , lightColor :: Color } > | AmbientLight { lightColor :: Color }
The two things we need to know about any shape are how to compute the distance to it along a given ray ( specified by origin and a unit direction vector ) , and how to find the normal ( another unit vector ) at a given point on the surface of the object .
These next two functions do this .
They are defined for spheres and planes , but can of course be extended to new variants of Shape via additional pattern matching .
> shapeDistance :: Shape -> Point -> Vector -> Maybe Double > > shapeDistance ( Sphere c r ) orig dir = > let p = orig <+> ( c <-> orig ) .*. dir #* dir > d_cp = vlength ( p <-> c ) > d = vlength ( p <-> orig ) - sqrt ( r ^2 - d_cp ^2 ) > ans | d_cp >= r = Nothing > | ( p <-> orig ) .*. dir <= 0 = Nothing > | otherwise = Just d > in ans > > shapeDistance ( Plane p n ) orig dir > | dir .*. n >= 0 = Nothing > | otherwise = Just ( (( p <-> orig ) .*. n ) / ( dir .*. n ) ) > > shapeNormal :: Shape -> Point ->
Vector > shapeNormal ( Sphere c r ) pt = normalize ( pt <-> c ) > shapeNormal ( Plane p n ) pt = n
The math there can be derived without a whole lot of trouble , provided you ’re relatively familiar with the basic ideas of vector operations .
It surprises me , though , how many people only understand dot products in terms of their implementation ( the sum of the component - wise products , or a b cos( theta ) ) , and not in terms of what they mean .
In particular , when one of the vectors in a dot product is a unit vector , the dot product is the component of the other vector along the direction of the unit vector .
That ’s a pretty powerful tool to have .
Next come the lights .
For the lights , the general question is how much ( in each color component ) the given light illuminates a particular point with a particular normal .
The object list is needed here as well , since lights can be occluded .
This is all captured in a function applyLight , which is implemented for each type of light .
It ’s trivial for ambient lights , since by definition they ignore all the specifics of the situation ; but it ’s non-trivial for point lights .
I also fence all light components to eliminate “ negative ” lights .
> fence a b x | x < a = a > | x > b = b > | otherwise = x > > applyLight :: [ Object ] -> Point -> Vector -> Light ->
Vector > applyLight objs pt n ( PointLight lpt color ) = > let dir = normalize ( lpt <-> pt ) > dist = vlength ( lpt <-> pt ) > lval = ( n .*. dir ) / dist ^2 #* color > final = map ( fence 0 9999 ) lval > in case findNearest objs pt dir of > Just ( _, opt ) > | vlength ( opt <-> pt ) < dist -> [ 0,0,0 ] > | otherwise -> final >
Nothing -> final > > applyLight objs pt n ( AmbientLight color ) = color
Now for the common stuff .
A very common thing we want is to take our list of objects and find the nearest point of intersection for a given ray .
This function does that , by calling objectDistance for each object in turn , and then choosing the minimum one .
It gives back Nothing if there is no intersection , or Just ( obj , point ) if there is .
> findNearest :: [ Object ] -> Point -> Vector -> Maybe ( Object , Point ) > findNearest objs orig dir = > let consider obj = case shapeDistance ( shape obj ) orig dir of > Nothing ->
Nothing > Just d ->
Just ( obj , d ) > result = mapMaybe consider objs > in case result of > [ ] ->
Nothing > _ -> let ( obj , d ) = minimumBy ( compare `on` snd ) result > in Just ( obj , orig <+> d #* dir )
And finally , the ray tracing itself .
I ’ve also thrown in defaultColor , which is the color assigned to rays that have either reflected back and forth beyond the recursion limit , or that proceed into infinity .
For now , this is always black .
> defaultColor :: Vector -> Color > defaultColor _ = [ 0 , 0 , 0 ] > > trace :: [ Object ] -> [ Light ] -> Point -> Vector -> Int ->
Color > trace objs lights orig dir 0 = defaultColor dir > trace objs lights orig dir limit = > case findNearest objs orig dir of >
Nothing -> defaultColor dir >
Just ( obj , pt ) -> > let n = shapeNormal ( shape obj ) pt > ndir = dir <-> 2 * ( n .*. dir ) #* n > refl = trace objs lights pt ndir ( limit - 1 ) > color = objectColor obj pt > shine = objectShine obj pt > lvals = map ( applyLight objs pt n ) lights > lighting = ( foldl ( <+ >) [ 0,0,0 ] lvals ) > in_light = shine #* refl <+> ( 1 - shine ) #* lighting > in map ( fence 0 1 ) ( color <*> in_light )
Finally , there ’s the GUI stuff .
I wo n’t discuss this much , except to say that it ’s horridly bad .
I ’m doing the actual ray tracing in an onExpose event handler .
If I had even a modicum of common sense , I ’d be rendering to an image or something , so that I would n’t have to redo all the ray tracing just because you switched over to a different window .
Oh well .
I ’ll improve this before the talk on Tuesday .
> objs = [ > Obj ( Sphere [ - 50 , - 50 , 100 ] 100 ) > ( const [ 1.0 , 0.3 , 1.0 ] ) > ( const 0.1 ) , > Obj ( Sphere [ 50 , 50 , 100 ] 100 ) > ( const [ 0.2 , 1.0 , 0.2 ] ) > ( const 0.1 ) , > Obj ( Plane [ - 100,100,0 ] ( normalize [ 1,-0.2,-0.2 ] ) ) > ( const [ 1.0,1.0,1.0 ] ) > ( const 0.0 ) > ] > > lights = [ PointLight [ 175 , - 200 , 10 ] [ 40000.0 , 20000 , 20000 ] , > AmbientLight [ 0.0 , 0.05 , 0.1 ] > ] > > drawScene d ev = do > dw <- widgetGetDrawWindow d > ( w , h ) <- widgetGetSize d > gc <- gcNew dw > > let eye = [ 0 , 0 , - 500 ] > > forM_ ( range ( ( 0,0 ) , ( w - 1 , h - 1 ) ) ) $ \ ( x , y ) -> do > let ( x ' , y ' ) = ( fromIntegral x - fromIntegral w / 2 , > fromIntegral y - fromIntegral h / 2 ) > let [ r , g , b ] = trace objs lights eye > ( normalize ( [ x ' , y ' , 0 ] <-> eye ) ) 5 > let fg = GTK .

And there you go : a ray tracer !
Of course , there are many things that ought to be improved .
They range from the trivial ( render to an off - screen image , perhaps save to an image file , and read from a file instead of coding the scene as an immediate data structure ) to the very complex ( implement diffuse effects , more complex interpolated curves , etc. ) .
But as a quick demo goes , this one did n’t turn out so bad .
Hypothetical discussion between Foo and Bar :
Foo :
Who are you voting for ?
Bar : I think I ’ll vote for Obama .
Foo :
Why him ?
Is n’t he going to destroy the economy ?
Bar : Maybe , but I think he ’ll do less damage than either McCain or Clinton , and besides , if he does a really awful job in office , maybe he ’ll shut up this nonsense about “ real change ” once and for all — since he obviously wo n’t really change anything that matters .
Foo :
Why do n’t you vote for someone else , then ?
Write in Ron Paul ’s name , or whoever the Greenie is this time , or something .
Bar : None of them will win .
I do n’t want to throw away my vote .
There are only two ways to throw away your vote :
Stay home , do n’t vote .
Vote for the Republican nominee or the Democrat nominee when you think he or she would make a terrible president , does n’t stand for anything you believe in , and will not accomplish much ( if any ) good .
Option number 1 is pretty easy to understand , but at the same time , I think there are times that ’s the appropriate answer .
One such case , for instance , is when you simply do n’t know enough about the situation to make a smart decision .
Do n’t vote blind ; stay home instead .
Of course , you should remember that there are other issues coming up for a vote besides who ’ll be the next President , and you might know something about those situations .
Option number 2 might seem a bit counterintuitive .
The reason it seems counterintuitive , however , is not that it violates basic principles as we understand them , or otherwise involves any really surprising interactions of facts .
Most people just never really think things through , and as a result they never realize the true consequences of their actions unless someone does a really good job of explaining them — of giving people the answer rather than letting people figure the answer out for themselves .
So , here ’s how option number 2 works :
A frontrunner does n’t need your vote if you do n’t agree with him or her .
Think about it — millions of people vote .
In fact , in the 2000 and 2004 Presidential elections , more than one hundred million votes were counted .
In fact , even if you supported either the Republican nominee or the Democrat nominee on matters of principle , you could probably do more good by not voting , if you ’re really clever about it and live in a state where it ’s already pretty much a given that one side or the other will win ( imagine ideas like mutual non-voting pacts , et cetera ) .
It ’s the third - party guy that really needs your votes .
Imagine — if a person of principle who matches your ideals , but a candidate from a party other than the Republicans and Democrats , were to capture a whopping 10 % of the popular vote , the Republicans and Democrats would sit up and take notice .
So would the voters .
There are two likely positive effects of this :
Voters would begin to believe that a third - party candidate could win some day .
At more local levels than the Presidency ( such as the Senate , the State ’s Governor , the House , the State ’s legislature , et cetera ) , candidates from other parties actually could win in the very next election cycle , a mere two years away ( depending on election schedules ) .
Of the Republicans and Democrats , the party whose candidate lost would see in this good showing by a third - party candidate a deep well of dissatisfied voters to tap into next time .
You ’d then likely have an opposition party from among the Republicans and Democrats whose candidate would lean a bit more in the direction of the ideals you hold dear .
There could be some negative effects , too :
Republican and Democrat officials would of course try to alter election regulations to make it more difficult for that to happen again .
You might undermine the candidacy of the “ lesser evil ” .
Of course , in the first case , you ’re not really losing anything — because even more effective a means of keeping a third - party candidate out of office than changing election laws is getting people to refuse to vote for third - party candidates .
As such , if you stay away from the third - party candidates because of a fear of changing election laws , not only do the corrupt officials that want to prevent you from voting third - party win , but they win without having to do anything — allowing them to direct more effort toward doing other things you would rather they did n’t do .
Might as well make ’em work to make things difficult .
In the second case , think about what you ’re saying for a moment .
The lesser evil ?
Really ?
Have you read up on the views of each of the two candidates with the Republican and Democrat nominations enough ?
Have you checked out their voting records in the House , or the Senate , or their policies and vetoes and bill support from time in office as a Governor , or whatever other evidence there may be of their real motivations ?
When Republicans and Democrats are so obviously similar , and it ’s generally expected that 98 % of politicians are corrupt right to the core , trying to vote for the “ lesser evil ” is really nothing better than a crap shoot with loaded dice .
When you vote for lesser evils , all you get is evil — in part because , when you vote for a lesser evil , * you deny your one and only vote to anyone actually * good **.
There is no verifiable lesser evil , because the balance of evils in each case is so confusing and , well , heavy , that there ’s no way to come to a reasonable conclusion that one is better or worse than the other .
Of course , if you ’re a single - issue voter , you can perhaps come to a conclusion that very clearly matches your requirements for a candidate , depending on the issue .
If you ’re a single - issue voter , though , and you do n’t get what you want , you should just stay the hell home and meditate upon your obsessive ignorance for a while rather than voting .
So , yeah — maybe , if you vote for a candidate other than McCain and Obama this November , your vote wo n’t get anyone elected .
That ’s not the only benefit your vote can provide , though .
There are other effects of your vote than simply choosing a candidate .
In fact , as long as we have a de facto two - party system , it does n’t even have that much of an effect .
If you consider voting for someone who did n’t win to mean you “ throw away your vote ” , then you have no options at all except to throw away your vote .
If you ’re just throwing it away anyway , at least make a statement with the act .
You could just throw it away on something that feels dirty , like voting for the “ lesser evil ” , of course — but I choose to “ throw away ” my vote on something I really believe in .
You should do the same .
Amid a dwindling economy , a controversial war , and an incomprehensible environmental crisis , it ’s easy to overlook the more “ benign ” pitter - patter of Capitol Hill .
As modern makers we declare independence in a sense , through what we create , but count on the protection of copyright in order to exclusively maintain our intellectual property .
The Shawn Bentley Orphan Works
Act , if allowed to become law , will drastically weaken and complicate rights of individuals to pursue damages for copyright infringement .
This legislation claims good intentions , yet has been drafted with dangerous loopholes .
I urge the indie craft community to take a closer look at this bill , and act quickly … it was introduced to congress on April 24th , 2008 , and is rumored to be fast - tracked to a vote .
In this special two - part post , I will introduce you to the legislation , and Skye will jump in later with some advocacy tips .
Currently , any work you produce is automatically protected under copyright law for your lifetime + 70 years .
This includes pictoral , graphical , sculptural , and literary creations , which are common among crafters .
It does not require you to use a “ c ” symbol , or register it with the U.S. Copyright Office .
The fee for you to do so is $ 45 , and will allow you to sue for statutory damages in the instance of a lawsuit .
Even if you have not registered your work , you can be awarded losses suffered , profits gained by the infringer , and recover attorneys fees .
Should you produce a “ work for hire ” , you essentially transfer your copyright to the business in which you are contracted with .
Under Creative Commons licensing , you can voluntarily endow rights to the public to use the work .
Due to the consequences of infringement , most individuals and companies avoid reproducing any work without arranging compensation with the artist upfront , or at least getting permission .
However , ample exclusions are afforded under Fair Use for works of parody , and limited reproduction by academic institutions , libraries , and charitable non-profits .
When interest arises to use a work , whether it be in an original or altered form , the copyright holder may not be known or can not be contacted .
Therefore , many works may not live up to their full potential of public exposure , commercial profit , or derivative creativity .
Tough cookies , right ?
Concern about this has been expressed by those who wish to use this copyrighted material .
Senators Orrin Hatch and Patrick Leahy tapped the U.S. Copyright Office to conduct research on solutions for what are innocently referred to as “ orphan ” works .
A notice of inquiry was released in 2005 , and in 2006 they filed this telling report .
As you read through , you might notice some interesting suggestions made by companies such as Microsoft , Google , Creative Commons , Getty , and the Association of American Publishers , to name a few .
Based on these recommendations , the Orphan Works Act was drafted .
The 2006 version died in a judicial committee .
The re-introduced bill aims to remedy a few of the objected formalities , but is essentially the same :
The Sean Bentley Orphan Works
Act of 2008 ( full text )
In very broad terms it states that legalized infringement whether private or commercial will require a “ diligent ” search for the owner of the copyright before proceeding with use .
These searches can be carried out on the internet through any number of registries created by the private sector whom may charge a fee for their use to artists and searchers alike .
If the work is not listed in the registries the user chooses to search , they may use the work for any private or commercial purpose , and can even create a derived work subject to it ’s own copyright .
If the author of the work does come forward , they are only entitled to “ reasonable compensation ” to be determined between the two parties or a judge , and may not sue for additional damages or attorney fees .
The artist will no longer have the upfront advantage to deny permission or negotiate their fee .
The Berne Convention , the basis of regulation for international copyright , states that no creator be required register a work to gain a copyright .
Orphan Works claims to bypass this requirement , since registering is voluntary and relies on registries created by the private sector .
Indeed , corporations that deal in web search and image cataloging technology were deeply involved in drafting the bill , and stand to gain a windfall of profits upon it ’s inception .
However , for artists , this is at very least , a logistical nightmare .
This legislation has been opposed by several organizations such as the Illustrators Partnership of America , the National Union of Journalists , The American Association of Independent Music , the Association of Medical Illustrators , the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists ( AAEC ) , the National Cartoonists Society ( NCS ) , and the Advertising Photographers of America , among others .
I have sifted through a lot of information about Orphan Works , and here is my round - up of what ’s worth checking out :
How the Orphan Works Bill Affects Visual Artists
Frequently Asked Questions About Orphan Works
Orphan Works – A Unique Set of Myths and Facts by John Harrington
Audio Interview with Brad Holland of the Illustrators Partnership – Brad helped to get the 2006 version of Orphan Works canned .
He offers an interesting perspective .
There is a lot of talk as to what ’s at stake for artists and authors , but some confusion exists about copyright among crafters .
U.S. Copyright Code designates visual art of that which is “ pictoral , graphical , or sculptural ” .
Some things we make might be considered sculptural , but if your item can be designated as a “ useful article ” , it no longer enjoys the protection of copyright .
Say you design and sew a tote bag and screen print your own drawing on it .
The drawing is protected , but the tote bag design is not .
Also , the photograph you take of said tote bag is copyrighted .
Incidentally , a separate bill recently introduced that would change copyright code is the Design Piracy Prohibition Act ( full text ) .
If passed it would protect designs of the following items : men’s , women ’s , or children ’s clothing , undergarments , outerwear , gloves , footwear , headgear , handbags , purses , tote bags , belts , and eyeglass frames .
I see this as a double - edged sword for crafters .
The rampant use of indie craft aesthetics in retail apparrel really burns me up .
Yet , many of us gain inspiration from fashion trends .
Also , I ’m not entirely clear on what would be defined as a dirivitive work in these situations .
Here are a few articles I found about it :
Wikipedia – Design Piracy Prohibition Act
Forever 21 : Knocking it Off ?
Design Piracy Prohibition Act : Historical Regression
My understanding is that if this passed , design would fall under the jurisdiction of Orphan Works as well .
From what I can tell , no one has addressed the ramifications of that .
Should Orphan
Works become law , it does offer one advantage to crafters .
It would open up opportunities for us to use imagery outside the public domain in our creations .
So , I ’m just wondering … would you ?

Pixar tells story behind ' Toy Story '
When Hollywood was churning out movies full of explosions and mindless violence a few years ago , Pixar Animation Studios swam against the stream with " Finding Nemo , " a G - rated feature that received four Academy Award nominations and grossed more than $ 355 million .
Today , of course , Pixar 's filmmaking wisdom is self - evident .
Mention the animation studio and everyone nods wisely .
But Monday , as Pixar celebrated the 10th anniversary of " Toy Story , " its debut film , the creative minds behind the studio for the first time told the real story of how they almost lost the picture .
Not only did the big- money folks at Disney who bankrolled the film not understand the vision of " Toy Story , " they hated it so much they shut down production .
Of course , Pixar made the movie , the movie made millions and Disney watched itself dethroned as the king of animation by a company that Steve Jobs started in a Richmond garage .
It is an instructive story on several levels .
Pixar , as you have probably heard , has had a stormy relationship with Disney -- and Disney , at this point , looks like the loser .
In the 10 years since we met Woody the cowboy , Buzz Lightyear and the rest of the " Toy Story " gang , Pixar has won 16 Academy Awards and grossed over $ 3 billion .
Disney , once the gold standard of animation , is reeling from flops like " Treasure Planet . "
Is Pixar the new model for corporate filmmaking ?
Would n't that be nice ?
Yesterday 's press tour was a rare opportunity to cruise the Emeryville campus , where studio guru John Lasseter can be seen strolling by in one of his trademark Hawaiian shirts , and slacker - chic employees zip the halls on scooters when they are n't playing video games and foosball .
Call it the house that Woody built .
" I do n't think there is any other studio out there like Pixar , " said Lee Unkrich , the co-director of " Finding Nemo , " " Monsters , Inc. " and " Toy Story 2 . "
He 's got that right .
Where else would employees talk about creating " art as a team sport ? "
It is n't just an innovative workplace ; Pixar sounds a little like an alternative lifestyle .
With their beach garb , geek culture and fanatic attention to detail , the folks at Pixar are churning out the must - see movies of their generation .
What no one seems to notice is that , with the huge production costs of computer animation , they are rolling the dice with every new release .
Pixar has only done six feature films in 10 years .
But there has n't been a clunker in the bunch .
" A lot of studios talk about a 12 - to - 1 ratio -- they come in with 12 ideas and one of them makes it , " said Andrew Stanton , who won Oscars for writing and directing " Nemo . "
" We pick one idea , good or bad , and we stick with it until it works . "
That 's not how it happens down south , as Pixar discovered with " Toy Story . "
Disney , which was bankrolling the project , peppered the young animators with notes and suggestions .
The story was too juvenile , the higher - ups said , and the characters had to be edgier .
Afraid to trust themselves , Lasseter and his crew tried to follow all the directions .
It was , nearly everyone agrees , a train wreck .
Disney hated the movie and the idea -- and shut it down .
" Yeah that was fun , " jokes Pete Docter , who was nominated for Oscars for " Toy Story " and " Monsters , Inc . "
" And it happened right around Christmas , too . "
Lasseter recalls that he " begged " for two weeks to fix things .
The animators went back , took out all of Disney 's suggestions and made the movie they wanted to make in the first place .
And , naturally , when they screened the new version , Disney execs loved it .
There 's your corporate minds at work :
First they screw it up and hate it , and then do n't even realize that they 're watching what they hated in the first place .
But if Lasseter 's last - second fixes had n't worked , there would be no
Pixar campus , first in Richmond , and now in Emeryville today , or a potential expansion with building permits available through 2012 .
Nor would the Bay Area be known as the epicenter of computer animation .
It was one of those behind - the - scenes moments that dramatically changes the culture of a community .
And , it has to be said , Pixar has turned out to be a terrific corporate role model .
Not only has it been wildly successful , it has turned out films that nearly everyone finds entertaining and worthwhile .
The studio's movies , except for some uncharacteristically dark moments in " The Incredibles , " are almost always wholesome family fare .
The movies , and the studio where they are made , are as down - to - earth and unaffected as the creators .
How do they make it work ?
Well , a big part of it , they insist , is avoiding what they call " No , but ... . "
The idea is that when someone suggests an idea , others should respond with " Yes , and ... , " not " No , but ... . "
Docter and Stanton say that attitude comes from the improv comedy culture , and they credit Joe Ranft ( Pixar 's 45 - year - old head of storytelling until he died last week in a car accident in Mendocino County ) with bringing it to Pixar .
It all comes with the concept that , as they say on campus , " every idea is a good idea . "
" What you need to create , " says Stanton , the eighth employee hired when Pixar started 20 years ago , " is the most trusting environment possible where people can screw up . "
And follow their own vision .
So far , so good .
Happy birthday , Woody .
