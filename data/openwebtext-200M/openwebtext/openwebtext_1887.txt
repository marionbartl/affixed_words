The village would have housed hundreds of people ( Image : National Geographic )
Excavations at Durrington Walls , near the legendary Salisbury Plain monument , uncovered remains of ancient houses .
People seem to have occupied the sites seasonally , using them for ritual feasting and funeral ceremonies .
In ancient times , this settlement would have housed hundreds of people , making it the largest Neolithic village ever found in Britain .
The dwellings date back to 2,600 - 2,500 BC - according to the researchers , the same period that Stonehenge was built .
This is where they went to party - you could say it was the first free festival
Mike Parker Pearson , Sheffield University
Consequently , archaeological material has been dug up and reburied on numerous occasions , making it difficult to assign a date to the original construction .
But Mike Parker Pearson and his colleagues are confident of a link .
" In what were houses , we have excavated the outlines on the floors of box beds and wooden dressers or cupboards , " he explained .
The Sheffield University researcher said this was based on the fact that these abodes had exactly the same layout as Neolithic houses at Skara Brae , Orkney , which have survived intact because - unlike these dwellings - they were made of stone .
The researchers have excavated eight houses in total at Durrington .
But they have identified many other probable dwellings using geophysical surveying equipment .
In fact , they think there could have been at least one hundred houses .
Animal bones were strewn on the floors of the houses ( Image : National Geographic )
" It is the richest - by that I mean the filthiest - site of this period known in Britain , " Professor Parker Pearson told BBC News .
" We 've never seen such quantities of pottery and animal bone and flint . "
The Sheffield University researcher thinks the settlement was probably not lived in all year round .
Instead , he believes , Stonehenge and Durrington formed a religious complex used for funerary rituals .
I see Stonehenge more as a living monument
Julian Richards , archaeologist and broadcaster
" The rubbish is n't your average domestic debris .
There 's a lack of craft - working equipment for cleaning animal hides and no evidence for crop - processing , " he said .
" The animal bones are being thrown away half - eaten .
It 's what we call a feasting assemblage .
This is where they went to party - you could say it was the first free festival . "
Pigging out
Durrington has its own henge made of wood , which is strikingly similar in layout to Stonehenge .
It was discovered in 1967 - long before any houses .
Both henges line up with events in the astronomical calendar - but not the same ones .
Stonehenge is aligned with the midwinter solstice sunset , while Durrington 's timber circle is aligned with the midwinter solstice sunrise - they were complementary .
" One of the things we can tell from the pig teeth we 've looked at is that most of them have been slaughtered at nine months .
And we think they are farrowing in Spring , " he said .
" It 's likely there 's a midwinter cull and that ties in with our midwinter solstice alignments at Durrington and Stonehenge . "
Sacred monument
Professor Parker Pearson believes Durrington 's purpose was to celebrate life and deposit the dead in the river for transport to the afterlife .
Stonehenge was a memorial and final resting place for some of the dead .
After feasting , he speculated , people travelled down the timber circle 's " avenue " to deposit their dead in the River Avon flowing towards Stonehenge .
They then moved along Stonehenge 's avenue to the circle , where they cremated and buried a select few of their dead .
The researchers say they will find many more houses ( Image : National Geographic )
But not all archaeologists agree : " I see Stonehenge more as a living monument , " archaeologist and broadcaster Julian Richards told BBC News 24 .
" So in terms of broad understanding of the landscape I 'm not in total agreement . "
Dr Andrew Fitzpatrick , from Wessex Archaeology , who was not a member of the research team , commented : " There have n't been many excavations near Stonehenge in recent years and the new work will stimulate exciting new theories in coming years .
" But we should n't forget that Stonehenge became special when people brought the stones from Wales , 250 km away .
Some of the answers about Stonehenge are n't just to be found in Durrington , but further afield . "
Stonehenge was the largest cemetery in Britain at the time , containing about 250 ashes from cremations .
In a separate area , further up the valley from Durrington Walls , Julian Thomas of Manchester University , discovered two other Neolithic houses .
But these were free of rubbish .
The researchers think these dwellings were deliberately kept clean .
They could have been home to community leaders , or they might have been sacred sites , where rituals were performed .
Music first sent down a telephone line in 1876
So you think downloading music from the Internet via a phone line is a really cool modern thing ?
Not so .
In 1896 , Thaddeus Cahill filed a patent on the “ art of and apparatus for generating and distributing music electronically ” and until 1914 he fed music signals down AT&T ’s telephone lines with his Telharmoniums apparatus .
And he was n’t even the first .
Inventor of the telephone
Elisha Gray transmitted music over a telephone line in 1876 – the same year the telephone was patented by Alexander Graham Bell .
Gray had actually filed for a patent for the telephone on the same day as Bell ’s attorney , Marcellus Baily , filed one for Bell , a few hours earlier on February 14 , 1876 .
But Bell was awarded the patent , US Patent 174,465 – the design of which was notoriously similar to that of Gray ’s invention .
It is now widely acknowledged that Gray was the first to invent the telephone .
Gray also invented the first electronic music instrument ( synthesizer ) in 1874 , calling it the “ Musical Telegraph , ” for which he was awarded US Patent 166,096 titled “ Electric Telegraph for Transmitting Musical Tones ” on July 27 , 1875 .
Image : Excerpts from Elisha Gray ’s patent caveat of February 14 and Alexander Graham Bell ’s lab notebook entry of March 9 , demonstrating their similarity .

Claims for the invention of the telephone
Other claims for the invention of the telephone include Antonio Meucci , Johann Philipp Reis , Innocenzo Manzetti , Charles Bourseul , Amos Dolbear , Sylvanus Cushman , Daniel Drawbaugh , Edward Farrar , and James McDonough .
The debate over the invention of the telephone is discussed in detail at about.com – History of the Telephone
Alexander Graham Bell also designed an experimental “ Electric Harp ” for speech transmission over a telephone line using , once again , similar technology to Gray ’s .
Bell also was a teacher of speech to the deaf .
In 1879 he created an audiometer to detect hearing loss .
That is why the degrees of loudness came to be measured in bels or decibels .
One of the best things ever ... That 's where all the music comes from .
Birds know everything about how it should sound and where that sound should come from .
And watch hummingbirds .
They fly really fast , but a lot of times they are n't going anywhere .
Your guitar is a divining rod .
Use it to find spirits in the other world and bring them over .
A guitar is also a fishing rod .
If you 're good , you 'll land a big one .
Wait until the moon is out , then go outside , eat a multi - grained bread and play your guitar to a bush .
If the bush does n't shake , eat another piece of bread .
Old delta blues players referred to amplifiers as the " devil box . "
And they were right .
You have to be an equal opportunity employer in terms of who you 're bringing over from the other side .
Electricity attracts demons and devils .
Other instruments attract other spirits .
An acoustic guitar attracts Casper .
A mandolin attracts Wendy .
But an electric guitar attracts Beelzebub .
If your brain is part of the process , you 're missing it .
You should play like a drowning man , struggling to reach shore .
If you can trap that feeling , then you have something that is fur bearing .
Your instrument has more power than lightning .
Just hit a big chord , then run outside to hear it .
But make sure you are not standing in an open field .
You must carry your key and use it when called upon .
That 's your part of the bargain .
Like One String Sam .
He was a Detroit street musician in the fifties who played a homemade instrument .
His song " I Need A Hundred Dollars " is warm pie .
Another church key holder is Hubert Sumlin , Howlin '
Wolf 's guitar player .
He just stands there like the Statue of Liberty making you want to look up her dress to see how he 's doing it .
You need that stink on there .
Then you have to get that stink onto your music .
When you 're not playing your guitar , cover it and keep it in a dark place .
If you do n't play your guitar for more than a day , be sure to put a saucer of water in with it .
Wear a hat when you play and keep that hat on .
A hat is a pressure cooker .
If you have a roof on your house the hot air can't escape .
Even a lima bean has to have a wet paper towel around it to make it grow .

Daily Show profiles Wolfowitz World Bank scandal
David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday May 2 , 2007 Print This Email This
The Daily Show's Jon Stewart took embattled World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz to task last night for the convoluted explanation he has given for securing perks for his girlfriend .
Stewart compared Wolfowitz 's bumbling in this current controversy to his role as an architect of the war in Iraq .
" When someone has been completely wrong about everything , you 've got to put him where he can't do any harm , like in charge of the world 's poor , " Stewart said , guessing at the president 's justification for appointing Wolfowitz to head the World Bank .
Stewart outlined the steps Wolfowitz followed to " avoid " a conflict - of - interest in working with his girlfriend , Shaha Riza .
" To comply with the bank 's conflict of interest policy , Wolfowitz had Riza transferred to the State Department , given a $ 60,000 raise , a promotion and guaranteed positive performance reviews ... to avoid conflict of interest , " Stewart said .
" What 's next ?
bombing the s--t out of a country in order to save it ?
" Actually , Wolfowitz has published a book of his counterintuitive hints , here 's one :
To get red wine stains out of a tablecloth , rub dog s--t on it . "
FIELD POLL / Approval of Bush on war , economy skids to new lows /

No president since Nixon has rated worse in California 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
California voters ' approval of President Bush -- now engaged in a war of words with Democratic congressional leadership over funding and American troop withdrawals in Iraq -- has disintegrated to the lowest levels since he took office , according to a Field Poll released today .
Much of the president 's plunging popularity is due to California voters ' opposition to the war , the poll showed , as more of his fellow Republicans desert him over his handling of Iraq .
Just 26 percent of California voters surveyed by the Field Poll approved of the president 's performance in office -- nearly reaching the record low 24 percent approval rating of former President Richard Nixon in August 1974 , just before his resignation over the Watergate scandal .
The poll showed that just 24 percent of the state 's voters saw the president 's performance in Iraq in a positive light , compared with 72 percent who viewed it negatively , the poll showed .
Mark DiCamillo , director of the Field Poll , said the results reflected a " really dismal " loss of confidence in Bush , saying that " what is driving ( his numbers ) down now is that the Republicans seem to have greater reservations and are more critical of the president than they have ever been .
" That 's the only way an elected official can get into the 20s , " DiCamillo said .
" You have to start losing your rank and file . "
The Field Poll showed that " majorities of Californians now hold positions diametrically opposed " to those of the president on the Iraq war .
Two - thirds opposed the president 's decision to increase American troops by 20,000 in Iraq , nearly 60 percent echoed Democratic efforts in Congress by favoring a timetable for troop withdrawal , and half said the U.S. presence in Iraq " decreases the chances of bringing peace and stability " to that nation , the poll showed .
The findings come as the president this week repeatedly vowed to veto any emergency spending bill for the war that includes a timetable to bring the troops home .
Democrats in the House and Senate have approved separate versions of the spending bill , which include different withdrawal requirements .
The versions must be reconciled into one bill when Congress returns from its holiday recess before it can be sent to the president .
The president 's collapsing numbers and the loss of confidence , DiCamillo said , now extend to voters ' growing disapproval of Bush 's handling of the economy .
The latest poll showed that just 1 in 3 California voters approved of the president 's performance on the economy , the lowest assessment ever given Bush in this area .
The Field Poll surveyed 1,093 registered voters March 20 - 31 .
It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points .
The Field Poll results mirror a new poll from the San Jose State University Survey and Policy Research Institute released this week , which showed that Bush 's approval rating stood at 23 percent among state voters .
The institute 's poll showed that the president has suffered a devastating loss in credibility among state residents -- just 28 percent of Californians answered " yes " to the question : " Generally speaking , do you believe what President Bush tells the American people is true ? "
The San Jose institute 's survey found that the president 's positive rating on his handling of the war was a mere 21 percent , with just 1 in 5 people saying the Iraq war has made the United States safer and 24 percent saying the war has been " worth it . "
The institute surveyed 846 California adults March 26 - 30 , including 574 voters .
It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points for the overall survey and 4 percentage points for the smaller sample of registered voters .

Chase Says Credit Limit Increase Is An Opportunity !
A credit card limit increase may be an opportunity , but for whom ?
Unsolicited Credit Limit Increase
I received a letter in the mail today from Chase announcing they had increased the limit on my credit card .
I had to laugh at the first two sentences of the letter :
“ You deserve the opportunities that come with a larger credit line .
Your increased credit line of $ 13,000 gives you more flexibility to enjoy the opportunities in life with less worry . ”
I did n’t ask for this increase , so why was it granted ?
Chase proudly claims it ’s for more opportunity .
I now have greater purchasing power , however , what they do n’t mention is that their opportunity for making money increased right along with my spending power .
Credit Card Prestige ?
I continued to chuckle as the letter went on :
“ Use your Chase credit card for all of your every day needs , as well as for the larger purchases you ’ve been waiting to make .
So take pride in the prestige of using your Chase credit card and enjoy the potential of your credit line .
Its our way of saying thanks to you . ”
They remind me that my new credit line will allow me to buy the things I ’ve always wanted but could n’t and will make me feel more prestigious .
Wow , I never knew a credit card could get me what I wanted and make me feel better about myself .
They wanted to offer me these benefits to say thank you for using their credit card .
Well that ’s certainly one way to spin it .
Another way to put it is they want me to feel good about spending more money in hopes I ’ll stop paying off my balance in full each month and start paying finance charges .
Sorry Chase , not going to happen .
Thanks for the credit limit increase , but I already have enough “ opportunities ” to spend money in my life , I do n’t need any more .
Has Dick Cheney Become Colnel Kurtz From " Apocalypse Now ? " Posted by Pile ( 6752 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
If you 've seen the movie " Apocalypse Now " or read Joseph Conrad 's book , " Heart of Darkness , " you might be experiencing deja vu when seeing the antics of Dick Cheney and the Bush White House .
It seems Cheney has definitely " gotten off the boat " and the White House is running its own little nation - within - a-nation that exists in a vaporous netherworld between the Executive , Judicial , and Legislative branches .
The news media is finally perking up and digging deeper into the enigma that is the Vice President of the United States .
It seems Dick Cheney claims he's not part of the Executive branch of the government , wo n't tell anybody what he does , who he sees , or even who is on his payroll ...
Dick Cheney , the PROPHET :
" I 've seen horrors ... horrors that you 've seen .
But you have no right to call me a murderer .
You have a right to kill me .
You have a right to do that ... but you have no right to judge me .
It 's impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means .
Horror .
Horror has a face ... and you must make a friend of horror .
Horror and moral terror are your friends .
If they are not then they are enemies to be feared .
They are truly enemies .
I remember when I was with Special Forces .
Seems a thousand centuries ago .
We went into a camp to inoculate the children .
We left the camp after we had inoculated the children for Polio , and this old man came running after us and he was crying .
He could n't see .
We went back there and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm .
There they were in a pile .
A pile of little arms .
And I remember ...
I ... I ... I cried .
I wept like some grandmother .
I wanted to tear my teeth out .
I did n't know what I wanted to do .
And I want to remember it .
I never want to forget it .
I never want to forget .
And then I realized ... like I was shot ... like I was shot with a diamond ... a diamond bullet right through my forehead .
And I thought : My God ... the genius of that .
The genius .
The will to do that .
Perfect , genuine , complete , crystalline , pure .
And then I realized they were stronger than we .
Because they could stand that these were not monsters .
These were men ... trained cadres .
These men who fought with their hearts , who had families , who had children , who were filled with love ... but they had the strength ... the strength ... to do that .
If I had ten divisions of those men our troubles here would be over very quickly .
You have to have men who are moral ... and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling ... without passion ... without judgment ... without judgment .
Because it 's judgment that defeats us . "
- Kurtz , Apocalypse Now
Completely wrong .
Posted by Me. on 2007-06-26 16:01:06 Kurtz is a rogue .
Cheney is a rogue .
That 's the extent of the resemblence .
Kurtz was an idealist that revolted against a crazy government .
Cheney * is* that crazy government .
In a tongue in cheek kind of way , I 'm almost offended that you would compare the two .
Name : ( change name for anonymous posting ) Title : Comments : 1 Article displayed .
' You did this hit piece because your corporate masters instructed you to .
You are a controlled asset of the new world order ... bought and paid for . "
" Everyone has some skeleton in the cupboard .
How else would MI5 and special branch recruit agents ? "
" Shill , traitor , sleeper " , " leftwing gatekeeper " , " accessory after the fact " , " political whore of the biggest conspiracy of them all " .
These are a few of the measured responses to my article , a fortnight ago , about the film Loose Change , which maintains that the United States government destroyed the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon .
Having spent years building up my leftwing credibility on behalf of my paymasters in MI5 , I 've blown it .
I overplayed my hand , and have been exposed , like Bush and Cheney , by a bunch of kids with laptops .
My handlers are furious .
I believe that George Bush is surrounded by some of the most scheming , devious , ruthless men to have found their way into government since the days of the Borgias .
I believe that they were criminally negligent in failing to respond to intelligence about a potential attack by al - Qaida , and that they have sought to disguise their incompetence by classifying crucial documents .
I believe , too , that the Bush government seized the opportunity provided by the attacks to pursue a longstanding plan to invade Iraq and reshape the Middle East , knowing full well that Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with 9/11 .
Bush deliberately misled the American people about the links between 9/11 and Iraq and about Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction .
He is responsible for the murder of many tens of thousands of Iraqis .
But none of this is sufficient .
To qualify as a true opponent of the Bush regime , you must also now believe that it is capable of magic .
It could blast the Pentagon with a cruise missile while persuading hundreds of onlookers that they saw a plane .
It could wire every floor of the twin towers with explosives without attracting attention and prime the charges ( though planes had ploughed through the middle of the sequence ) to drop each tower in a perfectly timed collapse .
It could make Flight 93 disappear into thin air , and somehow ensure that the relatives of the passengers collaborated with the deception .
It could recruit tens of thousands of conspirators to participate in these great crimes and induce them all to have kept their mouths shut , for ever .
In other words , you must believe that Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld and their pals are all - knowing , all - seeing and all - powerful , despite the fact that they were incapable of faking either weapons of mass destruction or any evidence at Ground Zero that Saddam Hussein was responsible .
You must believe that the impression of cackhandedness and incompetence they have managed to project since taking office is a front .
Otherwise you are a traitor and a spy .
Why do I bother with these morons ?
Because they are destroying the movements some of us have spent a long time trying to build .
Those of us who believe that the crucial global issues - climate change , the Iraq war , nuclear proliferation , inequality - are insufficiently debated in parliament or congress , that corporate power stands too heavily on democracy , that war criminals , cheats and liars are not being held to account , have invested our efforts in movements outside the mainstream political process .
These , we are now discovering , are peculiarly susceptible to this epidemic of gibberish .
The obvious corollorary to the belief that the Bush administration is all - powerful is that the rest of us are completely powerless .
In fact it seems to me that the purpose of the " 9/11 truth movement " is to be powerless .
The omnipotence of the Bush regime is the coward 's fantasy , an excuse for inaction used by those who do n't have the stomach to engage in real political fights .
Let me give you an example .
The column I wrote about Loose Change two weeks ago generated 777 posts on the Guardian Comment is Free website , which is almost a record .
Most of them were furious .
The response from a producer of the film , published last week , attracted 467 .
On the same day the Guardian published my article about a genuine , demonstrable conspiracy : a spy network feeding confidential information from an arms control campaign to Britain 's biggest weapons manufacturer , BAE Systems .
It drew 60 responses .
The members of the 9/11 cult were n't interested .
If they had been , they might have had to do something .
The great virtue of a fake conspiracy is that it calls on you to do nothing .
The 9/11 conspiracy theories are a displacement activity .
A displacement activity is something you do because you feel incapable of doing what you ought to do .
A squirrel sees a larger squirrel stealing its horde of nuts .
Instead of attacking its rival , it sinks its teeth into a tree and starts ripping it to pieces .
Faced with the mountainous challenge of the real issues we must confront , the chickens in the " truth " movement focus instead on a fairytale , knowing that nothing they do or say will count , knowing that because the perpetrators do n't exist , they can't fight back .
They demonstrate their courage by repeatedly bayoneting a scarecrow .
Many of those who posted responses on Comment is Free contend that Loose Change ( which was neatly demolished in the BBC 's film The Conspiracy Files on Sunday night ) is a poor representation of the conspiracists ' case .
They urge us instead to visit websites like 911truth.org , physics911.net and 911scholars.org , and to read articles by the theology professor David Ray Griffin and the physicist Steven E Jones .
Concerned that I might have missed something , I have now done all those things , and have come across exactly the same concatenation of ill - attested nonsense as I saw in Loose Change .
In all these cases you will find wild supposition raised to the status of incontrovertible fact , rumour and confusion transformed into evidence , selective editing , the citation of fake experts , the dismissal of real ones .
Doubtless I will now be told that these are not the true believers : I will need to dive into another vat of tripe to get to the heart of the conspiracy .
The 9/11 truthers remind me of nothing so much as the climate change deniers , cherry - picking their evidence , seizing any excuse for ignoring the arguments of their opponents .
Witness the respondents to my Loose Change column who maintain that the magazine Popular Mechanics , which has ripped the demolition theories apart , is a government front .
They know this because one of its editors , Benjamin Chertoff , is the brother / nephew / first cousin of the US homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff .
( They are , as far as Benjamin can discover , unrelated , but what does he know ? )
Like the millenarian fantasies which helped to destroy the Levellers as a political force in the mid-17th century , this crazy distraction presents a mortal danger to popular oppositional movements .
If I were Bush or Blair , nothing would please me more than to see my opponents making idiots of themselves , while devoting their lives to chasing a phantom .
But as a controlled asset of the new world order , I would say that , would n't I ?
It 's all part of the plot .

Shortly after dawn , the day laborers began gathering beneath a San Diego Freeway overpass in West Los Angeles .
A house painter pulled up in a pickup , looking for an assistant .
He offered $ 12 an hour .
A worker jumped in .
Next to arrive was a white - haired woman driving a Honda .
Her garden needed a makeover .
She ’d pay $ 11 an hour .
She departed with a second worker .
On the freeway above , commuters were heading to offices in Century City and El Segundo .
Down here , at the West L.A. Community Job Center , arrangements were being made to remodel their living rooms , landscape their yards , rebuild their decks .
Advertisement
The work is undertaken by men from Mexico and Central America .
Most are in this country illegally .
The jobs , which last only a day or two and pay cash , are all but invisible to the state and federal governments .
No one has to fill out paperwork , follow safety regulations or pay taxes .
Yet what happens here is far from marginal .
The jobs that flow out of this day - laborer hiring spot -- and from thousands of others around the state , some as informal as a street corner -- are a pillar of California ’s economic strength .
To see why , check out Adrian Lopez , 20 , who is kicking around a soccer ball as he waits .
Lopez , who came here from the Mexican state of Oaxaca , is carrying in his Everest backpack a Sony Walkman from the Best Buy across the street .
It ’s got a CD by the Argentine group Los Enanitos Verdes inside , bought at a Ritmo Latino store .
He has a bottle of Kirkland Premium Drinking Water , purchased at Costco , and a spare Old Navy shirt .
He likes the grilled steak at Baja Bud’s .
He was n’t impressed by “ Monster House . ”
Advertisement
“ Immigrants buy everything here , ” Lopez said in Spanish .
The presence in the United States of Lopez and 12 million other illegal immigrants is one of the most contentious issues of the era .
Hundreds of thousands of immigrants have repeatedly demonstrated this year for legal recognition , sparking a backlash from many native - born Americans .
Congress has been stalemated between legalization advocates and those pushing punitive measures .
Economists are less divided .
In the main , they say the American engines of industry and commerce have always been fueled by a steady supply of new arrivals .
Immigrants , they contend , contribute to consumer spending and , instead of replacing native workers , create jobs .
“ Overall , immigration has been a net gain for American citizens , though a modest one in proportion to the size of our $ 13 - trillion economy , ” 500 economists wrote in an open letter to Congress on June 19 .
Advertisement
Measuring the contributions of illegal workers is a difficult task , however .
Many numbers are vague or open to dispute .
A few experts contend that the gains are not clear - cut and that any benefits are far from being universally shared .
Special interests that benefit from immigrant labor -- including agribusiness , restaurant operators and unions courting new members -- tout their gains as gains for all , said Michael Teitelbaum , who was vice chairman of the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform in the 1990s .
“ It all comes down to where you sit , ” said Teitelbaum , a demographer at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation .
“ The upper tiers benefit from immigration , and the lower tiers lose . ”
The 500 economists concede that a “ small percentage ” of native - born Americans may be hurt by competition from illegal immigrants who are willing to work cheaply .
But any harm , they say , is outweighed by the benefits to the overall economy .
Advertisement
Lopez is a case in point .
Start with his willingness to work for little .
Add his eagerness to spend .
Multiply that by the more than 2 million illegal workers in the state .
One result : Restaurant prices are pushed down by illegal labor in the kitchen , fruit and vegetable prices by illegal field hands , new - home prices by illegal drywallers .
Immigrants are n’t just a weapon against inflation .
The tens of thousands of illegal nannies in the Los Angeles area , for example , lower the cost of child care , freeing mothers to return to work .
This in turn increases families ’ incomes , which encourages spending and fuels the economy .
Many immigrants send a portion of their earnings home to their families , but their influence here remains potent .
The Economic Roundtable , a Los Angeles think tank , estimates that the 400,000 illegal workers in L.A. County spend $ 5.7 billion annually on food , rent , transportation and other necessities .
Advertisement
The sales taxes they pay on all those consumer purchases boost the state treasury .
The growing number of immigrants who use false papers to get payroll jobs are contributing to Social Security without the right to receive payments from the fund .
That props up the beleaguered system by at least $ 5 billion a year , analysts say .
Other benefits may be less obvious , such as the gains in property values enjoyed by homeowners .
Prices surged for a number of reasons over the last few years , including very low interest rates , but experts say immigrants made a big difference in California .
Their apartments and houses may be shabby , but their sheer numbers exert a profound effect .
In a state that never has enough housing , the hundreds of thousands of units rented to immigrant families put upward pressure on all prices .
Advertisement
Then there are the bad things that are n’t happening despite the immigrants ’ presence .
For instance , they do n’t seem to be creating an unemployment problem .
Joblessness in California , with 24 % of the country ’s illegal immigrants , has tracked the low national rate .
All this evidence , many economists say , makes a powerful argument that immigrants ’ role can be characterized as somewhere between important and irreplaceable .
“ The only people to benefit from the deportation of millions of low - skill workers would be other low - skill workers , who would get an immediate increase in pay rates , ” said Timothy Kane , an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation .
“ However , they would also be the first to lose their jobs during a recession -- which would be inevitable if the economy were shocked in this fashion . ”
Many Californians forcefully disagree with this assessment , saying immigrants have dragged down the quality of life in the state .
They point to neighborhoods overflowing with poor immigrants .
In some occupations , such as landscaping and construction , workers who do n’t speak Spanish say they ca n’t get hired .

Other costs carry a more defined price tag .
The California Hospital Assn. says emergency - room care for uninsured immigrants , including delivery of babies , costs taxpayers and private insurers about $ 650 million a year .
Whether born here or brought here , children of illegal immigrants have access to a free education .
The Palo Alto - based Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy estimates that this schooling costs as much as $ 6 billion annually .
Teitelbaum says the cost is even higher if you take into account how the influx has strained classrooms .
“ California used to have one of the best systems of public education , ” he said .
“ Now it has one of the worst . ”

Feeling Squeezed Out
Sean Jourdan stood on the sidewalk at an Inglewood shopping center , hawking DirecTV satellite subscriptions .
A natural salesman , he charmed passers - by into taking his bright yellow leaflets .
“ Let me give you a flier , ” he said to a woman and her grandson coming out of the Giant Dollar Store .
“ What do you have at home ?
Comcast ?
I ’ll give you double what they ’re giving you for half of what you ’re paying . ”
Jourdan took classes at two community colleges but dropped out before getting a degree .
When he was in his early 20s , he attended the Maxine Waters Employment Preparation Center in Watts , a school started after the 1965 riots .
Trained as a telecommunications technician , he was soon making $ 50,000 a year installing TV systems .

“ It was a living wage , ” said Jourdan , 32 , who is African American .
“ There are a lot of jobs out there , but only a few pay a living wage . ”
At first , many of his co-workers were black .
Over time , however , his firm reduced payments for installation .
Meanwhile , it hired more Latinos .
Many could n’t speak English , Jourdan said , so he assumed they were new arrivals from Mexico and Central America .
By the time Jourdan left his last installation job in June , the pay rate for each house call had shrunk so much that he was making only about $ 25,000 a year .
The last company he worked for had two black technicians out of about 25 , he said .
Jourdan was briefly in the media spotlight a few months ago after attending a rally for the Minuteman Project , which vehemently opposes illegal immigration .
“ They ’re the same type of people who hunted us down when we escaped from the plantation , ” he said .
“ But on this issue , I unite with them . ”

Jourdan grew up near this mall , but it ’s no longer the place he knew .
There ’s a machine that makes fresh tortillas in the Superior supermarket , signs in Spanish in the Rite Aid and a Latino construction crew redoing a vacant storefront .
“ Give me a call .
I ’ll save you money , ” he promised a young Latina .
She smiled and took the flier .
Jourdan may be upset by illegal immigrants , but many make good customers because they “ have n’t had 25 years to run up their credit . ”
Every sale that survives DirecTV ’s credit check nets Jourdan a $ 150 commission .
“ Although I can make money , it ’s a hustle , ” he said .
“ I ’m going to have to learn Spanish . ”
Workers on the margins can be hurt by illegal immigration , economists note .
A 2005 study by Harvard economist George Borjas and Lawrence F. Katz of the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that native - born high school dropouts lost as much as 8 % in wages from 1980 to 2000 because of illegal immigration .

UC Berkeley economist David Card has challenged those findings , saying cities such as Los Angeles are absorbing large numbers of laborers without wages being affected .
The plentiful supply of workers , Card speculates , has led companies to keep people at jobs that might otherwise have been automated .
Other economists wonder whether the reason for the limited effect on wages is even more basic : Instead of competing with immigrants , many native workers simply surrender , perhaps relocating to cities with better prospects .
In a new book titled “ L.A. Story : Immigrant Workers and the Future of the U.S. Labor Movement , ” UCLA sociologist Ruth Milkman uses census data to show how some jobs have changed over the decades .
Advertisement
From 1970 to 2000 , Milkman calculates , the percentage of janitors in Greater Los Angeles who were black fell from 24 % to 5.2 % .
Meanwhile , the foreign - born Latino share rose from 10.3 % to 63.4 % .
Similar transitions occurred among construction drywallers , truckers and garment workers .
As in satellite TV installation , wages for these jobs are a far cry from what they once were .
But Milkman says that ’s not because the companies replaced the natives with illegal workers .
Instead , the employers first squeezed benefits and salaries under the mantle of “ competitiveness . ”
The lengthy decline of trade unions undermined workers ’ ability to fight back .

Natives who could get out did so .
The gaps were typically filled by immigrants , but in Milkman ’s analysis their hiring was a consequence , rather than a cause , of the jobs ’ lost allure .
The surprising development is that the immigrants , far from being pliant , have reinvigorated the union movement and in some cases won higher wages .
“ The people who have been demonized , the illegal immigrants , are in some ways showing the way forward for everyone , ” Milkman said .
For Jourdan , precisely what happened to his installation wages is of little consequence .
What matters is the constant worry about slipping behind .
“ As a technician , you knew that if you went in every morning and did the work , there ’d be a check at the end of the week , ” he said .
“ Now I do n’t have that security . ”

He ’s thinking of moving -- maybe north to Palmdale or east to Moreno Valley .
That ’s what some of his Inglewood friends have done .
“ There are so many homes being built out there , so many potential customers for satellite systems , ” he said .
“ Maybe I should go too . ”
A Region Revitalized
When Panorama City in the San Fernando Valley boomed after World War II , the developers allowed only white people to buy houses .
For four decades , General Motors made Chevrolets there , offering at peak production a solid income to more than 5,000 workers .

In 1992 , the plant , the Southland ’s last car factory , was closed .
With unemployment in the county running at 10 % , few of the assembly - line workers were able to find new jobs paying them the $ 17 and $ 18 an hour they had been earning .
Similar closures happened throughout the country .
But when the plants shut down in Ohio or Pennsylvania , they tended to become permanent ruins .
The surrounding streets festered with abandoned houses and empty storefronts .
Pittsburgh , Detroit and Cleveland have had to grapple with massive , long - term population declines .
In Panorama City , vitality quickly reemerged in a new language and a new culture .
What it had -- which the cities back East lacked -- was the proximity of Mexico .
In the 1990s , L.A. County gained 1 million immigrants , most of them from Latin America , many of them illegal .
In Panorama City , the Latino population grew from a significant minority to an outright majority .

The community around the former GM plant is thriving , if not exactly upscale .
The plant itself is a shopping center called , straightforwardly enough , the Plant .
It is anchored by a Home Depot where illegal immigrants wait for work that will pay about half what the autoworkers got , with no benefits and no promises about tomorrow .
On the surrounding streets are clinics , cheap restaurants and music and furniture stores catering to Latinos .
It ’s one of many centers of the informal economy in L.A. , where most transactions are in cash .
To many Californians , this is not a change for the better .
“ I really do n’t consider the low - income parts of California to even be California anymore , ” said Kevin Waterson , an administrative employee of UC Davis , near Sacramento .
“ The quality of life is much more like that in Mexico . ”
Advertisement
A year ago , the Public Policy Institute of California polled state residents on whether immigrants were “ a burden to California because they use public services ” or “ a benefit to California because of their hard work and job skills . ”
“ Benefit ” was picked by 56 % and “ burden ” by 36 % .
Many of those in the latter camp , including Waterson , see illegal immigrants as competition .
The struggle is less about jobs than scarce community resources , including affordable homes , gridlock - free roads and good schools .
Waterson grew up in Fontana in San Bernardino County , the son of a computer programmer and a billing clerk who were able to buy a three - bedroom house , own two cars and build a nest egg .
That status , achieved by millions of Californians after World War II , now feels out of reach .
“ There are a lot of places in Los Angeles I want to live that I ca n’t afford , ” said Waterson , 27 .
“ The places I can afford , I do n’t want to live . ”
Advertisement
It ’s not just his perception .
The Brookings Institution recently found that Los Angeles was the nation ’s most polarized city by wealth .
Fewer than a third of L.A. neighborhoods are middle class , according to its study .
The rest are either rich or poor .
Waterson keeps looking for all those benefits the economists say immigration has brought to him .
But if the informal economy benefits both the immigrants and the well off , it does n’t seem to be helping him and his wife , Julia , very much .
They do n’t use immigrants to mow the lawn or wash the car or take care of the kids .
They ca n’t afford to eat out , so they do n’t gain from the toil of illegal restaurant workers .
They ’re renters , so any immigrant - driven boost to real estate just puts a home of their own further out of reach .
The informal economy that much of California has embraced so enthusiastically can be criticized on other grounds .
Advertisement
Small cash - and - carry shops and vendors who cater to immigrants may not pay sales taxes to the state or business license fees to local government .
People who hire day laborers cheat the state by not using companies that pay payroll taxes .
The laborers cheat the state by not paying income taxes .
All of these groups put legal workers and legal businesses at an unfair competitive disadvantage .
The most sweeping criticism :
By creating a market for illegal labor , the informal economy increases the supply .
If illegal laborers were n’t in such demand , they would n’t risk so much to come here .
For better or worse , immigration would not be an issue .
But for Los Angeles County , the informal economy has been better than nothing -- and nothing , urban affairs expert and Economic Roundtable President Daniel Flaming says , is what the county would have had otherwise .
“ When manufacturing collapsed , there was no effort to salvage the infrastructure for other purposes , ” he said .
“ The formal economy here has been stagnant since the beginning of the 1990s .
The only growth has been in under - the - table employment , predominantly fueled by desperate workers and in particular undocumented workers . ”
Advertisement
Without immigrants , Flaming said , Los Angeles would be smaller and weaker and poorer -- Detroit or Pittsburgh or Cleveland with better weather .
In that L.A. , Waterson would be able to find an affordable house .
But because the population might be falling , his house could very well decline in value .
“ We should be thankful to immigrants , ” Flaming said .
“ Without them , things would be much worse . ”
First the newcomers stabilized Panorama City .
Now they are pushing it forward .
The median value of a single - family home has doubled since 2000 .
And on the edge of the Plant mall , there ’s a sign that the informal economy might be yielding to a more traditional , bigger - budget state of affairs .
Starbucks , that dispenser of $ 4 venti tangerine frappuccinos to the middle class , has just opened a store .

History of Ambivalence
Five days a week , Lissette Rodriguez starts work at 6 a.m. , preparing banquet food for a mid-priced hotel southeast of downtown .
After eight hours of chopping and slicing , she goes home and takes a shower .
Four days a week , she heads to Beverly Hills , where she works from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. washing dishes at a luxury hotel .
“ Not many people could make it through 16 hours like that , ” she said proudly .
Rodriguez , 32 , arrived from El Salvador in 2004 , not to save or damage L.A. 's economy but to help herself .
Advertisement
“ In Salvador , there ’s no money , no jobs , ” she said in Spanish .
“ It ’s more expensive here , but I can make a lot more . ”
That would be $ 9 an hour , a fortune to her and a pittance to the hotels .
The fact that both sides consider it a good deal binds them together in a “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy .
Rodriguez ’s employers no more want to catch her than she wants to be exposed .
The history of California is full of ambivalence to immigrants .
“ From 1907 to 1940 , ‘ the Mexican problem ’ was a hardy perennial in Southern California , ” historian Carey McWilliams wrote in 1946 .
“ Every winter , the business interests of the region worked themselves into a lather of excitement over the cost of Mexican relief , hospitalization and medical care .
With the return of the crop cycle in the spring , however , ‘ the Mexican problem ’ always somehow vanished or was succeeded by the problem of ‘ an acute labor shortage . ’ ”
Advertisement
For most employers , any ambivalence appears to be gone .
Instead , the business community speaks in dire terms about the consequences of a widespread crackdown on the hiring of illegal workers .
“ It would be a horrible negative , ” said Jeff King , co-founder of King ’s Seafood Co. , which owns Ocean Avenue Seafood in Santa Monica and the Water Grill downtown .
“ You can not get Americans to come in at entry - level wages .
You ’d have to pay a premium . ”
That might be good for the workers , but King contends it would bring on economic disaster .
Prices would go up .
Diners would balk .
Sales taxes would fall , employment tumble .
( King stressed that the 2,000 King ’s Seafood employees are all legal , as far as the company can tell . )
By working for less than a native citizen would , Lissette Rodriguez is helping her employers ’ bottom lines .
Advertisement
To an extent , she ’s also helping taxpayers , although unintentionally .
The hotels deduct the usual taxes from her payroll checks .
But she wo n’t see a refund or , later in life , a Social Security check .
“ That money is just gone , ” she said .
“ Most illegals are scared to do tax returns . ”
Rodriguez is the admirable and problematic face of immigration in 2006 .
She crossed the border without permission and obtained a bogus Social Security number .
She knows she is breaking the law .
Yet she wants only to do what legal immigrants have done throughout U.S. history : work hard and sacrifice mightily to get ahead .
In less than two years , she has become deeply embedded in the local economy and the community .
Advertisement
All of these contradictions in one person .
All of them in 12 million people .
And more tomorrow .
“ I miss my children , ” Rodriguez said .
She wants to bring them -- a 6 - year - old girl , a 15 - year - old boy -- to Los Angeles .
This is her home .

According to
Ice breakup after each winter is violent and would destroy normal bridge piers , so the 55 - mile - long bridge would need 220 piers , cone - shaped to resemble and function like the bow of an icebreaker ship , and weighing 50,000 tons each .
The bridge would require thousands of kilometers of new road and / or track over extremely harsh terrain through the wilderness of Alaska and Siberia .
The concept of an overland connection crossing the Bering Strait goes back at least a century .
The route would lie just south of the Arctic Circle , subject to long , dark winters and extreme weather ( average winter lows − 20 °C with possible lows approaching − 50 °C . ) .
Winter maintenance of any exposed roadway would be difficult and closures frequent .
Even maintenance of enclosed roadways and pipelines could also be affected by winter weather .
According to Discovery Channel the Bering Strait could be spanned by a series of three bridges via the Diomede Islands for a total distance of about 80 km ( 50 miles ) .
The two long spans would be comparable in length to the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway , the current longest bridge .

The bridge would require thousands of kilometers of new road and / or track over extremely harsh terrain through the wilderness of Alaska and Siberia .
The bridge as envisioned would be three stories : the top for vehicle traffic , the middle for high - speed trains , and the bottom for oil and gas pipelines .
The top would be open to cars and trucks only during summer months .
Discovery Channel 's Extreme Engineering estimates the cost of a highway , double track rail and pipelines , including continuations on land , at $ 105 billion .
This excludes the cost of new roads and railways to reach the bridge .
There have been long discussions about a highway for the benefit of residents in western Alaska , but environmental concerns and fears of undue cultural influence from a higher number of visitors to Eskimo villages have obstructed these plans .

A DEVICE that can pick up on people ’s emotions is being developed to help people with autism relate to those around them .
It will alert its autistic user if the person they are talking to starts showing signs of getting bored or annoyed .
One of the problems facing people with autism is an inability to pick up on social cues .
Failure to notice that they are boring or confusing their listeners can be particularly damaging , says Rana El Kaliouby of the Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
“ It ’s sad because people then avoid having conversations with them . ”

Ifcan stick it out on Earth for another two billion years , our descendants may witness quite a show in the night sky .
Researchers estimate that the Milky Way will collide with its nearest neighbor , the Andromeda galaxy , at around that time — well before the sun collapses into a white dwarf , perhaps destroying the Earth in the process .
This close encounter of the galactic kind could easily kick our solar system to the farthest reaches of the galaxy , and there is a small chance we might even take up residence in Andromeda , according to astronomers T. J. Cox and Abraham Loeb of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Mass .
The pair simulated the collision by estimating the relative speed between the two galaxies and the amount of gas and dark matter in the intervening space , which exerts a drag on their motions .
Andromeda is currently 2.3 million light - years from our galaxy .
Researchers know that the two neighbors are approaching each other at 120 kilometers per second , but they are far less certain of Andromeda 's sideways speed .
If moving fast enough to the side , it would miss us entirely .
" I think it 's very likely they will come together , " Loeb says .
" The issue is , will it be [ in ] three billion years , five billion years or 10 billion years ? "
Taking their cue from the latest models of the galaxies ' structures , Cox and Loeb assumed a relatively small sideways motion .
Based on this assumption , Andromeda would first graze the Milky Way two billion years from now , they report in a paper submitted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
The two galactic cores would orbit each other for another three billion years before merging .
During that time , the stars making up the two spiral galaxies would slowly coalesce into a more elliptical combo galaxy , " Milkomeda " ( or the Andromedy Way , if you prefer ) .
Although most of the stars would be too sparsely spaced to bump together , one galaxy 's gravity would jostle the other 's stars .
The fate of the sun , which is expected to last at least until the simulated merger , would depend on where it was in its 24,000 light - year - wide orbit around the galactic core .
The researchers estimate that by the time the cores had fused , the solar system would have a 50 percent chance of being swept to a wispy tail extending from Milkomeda , three times further out from galactic center than it is now .
Cox and Loeb also find a 3 percent chance of the sun being nudged into orbit around Andromeda when the two galaxies first collide .
Of course , they note , different assumptions for the simulation would likely result in different outcomes .
" What 's cool about this , " says astronomer Gregory Laughlin of the University of California in Santa Cruz , " is they track a reasonable orbit for the sun and sort of give a plausible range of scenarios for what the solar system might encounter .
It 's fun to speculate on this stuff . "
How the TLS Toolkit works
The TLS Toolkit provides secure connectivity to devices with a small memory footprint .
It has evolved to also serve networking devices requiring the highest levels of performance .
TLS Toolkit is a lean and efficient C source code SDK that is easy to integrate , and is the SDK to replace RSA BSAFE or OpenSSL .
With clear and well documented source code , integration is faster and smoother than alternatives .
Further simplifying and accelerating integration , Rambus offers developer - level support .
The TLS Toolkit has always been quick to adopt the latest TLS specifications .
The standard TLS Toolkit can be configured to a minimal code footprint of 66 KB ( PSK ) .
Manual optimization can further reduce the code footprint to meet the needs of memory constrained devices .
For applications that require FIPS validation , TLS Toolkit is also offered with a state - of - the - art FIPS 140 - 2 validated crypto module , which has been deployed in hundreds of millions of devices .
For applications switching from OpenSSL a compatibility layer is provided to ease and accelerate migration to the Rambus TLS Toolkit .

BBC News security correspondent
At the heart of the Intelligence and Security Committee 's report into rendition is the story of the UK 's intense but occasionally difficult relationship with the US when it comes to intelligence sharing and counter - terrorism since 9/11 .
MPs found " surprising " aspects of the Anglo - US relationship
The report makes clear just how important the relationship with the US is over counter - terrorism , in the eyes of top British officials .
" It is neither practical , desirable , nor is it in the national interests , for UK agencies to carry out [ counter - terrorism ] work independently of the US effort , " argued the Chief of MI6 , Sir John Scarlett , before the committee .
But the ISC report reveals aspects of the usually close Anglo - American intelligence relationship that are " surprising and concerning " .
These tensions have centred on the evolving US policy of rendition - the transferring detainees from one country to another , in some cases to stand trial , in other cases to US military detention or even to third countries for interrogation - and its alleged mistreatment .
This policy has meant that for British intelligence " ethical dilemmas are not confined to countries with poor track records on human rights - the UK now has some ethical dilemmas with our closest ally " because of " very different legal guidelines and ethical approaches " .
' Frenetic '
The practice of rendering suspects to trial in the US or elsewhere pre-dated 9/11 and the UK was marginally involved .
But after 9/11 it took on a whole new direction and intensity , one which British intelligence only gradually understood .
In the months after 9/11 , the atmosphere was , in the words of an MI6 officer " frenetic " .
" We were struggling very hard .
It felt like trench warfare , " explained the former head of MI5 to the committee .
The focus on preventing further attacks meant that significant changes in US policy were not immediately appreciated by British intelligence .
When MI6 was given notice of new detention powers by US counterparts , they were sceptical , believing it part of the " tough talk " coming out of Washington post - 9/11 rather than marking a major substantive shift .
In fact the shift was real when it came to rendition and detention of terrorist suspects and the committee found that MI6 should have " appreciated the significance of these events and reported them to ministers " .
It was only with a number of specific cases in 2002 that it began to dawn on British intelligence just how the US was now operating and that the US was transferring people not just to home countries or the US for trial but to other countries and facilities .
' Black sites '
The case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , detained in March 2003 , seems to have been a watershed for MI5 and MI6's understanding of what the US was up to , raising new questions .
The UK has lost its " inhibitions " about questioning the US
After his arrest , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been transferred to one of the so - called CIA " black sites " where he was subjected to practices such as simulated drowning or water - boarding .
From 2004 , MI5 and MI6 realised that their existing guidance was not sufficiently detailed to deal with these kind of new questions regarding co-operation and it had to be updated .
In one case in early 2005 , MI6 developed an operation that might have produced high - value intelligence on a target but the plan was dropped as it could not be sure of how the target of the operation would be treated and how long they would be detained .
The report also looks at a number of specific cases of alleged British involvement in rendition .
UK concerns
In some cases , it finds nothing to criticise , although in the case of Bisher Al - Rawi and Jamil El - Banna , the detail is particularly illuminating when it comes to US - UK intelligence relations .
Information passed to the US on the men was transmitted with an assurance that no action would be taken on the basis of it .
But the men were picked up after travelling from the UK to Africa and eventually transferred to Guantanamo .
The UK expressed its concerns but there was a " lack of regard on the part of the US for UK concerns " as it ignored protests of both MI5 and the government .
US flights passed through UK airspace , the report said
" This has serious implications for the working of the relationship between the US and UK intelligence and security agencies , " the committee argues .
Much of the attention has been on the issue of CIA rendition flights transiting through UK airspace and airports .
Here , the committee finds that while there is plenty of evidence of CIA flights coming through - including some which had just carried prisoners - there is no evidence of any flights carrying actual prisoners having passed through the UK , although it notes poor record - keeping in the past .
The report makes clear that British policy when it comes to liaison with foreign services has changed .
" We certainly have inhibitions ... greater inhibitions than we once did , " testified Eliza Manningham - Buller when she was still head of MI5 .
" We would now absolutely say , where is this man ?
What are you going to do with the information ?
Where is he being held ? "
The report notes that while the US may take note of UK protests over rendition , such concerns do not appear to affect US strategy in any way .
As a result , the UK intelligence community has had to find ways to work round the problems and maintain the exchange of intelligence which everyone agrees is " critical " to UK security .
( From the diaries .
Among other things , it 's great seeing grassroots Nevada Democrats speaking out against their " leadership 's " brain - dead actions -- kos . )
Over the past week and a half , many of us have been engaged in a very public conversation with the Nevada Democratic Party leadership on their choice to have Fox News host a Presidential forum in August in Nevada .
3500 of you sent emails to Nevada State Party Chair Tom Collins through Blogpac .
Moveon has a petition , and Robert Greenwald has created a video at FoxAttacks where the petition is hosted to demonstrate the partisan nature of Fox News as an information source .
The argument that we 've made is not that the Fox News audience is bad in and of itself .
It 's important to talk to the whole public ; the election of Howard Dean to DNC Chair was about the 50 state strategy , and no one has pushed that strategy harder than the progressive wing of the party .
And it worked , in 2006 , as we elected a whole host of members of Congress that seemed unlikely to win when insiders in DC were drawing up their prognostications for yet another swing state strategy .
No , the problem that we have is that allowing Fox News to singlehandedly host the debate gives that channel the legitimacy of claiming to be a real news source .
If the Democratic Party places its highest and most valuable political debate - that over our nominee to the Presidency - on Fox News , we are giving a Republican partisan news outlet the ability to argue that they are not biased .
We force thousands of diehard Democrats to watch a Republican propaganda outlet , and allow Fox News to spin and impute meaning to the debate .
This is a serious problem .
The reaction to our reasonable request has unfortunately not been what we had hoped .
Harry Reid has basically stayed silent , and as one of the most powerful Democrats in the country , and certainly the most powerful in Nevada , he has a part in this decision .
It 's hard to believe that he would not take some interest in a Presidential forum in his state .
After a few days , several Nevada union leaders , including Danny Thompson of the Nevada AFL - CIO , D. Taylor of the Culinary Union , and Rusty McAllister of the Firefighters , backed the choice of Fox News by Tom Collins of the Nevada State Democratic Party , arguing that Democrats need to reach out to a diverse audience segment .
Of course , Fox News makes regular and dishonest arguments against the minimum wage , for corporate abuses , and for privatizing Social Security .
Prominent Fox
News figures use misleading statistics to bolster the case for right - wing economics , and we can be sure that Fox News is very willing to spread lies about stronger labor law protections .
The reaction was not uniformly negative .
Michael Zahara , a Clark County member of the Nevada State Democratic Party ’s Executive Board , bravely and publicly argued that this decision was a poor one , and more to the point , was made in a veil of secrecy .
In the case of the decision to include FOX News in our partisan pre-caucus debate this August , apparently those who made this decision forgot who and what FOX News is and who and what our opponents are .
This was not a NV Dems decision , this was a unilateral move without the consultation of the Executive Board of the Democratic Party of the State of Nevada , nor the executive boards of the other sponsor states .
He went on to point out that grassroots Nevada Democrats are unhappy with this decision :
The overwhelming majority of our State Central Committee and our voters have a big problem with this decision .
My email box is filled with the opinions of those who elected me to my position on the Board and others .
75 % are in favor of my views on this matter .
Despite various leaders backing the decision with lukewarm calls for diversity , it looks like the majority of Nevada Democrats paying attention to this discussion do not like Fox News 's role in the Presidential forum .
Now to be clear , many of us who disagreed with the Nevada Democratic Party 's choice of Fox News are not averse to having Fox News broadcast the debate .
We simply object to having Fox News legitimized as a neutral news source by being the sole host of the debate .
As such , some of our allies asked the Nevada Democratic Party if they would allow Air America to co-host the debate and have equal panelists to balance Fox News and their partisan approach to politics .
This would have accommodated their desire to reach conservatives while also making it clear that Fox is not a neutral news outlet .
It would further increase the diversity of the viewership of the debate .
I believe that we 're open to other arrangements as well , anything that does not legitimize Fox News as a neutral news outlet .
The Nevada State Democratic Party rejected these requests .
Tom Collins , who is the Chair of the Party , apparently does not think that Fox News 's partisan agenda is enough to warrant a reexamination of the debate arrangement , or even a real conversation about how the party handles the Presidential contest .
In fact , it 's impossible to find out who made the decision to let Fox News host the debate .
As Michael Zahara said :
Regrettably , no one is owning up to this mistake and by all appearances , it was FOX that came with their Trojan Horse to those who made this decision .
We simply do n't know what the truth is at this point , and likely never will .
I 'm less concerned with who is responsible and more interested in immediately relieving FOXNEWS of their participation in our partisan event and protecting our candidates and Caucus ...
As I said before , none of us on the Executive Board of the NSDP , or the other states were in the loop on this .
The outgoing Chair may have felt that he had the authority to act unilaterally , but many of us believe he should have consulted us .
Trust that this decision very likely would n't have passed a vote of our E - Board , and would not have garnered the support of our State Central Committee here in Nevada .
Clearly something is not right in how this decision was made .
Nevada Democrats do not support it , the Executive Board never voted on it , and I doubt that many who mouthed support for this decision were fully briefed on what this decision meant .
What is needed right now in Nevada is the kind of leadership shown by Democrats like Michael Zahara .
Senator Reid , the most powerful official in Nevada and a key leader in the national Democratic Party , is either part of these decisions or could substantively accommodate our legitimate concerns .
At this point , he 's simply being silent and evasive , just like the Nevada Democratic Party ( this despite Fox News 's constant and baseless attacks on his patriotism and character ) .
Please call Reid 's offices and ask him to not legitimize Fox News as a neutral news outlet .
If you are not in Nevada , use this number : 202-224-3542 / Fax : 202-224-7327
If you live in Nevada , use this number , which is restricted to 775 and 702 area codes : 1-866-SEN-REID ( 736-7343 )
It 's time to let Senator Reid know that we want him to act like a good Democrat and ensure that the candidate forum in August treats the Democratic Party and our Democratic leaders vying for the Presidency with the respect that they deserve .
Treating Fox News as a neutral news outlet by letting them solely host this debate does not do that .

What Really Divides Us ?
by Rep. Ron Paul , MD
The overwhelming media response to recent remarks by Senator Trent Lott shows that the nation remains incredibly sensitive about matters of race , despite the outward progress of the last 40 years .
A nation that once prided itself on a sense of rugged individualism has become uncomfortably obsessed with racial group identities .
In the aftermath of the Lott debacle , we must not allow the term " states ’ rights " to be smeared and distorted into code words for segregationist policies or racism .
States ’ rights simply means the individual states should retain authority over all matters not expressly delegated to the federal government in Article I of the Constitution .
Most of the worst excesses of big government can be traced to a disregard for states ’ rights , which means a disregard for the Ninth and Tenth amendments .
The real reason liberals hate the concept of states ’ right has nothing to do with racism , but rather reflects a hostility toward anything that would act as a limit on the power of the federal government .
Yet it is the federal government more than anything else that divides us along race , class , religion , and gender lines .
The federal government , through its taxes , restrictive regulations , corporate subsidies , racial set - asides , and welfare programs , plays far too large a role in determining who succeeds and who fails in our society .
This government " benevolence " crowds out genuine goodwill between men by institutionalizing group thinking , thus making each group suspicious that others are receiving more of the government loot .
Americans know that factors other than merit in the free market often play a part in the success of some , and this leads to resentment and hostility between us .
Still , the left argues that stringent federal laws are needed to combat racism , always implying of course that southern states are full of bigoted rednecks who would oppress minorities if not for the watchful eye of Washington .
They ignore , however , the incredible divisiveness created by their collectivist big - government policies .
Racism is simply an ugly form of collectivism , the mindset that views humans only as members of groups and never as individuals .
Racists believe that all individual who share superficial physical characteristics are alike ; as collectivists , racists think only in terms of groups .
By encouraging Americans to adopt a group mentality , the advocates of so - called " diversity " actually perpetuate racism .
Their intense focus on race is inherently racist , because it views individuals only as members of racial groups .
Conservatives and libertarians should fight back and challenge the myth that collectivist liberals care more about racism .
Modern liberalism , however well intentioned , is a byproduct of the same collectivist thinking that characterizes racism .
The continued insistence on group thinking only inflames racial tensions .
The true antidote to racism is liberty .
Liberty means having a limited , constitutional government devoted to the protection of individual rights rather than group claims .
Liberty means free - market capitalism , which rewards individual achievement and competence , not skin color , gender , or ethnicity .
In a free market , businesses that discriminate lose customers , goodwill , and valuable employees — while rational businesses flourish by choosing the most qualified employees and selling to all willing buyers .
More importantly , in a free society every citizen gains a sense of himself as an individual , rather than developing a group or victim mentality .
This leads to a sense of individual responsibility and personal pride , making skin color irrelevant .
Rather than looking to government to correct what is essentially a sin of the heart , we should understand that reducing racism requires a shift from group thinking to an emphasis on individualism .

The Best of Ron Paul
You ’ve probably realized by now that software development and entrepreneurship are two very different things .
Software development is a tiny subset of the skills an entrepreneur needs to launch and operate a successful software or web startup .
If you ’ve been writing code for years you ’ve likely formed opinions that do n’t quite hold true in the world of entrepreneurship .
This lesson covers a handful of realizations that you will come to at some point during your transition from developer to entrepreneur .
Realization # 1 : Being a Good Technician is Not Enough
In The E - Myth Revisited author Michael Gerber talks about the archetypes of running a business .
They are : entrepreneur , manager and technician ( discussed in more detail here ) .
The entrepreneur is the dreamer , the visionary , and the creative mind .
The manager is the person who thinks about return on investment ( ROI ) , near - term success , and productivity .
The technician gets the work done .
She follows the manager ’s guidance and is concerned about today ’s success .
95 % of developers are comfortable , and probably excel at , being technicians .
This means you ’re good at writing code , producing something tangible , and cranking away on each task , moving one step closer to launch date .
But it takes more than a technician to run a successful business .
It ’s critical to look ahead into the near - term and determine which features or marketing efforts will provide the best ROI ( manager ) , and to think out a year or more to determine the long - term direction of your business ( entrepreneur ) .
The first step is to determine your goals and objectives .
Without planning , organizing , systematizing , outsourcing , and marketing , all things you will shy away from as a technician , you will never make it past the $ 25 / hour pit you see many one - person companies fall into .
Realization # 2 : Market Comes First , Marketing Second , Aesthetic Third , and Functionality a Distant Fourth
The product with a sizable market and low competition wins even with bad marketing , a bad aesthetic , and poor functionality .
Think QuickBooks in the early days , or any niche product you ’ve ever seen that looked like it was written by a six year old but sold thousands of copies .
In the same market , the product with better marketing wins .
Every time .
In the same market with equal marketing , the product with the better design aesthetic wins .
Sure , a few people will dig deep enough to find that the “ ugly ” product has better or more functionality , but the product that wins is the one that has the best looking website and user interface .
Functionality , code quality , documentation …are all a distant fourth .
I know this sounds sacrilegious , but unless you ’re marketing to software developers – they can be an exception to this rule – your order of importance is market , marketing , aesthetic , function .
Realization # 3 : Things Will Never Be As Clear As You Want Them to Be
Writing code is cut and dry .
There are different ways to accomplish the same thing , but in general you know how you want your application to behave and you just need to get it there .
Your constraints are constant – the compiler behaves the same way it did the last time you compiled .
By comparison entrepreneurship , especially the marketing side , is never this clear .
Even the foremost marketing experts in the world are not sure whether people will buy a new product .
People with 20 , 30 and 40 years of experience still have to take their best guess at what will succeed .
They have to try things out and adjust as they go .
They often do small roll - outs to test audiences and adjust the product or the message before unleashing it on the world .
You will have to do the same and it will involve a lot of guesswork at the start , which is a hard pill to swallow when you ’re used to making decisions based on fact .
Instead , you have to take your best guess , then measure and tweak .
And then do it 20 more times until you succeed .
Realization # 4 : You Have to Measure & Tweak
Like me , you ’ve probably visited hundreds of startup websites in the past 6 months .
Each one had about three seconds to sell you on their product … three seconds to convince you to click a link that was n’t your back button .
You will soon be on the other side of the equation , and you will have three seconds to sell someone on your product .
And you know what ?
You ’re going to fail .
A lot .
Your early conversion rates are going to be abysmal .
So low you ’re going to email your web analytics provider asking if there ’s a known bug in their conversion report .
You ’re going to wonder why no one is trying your demo , watching your product tour , or buying your product .
This is why you have to measure and tweak .
You have no chance of achieving an optimal marketing message on your first try .
So you have to observe your visitors ’ behavior and change pricing , headlines , screenshots , buttons , and a number of other factors … and watch how they behave when you do .
Realization # 5 : You Will Never Be Done
Finishing a software project is a great feeling .
The night you roll the new bits to the production server is indescribable .
The feelings of relief , joy , accomplishment …are some of the most rewarding parts of developing software .
And you ’re never going to feel that way with your product .
Sure , you ’ll have releases and milestones .
And you ’ll feel good the day you launch a new version .
But you will never feel “ done . ”
You will always have a list of features , marketing tests , potential partnerships , and new markets to take care of .
And while the journey is itself a gift , never having the feeling of completion is something you need to get used to .
The idea of building an application and sitting back to collect a check is , unfortunately , a pipe dream .
You have to continually invest in both your product and your marketing in order to remain successful .
Wall Street drools over prospect of capturing Iraq oil wealth
By Patrick Martin
6 March 2007
The Iraqi cabinet ’s adoption last week of a law creating the legal framework for turning over the country ’s oil wealth to American corporations has touched off a chorus of salutes from the Bush administration , congressional Democrats and the corporate - controlled American media .
Perhaps the crassest expression of money - grubbing glee came in the Wall Street Journal , which published an article March 4 celebrating the unlocking of untold riches , including “ dozens of untouched oil fields loaded with proven reserves and scores of exploration blocks that may prove a magnet to international oil companies . ”
The draft law lists 51 oil fields , 27 in production and the balance with proven reserves , as well as 65 exploration blocks .
The fallow fields and exploration blocks are located in every region of the country , while the working fields are concentrated in the northern region around Kirkuk and in the southern region near the border with Kuwait .
Citing a cabinet document , the Journal reported that “ Iraqi officials must first agree to the framework of contracts to be used when negotiating with foreign oil companies by March 15 if the country ’s draft hydrocarbons law is to be submitted to parliament for its approval . ”
The draft law calls for reviewing and renegotiating contracts with Russian , French and Chinese oil producers , signed under Saddam Hussein .
These countries , which initially opposed the US invasion , are expected to be cut out of any lucrative oil deals in favor of American and British companies .
The government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki endorsed the draft law February 26 , after months of bitter conflicts among the representatives of rival bourgeois factions within Iraq — Kurdish , Sunni and Shiite — over the terms of the deal .
Approval is likely in the Iraqi parliament , although not certain , as news of the agreement is sure to provoke widespread popular outrage over the sell - off of the country ’s most valuable resource .
The cabinet conflict revolved around two related issues : Kurdish determination to hold onto Kirkuk , a city of mixed Arab , Kurdish and Turkomen population that is the center of the northern branch of Iraq ’s oil industry ; and the Sunni demand for revenue - sharing at the national rather than regional level , since the proven oil reserves are largely in the Shiite and Kurdish populated areas , with relatively little in the central and western provinces where most Sunnis live .
Neither issue was completely settled , but the formula agreed upon under heavy pressure from outgoing US Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad , who reportedly dictated the final terms , provides rather more concessions to the Sunnis , largely at the expense of the Kurds .
In public , the Bush administration and congressional leaders of both parties have cited the working out of inter-ethnic compromises as the main purpose of the oil legislation .
In reality , however , the Bush administration sought an agreement on whatever terms it could impose , so that the Iraqi oil industry could be placed on legal foundations suitable for opening it up to foreign ( and largely American ) capital .
The most important aspect of the bill is that it revives a semi-colonial form of oil contract called a “ production - sharing agreement , ” which would give foreign companies first claim on any oil they help Iraq ’s nationalized industry extract from the country ’s enormous reserves , estimated at 115 billion barrels .
Production - sharing agreements were devised by the multinational ( mainly US , British , French and Dutch ) oil companies in response to the efforts of the bourgeoisie in the OPEC nations — Iran , the Gulf sheikdoms , Libya and Venezuela — to establish national oil companies and negotiate more favorable terms .
Under a PSA , the multinationals could continue operating the oil industries in these countries while the oil resources were nominally taken under national ownership .
The oil companies were guaranteed first right to oil revenues .
This structure became largely discredited as providing only the semblance of national control over oil resources , and only 12 percent of worldwide production is currently conducted under PSAs — with none at all in the Middle East .
The new Iraqi law would allow regional authorities to enter into PSAs in which oil companies would be guaranteed up to 70 percent of the revenues , as well as an unrestricted right to take their profits out of Iraq , rather than reinvesting them in the industry .
According to the oil minister , Hussain al - Shahristani , as many as 65 of Iraq ’s 80 known oilfields would be put up for bid to foreign oil producers .
Any region that can produce at least 150,000 barrels of oil a day can create its own operating company — with the result that dozens of relatively small companies could be formed , easy prey for the giant multinational corporations to manipulate , bribe or buy outright .
The law would reestablish the state - run Iraq National Oil Company , shut down by Saddam Hussein in 1987 in favor of an oil ministry .
This legal change is a step towards actual sale of the entire industry , which could take the form of selling an interest in the new INOC to one or several big foreign producers , or entering into joint ventures .
One of the most glaring failures of the Bush administration ’s occupation of Iraq — from the standpoint of the American ruling elite — has been its inability to revive the oil industry .
Under the impact of US and UN sanctions , Iraqi oil production had already fallen from 3.7 million barrels a day at its peak to 2.6 million barrels a day just before the US invasion .
This figure has declined further to barely 2 million barrels a day , much of which is stolen and traded on the black market rather than exported .
The significance of the oil law was widely commented on in the American ruling elite .
White House spokesman Tony Snow called it the “ key linchpin ” in Iraq ’s rebuilding , and congressional Democrats and Republicans praised the agreement as a vital step forward .
Ambassador Khalilzad , in an op - ed column published March 3 in the Washington Post , declared the agreement “ a significant achievement for Iraqis ’ national reconciliation .
It demonstrates that the leaders of Iraq ’s principal communities can pull together to peacefully resolve difficult issues of national importance . ”
Actually , the agreement signifies that no section of the Iraqi bourgeoisie — Sunni , Shiite or Kurdish — is capable of adopting an independent stand towards American imperialism .
All are seeking to maneuver with Washington , and to a lesser extent the European imperialist powers , to secure their own share in the division of the spoils .
Nothing will come of the oil deal for the Iraqi people , whose society continues its plunge into unchecked sectarian and ethnic strife .
Khalilzad declares that under the terms of the bill , “ Iraq would adopt the best international practices for the development and management of its mineral wealth . ”
The meaning of these “ best international practices , ” of course , is that Iraq ’s mineral wealth will be turned over to the multinational corporations .
The maintenance of state ownership is purely nominal : as in other PSAs , the oil will be legally the property of the people of Iraq , but the vast bulk of the revenues and profits will go to ExxonMobil , ChevronTexaco , Shell and BP .
Journalist and author Dilip Hiro , writing in the Guardian January 9 , noted the stage - managed character of the “ Iraqi ” decision to hand over control of the country ’s oil resources to US oil companies .
He wrote , “ The early draft of the proposed law , prepared with the assistance of BearingPoint , an American consultancy company hired by the Bush administration , was sent to the Bush White House and major western petroleum corporations in July , and then to the International Monetary Fund two months later , while most Iraqi legislators remained uninformed . ”
The Los Angeles Times noted , in reporting the Iraqi cabinet action , “ The United States has long wanted to capitalize on Iraq ’s oil , especially as a means of paying for the country ’s reconstruction .
Oil ’s importance was reiterated in the Iraq Study Group report released in December .
The agreement would open the door to international investment in Iraq ’s oil industry — a bonanza for foreign companies . . . ”
The New York Times editorialized cautiously on the draft agreement , focusing on the purported goal of “ equitably sharing the nation ’s oil revenues among all Iraqis , ” while remaining silent on the crass plundering of Iraq ’s resources that the new law would rubber - stamp .
The Times left no doubt about its approval for that goal , declaring , “ An oil law should be one of the benchmarks Washington insists on as a condition of continued support ” for the Maliki government .
Cabinet approval was a step forward , the Times said , “ but it is n’t nearly enough . ”
More than a month ago , the Washington Post reported on a meeting of 80 oil company executives and consultants in London on exploration prospects in the Kurdish region of Iraq , noting , “ Outside Saudi Arabia , no country has proven oil reserves as big as Iraq ’s .
And the oil there is high quality , easy and cheap to produce , and bottled up in reservoirs that many major oil companies were familiar with three decades ago before wars and sanctions drove them out . ”
One oil analyst , Fadel Gheit of Oppenheimer & Co. , told the Post , “ Exxon Mobil has more seismic data on Iraq than on Houston real estate .
If Exxon had security on the ground , the following day it would have crews there .
And money would be no object . ”
Gheit estimated that a restored Iraqi oil industry could triple current production to 6 million barrels a day , worth $ 131 billion a year at current prices .
While the US media and the politicians of both the Democratic and Republican parties publicly dismiss the claim that Bush invaded Iraq to seize its oil wealth , this political reality is increasingly understood by the American people .
According to a UPI / Zogby International poll in January , 73.4 percent thought that Iraq ’s oil resources were a “ major factor ” or a contributing factor in Bush ’s decision to invade , while only 23.7 percent believed that oil was “ not a factor ” in the war .
The enactment of an Iraqi oil law will outrage millions of working people , in the United States and internationally , who oppose sacrificing the lives of thousands of Americans — and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis — to give American companies control of Iraq ’s vast oil resources .

ぼくはその方法でサバイバルしたくないんだ
My Life Between Silicon Valley and Japan - 嵐のような反応を読んで
http://d.hatena.ne.jp/umedamochio/20070319/p1
「 ウェブ進化論 」 を 「 フラット化する世界 」 や「富の未来」と一緒に読んでくれる読者が多いようだけれど、どの「未来への考察」も大筋では近い方向を指しているわけで、ではそういう未来が2020年頃に顕在化し、かなり大きなインパクトをもって日本社会を変えていくのだとすれば、その「あとの半分」の世界でサバイバルする思考法っていったいどういう考え方なんだろう、ということを今後真剣に考えていきたいと思っているのだ。「直感を信じろ、自分を信じろ、好きを貫け、人を褒めろ、人の粗探ししてる暇があったら自分で何かやれ。」はそのプレビューみたいなものだったんだと思ってください。
どうなんだろ 。
ぼくは遠目か ら
今回の梅田氏のエントリ
→それに対する読者の（好意的な）反応
を見ていて 、
「 ああ、これが梅田氏 が “ ウェブ進化 論 ” で称揚している未来なのだな 」
と相似性なり類縁性なりを感じたのだが、そうしたものがあたりまえになった未来社会でサバイバルしていく、生きていくことは自分にはとても窮屈に思えてしかたない。窮屈というのは、ぼくにその能力がない落伍者という意味で。
具体的に言えば、梅田氏のことばを賞賛し、自分のinterest＝利益にかなうものとして盲目的に受け入れ、賛美する人々のものすごい規模の渦だ。この2,3日ではてなブックマークだけで700以上のブックマークを集めた “ 渦”は、それはインターネットがなければ実現しなかったことだろう。規模は。
しかし、質や内容はといえば別に “ 旧社会 ” でもありえたことだ。もちろんテーゼは違うけれど。特定のinterestをもつ人々が、自分たちのinterestを代弁してくれる弁の立つ人物の発言に注目し、熱狂的に支持する。バイアスがかかるのであえて例を出さないが、古今東西、こんな事例は枚挙にいとまがない。そしていい結果も悪い結果も生んできた。
違うのはスピードと規模だけだ。
たまたま
「 ネット 対“ 旧社会 ” 」
という構図でネット側に所属するinterestをもつ人々が、梅田氏という多弁なtalentをもつ人を得て、熱狂的に共感してあっという間に大きな渦をつくっていく…。
いっぽうでこの “ 渦” は、悪弊のほうもスピードと規模を増して持ち合わせている。
たとえば、このあいだ書いたぼくのエントリは珍しく何回かブクマされたのだが、なぜか細かいニュアンスまで把握せず、批判しているコメントがあった（「人をほめろ」というエントリを支持する人がなぜ他人の粗探しをするのかという疑問はさておき）。まあ、ぼくの文章のヘタさ加減や、そもそも論が稚拙なことは大目に見てもらっても、こうした “ 渦 ” が
「 否定や疑問を許さない性質をもちやすい」
という指摘は、過去のネットでの出来事からうなずいてもらえるんじゃないだろうか。それは「同調圧力」と言い換えてもかまわないはずだ。
同調圧力というならぼくらが所属するこの社会は、とてもこの圧力が強いことでおなじみで。それなら “ 渦 ” を形成するすごいパワーをもつ「 Web 2.0的未来社会」が旧社会と何が違うのかというと。何も違わないのではないかという不安を覚える。
どう もWeb 2.0的未来社会というのは、
「 フラットで、多くの大衆があっという間に “ 渦” を形成し 、
ときにものすごい同調圧力をかけてくる社会」
なんじゃないか 。
すると、そこでサバイバルする方法というのは、
・情報を効率よく消費して、大衆のあいだの
“ 流れ ” をすばやく読 む
・同調圧力の対象にならないよう、できるだけ大きな渦に入る
ということなんじゃないかとぼくは思う。これはまるで旧社会で重宝されている処世術の「バージョン 2.0 」のようだ。
ぼくのような障害者にとってこのサバイバル術はとても負担が大きい。この方法でサバイバルしていくことはできないし、そもそもしていきたくない。
と、ウェブ進化の果ての未来社会を恣意的に描き出すいっぽうで、ぼくは昔、インターネットの普及がまるっきり逆の影響を社会に与えると予想していた。
インターネットにま だ 「 Web」はなかったころの話だが 、AUPなどでバリバリに縛りのかかった細い線を介して、当時国交の希薄だったロシア・東欧の人々とさえ意見のやりとりができるさまを体験した。そこでぼくは
「 これは個人の不完全性を解決する道具なのではないか」
と考えた 。
圧倒的な低コストで自分の表現を世界に発信できる（これは95年ごろにかなり使い古されたインターネットの説明だ…）ということは、非力な個人を補完し、他の個人・法人・組織と対等にやりあう力を与えてくれるのではないだろうか、と思ったわけだ。
いまちょっと思ったが 「 発信する 」 と、Web 2.0的 な「つながる」はかなり違うよね…。「つながる」は外部依存性がある感じだ。当時ぼくが思い描いていたものはそれとはまるで逆で、発信するのは「完結している個人」というイメージ。
インターネットによって、あらゆる個人が知的な能力を高め、内省し、そして強力な個人として世界に率先して表現を発信していく…そんな未来を思い描いていた。
そこで必要なサバイバル術というのは先のものとはまったく異なる。
・自分で吟味して情報を収集し、内省してきちんと消化する
・他人の表現は収集・検討する価値のあるものだから、
多様性は尊重され る
無能力者なぼくだが、こういったサバイバル術を使ってひとりで生きていくことならなんとかできそうだ。だから、これでサバイバルする未来社会なら喜んで受け入れたい。
でも、2007年の現在。世界はそうなっているとは言えない気がする。なんとなく、梅田氏のエントリやそれを取り巻く人々の反応からそう感じた。まあ、カンタンに言えばみっともない疎外感でしかないのだけれど。
少なくとも、極端な激文がRSSリーダー経由でよく吟味されずに読まれ、ワンクリックでブックマークされることによる多数決で称揚され、大きな渦があっという間に作られていく…という形態は、ぼくにとってはあまり住みやすい未来じゃない。
どっちにしろ 「ぼくにとって」という話だ。世界にとってWeb 2.0的な未来が望ましいのであれば、それでしかたがないのだろう。
なんかめんどくさくなってきたのであんまり推敲せずにやめ。
おふろはいろ 。
追記：
あ、そうか 。
いや、カンタンにまとめると
「 ネットと か “ ウェブ進 化 ” とか言っても 、
結局新しい権益グループを作るだけで終わっちゃうんじゃないの？」
ってことか。氾濫して る“ マスゴミ ” って用語を多用する層みたいな、ね。
個人的には、なんかそれって悲しくって、ネットという道具によって社会構成員全体が完成された強い個人になったらいいのに…って思っているわけだ。なんというか…「上座部仏教的大乗仏教」？
関連しそうな過去記事： 絡みたいわけじゃないのだが、また書く 。My Life Between Silicon Valley and Japan - 嵐のような反応を読んでどうなんだろ。ぼくは遠目から今回の梅田氏のエントリ→それに対する読者の（好意的な）反応を見ていて、「ああ、これが梅田氏が“ウェブ進化論”で称揚している未来なのだな」と相似性なり類縁性なりを感じたのだが、そうしたものがあたりまえになった未来社会でサバイバルしていく、生きていくことは自分にはとても窮屈に思えてしかたない。窮屈というのは、ぼくにその能力がない落伍者という意味で。具体的に言えば、梅田氏のことばを賞賛し、自分のinterest＝利益にかなうものとして盲目的に受け入れ、賛美する人々のものすごい規模の渦だ。この2,3日ではてなブックマークだけで700以上のブックマークを集めた “ 渦”は、それはインターネットがなければ実現しなかったことだろう。規模は。しかし、質や内容はといえば別に“旧社会”でもありえたことだ。もちろんテーゼは違うけれど。特定のinterestをもつ人々が、自分たちのinterestを代弁してくれる弁の立つ人物の発言に注目し、熱狂的に支持する。バイアスがかかるのであえて例を出さないが、古今東西、こんな事例は枚挙にいとまがない。そしていい結果も悪い結果も生んできた。違うのはスピードと規模だけだ。たまたま「ネット対“旧社会 ” 」という構図でネット側に所属するinterestをもつ人々が、梅田氏という多弁なtalentをもつ人を得て、熱狂的に共感してあっという間に大きな渦をつくっていく…。いっぽうでこの “ 渦”は、悪弊のほうもスピードと規模を増して持ち合わせている。たとえば、このあいだ書いたぼくのエントリは珍しく何回かブクマされたのだが、なぜか細かいニュアンスまで把握せず、批判しているコメントがあった（「人をほめろ」というエントリを支持する人がなぜ他人の粗探しをするのかという疑問はさておき）。まあ、ぼくの文章のヘタさ加減や、そもそも論が稚拙なことは大目に見てもらっても、こうした “ 渦 ” が「否定や疑問を許さない性質をもちやすい」という指摘は、過去のネットでの出来事からうなずいてもらえるんじゃないだろうか。それは「同調圧力」と言い換えてもかまわないはずだ。同調圧力というならぼくらが所属するこの社会は、とてもこの圧力が強いことでおなじみで。それなら “ 渦 ” を形成するすごいパワーをもつ「 Web 2.0的未来社会」が旧社会と何が違うのかというと。何も違わないのではないかという不安を覚える。どうもWeb 2.0的未来社会というのは、「フラットで、多くの大衆があっという間に “ 渦”を形成し、ときにものすごい同調圧力をかけてくる社会」なんじゃないか。すると、そこでサバイバルする方法というのは、・情報を効率よく消費して、大衆のあいだの“ 流れ”

Kibbutz Ketura , Israel --
It has five leaves , stands 14 inches high and is nicknamed Methuselah .
It looks like an ordinary date palm seedling , but for UCLA - educated botanist Elaine Solowey , it is a piece of history brought back to life .
Planted on Jan. 25 , the seedling growing in the black pot in Solowey 's nursery on this kibbutz in Israel 's Arava desert is 2,000 years old -- more than twice as old as the 900 - year - old biblical character who lent his name to the young tree .
It is the oldest seed ever known to produce a viable young tree .
The seed that produced Methuselah was discovered during archaeological excavations at King Herod 's palace on Mount Masada , near the Dead Sea .
Its age has been confirmed by carbon dating .
Scientists hope that the unique seedling will eventually yield vital clues to the medicinal properties of the fruit of the Judean date tree , which was long thought to be extinct .
Solowey , originally from San Joaquin ( Fresno County ) , teaches at the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies at Kibbutz Ketura , where she has nurtured more than 100 rare or near - extinct species back to life as part of a 10 - year project to study plants and herbs used as ancient cures .
In collaboration with the Louis L. Borick Natural Medicine Center at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem , named in honor of its Southern California - based benefactor , Solowey grows plants and herbs used in Tibetan , Chinese and biblical medicine , as well as traditional folk remedies from other cultures to see whether their effectiveness can be scientifically proved .
In experiments praised by the Dalai Lama , for example , Borick Center Director Sarah Sallon has shown that ancient Tibetan cures for cardiovascular disease really do work .
The San Francisco Chronicle was granted the first viewing of the historic seedling , which sprouted about four weeks after planting .
It has grown six leaves , but one has been removed for DNA testing so scientists can learn more about its relationship to its modern - day cousins .
The Judean date is chronicled in the Bible , Quran and ancient literature for its diverse powers -- from an aphrodisiac to a contraceptive -- and as a cure for a wide range of diseases including cancer , malaria and toothache .
For Christians , the palm is a symbol of peace associated with the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem .
The ancient Hebrews called the date palm the " tree of life " because of the protein in its fruit and the shade given by its long leafy branches .
The Arabs said there were as many uses for the date palm as there were days in the year .
Greek architects modeled their Ionic columns on the tree 's tall , thin trunk and curling , bushy top .
The Romans called it Phoenix dactylifera -- " the date - bearing phoenix " -- because it never died and appeared to be reborn in the desert where all other plant life perished .
Now Solowey and her colleagues have brought this phoenix of the desert back to life after 2,000 years .
The ancient seeds were found 30 years ago during archeological excavations on Mount Masada , the mountaintop fortress on the shore of the Dead Sea where King Herod built a spectacular palace .
When the Romans conquered Palestine and laid waste to the Temple in Jerusalem , Masada was the last stand of a small band of Jewish rebels who held out against three Roman legions for several years before committing mass suicide in A.D. 73 .
Archaeologist Ehud Netzer found the seeds , which were identified by the department of botanical archaeology at Israel 's Bar - Ilan University .
Then they were placed in storage , where they lay for 30 years until Sallon heard about the cache .
" When we asked if we could try and grow some of them , they said , ' You 're mad , ' but they gave us three seeds , " she said .
Sallon took the seeds to Solowey , who has cultivated more than 3,000 date palms and rarities like the trees that produce the fragrant resins frankincense and myrrh .
Solowey admits she was skeptical about the chances of success with this project .
" When I received the seeds from Sarah , I thought the chances of this experiment succeeding were less than zero , " said Solowey , cradling the precious seedling in a specially quarantined section of her nursery on the kibbutz .
" But Dr. Sallon insisted and I took this very seriously .
Lotus seeds over 1,000 years old have been sprouted , and I realized that no one had done any similar work with dates , so why not give it our best shot -- and we were rewarded . "
The three seeds were long and thin , grayish - brown in color .
Solowey soaked them in warm water , and then added gibberellic acid , a potent growth hormone used to induce germination in reluctant seeds .
Next , she added a special rooting hormone for woody plants called T8 and an enzyme - rich fertilizer to supplement the natural food inside it .
She then planted it in sterile potting soil on the Jewish festival of trees , which this year fell on Jan. 25 .
Solowey placed the pots in her nursery and tended to them each day for a month , not expecting anything to happen .
" Much to my astonishment , after five weeks , a small little date shoot came up , " she says .
" It was pale , almost whitish green .
The first two leaves were abnormal - looking .
They were very flat and very pale .
The third leaf started to have the striations of a normal date plant .
Now it looks perfectly normal to me .
" The only difference between this date seedling and any other date seedlings I 've seen come up is the length of the third leaf .
This is very unusual , " she said , pointing out one very long , thin leaf growing out of the pot .
" It 's certainly the oldest tree seed that 's ever been sprouted .
Wheat seeds from pharaohs ' tombs have been sprouted , but none of the plants have survived for very long .
Before this , the oldest seed grown was a lotus from China , which was 1,200 years old , " she said .
" I 'm very excited .
I was n't expecting anything to happen .
I 'm really interested in finding out what the DNA testing is going to show .
I know that date seeds can stay alive for several decades .
To find out that they can stay alive for millennia is astonishing . "
Date palms are either male or female , but it 's too early to tell the sex of Methuselah .
Normally , female trees begin to bear fruit after about five years .
" We have to figure out where we can put it so it can grow to maturity .
Then we 'll hope that it grows up and flowers so we can figure out whether it 's male or female , and then it has offshoots and seeds so we can propagate it .
It 's very exciting to think that maybe someday we can eat 2,000 - year - old dates , but there 's a 50 percent chance that it's a male , in which case that wo n't happen , " she said .
Sallon trained as a pediatrician and gastroenterologist , and she once worked with Mother Teresa at the Sisters of Charity orphanage in Calcutta .
She founded the Louis L. Borick Natural Medicine Center 10 years ago and is a world - renowned expert on the medical properties of plants .
" It feels remarkable to see this seed growing , to see it coming out of the soil after 2 , 000 years .
It 's a very moving and exciting moment , " she said .
The two researchers hope the reborn tree will provide valuable information about the Judean economy and society at the time of Jesus .
Once the seed sprouted , samples of seeds excavated from the same cache on Masada were sent to the University of Zurich for radio - carbon dating .
The results came back last week , showing the samples were 2,000 years old , plus or minus a margin of error of 50 years , placing them during or just before the Masada revolt .
" Perhaps one of our ancestors was sitting there on the battlements of Masada eating his dates while the Roman armies were preparing for the final siege and perhaps nonchalantly spitting out a pip , " said Sallon .
" Two thousand years later , here I am at Kibbutz Ketura and it's grown . "
The sixth leaf has been sent to the Volcani Centre , Israel 's agricultural research institute , for DNA testing by date palm expert Yuval Cohen .
" I find it remarkable , " said Cohen .
" Two thousand years ago , during the Roman Empire , Israel was known for the quality of its dates .
They were famous throughout the Roman Empire .
But date growing as a commercial fruit export stopped at the end of 70 A.D. , when the Second Temple was destroyed by the Romans .
From then , the tradition was lost .
" It 's an interesting question what were the ancient dates like .
We hope by genetic analysis , we can learn more about the character of the ancient date population . "
When the Romans invaded ancient Judea , thick forests of date palms towering up to 80 feet high and 7 miles wide covered the Jordan River valley from the Sea of Galilee in the north to the shores of the Dead Sea in the south .
The tree so defined the local economy that Emperor Vespasian celebrated the conquest by minting the " Judea Capta , " a special bronze coin that showed the Jewish state as a weeping woman beneath a date palm .
Today , nothing remains of those mighty forests .
The date palms in modern Israel were imported , mainly from California .
The ancient Judean date , renowned for its succulence and famed for its many medicinal properties , had been lost to history .
Until now .
This week , barring a last - minute climbdown , Iran may get back to building a nuclear bomb .
It is a small moment , and a big one .
Small because the threat has lingered for years ; big because the consequences could convulse the region and the world .
If Iran ends its 30 - month freeze on uranium tests , the long diplomatic mission by the West will be in ruins .
The British Foreign Office says all bets will be off ; the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , signals that Iran is heading for the UN security council , and thus for resolutions and sanctions .
Every diplomat and onlooker knows the steps of that quadrille .
They danced it for Iraq .
As Iran moves towards the ultimate in WMD , George Bush must be thinking he fought the wrong war .
Now , as Israel says Iran 's nuclear missile programme " can be destroyed " , the scent of another conflict hangs in the air .
Even if President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad steps back from the brink , as he is prone to , there is a wider threat .
In the past week a 55 - page European intelligence assessment has surfaced .
It is an audit of the quest by rogue states to buy the kit to make weapons of mass destruction .
Syria and North Korea have been stocking up , along with Pakistan , and Iran is allegedly working towards a long - range missile that could reach Italy .
In addition , the New York Times reporter James Risen claims in a new book that the CIA inadvertently helped Iran to build a nuclear bomb by supplying flawed blueprints that the country 's scientists may have corrected and used .
Obviously , leaked intelligence on WMD comes with some health warnings .
How dodgy , exactly , are these dossiers ?
Maybe the CIA is daft enough to offer up DIY bomb manuals , though this sounds implausible .
The Tesco-isation of the nuclear trade raises another caveat .
According to the leaked European report , the world is a shopping mall for nukes , and the boardrooms and universities of Europe are the bombers ' Bond Street .
Hardly any of this is top secret or new .
Dubious regimes have indeed been stockpiling illicit technology , as if buying beans at a supermarket .
A briefing for the Carnegie Endowment thinktank , published in September 2005 , two months after the leaked report was written , lists a worldwide history of nuclear deals , including Iran 's links with the rogue Pakistani scientist , Abdul Qadeer Khan .
Nuclear arms never held many surprises .
J Robert Oppenheimer , their inventor , called himself " the destroyer of worlds " ; hopes that lavish death could forge a better universe faded faster than the prayers of the pastor who commended to God the Enola Gay , bound for Hiroshima .
Sixty years on , the notion of nuclear nemesis has not sunk in .
Last year 's make - or - break US conference to revive the nuclear non-proliferation treaty achieved nothing .
The pact , ratified in 1970 and signed by 187 countries , was designed to ensure that unarmed states never acquired weapons and that armed nations , in return , would wind down their arsenals .
That cornerstone of a peaceful world is crumbling , partly because Bush wants new weapons while demanding that other regimes forswear them , but also because the treaty is fatally flawed .
Its aims , to eradicate nuclear weapons while championing the spread of nuclear energy , are irreconcilable .
Atoms for Peace , suspect in President Eisenhower 's day , is an oxymoron in a globalised age .
Any rogue state can build up a civil programme , opt out of the treaty with six months ' notice and begin making weapons .
Iran has always claimed , to universal disbelief , that it is only exercising its right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes .
Pakistan , a non-signatory , was last week reported to be buying up to eight reactors from China , which has long been suspected of helping with its weapons programme .
On the campuses of Tehran , even moderately minded students are aggrieved .
Who are Bush and Tony Blair to preach while laying in new nukes and welcoming India , with its illicit weapons , into their nuclear club ?
Israel is stacked with unauthorised nukes , a Nato base sits at Herat , and the US Fifth Fleet patrols the Persian Gulf .
Why should Iran , so besieged , not have a deterrent ?
One answer is that Ahmadinejad is a Holocaust - denier who thinks that Israel should be " wiped off the map " .
No one could sleep easy with his finger trembling on a nuclear button .
But there are more dangerous prospects even than the Iran bomb .
Professor Paul Rogers , of Bradford University , thinks it conceivable that Israel could launch a pre-emptive attack against its loose - mouthed neighbour .
Ariel Sharon 's successor , needing to look tough , may be keener than his predecessor to do so .
Israel would have to move fast , though .
A few months from now , Iran 's powerful Bushehr reactor could be up and running and few attackers would dare unleash a reprise of Chernobyl .
Such a threat may seem far - fetched , but Bush 's tolerance for a regime he calls " the world 's primary sponsor of terror " is as thin as skin .
What a year for Britain to announce a $ 44bn replacement for the Trident missile , plus a new generation of nuclear power stations .
Tony Blair , intent on both schemes , is braced for protests on weapons but foresees little trouble over energy .
Britain is not keen on taking fewer cheap flights and turning out the bathroom light .
Nuclear power , touted as a painless option , is costly , risky and produces waste that stays dangerous for 240,000 years .
A combination of renewables , energy saving , fossil fuels and carbon storage could provide an alternative .
Besides , Britain has a duty to set some example .
On nuclear power , the case is far from made .
Trident , by contrast , is straightforward .
Its replacement should be fought by everyone bothered about world security .
More weapons for Britain would be a come - on to every failed state on the planet .
In Israel a leader lies in hospital .
In Iraq 130 people were blown up on Thursday last week .
In North Korea promises of nuclear disarmament have withered .
In Iran the nuclear scientists resume their work .
This may be the most dangerous time since superpowers threatened mutually assured destruction .
The world , once an atomic Athenaeum , has become a bomber 's eBay , full of murky bidders with pseudonyms and of nukes for auction .
The nuclear aristocracy is dead , destruction is democratised and Iran , angry at the West 's hypocrisy on the nuclear race , believes that what 's good for London is good for Tehran .
There is also hope .
Iran 's theocrats might oust Ahmadinejad .
American voters may elect a president who realises , as Blair must too , that the West has to reduce its own arms if it is to persuade others to do likewise .
But , for now , cold war politics looks easy .
The abyss was always safer than the quicksand .
This time , we can not simply walk away .

You know the old routine – You get a new machine and then you spend weeks looking for and installing all the applications , tools , utilities , etc that you had on your old computer that made you so productive .
There is always that utility that you use once in a while but you just ca n’t seem to find it .
I recently bought a new computer and decided to make a list of all the software I installed on the new computer so that I ’m ready to do this again for my next machine .
I wish I had discovered Belarc Advisor before I rebuilt my old desktop as a Linux ( Ubuntu ) desktop .
So here is a fairly complete list of what ’s installed on my machine and if you see something that I should have , please leave me a comment :
The Essentials
Development
Audio , Video & Graphics
Browsers & Extensions
Utilities
" With the EDK , developers will be able to create games that respond to a player ’s emotions and allow players to control their characters ’ expressions and manipulate objects using only the power of their brain . "
" For example , they can enable players to move an object in a game without the use of a keyboard or joystick , make their character smile when they smile , or require that a player stays calm in order to ensure his or her character remains undiscovered in a stealth game .
As a result , developers can create a more interactive , immersive , personal experience than is currently possible . "
Emotiv systems , a pioneer in brain computer interface technology has now launched the Emotiv Development Kit. ( EDK ) This is some really cool technology and I think it will be the first of many , progressively more advanced methods of computer input devices and methodology .
Eventually I anticipate this sort of tech will make the argument between Qwerty , Dvorak , Xpert , Colemak , etc layouts completely redundant .
Effectively this technology uses a range of data gatherers .
the main part of the kit is the Headset , which has multiple sensors that can detect various sorts of brain activity .
this includes concious and unconcious thoughts , along with different emotions , I find this sort of technology really exciting , although its a bit unnerving , if at this stage they are able to detect when you are thinking specific things - eventually it will get to the point where all your thoughts can be read .
this bodes for good and for ill , it would make work difficult - should the old fable about men thinking about a certain thing every 6 seconds ( or whatever it is ) .
however I 'm sure that would be filterable .
but more concerning - what about the next generation of " Windows Genuine Advantage " will it show images that will cause you to reveal if you have ever pirated software ?
the implications for how far this technology could reach are limitless - it does sound big brother - ish and quite fantastical and even conspiracy - theorist , but at the end of the day , from what all our thoughts and emotions are a complex system of electrical signals in the brain , so we should in theory be able to eventually read all of that directly .
I am cautiously enthusiastic about this technology , as a geek , a developer and a gamer , the ability to control my computer with thoughts is a dream come true .
I 'm sure we will see more of this in the news very soon .

THE FULLER CHALLENGE from Whirlwind Creative , Inc. on Vimeo .
Welcome !
Welcome to the Buckminster Fuller Challenge ( BFC ) archive !
Here you will find a comprehensive history of the BFC program and a curated archive of the ‘ best of ’ entries reviewed by the program from 2007 - 2017 making visible the vibrancy and dedication of an emerging field of comprehensive , whole - systems designers .
This searchable archive is offered as a resource and tool for educators , the design community , and the general public to use to discover the remarkable ideas and successful projects at work in the world today .
Origins and Histories
In 2010 Fuller Challenge juror David Orr – the esteemed sustainability educator and author – remarked that human civilization has entered the historical equivalent of shooting the dangerous rapids of a treacherous white - water river .
With a broken paddle .
Blindfolded .
Buckminster Fuller put it in stark relief with this famous question :
Are we heading toward Utopia or Oblivion ?
He challenged his contemporaries to creatively respond to the urgency of this moment by re-framing the crisis as an opportunity pointing to humanity ’s “ option to make it – to live successfully without compromising the ability for all of life to thrive . ”
Fuller demonstrated through his research and design practice that the resources needed for all forms of life on the planet to live in relative peace and prosperity exist .
Creatively deployed , these resources are more than enough to raise the standard of living for everybody .
He called for a revolution by design – not political or military - but a revolution driven by the problem - solving creativity of design combined with the empirical demands of science .
Fuller ’s practice took a comprehensive approach , starting with the whole ; anticipating future trends and needs ; employing the scientific method ; and aligned with nature ’s operating principles .
He saw that this way of thinking and doing was to be the future of design .
He called his practice design science .
And in the 1960 ’s he launched the Design Science Revolution with an open call to the world ’s creative communities “ to make the world work for 100 % of humanity in the shortest possible time , through spontaneous cooperation , without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone . ”
In 2007 The Buckminster Fuller Challenge Prize program reintroduced Bucky ’s vision .
After extensive research we determined that the development of a competitive prize – an open call to anyone creatively addressing any of the world ’s most urgent problems - would enable us to accomplish several goals :
1. honor the legacy of Fuller and create a prestigious program that would encourage innovation and recognize integrity ;
2. draw attention and support to the thinkers and doers applying a comprehensive , whole - systems approach to designing solutions to the
great challenges we face today ;
3. leverage the power of a prestigious innovation prize to demonstrate the importance of whole systems - thinking and its integral function in design -
thinking ;
4. educate a new generation of designers to take up Fuller ’s Challenge to transform our world through design , by showcasing world class projects
and celebrating the people behind them ” ,
Over the program ’s ten - year history ( 2007 - 2017 ) the Fuller Challenge attracted thousands of initiatives from across the globe , tackling every conceivable issue facing humanity and the planet today .
Each team submitted an application that was subject to a rigorous vetting process in which our esteemed review team and juries invested hundreds of hours of investigation , research , and debate to select our honored entries .
First recognized in 2011 by Metropolis Magazine as “ socially responsible design ’s highest award ” , the program conferred an annual grand prize of
$ 100,000 to a project that best fulfilled the entrance criteria and embodied what we have called the ‘ spirit of the Challenge ’ .
Winning projects are visionary initiatives that address multiple problems simultaneously , and evoke inspiration for others to study and replicate .
The winning team also received with The Omnioculi , a commissioned sculpture created by artist Tom Shannon in collaboration with geodesics expert Joseph Clinton .
While one project was selected as the winner , each year the Fuller Challenge program awarded resources and support to an additional 40 - 60 projects through our Catalyst Program .
These projects typically represented the top 20 % of the entry pool and received opportunities for additional funding and investment , pro-bono legal services , fast - track access to accelerator programs , mentorship opportunities , and international press coverage .
The projects included in the archive demonstrate that design can and must be applied to every aspect of the global system , and reveal a groundswell of successful solutions to our most complex and urgent problems .
With an expanded view of design ’s scope , we were able to recognize design innovation in places and projects that were unusual and new .
And in the process we discovered an extraordinary group of passionate people with an unusual capacity to feel a deep sense of generosity for the future .
It is our hope that
history will look back on their sacrifice , commitment and creativity to recognize that these were the trimtabs of our time who navigated us to safer shores , calmer waters , a world that works for all .
On behalf of the Fuller Challenge staff , review team and our generous supporters we thank you for your interest in this project and hope you will enjoy this archive !

Is this dark matter I see before me ?
An elusive dark matter particle may finally have been caught on film .
The particle , with a mass , neutral charge and lifetime matching that of the so - called axion , has left its mark on a photographic plate .
The hypothetical axion was proposed more than 30 years ago and could make up dark matter .
Earlier this year there were hints that an axion had been found , but that particle did n’t have the right properties to explain dark matter ( New Scientist , 15 July , p 35 ) .

Bitesize Functional Programming : Active Patterns May 3 , 2007
Welcome to the first in what I hope will be an ongoing series of blog posts on research in functional programming .
I see a lot of really neat papers come and go that show the great things that are happening in this design space , and I ’m hoping to open their discoveries to a slightly wider audience by providing more what I hope are readable descriptions of them for people who do n’t have the time to trawl through 20 pages or so .
By using examples liberally I hope I can provide an alternative to the sometimes rather dry language of the abstracts .
Anyway , that explained we can get on with the show !
A really cute paper just came up on Lambda the Ultimate , about the implementation of a new feature in the .NET functional programming language F# called Active Patterns .
The basic idea is to let you pattern match not just structurally , like this :
> data Animal = Armadillo String
| Mink String
| FunctionalProgrammer String Integer
>
> show ( Armadillo name ) = name
> show ( Mink name ) = name
> show ( FunctionalProgrammer name iq ) = name ++ “ , IQ of ” ++ ( show iq )
But also FUNCTIONALLY , by letting you define your own match functions :
> ( |Text |Element| ) xmlNode = if xmlNode .
ContentType = Text then Text ( xmlNode .
Text ) else Element ( xmlNode )
>
> match myXMLNodeInstance of
> Text s -> print ( “ Looks like a text node containing ” ++ ( show s ) )
> Element e -> print ( “ Hmm , it ’s something else ! ” )
And actually it goes beyond this because your pattern matching functions can receive arguments before the data you actually want to pattern match on , or can be partial functions ( i.e. fail to pattern match on some inputs ) .
Their “ curried ” nature lets the authors of the paper define a function which lets them write a pattern matching on the Nth bit of an integer , and on that integer rotated N times , where N is potentially supplied at runtime .
This clearly has great potential for expressiveness !
I think that ’s quite enough about active patterns , but I must say that I ’m quite tempted to go and add F# to my repetoire now :-) .
Coming up next time , possibly : data parallel Haskell ( concurrency for free ! ) or constructor tagging ( cute optimisation for lazy functional languages ) .
A team of anthropologists that studied chimpanzees trained to use treadmills has gathered new evidence suggesting that our earliest apelike ancestors started walking on two legs because it required less energy than getting around on all fours .
" When our earliest ancestors started walking on two legs , they took the first steps toward becoming human , " said lead researcher Michael Sockol of UC Davis .
" Our findings help answer why . "
" This is the first time anyone has succeeded in studying energetics and biomechanics in adult chimps , " said Sockol , who worked for two years to find an animal trainer willing to coax adult chimps to walk on two legs and to " knucklewalk " on all fours on the sort of treadmill found in most gyms .
The five chimps also wore face masks used to help the researchers measure oxygen consumption .
While the chimps worked out , the scientists collected metabolic , kinematic and kinetic data that allowed them to calculate which method of locomotion used less energy and why .
The team gathered the same information for four adult humans walking on a treadmill .
The researchers found that human walking used about 75 percent less energy and burned 75 percent fewer calories than quadrupedal and bipedal walking in chimpanzees .
They also found that for some but not all of the chimps , walking on two legs was no more costly than knucklewalking .
" We were prepared to find that all of the chimps used more energy walking on two legs -- but that finding would n't have been as interesting , " Sockol said .
" What we found was much more telling .
For three chimps , bipedalism was more expensive , but for the other two chimps , this was n't the case .
One expended about the same energy walking on two legs as on four .
The other used less energy walking upright . "
These two chimps had different gaits and anatomy than their knucklewalking peers .
And when the researchers examined the early hominid fossil record , they found evidence of these traits – skeletal characteristics of the hip and hind limb that allow for greater extension of the hind limb -- in some early bipeds .

Taken together , the findings provide support for the hypothesis that anatomical differences affecting gait existed among our earliest apelike ancestors , and that these differences provided the genetic variation natural selection could act on when changes in the environment gave bipeds an advantage over quadrupeds .
Fossil and molecular evidence suggests the earliest ancestors of the human family lived in forested areas in equatorial Africa in the late Miocene era some 8 to 10 million years ago , when changes in climate may have increased the distance between food patches .
That would have forced early hominids to travel longer distances on the ground and favored those who could cover more ground using less energy .
" This is n't the complete answer , " Sockol said .
" But it 's a good piece of a puzzle humans have always wondered about :
How and why did we become human ?
And why do we alone walk on two legs ? "
Sockol , a doctoral candidate in anthropology , has been pursuing his research for four years as part of his dissertation .
He conducted the research at UC Davis and at a private animal refuge and training facility in Northern California with colleagues Herman Pontzer of Washington University in St. Louis and David Raichlen of the University of Arizona .
His work was featured in the July 2006 issue of National Geographic .
A video of the chimpanzees walking and knucklewalking on the treadmill can be seen at http://www7.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0607/feature5/multimedia.html
The research appears in the online early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and in the July 24 print edition .
The Bush administration , which has been pushing presidential power to new extremes , is reportedly developing an even more dangerous new theory of executive privilege .
It says that if Congress holds White House officials in contempt for withholding important evidence in the United States attorney scandal , the Justice Department simply will not pursue the charges .
This stance tears at the fabric of the Constitution and upends the rule of law .
Congress has a constitutional right to investigate the purge of nine United States attorneys last year .
And there is no doubt that the investigation has unearthed improprieties : several administration officials have already admitted illegal or improper actions involving the politicization of the country ’s chief law enforcement agency .
But the administration has been extraordinarily defiant toward Congress ’s legitimate requests for information .
The low point came recently when Harriet Miers , the former White House counsel , refused even to show up in response to a Congressional subpoena .
Some of the questions she would have been asked might have been protected by executive privilege , but others no doubt would not have been .
Ms. Miers had no right to ignore the entire proceeding .
The next question is how Congress will enforce its right to obtain information , and it is on that point that the administration is said to have made its latest disturbing claim .
If Congress holds White House officials in contempt , the next step should be that the United States attorney for the District of Columbia brings the matter to a grand jury .
But according to a Washington Post report , the administration is saying that its claim of executive privilege means that the United States attorney would be ordered not to go forward with the case .
Libya Frees Nurses Bulgarian President Pardons Medics in Sofia
A Palestinian doctor and five Bulgarian nurses touched down in Sofia on Tuesday morning and were immediately pardoned by the Bulgarian president .
Libya released the six medics -- convicted of infecting hundreds of children with HIV in what was widely seen as a show trial -- after reaching a deal with the European Union that paves the way for better ties .

Mr. Frederick later testified that he designed the banner , using a slogan he had seen on a snowboard , “ to be meaningless and funny , in order to get on television . ”
Ms. Morse found no humor but plenty of meaning in the sign , recognizing “ bong hits ” as a slang reference to using marijuana .
She demanded that he take the banner down .
When he refused , she tore it down , ordered him to her office , and gave him a 10 - day suspension .
Mr. Fredericks ’s ensuing lawsuit and the free - speech court battle that resulted , in which he has prevailed so far , is one that , classically , pits official authority against student dissent .
It is the first Supreme Court case to do so directly since the court upheld the right of students to wear black arm bands to school to protest the war in Vietnam , declaring in Tinker v. Des Moines School District that “ it can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate . ”
The court followed that 1969 decision with two others during the 1980s that upheld the authority of school officials to ban vulgar or offensive student speech and to control the content of school newspapers .
Clearly there is some tension in the court ’s student - speech doctrine ; what message to extract from the trio of decisions is the basic analytical question in the new case , Morse v. Frederick , No. 06-278 .
What is most striking is how the two sides line up .
The Bush administration entered the case on the side of the principal and the Juneau School Board , which are both represented by Kenneth W. Starr , the former solicitor general and independent counsel .
His law firm , Kirkland & Ellis , is handling the appeal without a fee .
Mr. Starr and Edwin S. Kneedler , a deputy solicitor general who will present the government ’s view , will share argument time on Monday .
The National School Board Association , two school principals ’ groups , and several antidrug organizations also filed briefs on the school board ’s side .
While it is hardly surprising to find the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Coalition Against Censorship on Mr. Frederick ’s side , it is the array of briefs from organizations that litigate and speak on behalf of the religious right that has lifted Morse v. Frederick out of the realm of the ordinary .
Frustrated with buying a new CD and then spending 20 minutes in the parking lot trying to get through the shrink - wrap so that you can actually listen to it on the way home ?
Well if you have a puppy handy , you can always hand a corner to her for a few seconds ( you ’ll also end up with cracks in the jewel case , not to mention other dangers associated with babies and cellophane ) .
Figure 1 . Poodle Method ( not advised )
Remember in the 90’s when certain music stores would let you bring any CD up to their Special Counter – where they ’d open it and let you listen to the music before buying ?
Remember how often you realized the liner artists were more talented than the musicians and left empty - handed – probably why most places do n’t offer this anymore !
Where I used to shop most of the employees had special blades for opening the CDs – but there was one guy who could open one just as quickly with his bare hands .
Wanna hear it – here it go !
Find a surface that has a non-rounded edge – like a counter or metal door frame .
Apply a good deal of pressure and run the CD quickly along that edge .
I ’m using a bookcase shelf in the picture below .
Note that I ’m sliding in the up - to - down direction , not left - to - right .

If you ’re lucky , on the first or second try you ’ll get the cellophane peeled back as shown below .
From there it ’s easy to get the rest of the cellophane off with your fingers .
Figure 3 . Shrink - Wrap Breached
But once the shrink - wrap is gone , there will probably be a sticker underneath like the white one shown below .
These can be a major pain to get off because you just ca n’t seem to get your fingernail underneath a corner .
( I actually stuck this one on myself for the example as this CD did n’t come with one ) .

However , what you can easily do is carefully un -snap the jewel case cover at the hinge on the lower left side as shown below .

Now separate the two parts of the case and you have easy access to peel off the sticker .
Do that , snap the jewel case back together , and you ’re good to go .
Story Highlights • Commander of Walter Reed Army hospital fired after poor conditions found
• Building 18 has mold , holes in walls , newspaper said
• Army secretary said top brass did n't know about problems
• Wounded troops from Iraq , Afghanistan wars treated at facility
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The top general at Walter Reed Army Medical Center was fired Thursday , the military announced , following revelations of poor conditions in the building where troops who were wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq are treated .
Maj . Gen. George Weightman 's firing was the first major military staff change after reports surfaced last month about substandard conditions in a building that is part of the facility .
Army Secretary Francis Harvey , who removed Weightman from his post according to an Army statement , had blamed a failure of leadership for the conditions , which were first reported by The Washington Post .
According to the Army statement , " Maj. Gen . Weightman was informed this morning that the senior Army leadership had lost trust and confidence in the commander 's leadership abilities to address needed solutions for soldier - outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center . "
" The commanding general of U.S. Army Medical Command , Lt. Gen. Kevin Kiley , will be acting temporarily as Walter Reed commander until a general officer is selected for this important leadership position , " the statement said .
The Post report centered on Building 18 .
Last week , workers were repairing plumbing , covering holes in ceilings and repainting mold - covered walls in the building .
( Watch a tour of the run- down facility )
Weightman also served as commanding general of the North Atlantic Regional Medical Command , the statement said .
Last week , Harvey directed that Vice Chief of Staff of the Army Gen. Richard Cody develop and implement an Army Action Plan to address shortcomings at Walter Reed and elsewhere .
The focus areas are : soldier accountability , health and welfare ; infrastructure ; medical administrative process ; and information dissemination .
Cody put a 30 - day deadline on many of these actions .
In an interview with CNN last week , Harvey said , " if we would have known about this , we would have fixed it .
Unfortunately , we did n't know about it . "
The Post article , titled " The Other Walter Reed , " said outpatients at the facility also include veterans who suffer from depression and were involved in overdoses and suicide attempts .
Walter Reed is the Army 's top medical facility .
It opened in 1901 in a single small building and now is a complex of structures with 28 acres of floor space .
The hospital can accommodate 250 patients and admits more than 14,000 a year .
Thousands use its outpatient facilities daily .
President Bush has visited wounded troops at the hospital several times , and presidents often receive medical care there .
The Base Realignment and Closure Commission in 2005 recommended closing Walter Reed in 2010 .
Harvey said an " action plan " was being put together " to ensure across the board that our soldiers are being taken care of with the highest quality medicine possible in the kind of facilities that provide a quality of life for the soldier that is equal to the quality of their service . "
He added , " To have it in this condition is disappointing to me , unacceptable to me as the secretary of the Army , and we have a plan in place . "

Georgia Brown , from Aldershot , Hampshire , astounded experts by scoring 152 in an IQ test - putting her in the top 2 % of the population for her age .
Psychologist Joan Freeman , who tested Georgia , said she thought the toddler could have scored even higher but needed a nap after 45 minutes of work .
Georgia 's mother , Lucy , said : " It 's fantastic .
We 're so proud as a family . "
I had come unexpectedly into the presence of something rather special
Prof Joan Freeman
She had spotted that her daughter was a strikingly quick learner .
Georgia was crawling at five months , walking at nine months and , by 18 months , was having proper conversations .
The Brown family called in Prof Freeman , from Middlesex University , to test her IQ level in relation to others of her age .
Prof Freeman said she used the Stanford - Binet Intelligence Scale test and was " elated " by what she found .
She told the BBC : " She is two years , nine months - not very much older than a toddler really - and she is able to answer questions five and six - year - olds can't .
" The test uses questions like ' If brother is to boy , then sister is to ...?'.
If you take a normal two - year - old , they cannot hold a pencil , they do n't know the colours and they would not be able to answer those simple questions .
' Amazing ' concentration
" The thing I found most striking was the copying of a circle .
Most two - year - olds cannot do that but she drew a perfect one .
" I was quite elated - I had come unexpectedly into the presence of something rather special .
" She scored 152 points but I think she could have got more - she just got very tired .
Concentrating for three - quarters - of - an - hour at that young age is amazing . "
Mensa confirmed Georgia was their youngest member at the moment and the youngest female member ever .
The youngest ever member was a boy , who was several days younger than Georgia when he joined in the 1990s .

If your car has anti-lock brakes , or ABS , stop your car by pressing down on the brake pedal firmly but smoothly .
If your car does not have ABS , squeeze your brakes to the point right before they lock up .
Practice in an empty parking lot so you can get a sense of when they lock up .
Regardless of your brakes , do not jerk the wheel while braking to avoid a collision .
Instead , focus on where you would like the car to go and steer that direction while applying gentle pressure to the brakes .

Building a scanning camera from a flatbed scanner I 'm just itching to buy a really good digital camera , but until they become cheap enough for me to just buy one as a toy , I wanted something digital camera like to play with .
I started playing around with my flatbed scanner to see if I could capture images of stuff around it , by holding the scanner in my hand and rotating it as it scanned .
This allowed the focusing lens in the scanner to pick up some of the light from the surroundings .
One of my first experiments looked like this :
My very first attempt at photography with a flatbed scanner
It took a bit of tweaking with the colour balance to get the colours to look even this close to real .
Focus was of course way off , as the lens was focused on the glass plate .
This looked moderately promising .
I know people are hypothesizing about using a lens to focus an image onto the bed of a flat bed scanner , so that the scanner can pick up the image at the focal plane .
I do n't think this could work very well though , s as it would require a toroidal condenser , or ground glass to diffuse the light at the focusing plane , and that would waste most of the light .
Camera mechanism
My approach basically involves trashing a $ 100 scanner .
I disassembled the scanner and took out all the electronics , the CCD image sensor , and the stepper motor mechanism , and built a new mechanism to hold it all together , and rotate the CCD and lens assembly to scan its environment , instead of a piece of paper .
Front view of my scanning camera
For the lens , I used an obsolete 35 mm F /2.8 screw mount SLR camera lens .
The lens is so obsolete , its even predates the Pentax screw mount ( which I still use ) .
The lens has no anti reflective coating , and , a completely manual aperture - that is , it even predates the automatic aperture reduction when the shutter is released .
Its entirely manual .
Perfect for the job .
I mounted it to the CCD by cutting a slot in a block of wood .
On the back side , I mounted the scanner 's PCB with the linear CCD .
On the front side , I mounted a lens cap ( with a hole cut in it ) to the wood , and screwed the lens into that .
Surprisingly , from my rough calculations , I got the lens within .002 " of the right distance from the CCD for the focusing scale to be correct .
Careful sanding corrected the rest of the error .
The lens and CCD assembly is rotated on two metal points , which poke into small holes in the the wooden frame from the top and bottom .
The points are just the tips of screws , which are of course easily adjusted .
This method of scanning does cause the perspective to be more ' cylindrical ' than rectilinear , but for most shots , it 's either not noticeable , or not bothersome .
To get rectilinear perspective , I would have to move the CCD in a straight path while leaving the lens fixed in position , and that would n't be easy to do with simple means .
The mechanism for rotating the lens turret
My original idea was to have an elaborate gearing mechanism to rotate the turret , but going through my collection of miscellaneous gears , I just could n't find the right kind of mating gears to make this work .
That , and to preserve a reasonable aspect ratio with a 35 mm focal length lens , I could n't rotate it through more than 60 degrees in one scan anyway .
As such , using the toothed belt from the scanner to pull an arm at the back of the turret was a more logical choice .
Because I used all the electronics from the scanner unaltered ( except for removing the illumination light ) , I could just use the software that came with the scanner straight to operate it .
This software is not quite optimized for the task , but I was n't about to spend a hundred hours reverse engineering it and writing new driver software .
Mind you , doing that sort of thing should n't be impossible .
It turns out that this cheap scanner ( like many others ) has absolutely no smarts built in .
It 's all bit - bashed through the printer port , and the PC even has to generate the steps for returning the scan head to home position !
So basically , all the software to operate it sits on the PC .
( So instead of efficient embedded code , the driver is probably some badly designed piece of object oriented bloatware ) .
Colour convergence and aspect ratios
The rate of rotation per stepper motor step turned out to be very important .
For black and white , the error can be corrected by stretching the resultant image .
But for coluour photos , the colour convergence is all wrong if the image does not move across the CCD as a function of stepper steps as the software expects it to .
This is because the CCD has three separate sensor strips for red , green , and blue side by side .
The software takes the readings for each colur from different scan positions and combines them to converge the colour correctly .
If the image does n't move across the CCD at the right rate , this compensation is inaccurate .
Another thing I discovered was that , in order to get colour convergence to work , I needed to set it up to produce a mirror image .
This was because the beam folder in the original scanner had an odd number of reflections , thus resulting in a mirror image hitting the CCD .
In order to keep the software happy , I just set it up so that the lens rotated in the opposite direction that it used to scan .
It always gives me a mirror image , but this is easy to fix in the photo editor .
For rotating the turret , I first just ran the scanner 's belt directly over the gears as it had done in the scanner , and have the belt pull the back of the turret around .
However , this produced more rotation per step than appropriate .
Because of space constraints and limited belt length , I could n't make the arm much longer to reduce the angle either .
So , going to my box of miscellaneous gears again , I found a gear that mated fairly well with the toothed pulley for the belt already on the gear assembly .
This effectively gave me another gear of reduction .
To get the rate of rotation exactly right , I computed the ratio I needed by checking the distortion on circular objects I scanned , and then made a pulley to the exact diameter on my lathe .
Around this pulley , I ran the belt .
The drive is entirely friction based , but because the belt only rotates a turret on two points , slippage has not been a problem .
Scanner gear reduction plus one extra gear I added
On the other end of the belt , I put a tensioned idler , using , of course , the original idler pulley from the scanner .
I also put an idler in the middle of the belt .
This makes the back of the belt loop approximate an arc more closely , and gives a rate of turret rotation per stepper rotation more consistent over its entire range .
If you do n't understand why , do n't worry - most people do n't .
A picture I took of the garage while the door was moving
This digital scanning camera is of course only as fast as the original scanner was , which is to say not very fast .
I opened and closed the garage door while I took the shot above .
Really makes it look like there 's something gone very wrong with the garage door .
I have had that garage door jam and derail before , but never as bad as it looks in this photo !
A super close up - using extension tubes behind the lens I took this photo by mounting some extension tubes behind the lens for a real close up .
The resolution on the actual object is over 1000 DPI !
The shot took forever to set up , but once set up , its easy to take pictures of different things ( it 's tweaky much like it 's tweaky to get the ' perfect ' print in a darkroom )
Colour balance and CCD problems
The CCD and software is of course designed to operate in a scanner , which has fixed exposure and lighting .
In the scanner , the subject is always passively lighted with the same florescent tube .
In real life , things are less consistent .
It turned out that the CCD is not very well set up for dealing with very bright spots in the image , and if a bright spot is encountered , a streak is pulled across the image .
Exactly why I do n't know , but either the A/D converter or the CCD get screwed up when a very strong signal is scanned out of it .
A streaking artifact caused by a reflective spot Another problem is that the CCD 's colour balance is set up to work with a cool white fluorescent bulb .
When the subject is lit with a cool white fluorescent bulb , the colours come out quite realistic .
Daylight tends to be overly red , and daylight balanced fluorescent do n't have enough blue .
Incandescent illumination is pretty much unusable for colur photography .
This is because the CCD is very infrared sensitive , and there is no anti-IR filter in the optical path .
So the red CCD also picks up all the infrared light , and no amount of playing with the colour balance will make the result look colour realistic .
Black and white photography with incandescent illumination works pretty well , although the CCD is picking up more infrared than visible light .
Anything made of black anodized aluminum , for example , shows up as light gray instead of black .
Some dark thin fabrics you can see through a bit , so there is a bit of truth to this story of seeing through clothing with infrared camcorders .
On the whole though , with enough tweaking , it is possible to get some very sharp images over 2000x2000 pixels in size .
More pictures taken with the scanner Most of the photos on my Lego Machines page were also taken with the scanner .
Update : Well , within a year of building this contraption , I bought a digital camera always .
My first digital camera was an Olympus D340R .
My third digital camera , a 4 megapixel Canon S40 could finally do better than the scanner .
Really , have n't used the scanning camera contraption at all since I got a real digital camera .
Its too much effort to set up , so its not a practical alternative to a regular digital camera .
Most of the photos on my Lego Machines page were also taken with the scanner .
Other people have had the idea of scanning real life with a scanner too : Demonstration Quality Scanning Digital Camera .

Must be nice to get paid to hack around like that !

Business
For passengers on Skybus debut , it 's all about the price Richard Sutter was pleasantly astonished when he learned last month that the countrys newest and cheapest airline , Skybus Airlines , would charge him just $ 10 to fly him here from Ohio so he could attend his grandmothers 90th birthday this weekend .
And after landing at Portsmouth International Airport Tuesday morning , Sutter was even more astonished by how pleasant the flight from Columbus was .

 It was more than I thought it would be , a lot more .
For 10 bucks , I was expecting chickens on the plane ,  said Sutter , a Dayton native , who wound up paying just $ 146 total  counting taxes and security fees  for round - trip tickets for himself , his wife Mandy , son Tyler , 9 , and daughter Emma , 4 .
The Airbus A319 plane was clean and new , and with the ticket price so cheap , the Sutters had no complaint about paying the $ 20 Skybus fee to check their four bags and $ 2 apiece for some cans of soda .
Tuesday was the first full day of operations at Portsmouth for Skybus , a start - up airline based in the Ohio capital .
It s bringing to the United States the ultracheap discount service once offered by PeopleExpress on the East Coast in the 1980s and today offered in Europe by carriers such as RyanAir and EasyJet , which feature one - way promotional fares as low as one British penny .
While other US airlines have been trimming frills and edging into a - la - carte pricing for once - free services like checked baggage and extra legroom seats , Skybus takes frugality to new levels .
The airline promises at least 10 $ 10 fares on every flight  although by Tuesday afternoon those were all gone for June and July on the Portsmouth - Columbus route .
Skybuss website offered only $ 30 to $ 150 one - way tickets , which were still significantly less expensive than other airlines .
All any of the Skybus tickets buy , though , is a seat on the plane .
Passengers have to pay $ 5 to check a bag , $ 8 for a blanket , $ 15 for a pillow , and $ 10 to wait at the front of the line , since there are no assigned seats .
Except for babies and people with medical needs , passengers are forbidden to bring food or drink on board so Skybus squelches any free competition for its $ 5 Budweisers and $ 10 meat loaf plates .
There are no movies .
And by eliminating first - class seating , it squeezes 144 coach seats on a model of plane that has 124 or 126 seats in two classes on most other carriers  although Skybuss 30 - inch coach seat pitch ,  or spacing between seats , is the same as Northwest Airlines and US Airways in coach .
Also holding down costs :
There is no phone number customers can call .
All tickets are sold online , and the only access to Skybus customer service is the gate agent at the airport .
One big revenue stream for the airline is making its jets flying billboards for Nationwide Insurance , which pays an undisclosed fee to get its name and website on the fuselage and inside the cabin .
Initially , Skybus is flying to seven other destinations besides Portsmouth from its Columbus hub : Richmond ; Greensboro , N.C. ; Fort Lauderdale , Fla. ; Kansas City , Mo. ; Burbank , Calif . ; Oakland , Calif. , and Bellingham , Wash .
Like Portsmouth , which is 55 miles north of Boston and had no regularly scheduled jet service to or from anywhere before Skybus began operations Tuesday night , Bellingham , Burbank , and Oakland are meant to be cheap , if remote , alternatives for getting into the big metropolitan areas nearby of Seattle , Los Angeles , and San Francisco .
With $ 160 million in committed funding , Skybus plans to add 70 more jets to its current fleet of eight in the next five years and add several destinations .
Our belief is that if you bring down the fare a lot , a lot more people are going to want to fly ,  Skybus chief executive Bill Dieffenderffer said in an interview as he prepared to board the 9:05 a.m. flight back to his Columbus home .
Tuesday , Skybus was doing a better business eastbound than westbound , with about 105 passengers exiting the flight from Columbus to Portsmouth and about 50 waiting here to fly to Ohio , according to airport officials .
But the lure of too - cheap - to - believe fares clearly had huge appeal , especially for grandparents , who appeared to represent a disproportionate share of the passenger load .
Gary Duncan , a Massachusetts environmental police officer headed with his wife , Kathy , to see their grandchildren Robert and Joseph in Indianapolis , figured he spent more on gas driving up to Portsmouth from his Wakefield home than the $ 10 he paid for the 1 - hour , 45 - minute flight to Columbus .
Jan Keefe , who was heading from Rochester , N.H. , with her husband , Bill , to visit their son and his family in Florence , Ky. , was initially thrilled with the $ 112 total round - trip fare .
But after discovering she had erroneously booked a 9 p.m. flight instead of a 9 a .m. flight , she was actually happy to pay $ 80 to switch the tickets .
 The Skybus people were unreal .
They were so accommodating and nice about it ,  Keefe said .
Duncan , interviewed by cellphone after his flight landed in Columbus , said everything about the experience was excellent .
It was a brand new plane , very comfortable , and the service was excellent .
Duncan , who rented a car to get from Columbus to Indianapolis , said compared to the nonstops he and his wife have flown from Logan International Airport to Indianapolis on US Airways , the Skybus plane was actually cleaner and better appointed .
Negotiating the five - minute drive off Interstate 95 to the wide - open airport parking lot was a dream compared to Logan .
Even at $ 2 for coffee and $ 8 for a danish - and - fruit tray , he praised the food , too .
 Id recommend it to anybody .
Well be very glad to go again ,  Duncan said .
 For $ 10 , it was just amazing . Peter J. Howe can be reached at howe@globe.com .

Nature , through the trial and error of evolution , has discovered a vast diversity of life from what can only presumed to have been a primordial pool of building blocks .
Inspired by this success , a new Biodesign Institute research team , led by John Chaput , is now trying to mimic the process of Darwinian evolution in the laboratory by evolving new proteins from scratch .
Using new tricks of molecular biology , Chaput and co-workers have evolved several new proteins in a fraction of the 3 billion years it took nature .
The three - dimensional structure ( ribbon diagram ) of protein DX as a crystallogrpahic dimer .
The zinc metal ion is shown in orange and the chloride anion at the dimer interface in red , and the ATP ligand is colored by atom type .
DX has been evolved in the lab to improve protein stability and can bind ATP tighter than similar proteins found in nature .

Their most recent results , published in the May 23rd edition of the journal PLoS ONE , have led to some surprisingly new lessons on how to optimize proteins which have never existed in nature before , in a process they call ‘ synthetic evolution . ’
" The goal of our research is to understand certain fundamental questions regarding the origin and evolution of proteins , " said Chaput , a researcher in the institute ’s Center for BioOptical Nanotechnology and assistant professor in Arizona State University ’s department of chemistry and biochemistry .
" Would proteins that we evolve in the lab look like proteins we see today in nature or do they look totally different from the set of proteins nature ultimately chose "
By gaining a better understanding of these questions , we hope to one day create new tailor - made catalysts that can be used as therapeutics in molecular medicine or biocatalysts in biotechnology . "
The building blocks of proteins are 20 different amino acids that are strung together and folded to make the unique globular shape , stability and function of every protein .
The mixing and matching of the amino acid chain like numbers in the lottery are what favor the odds in nature of finding just the right combinations to help generate biological diversity .
Yet no one can predict how the string of amino acids sequence folds to make the 3 - D functional structure of a protein .
To select the raw ingredients to create the proteins , Chaput ’s group ( which includes Harvard collaborator Jack Szostak , and ASU colleagues Jim Allen , Meitian Wang , Matthew Rosenow and Matthew Smith ) began their quest by further evolving a protein that had been previously selected from a pool of random sequences .
Jack Szostak and Anthony Keefe first made the parental protein in 2001 .
To achieve their feat , they stacked the odds of finding just one or two new proteins and generated a library of random amino acid sequences so vast — 400 trillion — that it dwarfs the number of items in the entire Library of Congress ( 134 million ) .

They started with a small protein stretch 80 amino acids long .
This basic protein segment acts as a protein scaffold that can be selected for the ability to strongly clutch its target molecule , ATP .
There was only one problem , the parental protein could bind ATP , but it was n’t very stable without it .
" It turns out that protein stability is a major problem in biology , " said Chaput .
" As many as half of the 30,000 genes discovered from the human genome project contain proteins that we really do n’t know what their structure is or whether or not they would be stable .
So for our goal , we wanted to learn more about the evolution of protein folding and stability . "
Chaput ’s group decided to speed up protein evolution once again by randomly mutating the parental sequence with a selection specically designed to improve protein stability .
The team upped the ante and added increasing amounts of a salt , guanidine hydrochloride , making it harder for the protein fragment to bind its target ( only the top 10 percent of strongest ATP binders remained ) .
After subjecting the protein fragments to several rounds of this selective environmental pressure , only the ‘ survival of the fittest ’ ATP binding protein fragments remained .
The remaining fragments were identified and amino acid sequences compared with one another .
Surprisingly , Chaput had bested nature ’s designs , as the test tube derived protein was not only stable , but could bind ATP twice as tight as anything nature had come up with before .
To understand how this information is encoded in a protein sequence , Chaput and colleagues solved the 3 - D crystal structures for their evolutionary optimized protein , termed DX , and the parent sequence .
In a surprising result , just two amino acids changes in the protein sequence were found to enhance the binding , solubility and heat stability .
" We were shocked , because when we compared the crystal structures of the parent sequence to the DX sequence , we did n’t see any significant changes , " said Chaput .
" Yet no one could have predicted that these two amino acids changes would improve the function of the DX protein compared to the parent .
The results have helped provide a new understanding of how subtle amino acid changes contribute to the protein folding and stability .
Chaput ’s team has developed the technology potential to take any of nature ’s proteins and further improve its stability and function .
" We have the distinct advantage over nature of being able to freeze the evolution of our lab - evolved proteins at different time points to begin to tease apart this random process and relate it to the final protein function , " said Chaput .
Next , Chaput plans on further expanding his efforts to evolve proteins with new therapeutic features or catalytic functions .

Bacteria found in Australian mines help gold grains to form .

Prospectors looking for gold nuggets have swarms of tiny helpers : bugs that take up toxic gold complexes from the soil and spit out pure gold on to the grains around them .
Research published today provides strong evidence that bacteria known to produce gold in the laboratory do their trick in the wild too .
Impure gold , mixed with silver and copper , is found in the veins of minerals such as quartz , sometimes in such low concentrations as to be invisible .
More obvious to the casual prospector are the highly enriched ' secondary grains ' or nuggets found in river beds and soil .
It is thought that these may be formed by weathering processes that either leach out the silver and copper metals , or wash the gold into solution so it can accumulate elsewhere .
Frank Reith of the Australian National University in Canberra and his colleagues have shown that microbes play a role too .
Geologists in the field have seen bacterial structures on gold grains before , and microbiologists in the laboratory have shown that many types of bacteria will deposit gold and other metals from solution .
But the link between bacteria and gold deposits was tenuous .
Now Reith and his team have bridged the divide .
Gold Standard
The researchers visited gold mines 3,400 kilometres apart , in New South Wales and Queensland , Australia .
" We shovelled up gold into pans , and looked at the gold flakes .
Forms like cell walls appeared — bacterial remnants encased in gold , " says Reith .
Genetic analysis revealed up to 30 species of microbe in the biofilms of bacteria on the gold grains .
One that was found on gold grains in both sites — but never in the surrounding soil — was identified as the bacterium Ralstonia metallidurans , a microbe that can grow in metal - rich solutions .
The team , whose results are reported in Science1 , showed that R. metallidurans could survive in solutions of toxic gold chloride , and precipitated gold as it did so .
" Ralstonia may be precipitating the gold to detoxify its environment — meaning that it and the other organisms in the biofilm can survive , " says Reith .
" It 's possible that the bacteria become encased in gold and other bacteria grow on top , like a coral reef . "
Home grown
The exact details of how or why microbes enrich gold nuggets are still unclear .
ADVERTISEMENT
" Gold chloride complexes are rare in surface environments , " comments Gordon Southam , a geomicrobiologist from the University of Western Ontario , Canada .
He thinks that thiosulphate gold complexes may also be involved — but this study did n't look to see how the bugs react to that chemical brew .
" We need to try putting mobile gold into the soil and adding organisms to that , " says Reith .
" Could we then find gold nuggets ?
Would this take months , years , tens of years ? "
Potential applications — from sensing the bacteria as a way to look for gold mines , to using them to help make industrially useful particles of gold — may be some way off .
But Southam is keen to exploit the bacteria 's natural trick .
" I want to make a gold nugget one day , " he says .
" Gold nuggets grow in nature , so why should n't I be able to make one ? "

Things in WSGI - land have been going well lately , I think .
Paste is at 1.0 and doing fine there .
Pylons has been gaining in popularity , and it's been doing really well as a traditional and familiar framework on the outside , but with WSGI just under the skin .
It 's been a compelling introduction to WSGI for many people .
Other WSGI - based frameworks have been appearing ; I especially like niche frameworks like wsgicollection because they would n't be viable frameworks at all if they had to stand on their own .
But with WSGI you really can just solve one problem , and not worry about all possible problems .
There 's been several recent articles on WSGI .
I 'm never sure how WSGI should really be presented -- on one level it's an implementation detail of higher - level frameworks .
Creating WSGI middleware and dispatchers and whatnot is not terribly advanced , and is genuinely useful even if you are n't inclined to write your own framework from scratch , but it 's not a prerequesite to getting things done in WSGI - based environments .
But WSGI 's success will definitely rely on the community of people that feel comfortable with both the details and the architecture of these systems , so building wide familiarity is important .
I 've personally come to believe that talking about the architecture of WSGI is more important than the details ( which are easy enough to pick up if you are motivated ) .
I started talking about more standards on Web - SIG .
Python is ripe for new standards in lots of areas , and WSGI stacks are among them .
The first proposal I introduced just because it seemed like low - hanging fruit , but people seemed to really like it .
I guess it 's not surprise that low - hanging fruit is usually the best stuff to pick .
The proposal describes an environment key ( wsgiorg.routing_args ) that dispatchers can use to store captured information .
In the process we discussed a fairly light process for introducing and accepting proposals , centered now on a wsgi.org page .
I also added a bunch of ideas for specs to the bottom of that page ; so if you see one you are thinking about yourself , now you know someone else is thinking about it too .
In my own coding , I 've been working on WSGIRemote , which is a library to help with making subrequests , both external requests and what should be very fast internal requests ( not that I 've benchmarked anything ) .
This should make apps using REST internally more manageable -- they should scale down a lot further , requiring less setup and less general overhead .
Of course the performance characteristics will change a lot when you actually move services to other processes or servers , but I 'm more concerned with manageability at this point .
A lot of the tools in Paste ( and Paste Deploy ) are about managing lots of small pieces without letting that turn into external complexity .
One aspect of this is to let applications self - provide the services they need , because most of the time simple internal implementations of an API will be sufficient .
Turning a Python library into a service is kind of like adding another level of formality to it ; and I think more formality is useful as we try to share pieces of code .
Another earlier - stage project is WSGIFilter , perhaps notably one of the only frameworks for building WSGI middleware .
It 's not a very big framework , to be sure ( it 's really just the one file ) but it should help implement output filtering in WSGI , which can be really tricky .
WSGI development can seem kind of plodding at times , because we 're building up slowly from a low - level foundation .
But as the tools emerge they work together really well ; I think we 're starting to see real returns from that process .
If there was a motto for using these WSGI tools together , it might be making large problems smaller -- it 's not doing much for you , it 's not fancy or magic , things like " convention over configuration " do n't even mean anything on this level , it 's not code or a framework , it 's just an idea and an architecture .
Describing what that really means remains a challenge .
If you think you need to install a telescope on a mountaintop , or even above the surface of the Earth , think again .
A new telescope currently being installed near the South Pole has detectors more than 2 kilometres under the surface of the Antarctic ice cap .
For the neutrinos it ’s searching for , that much ice is the same as nothing at all .
Neutrinos are illusive particles generated by the fusion reactions in the Sun and other cosmic events .
They barely interact with normally matter , passing right through like it ’s complete vacuum .
Only in the rarest occasions will a neutrino collide directly normal matter , releasing a torrent of subparticles and radiation .
Once completed , the IceCube observatory will consist of detectors arranged in a 1 kilometre cubic array frozen underneath the surface of the Antarctic ice cap .
Construction is currently into its 3rd year , with more than 20 institutions participating .
The final instrument will consist of more than 70 strings , each containing more than 60 optical detectors frozen into the ice .
When operational , IceCube will be able to detect neutrinos from the Sun , as well as some of the most catastrophic events in the Universe , such as a supernova or black hole .
The neutrinos will interact with particles of ice within the array , and produce a cascade of particles that will produce a flash of light captured by the optical detectors .
The full construction is going to take another 3 - 4 years , but the array is already operational , and gathering scientific results .

Diagnosing Our Health Care Woes
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
No one disputes the diagnosis : American health care is in lousy shape .
As a practicing physician for more than 30 years , I find the pervasiveness of managed care very troubling .
The problems with our health care system are not the result of too little government intervention , but rather too much .
Contrary to the claims of many advocates of increased government regulation of health care , rising costs and red tape do not represent market failure .
Rather , they represent the failure of government policies that have destroyed the health care market .
It ’s time to rethink the whole system of HMOs and managed care .
This entire unnecessary level of corporatism rakes off profits and worsens the quality of care .
But HMOs did not arise in the free market ; they are creatures of government interference in health care dating to the 1970s .
These non-market institutions have gained control over medical care through collusion between organized medicine , politicians , and drug companies , in an effort to move America toward free universal health care .
One big problem arises from the 1974 ERISA law , which grants tax benefits to employers for providing health care , while not allowing similar incentives for individuals .
This results in the illogical coupling between employment and health insurance .
As such , government removed the market incentive for health insurance companies to cater to the actual health - care consumer .
As a greater amount of government and corporate money has been used to pay medical bills , costs have risen artificially out of the range of most individuals .
Only true competition assures that the consumer gets the best deal at the best price possible by putting pressure on the providers .
Patients are better served by having options and choices , not new federal bureaucracies and limitations on legal remedies .
Such choices and options will arrive only when we unravel the HMO web rooted in old laws , and change the tax code to allow individual Americans to fully deduct all healthcare costs from their taxes , as employers can .
As government bureaucracy continues to give preferences and protections to HMOs and trial lawyers , it will be the patients who lose , despite the glowing rhetoric from the special interests in Washington .
Patients will pay ever rising prices and receive declining care while doctors continue to leave the profession in droves .
Dr. Ron Paul is a Republican member of Congress from Texas .

SAN MATEO -- A San Mateo woman is getting messages from God and painting them in five - foot - tall letters on the roof of her house .
The city wants her to stop doing it .
Her neighbors want her to stop doing it .
But Estrella Benavides says she can't do that .
" I am going to keep going , because it is all I can do , " she said .
" God chose me to be His servant .
There is such a thing as freedom of speech . "
Benavides , a 48 - year - old woman who lives alone in her yellow house on Cottage Grove Avenue , began painting the giant messages about a year ago , about the time her husband moved out and she lost custody of her son .
Last month , she had two large pins inserted through her lips , to keep her from eating as part of a religious fast .
God told her to do that , too .
For months , cars and pedestrians have been passing slowly by the yellow house at all hours of the day and night , pointing at the giant letters on the roof and at other messages painted on the garage door , windows and the red compact car parked in the driveway .
The messages are a barely intelligible garble involving cloning , abuse , rape , the Mafia , Castro , Hitler , the Constitution , hurricane Katrina , Watergate and President Bush .
Not long ago , the city of San Mateo posted a sign of its own on Benavides ' front door , informing her that her signs violated city rules .
The city said her signs are too big , too numerous and cannot be on the roof .
It scheduled a hearing before the Community Improvement Commission for January 17 .
If Benavides loses , she could be fined up to $ 10,000 a day and lose her home .
Her neighbor just across the street , Robert Owlett , said he tries to be tolerant but the roof signs have got to go .
" She can paint what she wants on the garage , but I draw the line at the roof , " he said .
" It 's an eyesore .
It 's an invasion of my privacy and it degrades the neighborhood .
This may not be Hillsborough but it's all we 've got . "
Next door neighbor Briana Jackson said cars drive by constantly to look at the signs , and she finds that " disturbing . "
Jackson said she 's tried to be a good neighbor .
She offered to share her Thanksgiving dinner with Benavides , and she tries to chat from time to time , but it 's become increasingly harder to get through .
" Now I pray for her , and I hope she gets help , " Jackson said .
" It 's an unbelievable situation . "
Benavides said she first began receiving messages from God through a statue at her church .
Now , she said , she gets the special messages when she reads the Bible .
Sometimes she broadcasts the messages from a loudspeaker mounted on the roof of her car .
" If the city wants to put me in jail , what can I do ? " she said .
" I am God 's servant . "
Anyway , she said , the size of the roof letters are not particularly large .
" The signs at Costco are a lot bigger than the ones on my roof , " she said .
In his continuing quest to do his job and carry out the legitimate oversight functions of Congress , Henry Waxman has written to former White House chief of staff Andrew Card and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice asking them to appear before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
To Card :
" Mr. Fielding 's position appears to be that it is appropriate for you to discuss these matters on ' The Daily Show ' but not before a congressional committee , " Waxman wrote to Card on Friday .
" You will not be surprised to learn that I take a different view of this matter . "
That is some dry , dry humor there .
Jon Stewart should take note .
To Rice :
" I hope we can work together over the next week to schedule a voluntary appearance by you before the committee , " Waxman wrote to Rice on Tuesday .
" That would eliminate the need for the use of any compulsory process . "
" Compulsory process " ?
That would be the subpoenas the Oversight Committee will vote on on Wednesday .
White House counsel Fred Fielding continues to insist , of course , that for either Card or Rice to testify would be shocking and unprecedented .
To which Waxman replied :
" I never found it necessary to issue subpoenas to either President Bush 's father 's Administration or the Reagan Administration , " Waxman said in a statement .
" We were always able to reach an accommodation that respected our legitimate interests .
I hope that will continue to be the case with this White House " and the information will be provided voluntarily .
As Waxman almost certainly realizes , the interests the White House seeks to protect here are not legitimate , but the gauntlet is certainly thrown back toward the Bush administration on this one .

はじめに
2006年8月、Javaの次期仕様（JDK7）にクロージャを入れる案*が出され話題になりました。クロージャは関数型言語では30年以上の歴史を持ち、プログラミングにおける基本的な道具となっています。最近はPerl、Ruby、Pythonなどの軽量言語（Lightweight Language）にも取り込まれ、それと知らずに使っているユーザーも増えているのではないでしょうか。
一方、手続き型言語の世界では、完全なクロージャはなじみが薄いようです。C言語からC++へと発展してきた手続き型言語のメインストリームでは、
ガーベジコレクションを持たず、ローカル変数をスタックに置くことを基本とする言語のため、クロージャとの相性が悪かった
オブジェクト指向を採り入れることでクロージャの代用とできた
といったことが理由でしょう。
実際、クロージャとオブジェクト指向プログラミング言語には、メカニズム的に共通する部分があり、一方を他方で実装するのも簡単な工夫だけでできます。そのため、プログラミング言語に純粋性を求める向きには、「どちらか一方だけを言語のプリミティブとしてサポートすべきだ」との主張さえあります。確かに、クロージャを中心とするかオブジェクトを中心とするかで、プログラムの組み立て方が異なってくると言えます。
本稿では、クロージャとオブジェクトの実装と意味における共通部分と相違部分を検討することで、両方のメカニズムをうまく融合させる方法を考えてみたいと思います。なお、プログラム例としてSchemeを用いています*が、原理は多くのプログラミング言語に共通です。
クロージャによる動的オブジェクト
まずは簡単に、クロージャとは何かを説明し、それからオブジェクト指向との違いについて見ていきます。
クロージャおさら い
クロージャとは、関数が作成されるときの環境（定義個所から見えるローカルな束縛*）を「閉じ込んで」いるものです。Cのように関数の内部で関数を定義できない言語では、「ローカルな環境の内部で関数を作成する」ということがそもそもあり得ないため、クロージャの出る幕がありませんでした。しかし、多くの言語ではローカルな環境の中で関数を定義できて、その関数の中から外側にあるローカル変数を参照できます。
具体例を見てみましょう。次のSchemeコードは、map-add-nという関数を定義しています。add-map-nの内部では、ローカルな関数add-nを定義し、関数mapに渡しています。
（define （ map - add - n n lis） （define （add -n x） ← add - nを定義 （+ x n）） ← add - nを定義 （map add -n lis）） ← add - nを関数mapに渡してい る
関数add - nは 「 引数xにnを足す 」 、関数mapは 「手続きとリストを取り、リストのおのおのの値に手続きを適用した結果をリストにして返す」というものです。従ってmap-add-nは「リストlisの各要素にnを足したもののリストを返す」という動作をします。
gosh > （ map-add-n 5 '（1 2 3）） ↑数値の1、2、3からなるリストの各要素にそれぞれ5を足す => （ 6 7 8 ） ← 実行結果
Schemeを見慣れない読者のために、同様のコードをPythonで書いておきます。
def map_add_n（n , lis） : def add_n（x） : return x+n return map（add_n , lis）
Schemeのコードと比べて、括弧の位置など体裁を除けば、ほとんど同じだと分かるでしょう。この後に出てくる多くのコード例は、マクロを除けばほぼ一対一でほかの言語に変換可能です。読者のなじみの言語に変換しつつ読んでいただければ幸いです。
クロージャ＝関数＋環境
さて、ローカルに定義された関数add-nは、その外側にあるローカル変数nを参照しています。add-nが実際に呼ばれるのはmapの中であり、map本体は渡される関数のローカル環境など知らないわけですから、これを実現するadd-nは、処理内容「（+
x n）」だけでなく、map-add-nが作られた時点での束縛（前述の例では「n = 5」）をも知っている必要があります。関数mapに渡されるadd-nの実体は、単なる関数ポインタではなく、「n = 5」という環境と処理内容とを合わせたオブジェクトです。これをクロージャと呼ぶのでした。
もちろん、次にmap-add-nを呼び出せば、そのときに作られるnの束縛を環境として閉じ込んだ新たなクロージャが作られてmapに渡されます。
現在 のJavaに慣れた人でしたら、inner classを使えば同じことができることに気づくでしょう。inner classは、「閉じ込む変数をプログラマーが明示的に指定している」という点を除けば、できることはクロージャとたいして変わりません。
このページで出てきた専門用語 Javaの次期仕様 （JDK7）にクロージャを入れる案 提案の共著者であるNeal Gafterのブログ 「 Closures for Java」 が分かりやすい。 プログラム例とし てSchemeを用いています ここで紹介し たSchemeのコードは、すべ てScheme処理 系Gaucheでテストしている。動かして試しながら理解したいという方は、Gaucheをインストールされたい。なお、2006年8月時点で、GaucheはLinux/Mac
OS X/*BSD / Windowsで動作する（ただし、Windows版はCygwin環境で動作する。ネイティブ環境で動作する版もあるが、まだ動作は不安定）。 束縛 手続き型言語で言うところの、変数の定義や代入に相当する。「ローカルな束縛」とは、入れ子になった関数の中で定義された変数を指す。ローカルな変数は、入れ子の内部の関数からのみ参照/更新できる。 関数 ここでは「関数 」 をC言語などの、処理内容のみを持つ命令列、というような意味で使っている。関数型言語の多くはむしろすべての関数が環境を持つのが当然であり（グローバルな関数はたまたま環境が空であると考える）、そこでは「関数」と「クロージャ」はほぼ同義で使われる。

In a move sure to impress environmentalists and further cement his Earth friendly image , Governor Schwarzenegger is set to launch a multimillion dollar research effort into a revolutionary new source of clean non-polluting power .
The reactor works by using Quasi- spherical magnetic fields that trap injected energetic electrons to form a spherical negative potential well .
Fusion ions trapped in this spherical well focused through central region oscillate across the " core " until they are reacted .
The project is focused on the Inertial Electrostatic Fusion reactor invented by the award winning American physicist Dr. Robert W. Bussard .
The Radiation Free Fusion Reactor has the potential to change the whole landscape of energy generation , which is usually a choice between bad and worse options that include Nuclear , Coal and Natural Gas systems .
The State of California peak energy usage is about 40,000 Megawatts and is only expected to grow steadily over the coming years .
Fusion opens a whole new avenue of cheap clean energy that could not on
ly satisfy growing energy needs but also fuel massive water desalination plants that could help solve California ’s acute water shortages .
Fusion is the energy that powers everything in the universe .
The sun 's energy comes from fusion .
Alternatively , fission is the process whereby heavy atoms , which are nearly unstable , are split into two radioactive atoms .
Fusion , on the other hand , is when two light atoms merge .
The fusion process invented by Dr. Bussard takes boron - 11 and fuses a proton to it , producing , in its excited state , a carbon - 12 atom .
This excited carbon - 12 atom decays to beryllium - 8 and helium - 4 . Beryllium - 8 very quickly ( in 10 - 13 s ) decays into two more helium - 4 atoms .
This is the only nuclear - energy releasing process in the whole world that releases fusion energy and three helium atoms -- and no neutrons .
This reaction is completely radiation free .
The potential of one Electric Fusion reactor would be in the range of 100 to 1,000 MW and would provide power for up to 250,000 homes at peak output with a potential cost of construction ofaround $ 200 million dollars , making it relatively inexpensive compared to the ITER reactor that is to begin construction in France at a cost of $ 12 billion US dollars .
NEW YORKERS have often been told that they use less energy than most Americans , partly because they live in the most densely populated city in the country .
And that ’s true , up to a point .
Sure , New Yorkers have the benefit of an extensive mass - transit system , which means lower auto emissions , but the city ’s residential buildings are less energy - efficient than those in many other places in the country , particularly in eco-friendly states like California and Vermont .
“ The main reason that New Yorkers use much less electricity is that our apartments are so much smaller ” than homes in other cities , said Rohit Aggarwala , the director of the Long - Term Planning and Sustainability Office , part of the Mayor ’s Office of Operations .
In fact , most big New York buildings , both commercial and residential , are wasting thousands of dollars a year on energy , the city says .
Energy use by buildings accounts for almost 80 percent of the city ’s greenhouse gas emissions , and residential buildings for about a third of that .
These gases are released in creating the energy used to heat , cool and light the buildings , as well as to run myriad household appliances and gadgets .
Mitsubishi bought the island in 18901 and began using it as a coal mining facility .
When space for the workers began to run out , they built Japan ’s first large scale reinforced concrete apartment block on the island in 1916 .
More concrete tower blocks followed , and by 1959 the population of Hashima reached its peak of 5,259 – an astonishing 1,391 people per 10,000 square metres within the residential district – which is said to be the highest population density ever recorded in the world .
When petroleum began to replace coal here in the 1960s , coal production at Hashima began to decline , and Mitsubishi officially announced the closure of the mine in 1974 .
Today there is nobody left at all .
Protected by a high sea wall , and completely off - limits to the public , the island is now an empty , rotting and collapsing ghost town , as clearly demonstrated in this fantastically eerie photo set2 .
For more information on this incredible place , here ’s a short documentary , an excellent in - depth story and a rather short Wikipedia page .

Windows Vista suffers from a bug that causes many machines to stall while deleting , copying and moving files , a flaw that has provoked consternation in online forums .
" I 've seen this bug in action , and trust me , it 's as if you 're copying over a 64 k link using only 256 mb of RAM , " one Reg reader complained .
" To add to the problem , you can't cancel or anything . "
According to a thread on Microsoft 's TechNet site , Microsoft has issued a hotfix for the problem , but it has failed to quell the outrage .
For one thing , individual users must get Microsoft 's approval before the fix can be downloaded , according to our tipster .
And for another , hotfixes are more of a pain to install than patches .
We 've contacted a Microsoft spokeswoman , who promised to see if a patch for the problem in the works .
Meanwhile , Vista users continue to grumble .
" I simply can not believe that I updated to a new computer and put windows Vista on it to find that it's not even capable of moving and deleting files in an efficient manner , " one disaffected user posted in the Microsoft forum .
" Microsoft must be kidding !
The most basic of features that I use all the time is a slow train wreck . " ®
How Hollywood , Congress , And DRM Are Beating Up The American Economy
The United States traded its manufacturing sector 's health for its entertainment industry , hoping that Police Academy sequels could take the place of the rust belt .
The United States bet wrong .
America needs new , realistic trade policies , columnist Cory Doctorow says .
Not too long ago , back in 1985 , the Senate was ready to clobber the music industry for exposing America 's impressionable youngsters to sex , drugs and rock ' n ' roll .
For America , that was nothing new .
Through most of its history , the U.S. government has been at odds with the entertainment giants , treating them as purveyors of filth .
Not anymore .
The relationship between the entertainment industry and the U.S. government today is pretty cozy .
Entertainment is using America 's clout to force Russia to institute police inspections of its CD presses , apparently oblivious to the irony of post - Soviet Russia forgoing its hard - won freedom of the press to protect Disney and Universal .
The U.S. attorney general is proposing to expand the array of legal tools at the RIAA 's disposal , giving the organization the ability to attack people who simply attempt infringement .
How did entertainment go from trenchcoat pervert to top trade priority ?
I blame the " Information Economy . "
No one really knows what " Information Economy " means , but by the early '90s , we knew it was coming .
America deployed the futurists -- her least - reliable strategic resource -- to puzzle out what an " information economy " was and to figure out how to ensure that America stayed atop the " new economy . "
We make the future in much the same way as we make the past .
We weave our memories together on demand , filling in any empty spaces with elements of the present , which are lying around in great abundance .
In Stumbling on Happiness , Harvard psych prof Daniel Gilbert describes an experiment in which people with lunch in front of them are asked to remember their breakfast :
Overwhelmingly , the people with good lunches have more positive memories of breakfast than those who have bad lunches .
We do n't remember breakfast -- we look at lunch and superimpose it on breakfast .
We make the future in the same way :
We extrapolate as much as we can , and whenever we run out of imagination , we just shovel the present into the holes .
That 's why our pictures of the future always seem to resemble the present , only more so .
So when the futurists told us about the Information Economy , they took all the " information - based " businesses -- which Neal Stephenson , in his 1992 novel Snow Crash , described as ( music , movies , and microcode -- and projected a future in which these would grow to dominate the world 's economies .
There was only one fly in the ointment :
Most of the world 's economies consist of poor people who have more time than money , and if there 's any lesson to learn from American college kids , it 's that people with more time than money would rather copy information for free than pay for it .

Economy Soft Landing Revisited By Ryan McGreal
Published February 23 , 2007
Many economists have predicted a " soft landing " for the housing market , where prices peak and stall but do not crash .
Well , maybe .
I admit I 've been surprised at how gently the housing market has stalled - I expected a much rougher ride by now .
However , troubling signs suggest the market has n't quite landed yet , as Bloomberg reports :
ResMae Mortgage Corp. may be on the cutting edge of a trend in the U.S. subprime - loan industry .
It 's bankrupt and selling assets for pennies on the dollar .
ResMae , which made home loans to people with bad credit , will be auctioned off next week .
The opening bid , by Credit Suisse Group , is $ 19.1 million , less than half the size of an offer received by ResMae before it went bankrupt Feb. 13 .
ResMae is the third company to go bankrupt this year ; and Doug Duncan , chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association , predicts over a hundred other mortgage companies will follow in ResMae 's footsteps in 2007 .
The problem is that lenders are being squeezed by falling home sales and hence falling demand for mortgages to higher risk borrowers .
With falling demand , the 2 - 3 percent risk premium fell to zero even as bankruptcies and defaults hit record highs .
Moodys has reported that it may cut its ratings for some of the largest subprime lenders .
" I do not think it is surprising we have trouble in this sector of the market ; I think the surprise is the speed at which it has unfolded in the last couple of months , " said Mary Miller , director of fixed - income at Baltimore - based T. Rowe Price Group Inc. , which manages about $ 335 billion in assets .
The effects are starting to ripple outward .
Home improvement and building supply stores Home Depot and Lowe 's have seen their profits drop sharply , and homebuilders like Toll Brothers are suffering " dismal earnings " .
Perhaps surprisingly , the only home building companies doing well are so - called " green builders " - companies that specialize in materials for energy efficient and sustainable buildings .
Purveyors of such building components as foam insulation and faux wood shingles are continuing to see gangbuster sales , almost as though the housing boom that ended a year ago were still at full tilt .
Materials are considered " green , " in industry parlance , when they generally help reduce energy use more than conventional materials or are manufactured in a way that has less of an impact on the environment .
Sustainability is a good investment .

Apple is being challenged once again to open up its DRM by consumer groups in Europe .
This time , Germany and France have joined the slowly - growing number of countries who are asking Apple to allow the protected songs purchased from the iTunes Store to be played on other music players besides the iPod.
Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman Bjoern Erik
Thon told the Associated Press that France 's consumer lobby group , UFC - Que Choisir , and Germany 's Verbraucherzentrale are now part of the European effort to push Apple into an open DRM system , with more countries considering joining the group .
By now , everyone who owns a digital music player of any sort is painfully aware that buying music from a particular online store locks them into that platform .
Apple , the current market leader in both online music and digital music player sales , has been particularly stubborn about allowing its protected AAC files to be played on anything but iPods .
However , the company has been under some fire over the last year due to those restrictions , first with France and then Denmark looking to open up restrictive DRM schemes ( including , but not limited to iTunes ) .
Neither of those forced Apple to open up their FairPlay DRM , but last June , Norway ruled that the iTunes - iPod tie - in was unreasonable .
Norway 's Consumer Ombudsman gave Apple a deadline of June 21 , 2006 to come up with a solution , but the deadline then got pushed back to August 1 , 2006 .
Norwegian consumer groups were unimpressed by Apple 's response .
Norway has now given Apple a new deadline of September of this year to change its policies , and the pressure on Apple will likely grow in the months leading up to the deadline .
" This is important because Germany and France are European giants .
Germany , in particular , is a big market for digital music , " Thon said to the AP .
Who will be next to join the group and how will Apple respond to the growing pressure ?
ANYONE who follows an election campaign too closely will sometimes get the feeling that politicians think voters are idiots .
A new book says they are .
Or rather , Bryan Caplan , an economics professor at George Mason University , makes the slightly politer claim that voters systematically favour irrational policies .
In a democracy , rational politicians give them what they ( irrationally ) want .
In “ The Myth of the Rational Voter ” , Mr Caplan explains why this happens , why it matters and what we can do about it .
The world is a complex place .
Most people are inevitably ignorant about most things , which is why shows like “ Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader ? ” are funny .
Politics is no exception .
Only 15 % of Americans know who Harry Reid ( the Senate majority leader ) is , for example .
True , more than 90 % can identify Arnold Schwarzenegger .
But that has a lot to do with the governor of California 's previous job pretending to be a killer robot .
Many political scientists think this does not matter because of a phenomenon called the “ miracle of aggregation ” or , more poetically , the “ wisdom of crowds ” .
If ignorant voters vote randomly , the candidate who wins a majority of well - informed voters will win .
The principle yields good results in other fields .
On “ Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? ” , another quiz show , the answer most popular with the studio audience is correct 91 % of the time .
Financial markets , too , show how a huge number of guesses , aggregated , can value a stock or bond more accurately than any individual expert could .
But Mr Caplan says that politics is different because ignorant voters do not vote randomly .
Instead , he identifies four biases that prompt voters systematically to demand policies that make them worse off .
First , people do not understand how the pursuit of private profits often yields public benefits : they have an anti-market bias .
Second , they underestimate the benefits of interactions with foreigners : they have an anti-foreign bias .
Third , they equate prosperity with employment rather than production : Mr Caplan calls this the “ make - work bias ” .
Finally , they tend to think economic conditions are worse than they are , a bias towards pessimism .
Mr Caplan gives a sense of how strong these biases are by comparing the general public 's views on economic questions with those of economists and with those of highly educated non-economists .
For example , asked why petrol prices have risen , the public mostly blames the greed of oil firms .
Economists nearly all blame the law of supply and demand .
Experts are sometimes wrong , notes Mr Caplan , but in this case the public 's view makes no sense .
If petrol prices rise because oil firms want higher profits , how come they sometimes fall ?
Surveys suggest that , the more educated you are , the more likely you are to share the economists ' view on this and other economic issues .
But since everyone 's vote counts equally , politicians merrily denounce ExxonMobil and pass laws against “ price - gouging ” .
The public 's anti-foreign bias is equally pronounced .
Most Americans think the economy is seriously damaged by companies sending jobs overseas .
Few economists do .
People understand that the local hardware store will sell them a better , cheaper hammer than they can make for themselves .
Yet they are squeamish about trade with foreigners , and even more so about foreigners who enter their country to do jobs they spurn .
Hence the reluctance of Democratic presidential candidates to defend free trade , even when they know it will make most voters better off , and the reluctance of their Republican counterparts to defend George Bush 's liberal line on immigration .
The make - work bias is best illustrated by a story , perhaps apocryphal , of an economist who visits China under Mao Zedong .
He sees hundreds of workers building a dam with shovels .
He asks : “ Why do n't they use a mechanical digger ? ” “ That would put people out of work , ” replies the foreman .
“ Oh , ” says the economist , “ I thought you were making a dam .
If it 's jobs you want , take away their shovels and give them spoons . ”
For an individual , the make - work bias makes some sense .
He prospers if he has a job , and may lose his health insurance if he is laid off .
For the nation as a whole , however , what matters is not whether people have jobs , but how they do them .
The more people produce , the greater the general prosperity .
It helps , therefore , if people shift from less productive occupations to more productive ones .
Economists , recalling that before the industrial revolution 95 % of Americans were farmers , worry far less about downsizing than ordinary people do .
Politicians , however , follow the lead of ordinary people .
Hence , to take a more frivolous example , Oregon 's ban on self - service petrol stations .
Finally , the public 's pessimism is evident in its belief that most new jobs tend to be low - paying , that our children will be worse off than we are and that society is going to hell in a variety of ways .
Economists , despite their dismal reputation , tend to be cheerier .
Politicians have to strike a balance .
They often find it useful to inflame public fears , but they have to sound confident that things will get better if they are elected .
Easier to diagnose than to cure
In short , democracy is a mess .
But dictatorship is worse .
Mr Caplan observes that Winston Churchill 's aphorism — that democracy is “ the worst form of government , except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time ” — usually cuts the conversation short .
He does not think it ought to .
To curb the majority 's tendency to impose its economic ignorance on everyone else , he suggests we rely less on government and more on private choice .
Industries do better when deregulated .
Religions thrive when disestablished .
Market failures should be tackled , of course , but always with an eye for the unintended consequences of regulation .
Mr Caplan is better at diagnosis than prescription .
His book is a treat , but he will never win elective office .
This is unreal .
You 're seeing about 2-3000 kids under 10 in the front doing intensely choreographed gymnastics moves , and look in the background .
That 's not a giant screen , that 's thousands and thousands of children holding up sets of cue cards for the routine .
I do n't know what it is , but there 's something frightening about this .
| Children 's section of ' Mass Games ' or otherwise known as the ' Arirang ' performance in Pyongyang city , North Korea in 2005 .
Watch the giant human mosaic in the background , composed of 15,000 or more individuals each holding a colored placard .
The mosaic changes with the music .
TUMOUR NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA sounds a pretty intimidating molecule .
And , indeed , it is .
One of its jobs is to kill cancer cells — or , rather , to persuade them to commit suicide .
But its name is a bit misleading .
For TNF-α , as it is known in the trade , does more than just shrink tumours .
It is one of a group of proteins called cytokines that are used by the immune system to boss other body cells around .
They do so by feeding the cells in question signals that cause them to switch particular genes on or off in response to infection .
Over the past few years , there have been hints that one of these responses is fatigue .
Moreover , TNF -α has been implicated in fatigue that is not associated with infection .
To look into this idea further , Thomas Birchler of Zurich University Hospital and his colleagues decided to study the effect of TNF-α on the biochemical clock that keeps bodies running in sync with the sun .
Their results , just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , show that this effect is profound and may help to explain the phenomenon of chronic fatigue .
The genes that control the body clock are most active in parts of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nuclei .
However , they are — like all other genes — found in almost all cells and are frequently studied in specially cultured fibroblast cells that are easy to work with .
It was on these that Dr Birchler began his investigation .
Adding TNF -α to the fibroblast system did indeed throw a spanner in the works .
Six of the clock genes were suppressed by the cytokine in ways that would , in an actual animal , be expected to promote sleep .
So , having proved the point in a Petri dish , Dr Birchler and his colleagues went on to see whether that expectation would be realised .
It was .
The same biochemical changes took place in the brains of mice , and the mice in question were far less active than untreated mice .
As a response to infection , such inactivity makes sense .
Just as fever ( which is also controlled by cytokines ) creates an environment hostile to the reproduction of bacteria and viruses , so lethargy conserves energy that can be directed to building up the immune system — an extremely demanding task .
In both cases what look at first sight to be damaging symptoms caused by an infection are actually adaptive ( though unpleasant ) responses to it .
However , even well - evolved systems can go wrong and , just as the immune system occasionally attacks the body it is supposed to be defending , causing a so - called autoimmune disease , so it looks as though the TNF -α fatigue response may sometimes appear at the wrong time .
One example of an autoimmune disease is rheumatoid arthritis .
This is often associated with fatigue , and an experiment carried out last year by Louise Pollard of King 's College , London , suggested TNF -α might be involved .
Dr Pollard injected fatigue - ridden arthritis patients with a protein that binds specifically to TNF-α , and thus reduces its concentration in the body .
Those who underwent this treatment felt less fatigued as a result .
It is also possible that TNF-α is the explanation for the scourge called chronic - fatigue syndrome .
No one knows what this actually is , nor how it is triggered .
Some researchers , though , think viral infection is involved .
That would certainly activate the immune system , encouraging TNF -α production — and enhanced levels of TNF -α have , indeed , been reported in people with chronic fatigue syndrome .
This has generally been thought of as a symptom — and as support for the infection theory of the syndrome .
But perhaps it is the cause .
If so , reducing the cytokine 's level in sufferers might bring them some relief .
July 16 , 2007  --
More than 30,000 U.S. troops are trying to tame the violence in Baghdad as part of President Bush 's troop surge .
American soldiers describe the constant stress of living in a war zone , voice their frustrations over the politics with the war strategy in Washington , and are seen as they watch an armored vehicle burn with six of their fellow troops trapped inside , in a rare and raw look at what American troops are experiencing on the front lines in Baghdad .
ABC News has an exclusive look at that campaign , a portion of which was filmed by British photographer Sean Smith of the Guardian newspaper , who was embedded with the U.S. Army 's Second Infantry Division .
( Click on the video in the player on the right to see a clip of what Smith filmed in Iraq . )
Smith spent two weeks with members of Apache Company and filmed them as they went on daily routine investigations , including one of a bomb making factory hidden in a private home .
Soon after they arrived an explosion hit and an Iraqi soldier and several neighbors , including children , were hit .
The U.S. soldiers set up a first aid station and provided medical assistance in what was a typical day for the troops .
" I challenge anybody in Congress to do my rotation , " said Spc. Michael Vassell of Apache Company .
" They do n't have to do anything , they just come hang out with me and go home at the times I go home , and come stay here 15 months with me . "
Apache Company was sent to Iraq in June 2006 for a 12 - month rotation which has since been extended to a 15 - month tour .
" It 's a joke .
We will have spent 14 months in contact , basically fighting all 14 months , " said Cpl. Joshua Lake .
" Our battalion got right to Baghdad … first week we were in Baghdad we lost two guys in our battalion … it has n't stopped since . "
' We 've Got an IED '
In another instance of Smith 's reporting , Lake 's platoon responded to a Bradley armored vehicle being hit by a roadside bomb , leaving six American soldiers and an Iraqi translator burning to death inside .
Lake and his fellow soldiers then raided a nearby house to search for the attackers .
He said on a day like that , troops are given four to six hour breaks after these kinds of grueling assignments , which leaves little time to truly calm down .
" We got grenades going off , we 've got an IED blowing up your vehicle … and then you are expected to go back in those four to six , four to five hours … and relax ! " he said .
" You just do n't have time to do it .
Your body never gets to come down , you 're always on that heightened sense of alertness . "
Two days later , Lake returned to the same neighborhood as his unit raided a house looking for weapons and insurgents .
But all they found was an old woman and her dogs ; the woman was visibly distressed .
After spending two weeks with Apache Company in Baghdad , Smith noted , " That 's what being a soldier in so - called battle situations is about .
The abnormal becomes the normal . "
The next day , U.S. soldiers spotted a suspicious car circling the block where the old woman also lives .
They ordered the driver to stop , and when he did not they opened fire .
They tried , unsuccessfully , to revive him .
A woman is seen in the video footage telling troops the victim was a taxi driver who was coming to pick her up -- he was just looking for her house .
Smith said the troops first priority is to defend themselves as some questioned their place in the war .
" The frustration is not , ' Look how difficult this is . '
The frustration is ' Look how difficult this is and what exactly for ? ' "
Smith said .
" Because we have people up there in Congress with the brain of a 2 - year - old who do n't know what they are doing -- they do n't experience it .
I challenge the president or anyone who has us for 15 months to ride alongside me , " Vassell said .
" I [ would ] do another 15 months if he comes out here and rides along with me every day for 15 months .
I 'll do 15 more months .
They do n't even have to pay me extra . "

Mr. Gupta declined to comment for this article .
Mr. Gupta is clearly proud of his friendship with the Clintons .
He once had a personal Web site — it was taken down last year — where he posted photographs of himself socializing with them .
One showed him with Mr. Clinton on a golf course , arms draped around each other and smiling ; another showed Mrs. Clinton posing with the Gupta family in Aspen .
Mr. Gupta even dedicated two school construction projects he financed in a rural part of his native India to the Clintons , naming one of them after him and the other after her .
After Mr. Clinton left office , Mr. Gupta was one of two businessmen with whom the former president agreed to enter into consulting arrangements ( the other was Ronald W. Burkle , a billionaire investor and major Democratic donor ) .
In 2002 , Mrs. Clinton began reporting her husband ’s work for infoUSA on her Senate financial disclosure forms , but she does not have to disclose his income and it is not clear what he is paid .
The shareholder lawsuit against infoUSA , brought by two Connecticut - based hedge funds , Dolphin Limited Partnership and Cardinal Capital Management , forced that information into the open .
It charges that Mr. Gupta ’s spending on the Clintons is part of a pattern of improper company expenditures for things like luxury cars , jets and houses , as well as a yacht that is notable for being one of the few to have an all - female crew .
Mr. Gupta has defended the expenses as legitimate and business - related , and he has accused the hedge funds of trying to wrest control of the company through a smear campaign .
Mr. Gupta has moved to have the lawsuit dismissed ; a decision is pending .
Representatives of Dolphin and Cardinal declined to comment .
Herbert A. Denton , president of Providence Capital , a New York hedge fund that also invested in infoUSA and had pressed for management changes , said the expenditures cited in the lawsuit were hard to defend .
“ When the C.E.O. of a publicly traded company can say with a straight face that the shareholders benefit from having a yacht with an all - female crew stationed in the Virgin Islands , then you ’ve got a problem , ” Mr. Denton said .
The lawsuit says Mr. Clinton signed a consulting agreement in April 2002 to “ provide confidential advice and counsel to the chairman and C.E.O. of the company for the purpose of strategic growth and business development . ”
InfoUSA made $ 2.1 million in quarterly payments to Mr. Clinton from July 2003 to April 2005 , and in October 2005 entered into a new three - year agreement to pay him $ 1.2 million .
It also gave him an option to buy 100,000 shares of infoUSA stock , with no expiration date .
A Word on Design Value
The other day we got a telephone call from a business man that planned to “ exponentially increase ” his Internet performance .
His budget ?
$ 1,000 .
He had an existing , custom built CMS and he wanted a complete re-design and re-build .
We met , and he explained that he would like us to “ design everything , ready to program ” .
He would then send our “ detailed plans ” to India and let a cheap team program the whole site .
Our first suggestion to go with a 50 Dollar template did n’t really satisfy him .
His naivety was refreshing and insolent at once :
He figured that he could hire a designer for a thousand Dollars to fully sketch out a CMS and eCommerce solution , and then hire a programming team in India to produce it for another $ 3,000 .
He figured that all he needed to do is invest 4,000 to make 10 Million .
Reality Check
If it were that easy to make money on the web , everyone would do it .
There is no such thing as a quick buck made out of a small buck .
There is only a small buck being lost really quickly .
For $ 1,000 you are lucky if you get 1 day of work from a professional in our field .
If you find one that can map out a full eCommerce solution in 10 hours , including wireframes and skinning , who will also agree to all the meetings , communication and administration , then you have found yourself a solid con-man or a desperate junkie that will promise you anything for his next heroine shot .
If you want something cheap and fast , chances are it wo n’t do what you want .
Whatever you get for $ 4,000 , it ’s not going to make you rich .
Quality Costs
This really is n’t about poking fun at an individual — the point we ’d like to make is that this kind of proposal is all too common in our field , and that we realize that people willing to pay for good design , or at least , those who recognize the value of it , are few and far between .
What do you think differentiates an iPod from an $ 8.50 DN - 2000 , a BMW from a Trabant , a Swan Chair from a Lund Bjov Sofa ?
The production quality ?
What is the blue print of production ?
Good products are well designed and well produced .
Quality costs good money .
Online and offline .
Losing a cell phone happens from time to time .
But losing a laptop is another thing entirely .
It kind of goes beyond absent - mindedness .
So what do you call losing 1,427 laptops in six years , as the Energy Department has done ?
In a word , unbelievable .
The Energy Department revealed the bad news to Congress on Thursday after a FOIA request filed by a D.C. news radio station brought the information to light .
The good news ?
None of the laptops had classified information on it .
And none of the employees responsible for such superhuman carelessness has been disciplined .
Huzzah !
Implementing multiple interpreters in the same address space is trivial for rubinius .
The entire thing was written to be native thread - safe and reentrant .
This came out of my experience working on sydney , which was a cleanup of 1.8.2 .
You can easily create 2 machines ( the base data structure ) and initialize them both .
They 'll remain totally independent then .
The only work to be done would be making sure both machines get their code scheduled properly .
You could even fire up 2 machine instances in different native threads and let them communicate through channels , which would give you real multiprocessor enabled ruby .
debugger
set_trace_func
I 've already implemented the basic debugging facility , which gives us full speed breakpoints .
Full speed breakpoints mean that the debugger imposes no speed penalty on the runtime for using the debugger .
I see this as a HUGE win , because the speed of ruby 's debugger has always been a gripe I hear .
I 've begun to build the higher level functionality on top of the FSB's , and eventually , I 'll probably wire it into something like ruby - debug , or at least something that feels like ruby - debug .
Technically , FSB 's work by doing bytecode replacement .
So when a breakpoint is set , the system uses it 's reflection to find the exact Compiled Method object where the breakpoint needs to be set .
It then calculates where is the bytecode the breakpoint needs to happen , and replaces the current instruction with a magic one , call yield_debugger .
When that instruction is hit , it passes control to a debugger which is attached the currently running thread .
When that method needs to continue , the old instruction is swapped back in and the instruction pointer is rewound by 1 , then reactivated .
This works really well , because the debugger simple sits idle , waiting for thread running the real code to contact it .
This also works really well because rubinius has first class method contexts .
A method contexts is the same thing as a stack frame , it describes the state of running a method .
It rubinius , you can ask the VM to hand you a method context for any state in the system .
That object can then been inspected to find out exactly what was going on at that point in time .
The simpliest way to get a method context is to call " MethodContext.current " , which returns the method context for the currently executing method .
ObjectSpace
ObjectSpace::each_object( Class ) {|x |
p x
}
We actually have n't implemented it yet .
We wont have as much trouble as jruby implementing it , because we have direct access to the memory location of objects .
Smalltalk implements this behavior mainly using a single primitive , called next_object .
When you call next_object on most any object , it returns the object right after that one .
Now , the definition of right after is implementation dependent , but usually means the object in memory right after the current one .
It should be noted this is NOT in any way guaranteed to be lossless , or accurate , and can still require some overhead to accomplish in a way that does n't baffle the developer using the interface .
It can be baffling because VM's ( rubinius included ) depend on the fact that they can rearrange objects in memory without causing any problems with the already running code .
Rubinius does this a lot actually , because one of the garbage collectors is a copy / compact collector , so young objects are constantly moving .
And when you call next_object on an object one time and it returns object B , you can never depend on the fact that it the next time you call next_object , object B will again be returned .
One of thing related to this that rubinius has recently done is decouple object_id 's from location in memory .
MRI 's object_id returns the address in memory of the object , so that later on , ObjectSpace .
_id2ref can be called with that number and return the object .
_id2ref has a really easy time of this in MRI , because it just graps the object at that location in memory .
But anyone that has used _id2ref a lot knows that sometimes you get back a totally different object than you put in .
This is because the old object has died and a new object has been allocated in the same place .
This does n't keep people from using _id2ref , but they should be aware that it does n't work the way they think it works .
Anyway , rubinius currently does not support _id2ref , because object_id's are not memory locations .
We 'll figure out some way to support it , but like jruby , it might up being pure overhead .
Continuing from Part 1 of the Rubinius interview , Part 2 now goes into some implementation details .
Ruby 1.8.x currently uses userspace threads , which means it can't make use of multiple cores because the OS only sees and schedules one thread .
Rubinius currently uses userspace threads , but Evan ponders other solutions as well : Ruby includes a simplein its standard distribution .
It 's implemented using the tracing feature .
It 's possible to use this by setting a callback that is invoked before a new line of code gets executed .
The callback is registered with themethod .
( This is also used for profiling ) .
The problem with this approach is its overhead .
The execution of every line of Ruby code now means that the tracing function is invoked and has to decide whether to suspend execution at this point or not .
There are other solutions using native extensions , like ruby - debug or the Ruby in Steel Cylon debugger .
Ruby compilers , such as Ruby .
NET , IronRuby or XRuby just generate debugging information in the target IL or bytecode , and make use of the debugging features of the respective VMs .
Rubinius recently also gained debugging support with an implementation of breakpoints that only imposes an overhead if a breakpoint is hit .
Evan explains the implementation : With the advent of Ruby implementations on managed runtimes such as the JVM and the CLR , Ruby ' sfeature has become a bit of a problem .
ObjectSpace allows access to all reachable objects in a Ruby heap , eg.prints all Class objects in the current Ruby heap .
JRuby 's Ola Bini recently wrote about the performance impact of ObjectSpace on JRuby .
Since the JVM ( or the CLR ) does n't allow to access the heap directly , it 's necessary to track every object creation and hold a list of all living objects .
Evan explains the ObjectSpace situation in rubinius :
On July 12 , 2006 Israel launched a war against Lebanon variously called " Operation Just Return " 1 , " Operation Just Reward " 2 and " Change of Direction " 3 in response to the capture of two IDF soldier by Hizbullah near Aita Shaab on the border with Israel in South Lebanon .
The consequences for Lebanon were devastating , precipitating in the course of the first few days a major humanitarian crisis and the evacuation of virtually all foreign nationals .

It ’s summertime .
It ’s hot outside .
You ’re hot .
Cooling off with an icy indulgence seems like a great idea .
But as you stuff that frozen yogurt down your gullet something decidedly unpleasant happens : the dreaded “ ice - cream headache . ”
Why is it that slurping slushies , gobbling gelato , or inhaling Italian ice can cause such wicked , intense bursts of head pain ?
A surprising number of scientific studies have looked at the cause and prevalence of the phenomena ( including at least one in which school children were asked to scarf down ice - cream in the name of scientific discovery ) .
The prevailing theory is that the ice - cream headache sensation results from cold food contacting a nerve - filled area on the roof of your mouth .
One of the nerves in this region , the “ trigeminal nerve , ” is the largest cranial nerve .
Its three branches work together to sense and communicate information between the brain and the different areas of the front of the head – including teeth , tongue , and palate .
Though it is the roof of the mouth that is exposed to the cold , the pain of fast ice - cream eating manifests itself , obviously , in the head .
There are a few theories involving the trigeminal that explain the sensation .
One has it that the pain of an ice - cream headache is an example of referred pain .
In other words , instead of feeling the consequences of the cold at the site of contact , the pain manifests itself elsewhere along the nerve pathway — usually as an intense pain in the forehead , although some people also experience pain in the temples or other parts of the head .
Another idea that is often mentioned is that the trigeminal nerve senses the cold sensation contacting the palate and – in an effort to increase blood flow to the brain and keep it warm – reacts by dilating blood vessels in the head .
It is thought that this over - zealous attempt to warm up your brain alters the blood flow , causing a pulsating headache .
Gobbling ice - cream too quickly increases the incidence of headaches , according to a 2002 study of ice - cream headaches in middle schoolers published in the British Medical Journal .
The researchers suggested that licking ice - cream slowly could help stem the wave of cold - induced pain – but not always .
Fortunately , ice - cream headaches do n’t last long – usually 10 to 30 seconds – but their pain can be breathtaking .
Some research suggests that individuals who are prone to migraines are also more susceptible to ice - cream headaches .
Interestingly , migraine and cluster headaches seem to be caused by a similar , albeit probably differently triggered , activation of the trigeminal nerve that may cause pain in other regions of the head .
This means that for those of us who have never experienced the searing pain of migraines or cluster headaches , an ice - cream headache may be as close as we get .
At least one physician has gone as far as to propose inflicting mandatory ice - cream headaches on medical students as part of the med - school curriculum .
“ I think that all physicians and physicians - in - training would benefit and should be made to experience the exquisite pain of ice - cream headache to help them understand , empathize and appreciate the urgency for sufficient prophylaxis and treatment of the pain of their cluster headache patients , ” wrote Dr. Eric Lewin Altschuler , a physician and researcher from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey , in a 2006 article for the journal Medical Hypotheses .
So far , the jury is still out on the necessity of unleashing a flurry of Dairy Queen Blizzards on unsuspecting med students .
But if your summer includes ice - cream , ice pops , iced coffee , popsicles , Creamsicles , icicles or other frigid foods , the best advice available , for now , is eat slowly .
Some speak to their diaries , like they were people
Never mind the musings of the Alastair Campbells and the Tony Benns of this world , why do so many people put pen to paper every day to record their thoughts , dreams and observations ?
Here is a selection of the diary entries you sent in .
Some names have been changed and some extracts edited .
MARIE , MIDLANDS - MAY 1993
Oh my God !
Oh my God !
I 'm pregnant after 22 years of trying !!!
Oh God , I 'm so happy !
CLARE , LONDON - 3 JANUARY 2007
Amanda back to work ( boo ! ) after three weeks of bliss without her !
Annoying me so much ... wish she 'd clear off back to Bermuda where she had such a great time !
If she complains one more time about being cold I 'll go and set fire to her desk and warm her up a bit .
I have terrible diarrhoea today , must be all the food and booze over the festive season - oh yeah and the Heinz Hot Sauce that we bought back from Egypt that I consumed a gallon of last night with our tuna steaks , hee hee .
Watched the launch of Celebrity Big Brother and had steamed tuna again ( without the hot sauce this time ) .
Paul was in a great mood tonight and we had a little dance in the living room to try out our first dance for the wedding party .
Everything is coming together with the wedding , flights , hotel and chapel all booked to Vegas - just got to lose five stone in two months - yeah right !
ANON , OXFORD - UNDATED
Yesterday felt v sad as realised my best friend ( mum ) had gone and I will never be as happy again , I have changed forever .
Also later saw a bloke in Sainsbury 's with pink flip flops on which looked great .
ANON , SALISBURY - 4 MAY 2007
CK called today , said she wanted a divorce , on what would have been our fifth wedding anniversary !!!
Whatever happened to for better or worse ???
After 11 years together , she would only talk over msn ... she never even gave me a chance and she was the one who gave up .
CHRIS BENSON , BRADFORD - 1 JULY 2007
Rachel ( my girlfriend ) had bought several plants yesterday from a church fete in Horsforth .
Today provided an ideal opportunity to tidy the garden and do some planting .
Ask my Dad and he'd tell you I 've never taken interest in gardening , but between you and me , I really enjoyed it today !
We then relaxed with a cream scone and a cup of tea , a nice reward after the 75 or so minutes work in the garden ...
Whilst watching TV this lunchtime , we saw a bit of an MGM movie on BBC Two - That 's Entertainment .
It featured an amazing tap dance routine from the movie Broadway Melody of 1940 with Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell - it has to be seen to be believed .
No camera trickery or special effects !
ANON , BASILDON , ESSEX - UNDATED
Rob dumped me I 'm gutted , he is now dating an 18 - year - old from work .
He is 35 , she does n't know his age .
Think she is a silly girl .
Friends say it wo n't last but he 's with her and I 'm not .
TRINA , UK - 9 JULY 1987
I can't remember much about today .
I went to work and spent all day copy typing .
I busted the daisy wheel on the electric typewriter and there was nothing but talk of budgets .
I rang up Chris and she said she 'd give me a spare - cost about £ 30 .
Then I rang Education and they suggested there were spare typewriters so I managed to get one .
I actually used a manual today and it was awful .
I was typing a stencil for a gestetner ink duplicator .
I thought such things were in museums .
Only to find out they also own a Banda which uses carbon paper / meths type duplication .
Real back to the ark stuff .
Even the photocopier only uses china paper , and lousy duplication it is too .
JENNY , HASTINGS - UNDATED
Despite the unease I feel when trains derail on the Central Line and London stations are swarming with police because of the risk of terrorist attacks , I can't help wondering - is it possible to find love on the Underground ?
When I got on the Tube I picked up a grimy newspaper and flicked through the pages .
That was when I spotted the personal column .
Now I do n't go out of my way to read personals and when I do it is purely for entertainment .
But as I scanned the ads I secretly hoped I would read one about me .
" To the girl in the bowler hat and wellies who got on at Edgware Road - you were lovely . "
There was nothing .
But there was one that made me laugh .
" To the gorgeous brunette who smiled at me outside Waterloo station and then tripped up , are you single ? "
As I eased my way towards the exit my foot caught on a man 's shoe and I stumbled .
Embarrassed , I looked up and not being able to help myself , smiled .
He was very handsome .
And he smiled back .
Was there some strange fatalistic conspiracy going on to trip people up and make them fall in love ?
Anyway , I got off the train and headed for the exit making a mental note to myself to scour the personal ads religiously for the next week .
ANON , LEICESTERSHIRE , 12 JULY 2004
Brixham .
Surprisingly wide variety and number of pubs including a Wetherspoon ( hallelujah ! ) .
On leaving Brixham the port engine was thought to have blown a gasket but on further inspection & TLC from Bigs , it was found to be only a broken water pipe dripping on the engine .
Helm 7-10:30 .
Increased the entertainment factor by giving fishing floats an unnecessarily wide birth .
On telling the Boss that I was to do the pilotage into Penzance he replied " Oh god no ! " I am beginning to think he may not have complete confidence in me .
GIN - HUEY YANG , TAIWAN - 14 NOVEMBER 2005
Starting a new diary book .
Wonder where I will be when this one ends ?
Gin-Huey Yang , age 22 , starting this diary on 14 Nov 2005 at NTU ( National Taiwan University ) dorm 4 , room 119 .
Her feelings now , partly dreadful .
Going to have International Political Economics exam on Wednesday , the day after tomorrow .
And still do n't feel like studying it .
Partly because I can't understand what the heck it is talking about .
Never learned that part in economics .
Never is interested , either .
I 've been thinking all the time , what in the world am I interested in ?
Everyone seems to have something .
But me ?
Hmm .
Well , I like to read .
That counts , does n't it ?
What else am I interested in ?
I would like to try in - line skating , dancing , sign language ... but I need chances .
Keep it up Gin-Huey , keep it up .
ANON , LEEDS - UNDATED
On the train this morning , one of those stupid people who put their bags on the adjacent seat because on a packed train no - one would want to sit down , would they ?
When I politely asked the gentleman if I could sit down I got a look as if to say that I was personally responsible for the invasion of Poland .
Miserable so - and - so , I hope he eats something unpleasant and has the trots for a couple of days .
ANON , UK - UNDATED
I 've told Ben I want to move out .
The reason is petty , but also I think justifiable - his mother so much wanted to have her say one day when she came round that she barged in on me in bed .
He did n't stop her .
That was just the last straw .
I 'm very protective of my privacy , and I have a right to be .
Ben took the news pretty well and I 'm just really relieved now I 've told him .
I 'm looking forward to getting my own little flat and getting the internet and having my own say around the home .
I want her out of my life , and I want my relationship with Ben to go back to being fun .
It turns out it can't be serious , there 's just not enough there .
But I do think we 'll get on a lot better if we accept that .
And also , it gives us the freedom to perhaps find something that does suit us better .
There are a couple of people at work I might have feelings for .
Fickle , I know , and I would n't say anything while I 'm in a relationship , but we 'll see .
NAOMI KITT , WORKSOP , UK - UNDATED
The following is an extract from a diary I kept of my experiences while suffering from depression .
The next couple of weeks were a bit of a blur - clumsy +++ memory - atrocious !!
Spaced out feeling coming and going , almost like ' fugue states ' .
Though , at times I felt like a fraud ...
Am I really ill enough to be off work ?
I do n't really feel like there is anything wrong with me ... am I just making ( pathetic ) excuses for myself ?
I tried to keep myself busy - walks into town , bits of housework - though I often came across half - finished jobs I had forgotten I 'd started !
All the while feeling that spaced out unreal kind of feeling .
Then came the train journey .
ANON , WALES - UNDATED
I met the love of my life tonight .
Big statement I know , but I have fallen head over heels for him .
The stars never shone so bright !
PAUL FAIRCHILD , HIGH WYCOMBE - 9 APRIL 2001
Failed my driving test for the third time today !
Absolutely gutted .
The driving instructor was wearing some 1950s fluorescent jacket , put me right off !
Got a D for dangerous so it 's not all bad - makes for a good story .
Parents were n't happy - they say I do n't listen and now I 've got to pay for the next exam myself ... rubbish !
ANONYMOUS GIRL , LINCOLN - 5 APRIL 2005
We set off for Skye again for another boat trip .
The sun was out , but grey clouds loomed over our destination .
There were about 20 passengers on the small boat .
We were dressed like we were about to spend a week trekking in the Antarctic !
We saw at least 100 white seals lolling on the rocks , waving their flippers and preening themselves and looking at us with their round brown puppy - dog eyes ...
Dad led us a spectacularly squelchy route across the bogs - and the rest of the walkers followed !
I sunk up to my ankles .
The wind rose .
It threatened to whip our crisps away and the hats off our heads .
I accidentally spilt coffee on Mum .
Then it started to rain .
It suddenly was n't quite so fun .
Then began a wild journey back across the waves .
ANON , LONDON - 11 APRIL
We met by the river , just in front of the Eye , and it was good to see him again .
We did n't have much of a plan for the day so we wandered across the river and up to Oxford Street .
After that we were n't really sure what to do .
We were going to have some lunch and we were just thinking about where to eat when we came across Hyde Park .
I saw the park and I knew what would happen if we lay down together there , and I wanted it ; somehow I knew he wanted it too .
It was warm and sunny , unseasonably so , and we stretched out side by side on the dappled grass .
We talked and talked , and I made a really long daisy chain , which he picked the daisies for .
Whenever he handed me one , our fingers would sort of linger .
What happened next felt like a dream , because it was so silent and serene .
My hand was on his hand - we were n't holding hands then , just my fingers resting on his palm .
Then , and it was completely quiet , neither of us said anything , we just stroked each others ' hands and fingers ; I ran my hand up and down his arm very gently ; I could hardly breathe .
I could feel his fingertips trace my palm , and I ran my hand up his arm and across his chest , and then back , slowly .
My head was right next to his and I touched his hair .
I giggled a little , and then I kissed his cheek .
He turned his head gently over and I kissed his lips .
My first kiss , and it could n't have been more special .
“ Right now , the focus is almost entirely on improving the user experience , ” Mr. Lanzone said .
“ This is the product that , to date , we are the most proud of .
It is going to have a huge impact for people who use Ask . ”
For his part , Mr. Diller said AskCity was a demonstration of Ask ’s role in helping tie together the disparate properties owned by IAC .
AskCity is “ a really good service that is dependent on the information from all these IAC sites , which is the raison d’être of the company itself , ” Mr. Diller said , adding that over time , other IAC entities , which include HSN , LendingTree.com , Evite and Match.com , will be more tightly integrated with Ask .
Accounting for 5.8 percent of all the searches in the United States in October , Ask has edged out AOL to become the fourth most popular search engine , according to comScore Media Metrix .
By comparison , Google had 45.4 percent of all searches , Yahoo 28.2 percent and Microsoft 11.7 percent .
Data from Nielsen NetRatings , which measures only searches on Ask.com , not on related sites in the Ask network , shows that Ask ’s use grew 25 percent in October from a year earlier , the second highest rate of growth among the major search engines , after Yahoo .
The turnaround of Ask began long before Mr. Diller acquired the company .
After the collapse of the dot - com bubble , shares of Ask Jeeves dropped below $ 1 and the company was close to extinction .
But in 2001 , it sowed the seeds of its rebirth when it spent about $ 4 million to acquire Teoma Technologies , a small company in New Jersey that had developed well - regarded search technology .
A year later , Ask Jeeves got a lifeline from Google , which cut a deal to place ads next to Ask Jeeves search results .
News Digital Media 's CareerOne online employment website has launched an internal investigation into how confidential client information accidentally become publicly accessible on the internet .
The material is part of CareerOne 's customer relationship management database , described by the company as " old client information " .
The details include comments about clients made by CareerOne account executives , some of which are highly unflattering .
In one case , a client is referred to as a " retard " and in another a client is called a " lazy good for nothing " .
Every file on the master page shows the " last modified " time and date as being at " 00:45:52 GMT " on Monday , May 28 , 2007 , suggesting that they have appeared in this visible state for almost a month .
CareerOne was not aware of the security breach until this morning when they were informed .
The web page was subsequently taken down .
CareerOne said the investigation would determine how the material was exposed and who accessed it .
" The company immediately removed a URL that exposed old client information today , '' a spokesperson said in a statement .
" We take security and privacy issues extremely seriously and are currently reviewing our practices as a matter of urgency . ''
The statement said the company " will not tolerate comments made by the account executives responsible and apologises for any offence or embarrassment that this may have inadvertently caused '' .
None of the exposed details were from individual job seekers .
They all related to organisations seeking to hire employees .
Although clearly unintentional , the bungle almost certainly breaches the Commonwealth 's National Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act 1988 which relates to the handling of personal information .
NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - India , struggling to promote greater condom use among its population , is looking to hire its own “ condom man ” to follow the example of a former Thai cabinet minister who successfully pushed for safer sex , the Times of India reported .
National AIDS Control Organization ( NACO ) chief Sujatha Rao said that India needed to find someone like Mechai Viravaidya , famous for getting Thais to talk about sex , condoms and AIDS .
“ We are serious about finding India ’s very own Mr Condom , ” Rao was quoted as saying after visiting Thailand to study its dramatic increase in condom use over the past decade , which contributed to a sharp fall in new HIV infections .
“ He has to feel passionately about the cause as Mechai does ... have a dynamic personality to change both government policy and public perceptions about HIV / AIDS , sex and condoms , ” Rao said .
Viravaidya became famous in Thailand as the “ Condom King ” for actions such as taking condoms to World Bank talks as well as for the name of his Bangkok restaurant “ Cabbages and Condoms , ” where condoms are a major part of the decor .
Authorities in India , where many people are hesitant to talk about sex and condoms openly , are trying to push condom use through television , radio and newspapers and by targeting high - risk groups .
India has millions of people who are HIV - positive and many of them face discrimination and prejudice .
In Thailand , Viravaidya ’s organization -- the Population and Community Development Association of Thailand -- won the $ 1 - million Gates Award for Global Health this year that is awarded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
TV Solidarity
On September 14 , 1985 , residents of the Polish city of Toruń watching the popular James Bond ripoff 07 , Call In ( in which a blond and ideologically correct Citizen 's Militia officer fights crime from within a series of tight sweaters ) were surprised to see the show briefly overlaid with block white letters reading " Solidarity Toruń : Boycotting the election is our duty , " and " Solidarity Toruń : Enough price hikes , lies , repression " .
Twelve days later , the same slogans appeared superimposed on the hated evening news .
The dissident radio astronomers had struck again .
You can see a recreation of the broadcast ( and experience the exciting production values of advanced socialism ) in this brief YouTube video .
The doctored images could only be seen over a small area of central Toruń , but they caused a sensation .
The police caught the perpetrators after the second screening .
Jan Hanasz , Zygmunt Turło , Leszek Zaleski and Piotr Łukaszewski served four months in jail for the stunt .
This photograph , taken from the police file on the exploit , shows the homemade transmitter they to commit their heinous crime :
While looking for a key to the numbered items in the photo , I learned that the apparatus had been built by a Professor Eugeniusz Pazderski , who is still alive and well and teaching at the University of Toruń .
I sent Professor Pazderski a brief email asking for technical details about the transmitter , and in response received a most wonderful letter , which Prof.
Pazderski has graciously allowed me to translate and publish in full .
So right under our nose we had a television with an externally exposed synchronization signal .
When we found out about the underground Solidarity radio broadcasts during martial law , we figured why just do radio , why not do television ?
We could n't broadcast on our own frequency , because for one thing you needed an audience , and for another it would have required a lot of power , which is hard to conceal .
We had to broadcast on the same frequency as official programs and ensure ourselves a large number of viewers by piggybacking on popular films or series , overlaying our own texts over the official images .
To do this with a low power transmitter and have good range we could n't emit a complex video signal , but only pixels of text at appropriately calculated time intervals relative to the vertical and horizontal synchronization signals .
We discussed such a solution at the Astronomical Observatory in Piwnice ( more precisely in the Department of Radioastronomy ) , essentially just three people , Bogdan Wikierski , Andrzej Kępa and me .
At a certain moment Jan Hanasz came to see me and asked whether I would be able to build such a device .
I replied that I could make a transmitter , but that I would have problems building the digital interface , since the only ZX Spectrum available to me in the department was occupied day and night by colleagues ( more for fun than for work ) , so I would n't be able to conceal my particular interest in that computer .
Back then I was n't very expert at digital devices either , so I preferred that someone else do it .
I only worked on the transmitter at night , when there was no one else in the observatory building .
It consisted of a carrier signal generator ( around 50 MHz , channel 1 of Polish television ) , as well as a multistage class D amplifier .
When in use the transmitter would only connect to the amplifier when the driving signal from the digital interface was in the 1 state .
I had serious problems tuning the amplifier , since I did not have an artificial load with a dissipative power over 5 W .
The one I used would overheat badly , so I had to tune very quickly in order not to destroy it - it was the only one in the observatory and I would have trouble if it were damaged .
Haste dictated that I tune the amplifier with the lid open , which did not serve my health .
In any case I achieved an output power of 7 W , which I estimated would allow for the signal to reach Toruń and environs .
Jan Hanasz would sometimes stop by , which made me suspect that someone else was working on the digital component at the same time .
Knowing the capabilities of my colleagues as well as certain social ties I suspected it was Zygmunt Turło , but I never discussed the subject with Jan .
I would just pass along certain suggestions , for example that the text on the screen should continuously change position , so that a clever policeman would not be able to calculate where the transmitter was by triangulating the signal1 .
At a certain moment everything was ready , I gave Jan the transmitter and considered the matter finished .
The stress that came from the risk of detection went away .
Some time later I happened to hear people talking about how text had appeared on TV screens in Toruń .
Unfortunately I did n't see it myself .
I had left on a month - long official trip to the observatory in Holland , where for 250 guldens ( all my spending money ) I bought myself a ZX Spectrum so that I could have my own computer for any eventual further underground work .
Some time later one of the Dutch radio astronomers , a friend of mine , was supposed to visit Poland .
I was in charge of organizing his visit , so I went one day to see my fellow astronomers in Torun to pass along the date and topic of our Dutch guest 's seminar .
One of the people I visited was Jan Hanasz .
As I was walking out of his office , some girl looking at an Art Department exhibit on the same floor as the astronomy offices took my picture .
This was a little puzzling but it did n't make me uneasy ; after all , who understands artists !
That same evening right after 8:00 PM I saw the Solidarity TV logo on my own television screen .
I was bursting with pride , but I also felt very uneasy .
And with good reason , since around midnight four plainclothesmen and a uniformed policeman knocked on my door .
They spent several hours ransacking my apartment - doing it so quietly that neither my wife or my kids woke up .
They found cassettes with ZX Spectrum programs on them and underground publications , they also took my computer .
In the end they made me wake up my wife to find out what she had in her sofabed .
My dear late wife behaved very courageously , no panic , she asked for her dressing gown , got off the sofabed and then only watched as the sad men led her husband off to who knows where .
I spent about 40 hours under arrest in my precinct in the company of a bandit who had robbed priests in their parishes and an activist from the Union of Socialist Youth who had stolen pornographic video tapes from the cultural center2 .
Every once in a while they would call me in for interrogation , asking about underground television and radio as well as about my colleagues from the observatory ( I did n't know that they had been arrested ) .
I did not admit to anything , I said that I barely knew my colleagues because I lived in Piwnice , 12 km north of Toruń , while they lived far away in the center of the city .
After the Security Service was done interrogating me a man from military intelligence took over , trying to get me to collaborate .
I did n't show any enthusiasm ; gently but firmly I refused .
Finally after two days they let me go .
I returned home to the great joy of my wife .
During my absence , Mr. Antoni Stawikowski visited my wife ; he was an astronomer and regional leader of Solidarity in Toruń .
He handed her 5000 zl3 and told her where I was as well as which lawyer she should turn to .
To this day I do n't know how to give him back that money !
It turned out not to be necessary after all !
After several months my colleagues under arrest regained their freedom .
Not long afterwards Jan Hanasz reached me again .
I had prepared additional documentation on the transmitter for him in hopes of starting mass production of the transmitters .
He had gotten his hands on an artificial 50 W load for me as well as transistors of comparable power .
I started building a prototype of a new transmitter that could reach the entire district ( Jan Hanasz has it now ) with a tunable carrier wave generator so that it could be used anywhere in Poland or neighboring countries .
The Round Table talks [ in 1988 ] made me stop work on this , but I kept my activities a secret for five more years , just in case .
During the last years of the previous regime I also thought up an undetectable radio communication scheme for Solidarity .
By that point I could write assembler and build computer interfaces in my sleep , so the number of people required for these kinds of undertakings would have been very limited .
It was supposed to be just a couple of words , but it came out pretty long .
You 'll find documentation on the web pages mentioned above .
Wishing you happiness across the ocean ,

Seven children were born in Algeria on April , 18 in Boumerdes region by 27 - year old woman .
Six girls and one boy appeared by Cesarean operation in the hospital of capital city of Algeria .
Sadly , the boy did n't survive and the rest six children needed medical supervision .
Newborn children are in good condition .
The leightest of the children weighs about 1.5 lb ( 700 g ) and the biggest - about 3 lb ( 1400g ) , Al - Khbar newspaper reported .
It was the first pregnancy of 27 year old woman .
The last three months before the children births she had to spend in the hospital .
It became known that woman undergone fertility treatment for six months before and got pregnant on the fifth year of her marriage .
This is not a single event of multiple birth in the history .
There have been several cases of septuplets ( 7 children ) , octuplets ( 8 children ) , and even nonuplets ( 9 children ) recorded , however , in most of the situations multiple conceptions were result of fertility treatment .
There were around 7 cases of nonuplets and none of the children survived .
The world record was set in Italy , July 22 1971 , when woman was pregnant with quindecaplets ( 15 children ) : 10 girls and 5 boys and again due to fertility drugs .
Although , all fetuses had to be extracted from mother 's womb for health concerns .
The highest number of children conceived naturally without fertility drugs were 12 fetuses but in this case Argentinian woman lost the pregnancy .

The easy way to get smart ?
The Department of Health has asked the Academy of Medical Sciences to assess these so - called " cognition enhancing " drugs , some of which are already being widely used in the US .
In the 1960s the self styled guru , Dr Timothy Leary , urged American youth to " tune in , turn on and drop out " .
Now a new generation of so - called designer drugs are becoming available .
But instead of fuelling a new drop - out culture , they are being used by people who think they will help them do better at school and work .
One of these drugs , Modafinil , was developed to treat people who involuntarily fall asleep .
Dramatic effect
Dr Danielle Turner , of the Department of Clinical Neurosciences at Cambridge University , tested the drug out on 60 healthy volunteers .
If , in the future , there are cognition tablets for exams and I was n't happy for my children to take them , would I be disadvantaging them against those children that actually take them ?
Respondent to Academy of Medical Sciences study
It did not just keep them awake .
She found that the effects on their brains were much more dramatic .
" We tested them two hours after they had taken a single dose of Modafinil and found quite strong improvements in performance , particularly when things got difficult , " she said .
" That was interesting - as problems got harder , their performance seemed to improve .
With Modafinil they seemed to think a bit longer and they were more accurate . "
Bjorn Stenger was one of the volunteers in Dr Turner 's study .
He told us how the drug affected him .
" During the test I felt very alert and I could focus very well on the problems at hand .
" I had no problems memorising rows of numbers .
I felt pretty much that I was on top of my game . "
Student use
Modafinil is in common use in the US , officially for treating sleeping disorders .
In the future do you want one of those dictatorial type states where we have to take drugs to get better and faster to work longer hours ?
Respondent to Academy of Medical Sciences study
But according to internet chat rooms , it is also widely used by students and busy professionals to give their brains a boost .
The drug is among a new class of cognition enhancing drugs .
Professor Gary Lynch , from the University of California , Irvine , helped invent another class called Ampakines .
Professor Lynch designed them specifically to increase memory and cognition .
And he claims that animal experiments suggest that the drug enables the brain to rewire itself or make neural connections between different regions that normally people cannot make .
This rewiring , he claims , may enable people to " build thoughts that are a little bit beyond the normal brain " .
So what thoughts are these ?
" One would hope that what we are seeing with the Einsteins and Leonardos is that perhaps they are able to get into a space that we think of genius , " he said .
But is the public ready for " genius pills " ?
Potential impact
The UK Government is sufficiently concerned about them to have asked an expert group to assess their impact on medicine and their potential social impact .
The Academy of Medical Sciences expert group has held workshops across Britain to find out the public 's views .
It found some real concerns - quite apart from the long - term adverse health impact - these drugs could have .
One woman commented : " If , in the future , there are cognition tablets for exams and I was n't happy for my children to take them , would I be disadvantaging them against those children that actually take them ? "
Another comment was : " Who knows where we are going ?
In the future do you want one of those dictatorial type states where we have to take drugs to get better and faster to work longer hours ?
The Academy 's report is due out later this year .
It is to help government assess whether or not these new drugs could - or even should - be used to enhance people 's abilities .
Or do they pose a new and dangerous hazard to our society ?

Deal With It
Last week I linked to Tantek Çelik ’s “ Three Hypotheses of Human Interface Design ” , which I described as an “ excellent analysis … regarding what makes software feel easier and more fun to use . ”
Some of the feedback I got from DF readers on Çelik ’s essay was negative , but the complaints were mostly about the way it was written , couched in a sort of academic - ese ( e.g. : “ The inverse geometric relationship results from the compounding of two asserted inverse linear relationships ” ) .
But do n’t let those dashes of formality turn you off ; I ’m convinced that Çelik ’s premises are insightful and very important .
Çelik writes :
More specifically , all other things being equal , the cognitive load required to complete an action or task in a human computer interface is directly ( probably linearly ) proportional to the number of clicks and keystrokes required to complete that action or task .
Cognitive load can be roughly defined as “ how mentally easy / hard it feels to do something ” .
Example : instant messaging someone vs. emailing them .
To instant message ( IM ) someone , you merely : switch to your IM client double click their name type your message press return Four steps .
Only three if you were already “ in ” your IM client .
Not counting typing the message itself of course which is the “ content ” you wanted to communicate anyway brings it down to only two steps .
Thus only two gestures of user interface overhead .
To email someone , you have to : switch to your email client choose “ New / Compose Message ” from the interface type the recipient ’s name ( autocomplete in most email programs typically helps to reduce this to 3 - 4 keystrokes ) type tab or return to go to the next field ( typically another to or cc field ) type tab or return again to go to the subject field think up a subject ( or ideally skip it ) type a subject ( or ideally skip it ) type tab or return again to go to the message body field type in your message click send Ideally , assuming no subject ( which is atypical ) , and only typing 3 letters to autocomplete the recipients name , this comes to a total of TEN steps , more than 3 × as much interface overhead as using instant messaging .
I assert that this is why sending email feels so much more heavyweight than instant messaging someone .
This example hit home for me , because I ’ve caught myself doing this many times — sending something via AIM that deserved to be sent via email .
However , I suggest measuring things differently than Çelik does .
For one thing , once you ’re already typing , additional keystrokes within the same text field do n’t matter much .
Çelik ’s technique is to count the actions , or , if you will , the verbs .
But I suspect it ’s the nouns that add the most to the cognitive load .
For example , hitting the Tab key to switch to a new field does n’t add to the load .
It ’s the field itself that counts .
I would enumerate Çelik ’s examples like this .
Sending an IM :
Double - click name in buddy list .
Type message in chat window text field .
Sending an email :
Create a new message window .
Type name in the To field .
Skip the CC field .
Type subject in the Subject field .
Type message .
Send the message .
My counting methodology can be reduced to the form “ Deal with some specific user interface element ” .
For IM :
Deal with the buddy list .
Deal with the text field in the new chat window .
For email :
Deal with creating a new message window .
Deal with the To field .
Deal with the CC field .
Deal with the Subject field .
Deal with the message content text box .
Deal with sending the message and closing the message window .
I do n’t count sending the IM as a step because it does n’t feel like you have to deal with anything .
You just whack the Return key after typing your message .
Eventually , yes , you will have to deal with the chat window ( or tab ) you ’ve created , but you do n’t have to deal with it before you send the message .
( And in fact , in most cases , your expectation is that you ’ll soon get a response in that window . )
Whereas with an email message , you must click a Send button or invoke a command - key sequence , either of which feels like a separate item to deal with .
Any rule of thumb is inherently inexact .
Not all of these steps are equally weighted .
Step # 3 in sending an email — skipping past the CC field — carries far less cognitive load than entering a message subject .
But it does carry some load , even if you ’re just hitting Tab to skip it .
Imagine if there were five CC fields to skip in every message window .
Or 100 .
It ’s a little tiny thing , but it is not nothing .
The same goes for the Subject field in a reply — you do n’t have to think of and type a new subject , but you still have to deal with skipping past the field on your way to the message body .
This technique serves as a perfect explanation for why I despise entering events in iCal :
My typical usage :
Double - click on the date of the event in month view .
Type the event name .
Tab past Location .
Tab past “ all - day ” checkbox .
Tab past Month .
Tab past Day .
Tab past Year .
Enter the hour .
Enter the minutes .
Swap the AM / PM .
Some of these steps are variable .
If you use the mouse instead of the keyboard , you do n’t have to “ Tab past ” fields , but you do have to click on very small targets .
And if the event starts on an even hour and the AM / PM field is already correct , you can stop at # 8 .
Compare and contrast to the event entry UI for the calendar feature in 37signals ’s Backpack :
My typical usage :
Double - click on the date of the event in month view .
Type the time and name of the event .
You do n’t have to deal with the Add Event button because you can just hit the Return key when you ’re finished entering the time and name of the event , much like sending an IM .
This is not about “ easy ” vs. “ hard ” , which are clumsy , imprecise words for describing a user interface .
Easy what ?
Easy to learn ?
Easy to understand ?
Easy to remember how to use ?
Easy meaning “ simple ” ?
There ’s nothing complex or confusing about iCal ’s event entry UI .
And with specific fields for each item of data , it is more obvious than Backpack ’s — but only for a first - time user , which is the wrong case to optimize for .
But to me iCal ’s date entry UI is clearly worse , much worse , and the reason why can be expressed by the fact that it forces you to deal with about 10 user interface elements , versus just 2 for Backpack .
If you only count mouse clicks and key presses , however , you might arrive at a similar count for each UI .
To enter an event named “ Breakfast ” starting at 9:30 am in iCal , it requires 21 keystrokes and a double - click :
Double - click on date .
Type “ Breakfast ” , Tab 6 times , “ 9 ” , Tab , “ 30 ” , Tab , “ a ” .
In Backpack , it requires 16 keystrokes and a double - click :
Double - click on date .
Type “ 9:30 a Breakfast ” , Return .
Compared this way , by simply counting keystrokes and mouse clicks , it does n’t look like much of a difference at all , which is terribly misleading .
I ’m annoyed every single time I enter a date in iCal ; I actually enjoy entering them in Backpack .
It ’s as palpable as the difference between going uphill and downhill .
Counting the user interface elements you have to deal with produces a comparison that reflects the actual appeal of the two designs .
Two of the most trusted names in the Media CLASH in a battle you wont want to miss .
" So in the Defense bill that gave the troops a 3.5 percent pay increase , a pay increase because there is such a gap , such a disparity between the private sector and our servicemen and women and their salaries .
When they join the military , they are not trying to make a lot of money .
But the fact is that those privates who are making $ 17,000 a year , those privates that are leaving their wives and kids at home , many of whom have to survive on food stamps , those privates who saw what we did in the Defense bill , who said that is great , 3.5 percent pay increase , a couple hundred dollars a year .
The President of the United States said , " Private , thank you for your service to your country , but that is too much of a pay increase . '
" I hope the people at home are watching .
The President of the United States said a couple hundred dollars more a year to a private making $ 17,000 a year is too much .
" How do the soldiers feel that are running convoys up and down Ambush Alley , scouting on the streets for roadside bombs and looking for snipers on rooftops , when they hear their President back at home , the President of the United States thinks a couple hundred dollars more a year is too much .
The President says , hey , it would add up over the next 5 years , $ 7.3 billion ; that is a lot of money . "
I would ask how George W. Bush sleeps at night but , knowing that he's not much of a deep thinker and does n't possess much in the way of conscience , I would bet he sleeps more soundly than Rush Limbaugh on an Oxycontin bender .
The latest bit of reality - defying hypocrisy from Bush comes in the form of a speech he gave yesterday morning , in which he bashed Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) and Senate Democrats for yanking the Defense Authorization bill from consideration -- after Republicans filibustered yet another Iraq vote -- and implied that Democrats are against a military pay raise .
" It is time to rise above partisanship , stand behind our troops in the field , and give them everything they need to succeed , " said Bush .
" Even members of Congress who no longer support our effort in Iraq should at least be able to provide an increase in pay for our troops fighting there .
" What Bush leaves out , of course , is that just a couple of months ago , he threatened to veto a House defense spending bill over a 3.5 percent pay increase for the troops .
The Democratic - sponsored increase was more than Bush had asked for and the administration called the additional pay hike for the troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan " unnecessary .
" Oh , and they also did n’t like the radical proposal calling for a $ 40 - per- month increase in the death benefit for surviving spouses of military war dead .
Representative Patrick Murphy ( D - PA ) , an Iraq war Veteran , blasted Bush on the House floor on May 22 when the veto threat was issued : Murphy also pointed out how Bush has a problem with a drop - in - the - bucket raise for the troops he claims to love so much but no such concern about billions in waste and fraud with America 's military contractors .
"
The same standard that the President uses where he says it is too much for the troops , it is not too much for the contractors who have proven that they mismanage over $ 9 billion of our hard - earned money , the contractors who do n't want any accountability and do n't want to see the light of day , " said Murphy , in May .
And Reid responded rapidly yesterday to Bush implying that Congress does n’t support a pay raise for the troops when it was the White House that said they “ strongly oppose ” the 3.5 percent raise for 2008 and any future increases in military pay .
“ Democrats and a majority of Americans believe that supporting the troops means rebuilding our overburdened military and redeploying our troops from an Iraqi civil war , " said Senator Reid on Friday .
" It is the height of hypocrisy for a President whose Administration has sent our brave men and women into combat without the proper equipment , recuperation time , training or strategy for success to lecture Congress about supporting the troops . "
“ If our military ’s wellbeing were truly a priority for this President , as he indicated this morning , why has his Administration for the past several months opposed military pay raises as too costly and blocked everything we have done to support the troops ?
I hope , but highly doubt , that President Bush will one day realize that supporting our troops is more than a slogan or a photo op .
” Amazingly , George W. Bush and Congressional Republicans continue to think they can fool Americans into believing it is they , and not Democrats , who truly support the troops despite documented hypocrisy like this and the fact that just 10 days ago , Senate GOP leaders killed a Democratic bill that would have protected the troops by mandating longer downtime at home between combat deployments .
They can keep trying , but the pool of people dumb enough to believe their lies gets smaller every day .

My first design job was with a small print design agency in Manchester that produced work in varying media : packaging , publications , and marketing support materials , and …direct mail .
Article Continues Below
I soon discovered that the graphic design principles I ’d learned in college were of little use when I designed for direct mail , where big , bold , and crowded is the order of the day .
In the words of one client — words I will never forget — “ whitespace is empty space . ”
Direct - mail clients need their packages to look down - market , because it works for them .
But for just about everything else , my client could n’t have been further from the truth .
Meet whitespace #section2
“ Whitespace , ” or “ negative space ” is the space between elements in a composition .
More specifically , the space between major elements in a composition is “ macro whitespace . ”
Micro whitespace , is — yes , you ’ve guessed it — the space between smaller elements : between list items , between a caption and an image , or between words and letters .
The itty - bitty stuff .
So what does whitespace do ?
Micro whitespace and legibility # section3
A couple of months ago , I was lucky enough to see Erik Spiekermann give a lecture .
Part of his talk addressed his redesign of The Economist newspaper , which was partly motivated by the client ’s realization that their design was too heavy and the content too difficult to read .
Macro whitespace & Micro whitespace
In newspaper design , information is dense .
Sometimes , as in web design , it ’s difficult to add whitespace because of content requirements .
Newspapers often deal with this by setting their body content in a light typeface with plenty of whitespace within and around the characters .
This was part of Spiekermann ’s solution for the redesign of The Economist .
Whilst retaining the quirkiness of the original Economist typeface , Spiekermann redesigned it slightly , adding more whitespace to the individual characters .
He then set the type slightly smaller and with more leading .
All these changes added micro whitespace to the design .
The overall result was subtle : the content was more legible and the overall feeling of the newspaper was lighter , yet the amount of content remained the same .
Though Spiekermann also added macro whitespace and color to The Economist his successful type redesign demonstrates that the space between the itty - bitty stuff can have a big impact on the effectiveness of a design — and this applies to design for the web as well .
Brand positioning #section4
Designers use whitespace to create a feeling of sophistication and elegance for upscale brands .
Coupled with a sensitive use of typography and photography , generous whitespace is seen all over luxury markets .
Cosmetics , for example , use extensive whitespace in their marketing material to tell the reader that they are sophisticated , high quality , and generally expensive .
My old direct - mail client was correct in his assessment of whitespace for his particular product , because direct - mail packages need to appear down - market to work — and adding whitespace to his design would have lent his package an undesirably upscale quality .
Take the following example .
Figure 3 . Examples of direct mail vs. luxury brand design
The content is the same on both designs , as are the other elements , such as photography .
Yet the two designs stand at opposite ends of the brand spectrum .
Less whitespace = cheap ; more whitespace = luxury .
A lot more goes into brand positioning than just whitespace , but as a brief lands on your desk for a luxury brand , it ’s very likely that the client — and their target audience — expects whitespace and plenty of it to align the product with its competitors .
Active and passive whitespace #section5
Whitespace is often used to create a balanced , harmonious layout .
One that just “ feels ” right .
It can also take the reader on a journey through the design in the same way a photographer leaves “ looking room ” in a portrait shot by positioning the subject off the center of the frame and having them looking into the remaining space .
When whitespace is used to lead a reader from one element to another , it ’s called “ active whitespace . ”
Let ’s take the following example before any active whitespace is applied :
Figure 4 .
Text before whitespace is added
Everything is pretty cramped .
We need to add whitespace to create harmony and visual comfort in the design .
First , I add margins , change the type family and weight , and also increase the leading ( or line - height , as it ’s known in CSS ) .
This is all “ passive whitespace . ”
Figure 5 .
Text with passive whitespace added
Some might argue that passive whitespace is the unconsidered space present within a composition .
I disagree : if you do n’t consider all your whitespace , that ’s just bad design .
Passive whitespace creates breathing room and balance .
It ’s important .
We ’re not done yet , though .
Within this content is something that I want the reader to pay extra attention to : the second quote .
I could highlight this element with a different color or make the type size larger , but in this instance , I ’ve simply added macro whitespace around the element to draw the user ’s eye , then reduced the micro whitespace within the type by making it bold .
Figure 6 .
After active whitespace has been added
This is active whitespace — whitespace added to a composition to better emphasize or structure , information .
The only way to come to grips with a concept as subjective as whitespace is to practice .
In the same way martial artists have to spend hours upon hours drilling simple techniques , graphic designers have to do the same .
Compositional exercises have been conducted by graphic design students for decades and , luckily for us , some of the design legends of past years have documented the process .
Emil Ruder is one of my favorites .
Ruder was a Swiss typographer who died in 1970 .
After 21 years of teaching typography , he produced a book called Typography : A Design Manual , in which he states :
The book is deliberately restricted to pure typography , to working with prefabricated types which are subordinated to a precise system of measurements .
Its purpose is to make apparent the laws of typography and — in spite of certain common features — the contrast between it and graphic design which in both the selection and means of their application , is freer and more complex .
Ruder ’s teachings are fairly black and white , with a focus on typography and the subtlety of designing with letterforms .
Ruder takes you through the rights and wrongs , which is a great place to start learning the fundamental principles of composition .
The book is chock - a- block with great exercises covering whitespace and other compositional devices .
It ’s expensive , but well worth the price .
Once you know how to design and manipulate the space outside , inside , and around your content , you ’ll be able to give your readers a head start , position products more precisely , and perhaps even begin to see your own content in a new light .

先日、彼女に別れを告げられた。これで３０回目くらいになるだろうか。悪いのはいつだっておれなのだが、おれはどんなときでも謝ったりしない。ただ、ひたすらなだめるだけだ。そして、今回ばかりはもうなだめるだけではどうでもならない気がしている。どうしようなかなあ、なんて途方に暮れながら、おれは本質とは全く関係ないことを考え始めていた。「おれの村はどうなってしまうんだろう」そんなことだ。
「 おいでよどうぶつの森 」 は ,
プレイヤーであるあなたが、
現実の世界とは違う架空の世界で気ままに
暮らすことができるゲームです。
（ 「おいでよどうぶつの森」取扱説明書より）
「 おいでよどうぶつの森」では、1本のソフトで四人まで住人をつくることができる。家は一軒しか建てられない。必然的に同棲することになる。同棲話も出ていたおれたちはひとまず先にゲームの中で暮らし始めることになった。
村の名はマコンド村という。マコンド村は、マルシア・ガルケス*1の「百年の孤独」から取った名前で、おれの分身となるキャラクターには「ホセ」と名づけた。これも「百年の孤独」に出てくるホセ・アルカディオ・ブエンディーアから取ったものだ。しかし、どうぶつたちにホセさん、ホセさん、と呼ばれていると、どちらかというと不法就労者のような気分になってしまうから困ったものだ。彼女は、普通に自分のニックネームをつけた。ゲームなんて全然やらない子なので、そこら辺は素直なものだった。
が、もともと田舎育ちで、かつ、田舎暮らしなんて別段好きでもなかったおれがどうぶつの森のスローライフに耐えられるわけもなくて、だいたい三日くらい触ってすぐに投げ出してしまう。「どうぶつの森」では、プレイしていない住人は家のベッドで寝ていることになっている。彼らは、おれがゲームを始めるとベッドから跳ね起きて、ゲームを終えるとまたベッドに潜り込むのだ。おれがスタートボタンを押すことでしか、かれらにとっての現実ははじまらないのだ。そして、おれはすぐに「どうぶつの森」に飽きてしまったため、もうずっとおれの分身は眠り続けている。彼女の分身もそうだ。
ほんとうはとっくに別れてしまったふたりが、ゲームの中ではひとつ屋根の下、枕を並べてすやすやと眠りこんでいる。そして、おれがこのゲームをやることは二度とないだろうから、彼らはこれからもずっとふたりで眠り続けてゆくのだ。ＮＤＳのカートリッジの記録がどれほど持つものなのかはわからないけれど、これから十年、二十年と時がたって、お互いの顔がうまく思い出せなくなったそのときでも、ふたりが離れることはないのだ。
これはもう、幽霊だろう。今まで迷信の類だった幽霊は、２１世紀の科学力でようやく実現したのだ。あるいは、おれがゲームをしているだけ覚醒していて、おれが実生活をしているときは眠っているホセは、おれの現実が反転した存在なのかもしれず、そういう捉え方をするならば、おれと彼女がくっついたり離れたりする茶番劇も、どうぶつの森のふたりにとっては長い長い一夜の眠りが見せた幸福な夢なのかもしれない。だとすれば、この世界は幻が反射された幽霊世界に過ぎないのに、おれは「どうぶつの森」のカートリッジをなくしてしまったせいで、それを確かめる術を持たないのだった。この部屋の、どこかにはあるはずなんだけど。

A masterpiece thought to depict a favourite mistress of King Charles II is expected to make up to £ 2 million at auction .
Portrait Of A Young Lady And Child As Venus And Cupid by Sir Peter Lely , the finest painter of the Restoration and official artist to the king , is being sold to raise money to save a castle in Kent .
The mistress may be Nell Gwyn but is more likely to be her predecessor , Barbara Villiers , Countess of Castlemaine and Duchess of Cleveland .
A description in an inventory of the period suggests the painting was kept in a secret panel in the royal bedchamber .
Scroll down for more ...
It is being sold by the trustees of the Denys Eyre Bower bequest to save Chiddingstone Castle , near Tonbridge .
It is one of dozens of works representing more than 300 years of British art that can be seen at Christie 's in London from Monday , in what the auction house is calling British Art Week .
The Lely is being sold in an Old Master auction on 5 July , but the majority of works on public view are being auctioned between 5 and 8 June .
The sales are expected to realise about £ 25 million in total .
Other works include a rediscovered chalk pastel by Pre-Raphaelite Dante Gabriel Rossetti .
The work , Proserpine , depicts Rossetti's lover , Jane Morris , as the queen of Hades .
It is expected to make up to £ 400,000 .
The sales also include the finest private collection of pictures by LS Lowry ever to appear at auction .
The six works include Good Friday , Daisy Nook , which was last sold at auction in 1970 for £ 16,800 but is now expected to sell for about £ 3 million .
Jonathan Horwich , deputy chairman of Christie's , said British Art Week stemmed from the realisation that it would be easier for buyers if the sales were concentrated in two weeks in June and November .
He said : " We thought : ' We 'll have British Art Week , you 'll know what you will see and you will know when it is . '
And that 's what happened . "

Here is a mirror :
Chalk another one up on the list .
From 911 Blogger :
I found a very short video clip ( which I have saved ) of the domestic BBC news channel from 9/11 , with the voice - over factually reporting another ' collapse ' , identifying it as the Salomon Brothers building , with an on - screen clock time of 21.54 ( this is British Summer Time , an hour ahead of GMT , five hours ahead of Eastern Daylight Time , i.e. 4:54 pm EDT )
HERE’S A PARADOX : Science is our best way of deciphering the complexities of the natural world .
It is useful , consistent and , despite the claims of fundamentalists — religious or postmodern — true .
Yet the insights of science are often counterintuitive , frequently lacking what Stephen Colbert called “ truthiness . ”
When Colbert coined that term , during the inaugural episode of his satirical show , “ The Colbert Report , ” he applied it to things that people in general ( and George W. Bush in particular ) know to be true “ from the gut , ” as opposed to from the head .
Truthiness trumps dry logic , dull evidence and mere facts .
It disdains or simply bypasses laborious intellectual examination in favor of what feels right .
The word has taken on a life of its own , and Colbert stuck it scathingly to Bush ’s political decisions , including the rationale for invading Iraq and his claim to have looked into Vladimir Putin ’s eyes and seen “ his soul . ”
But such gut thinking poses another set of dangers to science .
All too often , it bumps into scientific truth , and when it does , it tends to win — at least in the short term .
Ironically , much of the time , scientific findings do n’t seem immediately logical ; if they were , we probably would n’t need its laborious “ method ” of theory building and empirical hypothesis testing for confirmation .
We ’d simply know .
After all , the sun moves through our sky , but it is the Earth that is going around the sun .
Our planet is round , even though it sure feels flat under our feet as we walk .
The microbial theory of disease only prevailed because Louis Pasteur , Robert Koch and other scientists finally marshaled enough irrefutable evidence to overwhelm the alternative perspective : that things too small to be seen with the naked eye could n’t possibly exist or have any effect on us .
This conflict was foreshadowed by Francis Bacon in his 1620 treatise , “ Novum Organum , ” the founding document of the scientific method .
Bacon warned : “ The human understanding resembles not a dry light , but admits a tincture of the will and passions , which generate their own system accordingly : for man always believes more readily that which he prefers .
In short , his feelings imbue and corrupt his understanding in innumerable and sometimes imperceptible ways . ”
Nor is the battle over .
Indeed , there is a constant tension between science and its truthy alternatives , from “ quantum weirdness ” to the irrefutable ( but readily resisted ) reality that a brick wall consists of far more empty space than solid matter .
Evolution by natural selection , for example , is as close to truth as biological science is likely to get , and yet ( even notwithstanding its conflict with biblical literalists ) the notion that lineages change very slowly over vast amounts of time is less common - sensical than the observation that living things remain pretty much the same from one generation to the next .
Similarly , each of us is so small and the world so big that it simply is n’t truthy that we are literally using up certain resources , driving species extinct , polluting even the seemingly infinite oceans and modifying the climate .
The good news is that over time , actual truth wins out .
Only scientifically illiterate troglodytes deny the microbial theory of disease , or the reality of atoms , or of evolution .
Still , scientists face a constant struggle , a kind of Red Queen dilemma .
Recall the scene in Lewis Carroll ’s “ Through the Looking Glass , ” in which Alice and the Queen run vigorously but get nowhere .
The Queen explains , “ Here , you see , it takes all the running you can do , to keep in the same place .
If you want to get somewhere else , you must run at least twice as fast as that . ”
Science , bless its innovative soul , constantly reveals new realities .
Many of them — global warming , nuclear weapons , overpopulation , threats to biodiversity — are pregnant with immense risk .
Others , like genomics or stem cell research , offer great opportunity .
But nearly all are freighted with a lack of truthiness .
And so our intellectual race with the Red Queen continues .
Evolution did not equip Homo sapiens with ready access to insights that transcend our personal experience .
But somehow , we ’d better get over our stubborn bias toward “ thinking ” with our gut , which is to say , not thinking at all .
And that ’s the truth .
Pulitzer - winning journalist :
Why I asked if Clinton 's al Qaeda strike was like ' Wag the Dog ' Adam Dupont
Published : Wednesday June 6 , 2007 Print This Email This Reporter 's ' lighthearted ' query spread like wildfire in media Hollywood often lifts its stories from the front pages , but nearly nine years ago , a sitting president was accused of doing directly the opposite .
In the summer of 1998 , when the United States bombed al Qaeda terrorist targets in Sudan and Afghanistan in retaliation for the Aug. 7 , 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania , the sex scandal involving former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and President Clinton was on the minds of almost everyone in Washington DC .
But at an Aug. 20 Pentagon press briefing , Pulitzer Prize recipient Gaylord Shaw became the first reporter to reference the movie Wag the Dog , a satire about a make - believe war started to deflect media attention from a presidential sex scandal .
Though this question was later taken seriously by many journalists who were n't at the press conference , RAW STORY has learned in an interview with Shaw that he posed his question in a joking and lighthearted  manner .
 It was kind of lighthearted , " Shaw said about his question .
" We obviously ...
I mean , no one seriously thought that the President was bombing targets to change the subject from Monica Lewinsky . "
However , Wag the Dog immediately exploded as a metaphor for the idea that President Clinton had attempted to start a war to distract the news media from his troubles .
Many have argued that -- faced with skepticism towards his actions in the national media , and with some political pundits being egged on by a Republican - led House of Representatives that was driving towards impeachment -- the Wag the Dog accusations may have even hindered President Clinton 's ability to take further action at that time against Osama bin Laden and other foreign terrorists .
Metamorphosis of a metaphor On Aug. 20 , 1998 , just three days after President Clinton had admitted to a grand jury that he'd had an affair with Lewinsky , the Pentagon held a press conference about the US retaliatory bombings .
Gaylord Shaw , then the Washington Bureau Chief for Newsday , asked Secretary of Defense William Cohen , " Some Americans are going to say this bears a striking resemblance to Wag the Dog .
Two questions :
Have you seen the movie ?
And second , how do you respond to people who think that . "
( Audio clip of question can be heard at this link )
" The only motivation driving this action today was our absolute obligation to protect the American people from terrorist activities , " a taken aback Cohen responded .
Shaw , who was awarded a Pulitzer in 1978 " for a series on unsafe structural conditions at the nation 's major dams " published in the LA Times , told RAW STORY that he had n't seen the movie when he asked the question .
But " several of the guys [ in the White House press pool ] had and they were talking about it , " and there arose a " kind of a challenge among us to see who would ask Cohen . "
When asked if this was a serious challenge among the press pool , Shaw downplayed the notion and defined the challenge as lighthearted .
 It was kind of , when you see one of these guys in the hallway or you encounter them for an interview and you talked to them in their office ,  Shaw said of his question ,  that 's sort of something you use to break the ice , you know , that kind of thing , 
When asked if any other journalists wanted to ask the question , he added ,  You know , it was kind of humming in the background and I think everyone laughed when I asked it .
" Well you know , I can't speak for the entire press corps , " Shaw told RAW STORY .
" There may have been some people who thought Clinton would do that ; I did n't , did n't think that that was what was taking place , and I do n't think any of my colleagues , folks I know and worked with , they did n't take that as a serious possibility . "
But  Wag the Dog spread like wildfire On Aug. 20 , 1998 , anchor Brian Williams introduced NBC Nightly News 's " In - Depth " segment with a reference to the movie : " It had some invoking the title of a recent movie in which just that happened .
Wag the Dog , it 's a work of fiction , but that same thought today had a real feel .
Also that night , CNN's Wolf Blitzer took a " look at the presidency with attention split between the sex scandal in the White House and the military strikes aimed at the terrorists responsible for the U.S. embassy bombings . "
In an editorial published the next day , The New York Times backed the strikes , but cautioned the president to " reassure " Americans that they were not intended to distract .
" The United States has every right to attack suspected terrorists if there is credible evidence showing that they were involved in attacks against U.S. citizens or were planning such attacks , " the Times editorial said .
" That seems to be the case in the missile attacks ordered by President Clinton in the Sudan and Afghanistan ....
But since those attacks were ordered from a White House weakened by scandal , Clinton needs to take extra care to reassure the country that the attacks were not timed to help repair his shaken presidency . "
Andrew Krepinevich wrote for the Aug. 23 , 1998 Washington Post , " While the president 's decision to retaliate against terrorism is clearly justified based upon the evidence at hand , the propriety of this course of action is undermined by doubts as to the motives for the strikes , coming so close to the president 's Monday night scandal speech , and the continuing scandal coverage on the front pages of the national press . "
" It has been noted that after the antiterrorist military strikes , the president did not shy away from using the opportunity to appear ' presidential , ' giving two speeches on the matter , one after flying back dramatically to Washington from his vacation on Martha 's Vineyard , " Krepinevich added .
" These actions may have been appropriate .
Yet a president who lacks credibility must be careful not to present even the appearance that he may be acting out of a personal , rather than a public , interest . "
One day after the briefing , Salon.com columnist David Corn made a direct reference to Shaw 's question :
 It took only a few minutes for one of the reporters in the Pentagon pressroom to ask Secretary of Defense William Cohen the question on many minds : ' Have you seen the movie ? '
He was referring to Wag the Dog and the unsettling coincidence between Thursday 's military strikes and a movie in which political fixers concoct a war to distract public attention from a presidential sex scandal .
On Aug. 23 , 1998 , Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page used Shaw 's stature as a veteran journalist to give credibility to  Wag the Dog accusations against Clinton :  A year ago it would have been hard to imagine a reporter as respectable as Newsday 's Gaylord Shaw raising such a tacky question in a Pentagon news conference .
On the Aug. 21 , 1998 edition of MSNBC 's Hardball , University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato told anchor Chris Matthews : " Yeah , Chris , two things strike me about it .
The first is -- and I think this is an amazing figure -- 36 percent of Americans believe that the Monica Lewinsky scandal had something to do with the president 's action to strike in Afghanistan and the -- the Sudan .
That is an amazingly high percentage .
That 's a product of cynicism , and it 's cynicism that Bill Clinton has helped to create and to stoke .
He is , after all , a self - certified liar now . "
References to Wag the Dog and Clinton continued well after August 1998 , especially in more " conservative friendly " media outlets such as the New York Post , Washington Times , National Review , and Fox News .
In the New York Post , columnist Andrea Peyser asked , " On the day Monica Lewinsky was testifying before a grand jury , did the president of the United States send innocent people into harm 's way for the ugly purpose of changing the subject of national discourse from oral sex and semen - stained dresses to battle scars and blood - stained uniforms ? " and Deborah Orin wrote , " Only a majority of Democrats believe President Clinton launched missile strikes primarily to act against terrorism -- while everyone else is more likely to suspect a case of ' the tail wagging the dog , ' a new Post Poll shows . "
In a Dec. 17 , 2001 column for the National Review , Byron York said that after the Aug. 20 , 1998 bombings , " Clinton 's critics accused him of using military action to change the subject from the sex - and - perjury scandal -- the so - called ' wag the dog ' strategy . "
York goes on to note that  [ a ] fter the cruise missile raids , the administration restricted its work to covert actions breaking up terrorist cells ,  but also insinuates that Clinton 's anti-terrorist actions may have been less than altruistic .
He quotes James Woolsey 's dismissal of Clinton 's tactics as " PR - driven , " adding that Clinton 's  PR - driven method of fighting terrorism was an approach that left the fundamental problem unsolved .
John Podhoretz was even blunter in a Jul. 16 , 2002 column for the New York Post , charging point - blank that President Clinton was guilty of ordering military actions to focus attention away from his domestic problems and urging President Bush to use the same tactics to begin the war in Iraq :  Go on , Mr. President :
Wag the dog .
...
You 're in some domestic political trouble , Mr. President .
You need to change the subject .
You have the biggest subject - changer of all at your disposal .
Use it .
I can hear the screaming already from certain quarters .
How would such a thing be different from what Bill Clinton did in 1998 , when he used cruise missiles twice in response to Osama bin Laden at crucial moments during the Lewinsky scandals ?
Here 's how it would be different , Mr. President :
You 'd get the job done .
Republican reactions
Although the majority of Republicans publicly backed the al Qaeda strikes in 1998 , a few sitting Congressional members were skeptical of Clinton 's motives .
" While there is clearly much more we need to learn about this attack and why it was ordered today , given the president 's personal difficulties this week , it is legitimate to question the timing of this action , " Sen .
Dan Coats ( R - Ind . ) said in a statement .
" Once the president has broken the bond of trust with the American people , as he has done with his repeated lies , it raises questions about everything he does or does not do . "
Republican Senators Arlen Specter ( R - Pa. ) and John McCain ( R - AZ ) did n't go as far as Coates , but both noted that Clinton was " distracted , " before slightly reversing themselves later , after House Speaker Newt Gingrich characterized " Wag the Dog " accusations as " sick . "
But after Clinton struck targets in Iraq in the winter of 1998 , many more Republicans joined the " wag the dog " attack .
" Both the timing and the motive are subject to question , " Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott ( R - MS ) was quoted as saying , and Rep. Harold Solomon , ( R - NY ) said " Never underestimate a desperate president . "
Coverage of foreign matters buried in favor of scandal President Clinton was also trying to get the job done on other issues -- matters we still see in the news today .
From Oct. 15 through Oct. 23 , 1998 , Clinton was in Wye , Maryland for the Wye River Accord , a meeting between the leaders of Israel and Palestine to continue the peace process .
These talks brought Israel 's then - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat together to discuss how to bring peace to the region .
President Clinton focused his attention on mediating the discussions , since issues between the Israelis and Palestinians are always heated .
At one point , after Israeli leaders threatened to leave , Clinton launched a marathon 21 - hour session [ after which ] both Palestinians and Israelis agree to what becomes known as the Wye River Memorandum ,  according to PBS .
On Sep. 21 , 1998 , Clinton received a standing ovation from world leaders at the United Nations before giving a speech about combating international terrorism .
But on the same day , Republican Congressional leaders had the video tape of Clinton 's deposition to the grand jury released to the public , which prompted the major networks to show hours of footage from the tape .
In his book The Clinton Wars , Sidney Blumenthal , a senior adviser to Clinton , notes that the media climate at this time was still focused on fallout from the Lewinsky scandal , practically ignoring terrorism and other matters that the White House was working on :  In the media , busy with the tumultuous response to the Starr Report 's release , the struggle against terrorism was a mere footnote if it was mentioned at all .
Legacy of a metaphor Last year , controversy surrounded ABC when it aired the movie The Path To 9/11 before the 2006 elections .
The docudrama , which ABC claimed was based on facts detailed in the 9/11 Commission Report , was critical of the Clinton administration .
CNN reported that the movie portrayed  Clinton being too distracted by impeachment and his marital problems to focus on bin Laden . 
Clinton emphatically rebutted this charge in a Sep. 26 , 2006 interview on Fox News : ABC just had a right - wing conservative run in their little Pathway to 9/11 , falsely claiming it was based on the 9/11 Commission report , with three things asserted against me directly contradicted by the 9/11 Commission report .
...
And I think it 's very interesting that all the conservative Republicans , who now say I did n't do enough , claimed that I was too obsessed with bin Laden ...
They were all trying to get me to withdraw from Somalia in 1993 the next day after we were involved in  Black Hawk down ,  and I refused to do it and stayed six months and had an orderly transfer to the United Nations . 
Clinton continued , making a direct mention of Wag the Dog and noting the pressure Republicans who now accuse him of not fighting terrorism placed on him when he attempted to kill bin Laden in the Aug. 20 , 1998 attacks :
 The people on my political right who say I did n't do enough spent the whole time I was president saying ,  Why is he so obsessed with bin Laden ?
That was wag the dog when he tried to kill him .
Noting the legacy of the  Wag the Dog metaphor and the power it carries , RAW STORY asked Gaylord Shaw if he had any regrets about being the first reporter to mention the movie .
Shaw replied ,  No , I do n't regret asking the question .
I regret that anyone 's taking it too seriously ,  then added , with a chuckle ,  I mean , we got to have a little more faith in our national leaders then that . 

Top 10 Movie Spaceships Saturday , January 27 , 2007
There are many movie spaceships but which one is the best in the universe ?
Some rules formed this list : these are spaceships from movies ( TV spaceships like Battlestar Galactica or Draconian Marauder from Buck Rogers do n’t count ) and real space crafts .
Flying cars and rockets do n’t count .
It turns out that we have lot of great spaceships , so I apologize in advance to Borg Cube , Imperial Star Destroyer , X - Wing Fighter , many other Star Trek and Star Wars low grade ships and all other ships that we know of .
10 . The Thunder Road ( Explorers ) – Advantage : Invisible .
Source of power is 9V battery size generator .
No Inertia .
Damage resistant ; can pass through ground with no problem at all .
Flaws : Named after Bruce Springsteen song and only for kids .
9. Gunstar ( The Last Starfighter ) – If you win enough points in a video game , you might be recruited to fly Gunstar and defend Frontier from Xur and Ko- Dan fleet !
Weapons are standard but with a little bonus : the " Death Blossom " , which automatically aims at any ship within range of weapons and destroys it .
Why they did n’t install it as a regular system remains a mystery .
8. Mothership ( Independence Day ) – Despite of its absurd vulnerability for human made computer viruses , this bad boy possesses one of the most impressive arsenal of weapon in movie history .
And it ’s huge : quarter of a Moon .
Inside , it carries 30 smaller ships , each one is big as Manhattan and possesses incredible beam weapon for destruction of a city .
It is also resistant to all known weapons except Randy Quaid .
7. Klingon Bird of Prey ( Star Trek ) – “ Bird of Prey ” never fit in alongside Federation starships , but their wing like shape gives them lethal design in movie space technology Hall of Fame .
Put some leather seats in it and you ’ll have a Ferrari among spaceships .
6. Discovery One ( 2001 : A Space Odyssey ) –
This massive ship , shaped like a pencil , is designed for long term explorations .
The Jupiter spacecraft Discovery
One carries three one - man EVA pods , centrifuge that creates artificial gravity , and , well , one buggy computer system – HAL 9000 .
Despite technical problems , HAL ’s red eye is hypnotically invincible .
5. Apollo 13 ( Apollo 13 ) –
One real spaceship on this list and without doubt , most heroic ship of them all .
It flew only once , reached the Moon and barely returned to Earth in on piece … and they were welcomed by Kathleen Quinlan .
Ha .
4. Heart of Gold ( The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy ) – If we disregard it ’s weird ball like design ( inspired by a teapot ) , Incredible Endless Ride in this ship performs a very interesting stunt trick :
Traveling through every point of Universe in a single moment .
Do n’t bang your head against wall , instead enjoy in a personal ship computer and robotized things .
3. Nostromo ( Alien ) – Nostromo is not your regular space freighter , because it carries with it a huge ore excavator .
Even though it has no weapons , when it receives a command for auto destruction ( rather complex one ) , it completes it with a style .
It was underestimated ship , but it could land on a planet and pick up certain alien life forms … which turned out to be not such a good idea .
2. U.S.S. Enterprise ( various versions ) ( Star Trek ) – Even though it is originated from a series , Enterprise truly expressed itself in a movie serial .
Earlier ships stand out with their photon torpedoes and pre-selection for auto destruction , but this was the only ship that could literally go back and forth through time .
Holodeck ?
Cute .
And those transporters had a killing dose in them .
Later versions of a ship had ability of splitting in two parts .
1. Millennium Falcon ( Star Wars ) –
It is probably not that big surprise to see Falcon on top of this list , but really , who would thought that a light freighter of quarrelsome smuggler , would be that important in saving of a Galaxy .
Armed with 2 Quad laser cannons , 1 Mounted Anti-Infantry Swivel Laser Cannon , Dymek Concussion Missiles , Tractor Beam Projector , hyperdrive , and space for eight passengers , Millennium Falcon easily earned its first place .
If you can find other ship that can made the Kessel Run in less than twelve parsecs , please let us know .

The Bush Administration has apparently decided that the best way to make sure that the so - called surge option succeeds is to refuse to discuss the possibility that it could fail :
During a White House meeting last week , a group of governors asked President Bush and Marine Gen.
Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , about their backup plan for Iraq .
What would the administration do if its new strategy did n’t work ?
The conclusion they took away , the governors later said , was that there is no Plan B . “ I ’m a Marine , ” Pace told them , “ and Marines do n’t talk about failure .
They talk about victory . ”
Pace had a simple way of summarizing the administration ’s position , Gov. Philip N. Bredesen ( D - Tenn . ) recalled .
“ Plan B was to make Plan A work . ”
In the weeks since Bush announced the new plan for Iraq — including an increase of 21,500 U.S. combat troops , additional reconstruction assistance and stepped - up pressure on the Iraqi government — senior officials have rebuffed questions about other options in the event of failure .
Eager to appear resolute and reluctant to provide fodder for skeptics , they have responded with a mix of optimism and evasion .
This is exactly the kind of thinking that got us into the situation we are in today .
From the start of the war , there was an almost criminal lack of planning for the countless things that could go wrong during the course of a major military operation .
When things did go wrong , such as when the Iraqis failed to great us as the liberators that Paul Wolfowitz and others assured Americans would happen , there was no plan in place to deal with them and military officials were forced to make things up as they went along , hoping they would work .
And now , it seems , we ’re making the same mistakes all over again .
The difference does not involve changes in genes , as far as is known , but changes in the human form .
It shows up in several ways , from those that are well known and almost taken for granted , like greater heights and longer lives , to ones that are emerging only from comparisons of health records .
The biggest surprise emerging from the new studies is that many chronic ailments like heart disease , lung disease and arthritis are occurring an average of 10 to 25 years later than they used to .
There is also less disability among older people today , according to a federal study that directly measures it .
And that is not just because medical treatments like cataract surgery keep people functioning .
Human bodies are simply not breaking down the way they did before .
Even the human mind seems improved .
The average I.Q. has been increasing for decades , and at least one study found that a person ’s chances of having dementia in old age appeared to have fallen in recent years .
The proposed reasons are as unexpected as the changes themselves .
Improved medical care is only part of the explanation ; studies suggest that the effects seem to have been set in motion by events early in life , even in the womb , that show up in middle and old age .
“ What happens before the age of 2 has a permanent , lasting effect on your health , and that includes aging , ” said Dr. David J. P. Barker , a professor of medicine at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland and a professor of epidemiology at the University of Southampton in England .
Each event can touch off others .
Less cardiovascular disease , for example , can mean less dementia in old age .
The reason is that cardiovascular disease can precipitate mini-strokes , which can cause dementia .
Cardiovascular disease is also a suspected risk factor for Alzheimer ’s disease .
The effects are not just in the United States .
Large and careful studies from Finland , Britain , France , Sweden and the Netherlands all confirm that the same things have happened there ; they are also beginning to show up in the underdeveloped world .

I really wanted to go to Putting the Fun in Functional : Applying Game Mechanics to Social Software by Amy Jo Kim , but my inner geek won out and I went to Applied Web Heresies with Avi Bryant ( slides ) .
I hope someone else took good notes .
The basis for the talk is Seaside , a web framework for Smalltalk that Avi wrote several years ago .
The problem with Seaside is you 're not going to use it !
There are a lot of interesting ideas in Seaside that people should know , so this tutorial is way of spreading the ideas outside of Smalltalk .
Avi suggests using Seaside as a recipe .
He tells the story of Primo Levy and onions in the varnish .
There are a lot of " best practices " of Web development that were good decisions at the time but which are no longer needed .
Here 's the basic requirement list :
OOP
Servlet - style app server
Blocks and closures
" First thing we do , let 's kill all the templates . "
Templates were a good idea that have become useless and harmful .
They 're constraining or they 're a bad programming language .
The is a belief that templates are useful for model / view separation .
But HTML is now a semantic layer and CSS is the real view layer ( see Zen Garden ) .
This is an interesting point of view and one I have a hard time arguing with .
So , you need a rich library for generating HTML ( see AWT for inspiration ) .
Each widget has a render method that gets a canvas passed to it .
The first thing we did was write a small framework to get things going .
Different groups were working in different languages .
I used Ruby ( even though I do n't really know Ruby ) .
Here 's mine :
require ' webrick ' require ' stringio ' server = WEBrick ::HTTPServer.new ( : Port => 2000 ) server.mount_proc( " /heresy " ) {|req , res| Application.new.handle(req , res) } server.mount_proc(" /favicon.ico " ) {|req , res| res.status = 404} class Application def handle ( req , res ) canvas = Canvas.new ( res ) render_on ( canvas ) end def render_on ( html ) html.heading ( " Hello World " ) end end class Canvas def initialize ( res ) @res = res res [ ' Content - Type ' ] = ' text / html ' end def heading ( str , level=1 ) @res.body = " < h1 > " + str + " < /h1 > " end end trap ( " INT " ) { server .
shutdown } server.start
We 're omitting tag objects here and just spitting out HTML , but a real API should do that .
The next heresy that Avi proposes is that sessions are two valuable to persist .
In general , you can never marshall and unmarshall the stuff in memory reliably .
All the good stuff 's in memcached anyway .
Keep the session in the memory of the application server
What about load balancing ?
Use sticky sessions .
YAGNI Application servers going down is unusual .
Users losing session data is a minor annoyance .
Live with it .
NeXT 's WebObjects is the inspiration for much of what Avi 's done .
Next we move from our HelloWorld application to something that has stateful sessions .
We 're going to build a registry of sessions and push the canvas down a level so that the sessions hold the canvas .
My Ruby coding skills were not up to keeping up , so I cheated and grabbed Avi's code ( which includes a much more usable Canvas object ) :
require ' webrick ' require ' stringio ' server = WEBrick ::HTTPServer.new ( : Port => 2000 ) server.mount_proc( " /heresy " ) {|req , res| Application.new.handle(req , res) } server.mount_proc(" /favicon.ico " ) {|req , res| res.status = 404} class Registry def initialize @items = [ ] end def register ( item ) @items << item ( @items.size - 1 ) .to_s end def find ( key ) @items[key.to_i ] end end class Application @@sessions = Registry.new def handle ( req , res ) session_cookie = req.cookies.detect{|c| c.name == " heresy " } if ( session_cookie ) session = @@sessions.find(session_cookie.value ) end unless session session = Session.new res.cookies << WEBrick ::Cookie.new ( " heresy " , @@sessions.register(session ) ) end session .
handle ( req , res ) end end class Canvas def initialize @io = StringIO.new end def tag ( name , attrs={} , & proc ) @io << " < " @io << name attrs.each{|k , v| @io << " # {k}='# {v} '" } @io << " > " proc.call @io << " </#{name} > " end def text ( str ) @io << str end def heading ( txt , level=1 ) tag ( " h#{level} " ) { text ( txt ) } end def string @io.string end end class Session def initialize @count = 0 end def handle ( req , res ) @count += 1 html = Canvas.new render_on ( html ) res.body = html.string res [ " Content - Type " ] = " text / html " end def render_on ( html ) html.heading ( " Hello World : # {@count} " ) end end trap ( " INT " ) { server .
shutdown } server.start
What 's left to do on session ?
Lots , including :
Unguessable session keys
Session keys as query params
Session locks
Expiration from registry
The next piece of heresy : meaningful URLs do n't carry enough meaning .
People put a lot of energy trying to create names that describe the particular point in an application .
Not every page in an application is a meaningful part of an API .
URLs , particularly query parameters are classic place where people repeat themselves .
Do n't repeat yourself .
Lots of meaningless names create namespace collisions .
Avi proposes using a registry to store IDs against page names .
The inspiration for this is TCL / TK : Register closures / blocks as callback objects .
Here 's the code that implements this refinement ( I did it almost all by myself - - I had to peak to see how WeBrick handled requests ) :
require ' webrick ' require ' stringio ' server = WEBrick ::HTTPServer.new ( : Port => 2000 ) server.mount_proc( " /heresy " ) {|req , res| Application.new.handle(req , res) } server.mount_proc(" /favicon.ico " ) {|req , res| res.status = 404} class Registry def initialize @items = [ ] end def register ( item ) @items << item ( @items.size - 1 ) .to_s end def find ( key ) @items[key.to_i ] end end class Application @@sessions = Registry.new def handle ( req , res ) session_cookie = req.cookies.detect{|c| c.name == " heresy " } if ( session_cookie ) session = @@sessions.find(session_cookie.value ) end unless session session = Session.new res.cookies << WEBrick ::Cookie.new ( " heresy " , @@sessions.register(session ) ) end session .
handle ( req , res ) end end class Canvas def initialize ( cbs ) @io = StringIO.new @callbacks = cbs end def tag ( name , attrs={} , & proc ) @io << " < " @io << name attrs.each{|k , v| @io << " # {k}='# {v} '" } @io << " > " proc.call @io << " </#{name} > " end def text ( str ) @io << str end def link ( name , & proc ) id = @callbacks.register( proc ) tag ( " a " , { : href= > " ?# {id} " } ) {text ( name ) } end def space @io << " " end def heading ( txt , level=1 ) tag ( " h#{level} " ) { text ( txt ) } end def string @io.string end end class Counter def initialize @count = 0 end def render_on ( html ) html.heading ( " Hello World : # {@count} " ) html.tag ( " p " ) {html.text ( " this is fun !!! " ) } html.link ( " --" ) {@count -= 1} html.space html.link ( " ++ " ) {@count +=
1} end end class Session def initialize @callbacks = Registry.new @root = Counter.new end def handle ( req , res ) req.query .each do |k , v| if callback = @callbacks.find(k ) callback.call( v ) end end html = Canvas.new(@callbacks ) @root.render_on( html ) res.body = html.string res [ " Content - Type " ] = " text / html " end end trap ( " INT " ) { server .
shutdown } server.start
As we finished this segment , I said " I get what we 're doing , but why are we doing it ? "
In other words , why go to all this trouble to create a registry of callback methods and URLs that point to it uniquely ?
The answer is in the next little exercise .
Here 's the code I produced :
require ' webrick ' require ' stringio ' server = WEBrick ::HTTPServer.new ( : Port => 2000 ) server.mount_proc( " /heresy " ) {|req , res| Application.new.handle(req , res) } server.mount_proc(" /favicon.ico " ) {|req , res| res.status = 404} class Registry def initialize @items = [ ] end def register ( item ) @items << item ( @items.size - 1 ) .to_s end def find ( key ) @items[key.to_i ] end end class Application @@sessions = Registry.new def handle ( req , res ) session_cookie = req.cookies.detect{|c| c.name == " heresy " } if ( session_cookie ) session = @@sessions.find(session_cookie.value ) end unless session session = Session.new res.cookies << WEBrick ::Cookie.new ( " heresy " , @@sessions.register(session ) ) end session .
handle ( req , res ) end end class Canvas def initialize ( cbs ) @io = StringIO.new @callbacks = cbs end def tag ( name , attrs={} , & proc ) @io << " < " @io << name attrs.each{|k , v| @io << " # {k}='# {v} '" } @io << " > " proc.call @io << " </#{name} > " end def text ( str ) @io << str end def link ( name , & proc ) id = @callbacks.register( proc ) tag ( " a " , { : href= > " ?# {id} " } ) {text ( name ) } end def space @io << " " end def heading ( txt , level=1 ) tag ( " h#{level} " ) { text ( txt ) } end def string @io.string end end class MultiCounter def initialize @counters = [ Counter.new , Counter.new , Counter.new ] end def render_on ( html ) @counters.each{|ea| ea.render_on( html ) } end end class Counter def initialize @count = 0 end def render_on ( html ) html.heading ( " Hello World : # {@count} " ) html.tag ( " p " ) {html.text ( " this is fun !!! " ) } html.link ( " --" ) {@count -= 1} html.space html.link ( " ++ " ) {@count +=
1} end end class Session def initialize @callbacks = Registry.new @root = MultiCounter.new end def handle ( req , res ) req.query .
each do |k , v| if callback = @callbacks.find(k ) callback.call( v ) end end html = Canvas.new(@callbacks ) @root.render_on( html ) res.body = html.string res [ " Content - Type " ] = " text / html " end end trap ( " INT " ) { server .
shutdown } server.start
The only changes here are the addition of a MultiCounter class that creates a three item array of counter objects and a render_on object that calls render_on on each member of the array .
Then , instead of putting a Counter object at the root , I put a MultiCount object .
And you get three of the Counter widgets on the same page .
This shows how easy it is to use the objects as Web widgets .
Avi says you can't do this with named URLs .
Avi remarks that pages are a lousy unit of reuse and partials ain't much better .
" But every piece of my application is a beautiful and unique snowflake . "
Again , with the CSS .
What are n't we doing ?
Splitting callback registries up by page view
Tracking the back - button
Redirecting after side - effects
Forms !
Overall this is a very interesting set of thoughts about Web development .
Clearly he 's espousing a lot of new ideas , which generated a lot of " How do you ...? " questions .
Very good stuff .
This tutorial made me think , which is the best kind .

A Who 's Who of Awful Times to Invest
John P. Hussman , Ph.D .
All rights reserved and actively enforced .

December 1961 ( followed by 28 % market loss over 6 months )
January 1973 ( followed by a 48 % collapse over the following 20 months )
August 1987 ( followed by a 34 % plunge over the following 3 months )
July 1998 ( followed abruptly by an 18 % loss over the following 3 months )
July 1999 ( followed by a 12 % loss over the following 3 months )
December 1999 ( followed by a 9 % loss over the following 2 months )
March 2000 ( followed by a 49 % collapse in the S&P over the following 30 months )
The defining characteristics of these instances were :
1 ) price / peak - earnings multiple above 18
2 ) 4 - year high in the S&P 500 index ( on a weekly closing basis )
3 ) S&P 500 8 % or more above its 52 - week moving average ( exponential )
4 ) rising Treasury and corporate bond yields
Depending on how we define the interest rate trends , we can include two additional historical instances of these conditions : October 1963 and May 1996 , both closely followed by 7 - 10 % corrections .
One more instance completes the list : July 2007 .
Careful readers will notice that there is no condition on bullish / bearish sentiment above .
I 've generally written about abrupt downside risks in terms of overvalued , overbought , overbullish conditions .
The reason we can exclude sentiment is that the above criteria already capture such awful times to invest that adding further restrictions simply reduces the size of the list .
Taking the extreme , if we limit these cases only to those where 20 % or fewer investment advisors were bearish ( based on Investors Intelligence figures ) , we exclude all the points except January 1973 , August 1987 , and today .
It 's extremely important to emphasize that I am not making a forecast or a " bearish call . "
The point of these remarks is n't to yell " head for them hills Vern , thar 's a stampede a - comin ' up yonder ! "
We 're fully hedged , but we do not have an investment position that would be expected to lose value in the event of a continued advance .
Indeed , the Strategic Growth Fund is within 1 % of an all - time high , including reinvested distributions .
Though we are strongly conservative here , we are not fighting this market with a position that would predictably lose if the market gains .
The point of this analysis is instead to emphasize that based on prevailing market conditions , we have no evidence on which to accept market risk here .
There is no need to forecast a decline - it is enough that , on average , the market has lagged Treasury bills in conditions similar to the present ( though the skew , depth and abruptness of the historical losses in this case are striking ) .
No evidence to take market risk , no market risk taken .
It 's that simple .
I recognize that our defensiveness in recent months has probably seemed interminable .
I do have less conservative versions of our hedging approach that could have accepted greater market risk in the past few years , but only by allowing larger drawdowns historically .
Even these have been defensive in recent months .
Though these versions might have added several percent to our returns during the bull market portion of this particular cycle , the overall increment to long - term returns ( compared with the approach I use in practice ) is only a fraction of a percent annually at best , since most or all of the captured gains from being more aggressive would generally have been surrendered in market downturns .
Tracking the market more closely in advances at the cost of greater losses in downturns , with little or no overall return for the round - trip , seems like " empty calories " to me .
My impression is that shareholders are better served by the Fund taking the minimal amount of risk necessary to achieve a given long - term return .
But again , I do realize that the more defensive alternative can demand greater patience in market environments like this one .
In any event , the fact is that current conditions fall into a fairly narrow sliver of historical experience , but one that has enough observations to draw clear conclusions .
That conclusion is that overvalued , overbought , overbullish conditions ( even short of the unusually extreme ones listed above ) have resulted in market returns below Treasury bill yields , on average .
Our strategy is not to try to predict whether the current instance will be different .
To admit that there is risk is to admit that there is a range of possible returns , some better than the average , some worse .
But an average outcome below Treasury bill yields , and risk to boot , is not a good combination .
Consistently taking risk in such environments provides no long - term edge , only volatility .
Our strategy is to align ourselves with the prevailing return / risk profile of the market , knowing that there will be many , many attractive periods in which to accept market risk , and that these periods have historically provided more than enough opportunity to capture strong returns over the full cycle , with subdued risk ( see the remarks of recent weeks for some instructive examples ) .
Frankly , I do n't know whether investors will drive the market even higher in the weeks ahead .
My opinion is that whatever gains emerge ( and indeed , much of what has already emerged ) will ultimately prove quite temporary .
What I do know is that certain factors have reliably identified egregiously bad times to accept market risk , and that every historical instance similar to the present has been a disaster .
The current instance may very well prove to be the exception , but I do not invest shareholder assets on the hope that the future will be entirely at odds with all available historical evidence .
The likely range of long - term market returns - an update
The following charts update various studies of valuations and subsequent market returns .
The chart below presents the likely range of S&P 500 total returns in the coming decade .
The various possibilities are based on continued long - term earnings growth in the same well - defined channel that has characterized S&P 500 earnings over the past 10 , 20 , 50 years and longer , and applying a range of terminal multiples to those earnings .
It 's clear that with a small exception of 10 - year periods that ended in the late 1990 's bubble , these projections have nicely contained the actual 10 - year return on the S&P 500 ( the solid blue line , which ends 10 years ago ) .
Presently , the probable total return on the S&P 500 over the coming decade ranges between - 4 % and 5 % annually , with the most likely outcome in the low single digits .
Here 's a method - free version : the simplest comparison you can get ( aside from having to use logarithms since Excel does n't handle dual log scales well ) .
It is the log of the S&P 500 earnings yield based on peak trailing earnings , compared with the log ratio of the S&P 500 total return index 7 years hence to the prevailing total return index .
The values on the scale are n't intuitive , but the picture is clear as day .
Note that this presently makes no correction for the level of profit margins - it assumes that the current record level of earnings , with no downward adjustment , is the correct level on which to base the P/E calculation .
The current implied value of 0.14 for the log gross total return still converts to an expected 7 - year total return of 4.71 % annually .
Calculation : [ ( 10^0.14 ) ^( 1/7 ) - 1 ]
The following chart presents an alternative methodology , which projects the potential growth rate of earnings by amortizing the difference between current earnings and the well - defined historical trendline that connects S&P 500 earnings from peak - to - peak across market cycles .
This approach has been quite reliable over 7 - year horizons ( except , again , for those 7 - year periods that ended in the late 1990 's market bubble ) .
At present , the likely 7 - year total return on the S&P 500 is again in the low single digits .
As I 've frequently noted , it 's not useful to attempt to forecast specific short - term market outcomes , but valuations have an enormous and reliable impact on long - term outcomes .
Investors ignore evidence like this at their peril .
It is also useful to emphasize that the defensive case does not require any expectation that earnings will fall short in the months ahead , or even that profit margins will contract over the coming quarters .
If you look at the historical data , it is clear that the correlation between year - over - year earnings growth and year - over - year market performance is zero anyway .
The argument is that even on the basis of current earnings - record profit margins and all - the market is very richly priced .
On the basis of normalized profit margins , the situation is even worse .
But we do not need to argue that earnings will decline or disappoint .
The potential for margins to erode certainly strengthens the case , but is not the basis of our defensiveness .
As for various convolutions of the Fed Model ( which I now receive almost daily ) , just a general remark - it 's important to remember that the 10 - year bond yield is not a " permanent yield " with a duration of anything close to the duration of stocks .
If we could observe a 60 - year , zero - coupon bond yield ( or at least a yield whose fluctuations do n't damp out over much shorter horizons ) , then we could make a good theoretical case for pricing stocks on that benchmark .
But if you are familiar with the dynamics of the yield curve , you also know that the longer the maturity of the bond , the smaller the range of yield fluctuation .
Given that even a 30 - year coupon bond has a duration of just 14 years or so , you can imagine how limited the yield fluctuations on a 60 - year zero would be .
It is that yield , not the yield on a 10 - year Treasury ( which only has a duration of about 7 years ) that would have some hope of moving 1 - for - 1 with the long - term return priced into stocks .
And as usual , if the model somebody presents does n't include convincing data that shows a long - term relationship between that model and subsequent market returns ( at least as tight as the relationship with the simple , raw , unadjusted price / peak earnings yield above , and in data prior to 1980 ) , walk away .
Investment professionals that hold themselves out on CNBC as " long - term investors " should be troubled by the paltry long - term returns currently priced into stocks , as well as the historical tendency toward abrupt short - and intermediate - term losses given current conditions .
Otherwise any talk of being a " long - term investor " is nothing but lip service .
No , multiples are not as bad as they were in the late 1990's , but those valuations have also been followed by market returns below Treasury bill yields for 8 years , and even those meager returns have been achieved only because the market has returned to high valuations currently .
If the late 1990's now represent our standard of appropriate valuation , we may as well bury our savings in a bottle in the back yard , because the outcomes will be similar .
When even modest future investment returns rely on profit margins and valuation multiples remaining at elevated levels indefinitely , there is no margin for error , and one is no longer investing .
Market Climate
As of last week , the Market Climate for stocks was characterized by unusually unfavorable valuations , extremely overbought conditions , tenuously favorable market action on the basis of market internals , and generally upward interest rate pressures .
The current overvalued , overbought , overbullish combination of investment conditions has historically been associated with market returns below Treasury bill yields , on average .
We need not forecast where the market will move in this particular instance - that average return below T - bill yields is enough to hold us to a defensive position .
In bonds , the Market Climate remained characterized by relatively neutral yield levels and unfavorable market action , holding the Strategic Total Return Fund to a relatively short 2 year duration , mostly in TIPS .
We have n't observed sufficient weakness in bond prices to warrant an increase in duration exposure , but we did observe some significant strength in precious metals shares last week , sufficient to clip our exposure from over 20 % of assets down to about 15 % of assets .
The Market Climate for precious metals shares remains favorable here , but given the volatility of these shares , we should not be surprised by a consolidation .

Equator on BBC Two Episode One clips
BBC weather presenter and meteorologist , Phil Avery , separates some of the fact from the fiction .
Does water really flow down a plug - hole clockwise in the southern hemisphere and anti-clockwise in the northern hemisphere ?
Is the moon " upside down " in the southern hemisphere ?
And in equatorial regions is the climate always the same ?
If you start drawing imaginary lines on a planet , I suppose there is bound to be endless scope for myths to develop .
But perhaps the greater degree of surprise comes from the knowledge that not all the myths date from ancient history .
Dare to express an opinion about water disappearing down a plug - hole anywhere near the equator , and you enter a world of entrenched opinion and scathing ridicule of your grasp of science .
' Line - crossing ceremony '
Portuguese adventurers and explorers of the early 15th century would never have passed the headlands of Northwest Africa had they believed the myths of monsters and boiling seas which were so widespread in western Europe at the time .
EQUATORIAL COUNTRIES
Brazil Colombia Rep of Congo Dem Rep of Congo Ecuador Gabon Indonesia Kenya Kiribati Maldives Sao Tome / Principe Somalia Uganda
The " line - crossing ceremony " - a seafaring tradition dating back to the Middle Ages - commemorates a sailor 's first crossing of the equator and is still practised - to an extent - aboard some naval ships today .
It was originally created as a test for seasoned sailors to ensure their new shipmates were capable of handling long , rough times at sea .
Traditionally presided over by " King Neptune and his Royal court " , the ceremony was part of an initiation into " The Solemn Mysteries of the Ancient Order of the Deep " .
In the 19th century and earlier , it was quite a brutal event and would sometimes involve sailors being beaten with wet boards and ropes , and then occasionally throwing these men overboard .
Night and day
There are some indisputable facts about the equator :
The region around the equator is the area with the world 's greatest concentration of human poverty and natural biodiversity .
Send us your equator photos Almost half the world 's rainforests are concentrated on the equator in just three countries : Brazil , Congo and Indonesia .
The Sun - in its seasonal movement - traverses directly over the equator twice each year , on the spring and vernal equinoxes .
Locations along the equator experience the fastest rates of sunrise and sunset on the planet .
The transition from day to night takes only minutes .
The lengths of day / night time vary very little , while more northerly and southerly locations can vary enormously .
Season - long days and nights are a feature of life at the poles .
Common myths
While on the astronomical aspects of equatorial misconceptions , discussions have ranged over the moon 's ability to turn upside down once across the equator .
Not a question that crossed this inquiring mind but , once again , choose your website with care and you too can become immersed in the subject .
To save you the bother though , the consensus seems to be that the Moon does appear to have such an ability , but this is the exception to a much more prevalent rule .
The direction in which water drains is the most debated equator myth
But this debate is nothing compared to the old chestnut of the water disappearing down the plug - hole in different directions depending on your hemisphere of choice .
I offer one line of argument only ( although I am not sufficiently arrogant to believe that anything I write will settle this once and for all ) .
Water flows down the plug - hole in the direction it is introduced into a sink or drain .
The effects of Coriolis - when the rotating earth causes the winds to deflect to the right in the northern hemisphere and the left south of the equator - on baths of water , at whatever distance from the equator , is minimal .
Very large vortices are affected by Coriolis .
The Coriolis force is too weak to affect a system as short - lived as a basin full of water .
Hurricanes and our more familiar areas of low pressure , which originate in different hemispheres , rotate in opposing directions .
Weather warning
From a meteorological perspective , the myth of the equatorial climate always being the same certainly needs to be dispelled .
Regular downpours feed the lush landscape in western Sumatra
Tropical areas along the equator can experience wet and dry seasons while other spots may well be wet for much of the year .
Given that the length of the equator is just short of 25,000 miles ( 40,000 kms ) , there is obvious scope for variety .
Seasonal variation is supplemented by the influences of elevation and the proximity of an ocean .
Life at 5,790 m on the slopes of Volcan Cayambe in Ecuador is very different to that on the Aranuka and Nonouti Atolls in the Gilbert Islands ; both areas through which the equator passes .
Snow lies on the ground in Ecuador , but is in very short supply in the Gilbert Islands .
Precautionary measures
The extent of web debate over equator - related myths is astounding .
And whatever wonders scientific discoveries may hold , I am sure seafarers will continue to pay their dues to King Neptune as they cross the equator for the first time .
The elaborate and often amusingly degrading initiation rituals are a safer bet than falling foul of the King of the Deep .
Well , would you take the chance ?

I have always been fond of the phrase ' work smarter , not harder ' , so I enjoyed my recent read of the book Slack : Getting Past Burnout , Busywork , and the Myth of Total Efficiency by Tom DeMarco .
The main premise of the book is that being 100 % busy ( totally efficient ) provides no capacity for dealing with change .
When change does happen , you will either miss the opportunity it presents , or be forced to react to it , rather than anticipating it .
Slack time is necessary in order to deal with change effectively - ideally proactively - instead of in a reactionary mode where you typically are the victim of change rather than the driver .
Slack time also provides the opportunity to reflect on your current course of action and make corrections .
If you are too busy working harder that you do n't take the time to reflect , you may end up taking suboptimal actions because you have no time to think , just do .
DeMarco makes the analogy of driving a car : efficient is going as fast as possible , while flexibility / adaptability is ensuring you are going in the right direction .
Which would you rather have ?
The same concept is discussed in the book First Things First by Stephen Covey , which I highly recommend reading .
In First Things First tasks are classified according to two dimensions : importance and urgency .
Covey says that we should spend our time on the important tasks before addressing the unimportant .
This seems obvious , but he explains that the natural tendency is to address the urgent tasks , whether or not they are important , which leaves one with no time for the non-urgent yet important tasks .
Part of the difficulty is determining which tasks are truly important : this is aided by having a clear set of goals .
Of course , thinking about goals and the importance of tasks takes time .
And if you are 100 % busy with urgent tasks ( i.e. always fighting fires ) , then you probably feel like you can't afford to spend this time .
In reality , if you are that busy , then you can't afford to not do this , or else you risk never completing some ( all ? ) of the important tasks .
I view the time spent thinking about goals , objectives and task importance as a planning component of time management .
Planning is usually considered a management activity , and everyone needs to manage their time .
So if you are n't doing any planning at all of how you spend your time , it probably is not well managed .
I think that the points DeMarco and Covey make mesh together quite well .
You need to regularly review and update your goals and objectives based on changing circumstances , both internally ( i.e. completing some objectives ) and externally ( i.e. new technology , new competitors , new market ) .
You also need to reflect on your work - the importance of your tasks , how you work , and improvements that can be made .
However , I really do n't like calling this slack time - I consider it an integral part of professional software development .

Cat I ’d like to say hello to our Wiccan community and share with you a photo of my lovely cat , showing off a Wiccan pentagram handmade by me .
It is a light brown pentagram inside of a circle , the color of which resembles earth and its natural healing powers : I have handcrafted this special pentagram and have applied a unique guardian spell on it .
My cat is a British Devon Rex and had n’t been feeling too good – had a problem with the stomach .
I had to do something , because I love this cat very much !
After a week he got much better !
I ’m still wondering if I should make a few more of these Wiccan pentagrams .
What do you guys think ?

Continue reading → About Wicca and Wiccans About Wicca and Wiccans Craftsmanship ( another known term for Wicca ) has several features : 1 . In Wicca there is a hierarchy ( I am talking about classic Wicca , namely Old Faith ) .
In coven ( Wicca Organization ) there are usually primary priest or priestess .
They head the Sabbaths ( Wheel of the year holiday ) .
2 . In Wiccan texts there is a direct reference to the ethical standards ( a commandment ) , which is bound by a witch ( if she is good ) .
3 . In Wicca there are canons of “ netting ” spells , as We believe that we should follow our route , drawing on the experience of those who went before us .
4 . Wicca is very tolerant to other religions , as they believe that all gods are one of the incarnations of the Great Spirit .
5 . Old Faith rejects violence .
The origins of the religion dates back to the days when the main power in the society was in women hands .
The women understand the value of life , as they brought a new life .
The law clearly states that a witch , that preaches Wicca should not kill .
She can do so only on two occasions as motivated by hunger ( this applies to animals ) and in the event of an attack .
6 . The moral of Wicca is very different from Christian .
We ( wiccans ) do not accept slave obedience to God , as in most prayers of the Bible , a direct reference to the absolute god .
Gods are our parents , not owners .
They need love , not subordination .
7 . Wiccan would not suggest other cheek when it get hit .
Although we do not accept violence , but self - defense is acceptable !
8 . We are not alien to human joy .
9 . Wiccans are not extremist , we DO NOT believe in Satan , and we do NOT worship him .
( for Others argues see above ) 10 .
We do not accept the deliberate destruction of the body ( to the issue of drugs , smoking and alcohol , which destroys the body ) .
Yes , we use wine in their ceremonies , but this is happens eight times a year , and it is a very small portion .
The wine in small doses provides therapeutic effect ( it is that small ) .
Yet , it should be noted that Neo Wiccans replace the wine with various juices , which is also acceptable .
11 . Wiccans believe in reincarnation , that is , that our souls after the death of the body ( shell ) does not die , and after a short rest will return to the earth to live again , but in a different body .
Sometimes , the soul enters the country eternal summer , and remains forever with the Great Spirit .
This is due to the fact that their life was righteous and life committed to performing their duty .
The main postulate in Old Faith is the witch credo “ An it harm none , do what you will ” – ( do what you want , just do no harm ) .
For clarity any Wiccan regardless what branch he belonged , had no right to cause any harm ( spiritual , physical , emotional ) , except in case of self - defense .
Each Wiccan believes in the law of three ( “ The rule of three ” ) , which indicates that the damage given will cause three times more damage .
Wiccan of clear mind does not induce black magic ( he is not a suicide bomber ! ) .
This is shortly of what is “ Wicca ” , and in particular the Old Faith .
This small amount of information gives a superficial vision of what is Crafts .

Heron -Centric : Ruminations of a Language Designer
A Brief Description of Cat
by Christopher Diggins
April 24 , 2007
Summary
The Cat programming language version 0.11 has just been released .
I thought I 'd take a moment to talk a bit about what Cat is all about .
Advertisement
The Cat programming language has just released version 0.11.0 at Google code hosting .
The interpreter is released under the MIT license ( due to restrictions imposed by Google code hosting ) while the source code for the interpreter is public domain C# code .
Cat as an Intermediate Language
My original motivation for designing Cat was as an intermediate programming language .
I had studied the .NET Common Intermediate Language ( CIL ) and Java bytecode and I noticed a similarity between these languages and the functional programming language Joy .
The big difference between Joy and most intermediate stack - based languages is the fact that instructions in Joy can all be pushed onto the stack as data .
A trait also shared with the Postscript language .
More Compact / Expressive Code
define map_reduce { [ map flatten self_join ] dip map }
Improved Concurrency
define add_one_to_all_items { [ 1 + ] map }
Type System
Cat as a Teaching Language
Allowing instructions to be pushed onto the stack as data and executed is very powerful .
You can express very complex algorithms using very few commands .
For example a simple version of the Google MapReduce algorithm in just one - line of Cat code :
One advantage of functional languages , is that they make it much easier to express algorithms without specifying superflous sequential dependencies .
In other words it is easier to run functional code concurrently .
For example if I want to express the algorithm for adding one to each element in a list , the assembly code usually specifies a sequence which is not neccessary .
Using higher - order functions we can express the algorithm more accurately as :
The map instruction can be easily implemented to take advantage of multi-core or multi-processor machines .
Joy lacks a type - system , so I designed the Cat language based on Joy but with type - checking in mind .
This restricts some of the operations that are available , but improves the safety and verifiability of code .
Admittedly the current Cat implementation lacks a type - checker but I have formally defined the Cat type system in a technical report .
Having a type - system makes it possible for Cat code to be verified before execution thus improving security and enabling many optimizations .
Types are also very useful as a form of documentation of stack effects , but are not mandatory since they can be inferred by the compiler .
The other role I envision for the Cat language is as a language for teaching programming .
I used as my inspiration the fact that many people first learned programming using RPL on Hewlett Packard calculators .
Stack - based languages have very simple semantics and are very easy to teach .
A popular teaching language for kids is Logo , so I 've added a logo - style graphics library to Cat ( see http://cat-language.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cat/graphics.cat ) .
You can see a screen - shot of the graphics engine in action at http://cat-language.com/screen.png

Some of you may remember when we reported on the 2D Girlfriend , also known as the INBED , a projector that affixes to the ceiling and projects an image of a sleeping body in your bed .
Of course , some of you might want an artificial sleeping partner that is a bit more three - dimensional , and that ’s why the LightMate was invented .
The LightMate is basically a large pillow with a few warming lamps which are presumably there for the user to feel that he or she is snuggling with a warm body .
Judging from the comments that were posted on the INBED article , there will no doubt be comments on this article saying that the LightMate is “ creepy ” .
My only response to that is this : if you are actively pretending that some inanimate object is a sleeping partner , then yes , that is creepy .
However , I know a lot of people who sleep with a body pillow , and nobody thinks that is disturbing , but a simple channeling of our snuggling instinct .
Unfortunately , what designer Francesca Lanzavecchia was attempting with the LightMate was that she wanted to create “ soft anthropomorphic pillows ” .
For those of you who do n’t know what anthropomorphic means , it is “ the attribution of human form , human characteristics , or human behavior to nonhuman things ” .
In this case , it applies to act of pretending a pillow is a sleeping mate .
Of course , this is what designer Lanzavecchia was trying to do by creating “ a mate to hug or a huge companion you can lay on ” .
Okay , that ’s a little creepy , and I think I ’m going to quit now .

Yesterday I highlighted the names of Republican troop haters who voted ( unanimously ) in the Appropriations committee last week to continue to send troops to Iraq before they 're combat ready and fully equipped .
Their shameless and , frankly , traitorous opposition to key provisions of the Defense of the American Soldier Act ought to have their constituents seeing red .
And apparently , it does .
Blue Jersey , on Rodney Frelinghuysen
So in a nutshell , Rodney Frelinghuysen is another GOP poodle whose party line is simple : pin an American flag to your lapel , say you support the troops , and then vote to kill them .
Red State Rebels , on Mike Simpson
It 's time someone started asking Mike Simpson who deserves his loyalty : the troops he 's ordered into harm 's way or his political party 's failed policy .
Michigan Liberal , on Joe Knollenberg
Guess who recently voted against an amendment that would require our troops heading to Iraq to be equipped with the new body armor and certified combat ready ?
If you answered Joe Knollenberg , the same Joe Knollenberg who organized a Support the Troops rally the other day , you 'd be correct .
Vote NO on JOE , also on Knollenberg
We have contacted votevets.org to see what we need to do to modify this so it can be run here so voters know see just how Knollenberg " supports " the troops .
The Albany Project , on Jim Walsh
At best , Jim Walsh ( R - Bushland ) does n't believe that sending our troops into battle in Iraq without being properly equipped , properly trained and without being properly rested will get many of those troops killed .
At worst , he simply does n't care .
Montana Netroots , on Dennis Rehrberg
Dennis was told to vote for it on the party line and he did so .
This was a party line vote in committee and Rehberg voted his party 100 % .
Could this be it ?
Could it be that Dennis Rehberg is a party tool ?
The alternative , as I see it , is that he does n’t give a damn about the troops safety .
In either case , he is putting the troops last .
Intelligent Disconnect , also on Rehrberg
Remember step three of the Dennis Rehberg action plan for Iraq , to vote against the interests of the American military ?
well , he 's back at it again .
The Flypaper Theory , on Zach Wamp
In East Tennessee , in the town of West Gomp , there lived a mad Gooper called Zachary Wamp .
He loved to kill soldiers , he thought it was fun to send them to war with an unloaded gun .
More Flypaper
Theory , on Wamp
Q : What sound does an undertrained , ill - equipped American soldier make when he 's gunned down in Iraq ?
A : Zach !
Wamp !
Down With Tyranny ! on Jerry Lewis and John Doolittle
[ O ] n the 15 votes regarding the well - being of our fighting men and women , the only time Doolittle did n't vote against them was on October 30 , 2003 when he was absent -- and Jerry Lewis -- 3 absences but an otherwise perfect record of undermining the well - being of our fighting men and women .
There are no elected members of either house of Congress as dangerous to our country 's safety and security as John Doolittle and Jerry Lewis .
UPDATE : ArchPundit on Mark Kirk
Do n’t worry , troops .
As soon as you get home , you ’ll be a veteran , and then Mark Kirk will love you .
I ’m hoping and praying that you come home safe and sound .
Too bad Mark Kirk does n’t care .
The Daily Gotham , on Jim Walsh
James
Walsh believes that American soldiers should be sent into combat unready , unarmored , unfit to fight .
James
Walsh does not realize , or does not care , that his ass - kissing of his White House overlord will cost American lives .
James
Walsh , ladies and gentlemen , is a pig .
UPDATE : Seems John Doolittle ( R - CA ) and John Peterson ( R - PA ) mysteriously " missed " the vote last week .
Particularly mysterious because Doolittle was apparently at the markup , but just did n't vote .
Hmm .
Local bloggers , have any of you been able to learn why Doolittle or Peterson ducked their chance to Defend our American Soldiers ?
Hey everyone .
I am here to talk about the wikipedia comment that was left by myself .
I just want to say that it was an incredible coincidence .
Last weekend , I had heard about Chris Benoit no showing Vengeance because of a family emergency , and I had heard rumors about why that was .
I was reading rumors and speculation about this matter online , and one of them included that his wife may have passed away , and I did the wrong thing by posting it on wikipedia to spite there being no evidence .
I posted my speculation on the situation at the time and I am deeply sorry about this , and I was just as shocked as everyone when I heard that this actually would happen in real life .
It is one of those things that just turned into a huge coincidence .
That night I found out that what I posted , ended up actually happening , a 1 in 10,000 chance of happening , or so I thought .
I was beyond wrong for posting wrongful information , and I am sorry to everyone for this .
I just want everyone to know it was stupid of me , and I will never do anything like this again .
I just posted something that was at that time a piece of wrong unsourced information that is typical on wikipedia , as it is done all the time .
Nonetheless , I feel incredibly bad for all the attention this got because of the fact that what I said turned out to be the truth .
Like I said it was just a major coincidence , and I will never vandalize anything on wikipedia or post wrongful information .
I 've learned from this experience .
I just can't believe what I wrote was actually the case , I 've remained stunned and saddened over it .
I wish not to reveal my identity so I can keep me and my family out of this since they have nothing to do with anything .
I am not connected to WWE or Benoit at all in anyway .
I am from Stamford as the IP address shows , and I am just an everyday individual who posted a wrongful remark at the time that received so much attention because it turned out to actually happen .
I will say again I did n't know anything about the Benoit tragedy , it was a terrible coincidence that I never saw coming .
I hope this puts an end to this speculation that someone knew about the tragedy before it was discovered .
It was just a rumor that I had heard about from other people online who were speculating what the family emergency Chris was attending to .
I made a big mistake by posting this comment on his page , since all we had were what we thought was going on and nothing about what actually was going on yet , and sadly what happened turned out to be my speculation at the time .
I assumed wiki would edit out my information , which they did , so thats why I did n't go back to edit it out myself .
I know I keep repeating it but I feel terrible about the mainstream coverage this has received , since it was only a huge coincidence and a terrible event that should of never happened .
I am not sure how to react , as hearing about my message becoming a huge part of the Benoit slayings made me feel terrible as everyone believes that it is connected to the tragedy , but it was just an awful coincidence .
That is all I have to say , I will never post anything here again unless it is pure fact , no spam nothing like that .
Thank you , and let this end this chapter of the Benoit story , and hopefully one day we will find out why this tragedy ever actually happened .
Would you pay to see a monkey 's backside ?
I hope not .
Monkeys will , and I guess that 's okay , though it sounds awfully close to the sort of thing that lands guys in jail here in the human realm .
A new study found that male monkeys will give up their juice rewards in order to ogle pictures of female monkey 's bottoms .
The way the experiment was set up , the act is akin to paying for the images , the researchers say .
The rhesus macaque monkeys also splurged on photos of top - dog counterparts , the high - ranking primates .
Maybe that 's like you or me buying People magazine .
The research , which will be detailed in the March issue of Current Biology , gets more interesting .
The scientists actually had to pay these guys , in the form of extra juice , to get them to look at images of lower - ranking monkeys .
Curiously , the monkeys in the test had n't had any direct physical contact with the monkeys in the photos , so they did n't have personal experience with who was hot and who was not .
" So , somehow , they are getting this information by observation -- by seeing other individuals interact , " said Michael Platt of the Duke University Medical Center .
Next , Platt and his colleagues want to see how people will perform in a similar experiment .
" At the moment , it 's only a tantalizing possibility , but we believe that similar processes are at work in these monkeys and in people , " Platt said .
" After all , the same kinds of social conditions have been important in primate evolution for both nonhuman primates and humans .
So , in further experiments , we also want to try to establish in the same way how people attribute value to acquiring visual information about other individuals . "
Take this Week's Science News Quiz Gallery : The World 's Tallest Buildings
The study , announced Friday , is far from monkey business .
It was sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health and the Cure Autism Now Foundation .
The goal is to learn more about the social machinery of the brain with an eye toward helping autism patients .
" One of the main problems in people with autism is that they do n't find it very motivating to look at other individuals , " Platt said .
" And even when they do , they can't seem to assess information about that individual 's importance , intentions or expressions . "
The monkeys provide " an excellent model for how social motivation for looking is processed in normal individuals , " Platt said .
" And , it 's a model that we can use to explore the neurophysiological mechanisms of those motivations in a way we can't do in humans .
For example , we can use drugs that affect specific neural processes to explore whether we can mimic some of the deficits found in autism in these animals . "
This chapter covers internal details of the Git implementation which probably only Git developers need to understand .
The structured objects can further have their structure and connectivity to other objects verified .
This is generally done with the git fsck program , which generates a full dependency graph of all objects , and verifies their internal consistency ( in addition to just verifying their superficial consistency through the hash ) .
As a result , the general consistency of an object can always be tested independently of the contents or the type of the object : all objects can be validated by verifying that ( a ) their hashes match the content of the file and ( b ) the object successfully inflates to a stream of bytes that forms a sequence of < ascii type without space > + < space > + < ascii decimal size > + < byte\0 > + < binary object data > .
Regardless of object type , all objects share the following characteristics : they are all deflated with zlib , and have a header that not only specifies their type , but also provides size information about the data in the object .
It ’s worth noting that the SHA - 1 hash that is used to name the object is the hash of the original data plus this header , so sha1 sum file does not match the object name for file .
All objects have a statically determined " type " which identifies the format of the object ( i.e. how it is used , and how it can refer to other objects ) .
There are currently four different object types : " blob " , " tree " , " commit " , and " tag " .
A birds - eye view of Git ’s source code
It is not always easy for new developers to find their way through Git ’s source code .
This section gives you a little guidance to show where to start .
A good place to start is with the contents of the initial commit , with :
$ git switch -- detach e83c5163
The initial revision lays the foundation for almost everything Git has today , but is small enough to read in one sitting .
Note that terminology has changed since that revision .
For example , the README in that revision uses the word " changeset " to describe what we now call a commit .
Also , we do not call it " cache " any more , but rather " index " ; however , the file is still called cache.h .
Remark :
Not much reason to change it now , especially since there is no good single name for it anyway , because it is basically the header file which is included by all of Git ’s C sources .
If you grasp the ideas in that initial commit , you should check out a more recent version and skim cache.h , object.h and commit.h .
In the early days , Git ( in the tradition of UNIX ) was a bunch of programs which were extremely simple , and which you used in scripts , piping the output of one into another .
This turned out to be good for initial development , since it was easier to test new things .
However , recently many of these parts have become builtins , and some of the core has been " libified " , i.e. put into libgit . a for performance , portability reasons , and to avoid code duplication .
By now , you know what the index is ( and find the corresponding data structures in cache.h ) , and that there are just a couple of object types ( blobs , trees , commits and tags ) which inherit their common structure from struct object , which is their first member ( and thus , you can cast e.g. ( struct object *) commit to achieve the same as &commit -> object , i.e. get at the object name and flags ) .
Now is a good point to take a break to let this information sink in .
Next step : get familiar with the object naming .
Read the section called “ Naming commits ” .
There are quite a few ways to name an object ( and not only revisions ! ) .
All of these are handled in sha1_name .c .
Just have a quick look at the function get_sha1 ( ) .
A lot of the special handling is done by functions like get_sha1_basic ( ) or the likes .
This is just to get you into the groove for the most libified part of Git : the revision walker .
Basically , the initial version of git log was a shell script :
$ git-rev-list -- pretty $( git- rev- parse -- default HEAD " $ @ " ) | \ LESS= - S $ {PAGER :- less}
What does this mean ?
git rev-list is the original version of the revision walker , which always printed a list of revisions to stdout .
It is still functional , and needs to , since most new Git commands start out as scripts using git rev-list .
git rev-parse is not as important any more ; it was only used to filter out options that were relevant for the different plumbing commands that were called by the script .
Most of what git rev-list did is contained in revision .c and revision.h .
It wraps the options in a struct named rev_info , which controls how and what revisions are walked , and more .
The original job of git rev-parse is now taken by the function setup_revisions ( ) , which parses the revisions and the common command - line options for the revision walker .
This information is stored in the struct rev_info for later consumption .
You can do your own command - line option parsing after calling setup_revisions ( ) .
After that , you have to call prepare_revision_walk ( ) for initialization , and then you can get the commits one by one with the function get_revision ( ) .
If you are interested in more details of the revision walking process , just have a look at the first implementation of cmd_log ( ) ; call git show v1.3.0~155^2~4 and scroll down to that function ( note that you no longer need to call setup_pager ( ) directly ) .
Nowadays , git log is a builtin , which means that it is contained in the command git .
The source side of a builtin is
a function called cmd_<bla > , typically defined in builtin / < bla.c > ( note that older versions of Git used to have it in builtin - < bla >.c instead ) , and declared in builtin.h .
, typically defined in ( note that older versions of Git used to have it in instead ) , and declared in . an entry in the commands [ ] array in git.c , and
array in , and an entry in BUILTIN_OBJECTS in the Makefile .
Sometimes , more than one builtin is contained in one source file .
For example , cmd_whatchanged ( ) and cmd_log ( ) both reside in builtin / log.c , since they share quite a bit of code .
In that case , the commands which are not named like the .c file in which they live have to be listed in BUILT_INS in the Makefile .
git log looks more complicated in C than it does in the original script , but that allows for a much greater flexibility and performance .
Here again it is a good point to take a pause .
Lesson three is : study the code .
Really , it is the best way to learn about the organization of Git ( after you know the basic concepts ) .
So , think about something which you are interested in , say , " how can I access a blob just knowing the object name of it ? " .
The first step is to find a Git command with which you can do it .
In this example , it is either git show or git cat - file .
For the sake of clarity , let ’s stay with git cat - file , because it
is plumbing , and
was around even in the initial commit ( it literally went only through some 20 revisions as cat - file .c , was renamed to builtin / cat - file . c when made a builtin , and then saw less than 10 versions ) .
So , look into builtin / cat - file.c , search for cmd_cat_file ( ) and look what it does .
git_config( git_default_config ) ; if ( argc != 3 ) usage ( " git cat - file [ - t| - s| - e| - p| < type > ] < sha1 > " ) ; if ( get_sh a1 ( argv [ 2 ] , sha1 ) ) die ( " Not a valid object name %s " , argv [ 2 ] ) ;
Let ’s skip over the obvious details ; the only really interesting part here is the call to get_sha1 ( ) .
It tries to interpret argv [ 2 ] as an object name , and if it refers to an object which is present in the current repository , it writes the resulting SHA - 1 into the variable sha1 .
Two things are interesting here :
get_sha1 ( ) returns 0 on success .
This might surprise some new Git hackers , but there is a long tradition in UNIX to return different negative numbers in case of different errors — and 0 on success .
returns 0 on .
This might surprise some new Git hackers , but there is a long tradition in UNIX to return different negative numbers in case of different errors — and 0 on success .
the variable sha1 in the function signature of get_sha1 ( ) is unsigned char * , but is actually expected to be a pointer to unsigned char [ 20 ] .
This variable will contain the 160 - bit SHA - 1 of the given commit .
Note that whenever a SHA - 1 is passed as unsigned char * , it is the binary representation , as opposed to the ASCII representation in hex characters , which is passed as char * .
You will see both of these things throughout the code .
Now , for the meat :
case 0 : buf = read_object_with_reference ( sha1 , argv [ 1 ] , &size , NULL ) ;
This is how you read a blob ( actually , not only a blob , but any type of object ) .
To know how the function read_object_with_reference ( ) actually works , find the source code for it ( something like git grep read_object_with | grep " : [ a - z ] " in the Git repository ) , and read the source .
To find out how the result can be used , just read on in cmd_cat_file ( ) :
write_or_die ( 1 , buf , size ) ;
Sometimes , you do not know where to look for a feature .
In many such cases , it helps to search through the output of git log , and then git show the corresponding commit .
Example :
If you know that there was some test case for git bundle , but do not remember where it was ( yes , you could git grep bundle t/ , but that does not illustrate the point ! ) :
$ git log -- no - merges t/
In the pager ( less ) , just search for " bundle " , go a few lines back , and see that it is in commit 18449ab0 .
Now just copy this object name , and paste it into the command line
$ git show 18449ab0
Voila .
Another example :
Find out what to do in order to make some script a builtin :
$ git log -- no- merges -- diff - filter = A builtin /*.c
You see , Git is actually the best tool to find out about the source of Git itself !
Good things come in small packages , they say .
That 's certainly true when it comes to the Zonbu , a diminutive computer about the size of pocket paper book , that comes loaded with Linux and a ton of free open - source software .
At a starting price of only $ 99 with a two - year subscription , it 's being marketed to home users .
However , Zonbu certainly has more than enough utility to slide nicely into an enterprise setting , especially if your IT department is looking for a low - cost way to experiment with desktop Linux .
The subscription includes automatic backup to an online storage space , but if you are squeamish about the subscription model , you can purchase the unit outright for $ 249 .
Zonbu is not flawless , but the beta version we tested worked reasonably well and required little tinkering or complex configuring to make it work .
No fiddling with drivers , no issues connecting to the Internet .
All in all , it was a very smooth experience .
Although the company imagines its product will be of interest mainly to consumers , after looking at the Zonbu , I think IT pros also could be intrigued .
Out of the Box The first thing you notice when you open the small box is the unit 's size : just 5 " x 6.5 " x 2 " .
It 's hard to believe that this is a fully operating desktop computer , as it takes up the same space as many KVM switches ; it 's actually smaller than my Maxtor USB hard drive .
The only other items in the ( fully biodegradable ) box are a power cord and a small stand .
Documentation is limited to a pamphlet describing the ports , but it 's so easy to set up you do n't really need more .
Looking at the computer from the front , you see a single USB port , the on / off switch and two LEDs : one for the hard drive , and one to prove the unit is on .
Turn the unit around , and you find all the ports necessary to hook up keyboard , mouse , monitor , speakers , network cable and four additional USB ports .
A CF slot houses the 4GB flash hard drive .
The fanless unit is self - cooling and totally quiet , relying on its cover design to allow air inside , yet it remained surprisingly cool .
The configuration includes 512MB of RAM .
Hooking It Up
Setup could n't be more simple .
You connect the keyboard , mouse , monitor , network ( and other USB devices as needed ) and turn it on .
After signing on with a Zonbu - supplied log - in , it configures itself and opens amazingly fast .
Zonbu is based on Gentoo Linux and provides a very familiar looking interface , even for users who have never used Linux before .
The computer is preloaded with open - source software , including OpenOffice , Firefox , Nvu ( a webpage design application ) and just about any application required for a standard desktop computer .
Loading customized corporate applications could be an issue , which may be why Zonbu does not yet market to the enterprise , but you should have no problem connecting to Web - based applications , so long as users can access them with Firefox .
Zonbu recognized my printer as soon as I turned it on , and displayed a configuration window , but the operating system could n't configure it automatically .
I could blame this on beta software or chalk it up to a Linux driver issue .
It 's hard to know .
When I connected an iPod Shuffle , the software recognized it immediately and opened the media player to review the music .
I also immediately connected to the Internet without an issue .
The beta software setup had some issues in testing .
It locked up at times , or slowed way down , requiring a reboot .
But when I created test files , they were immediately backed up to my online storage space .
Zonbu uses Amazon S3 as a backup space for files on the Zonbu computer , giving you the peace of mind of automatic backup along with the ability to access your files remotely via a Web interface .
When the final version of the software is ready , you 'll be able to organize your files by creating folders in S3 , then dragging and dropping files into the folders .
There 's a lot to like about Zonbu , including its three - year replacement warranty .
With your configuration information and all your data backed up in the Zonbu online storage space , when you plug in , you can restore your machine instantly .
As an added plus , Zonbu is environmentally friendly ; the company claims the computer uses a fraction of the electricity of a standard PC , which will cut down on your company 's electricity costs .
The Zonbu is scheduled to be released in late summer or early fall .
Although it 's a consumer - oriented machine , you may want to give it a try .
At only $ 99 , what have you got to lose ?
As promised , here is a summary of the much talked about Neil Gaiman classic , Sandman .
The final panel was supposed to be a much larger harem of goth girls , but it turns out I can't plan panels very well , so I threw in a goat .

The wireless power transmission sheet , shown embedded into a floor .
Credit : Takao Someya
A team of Japanese researchers has created a novel wireless power - transmission device that is thin , flat , and flexible .
Based on a sheet of plastic , the device can be put on desks , floors , walls , and almost any other location , delivering power to electronics placed on or near it without the use of cables or connectors .
The power sheet is described in the April 29 , 2007 , online edition of Nature Materials .
A small Christmas tree lights up when placed on the power sheet .
The electrical components are deposited onto the plastic via state - of - the - art inkjet printing technology using “ electronic ink . ”
The finished product is about one millimeter thick and 21 centimeters square , although power sheets large enough to cover entire walls or floors could potentially be created .
The sheet can deliver up to about 40 watts , enough to power light bulbs and small electronics ( cell phones , clocks , etc. ) equipped to accept wireless power .
The sheet has an impressive 81 percent efficiency , meaning 81 percent of the emitted power is received by devices .
The sheet is a significant step forward for the field of electronics .
Corresponding researcher Takao Someya , a scientist at the University of Tokyo , told PhysOrg.com , “ Our power - transmission sheet addresses two of the issues facing the electronics field : creating ecologically friendly power systems and developing power - transmission technologies that further the imminent trend of ' ambient electronics ' – electronic networks , such as sensors , built into our homes and offices to increase our day - to - day security and convenience . ”
The sheet is an example of “ organic electronics , ” a fast - growing field in which circuits are based on conducting plastics rather than conventional silicon .
Organic electronics have several advantages , including being cheaper to manufacture , more environmentally safe to produce , physically light , and , as in this case , are often thin and bendable .
An LED in water , lit by power from the power sheet , poses no danger to a goldfish .
However , many organic electronic devices can only be integrated into low - power applications because organic transistors have high electrical resistances and cannot handle large amounts of electricity .
By combining organic transistors with a technology traditionally used to fabricate silicon circuits , Someya and his colleagues have boosted the amount of power their organic power - transmission sheet can handle .
The finished product consists of several layers .
These include a layer printed with an array of thin , flat copper coils , which sense the position of nearby electronic devices , and a layer of sender coils that deliver the wireless power .
This process occurs via electromagnetic induction , a physics phenomenon in which a magnetic field can induce a current in a nearby conductor .
Here , a voltage applied across the sender coils produces a magnetic field , which induces current flow in nearby devices that need power , as long as those devices are equipped with receiver coils .
Someya and his colleagues say that any potential safety concerns regarding wireless power , such as electric shock and leakages , have been addressed by coating the power sheet 's sender coils and other electrical components with an insulating material .
They demonstrated the system 's safety by using the sheet to power a light bulb submerged in water .
“ This could lead to a whole new class of water - safe electronics , ” said Someya .

Hello , strangers of the internet .
This page is a gallery of pictures .
The pictures are simple enough : the people in the photos have been digitally removed and replaced with drawings .
Yeah , I know : anyone can trace a drawing .
But so what ?
I am doing it , and you 're not .
Maybe the pictures illustrate the idea that we all want to remove ourselves from life , and replace ourselves with fictional , self - created versions of ourself .
We want to fictionalise our own existence , and impose order and narrative where there is none .
Or maybe it 's just tracing .

A new ranking of Europeâ€™s worst climate - polluting power stations reveals the least efficient power stations in Europe with the biggest emissions of carbon dioxide .
The WWF ranking â€ ” the Dirty Thirty â€ ” lists Greeceâ€™s Agios Dimitrios and Kardia ( owned by DEH ) as the dirtiest power stations , followed by NiederauÃŸem in Germany ( owned by RWE ) .
In 2006 the â€ œDirty Thirtyâ€ ( pdf ) were responsible for 393 million tonnes of CO2 , which is equal to 10 per cent of all EU CO2 emissions .
Europeâ€™s dirtiest power stations are all coal - fired , with the worst ten running on particularly CO2 - intense lignite .
As CO2 emissions are considered the main cause for global warming and devastating climate impacts , it is essential to have a stronger EU Emissions Trading Scheme that delivers significant emissions reductions by encouraging investment in cleaner and more efficient plants .
â€ œThe facts are clear .
The power sector needs to phase out dirty coal as soon as possible , â€ says Stephan Singer , Head of WWFâ€™s European Climate and Energy Unit .
â€ œThis must be done through an improved EU Emissions Trading System , helping the EU achieve its target of up to 30 per cent reduction in emissions by 2020.â€ 
The WWF ranking results from the analysis of 2006â€™s data included in the European Emissions Registry , managed by the European Commission .
The global conservation organization looked at the absolute CO2 emissions of power stations in EU countries ( million tonnes of CO2 per year ) and ranked the 30 biggest emitters according to their level of efficiency ( grams of CO2 per Kilowatt hour ) .
Most of the â€ œDirty Thirtyâ€ are located in Germany and the UK ( 10 plants each ) , followed by Poland ( 4 plants ) .
Just four companies account for most of Europeâ€™s dirtiest power stations .
More than half of the 30 plants analysed are run by RWE ( Germany ) , Vattenfall ( Sweden ) , EDF ( France ) and EON ( Germany ) .
RWE and Vattenfall are also the EUâ€™s largest corporate climate polluters .
â€ œWe cannot tolerate a power sector where the dirtier get richer , â€ adds Singer .
â€ œThe EU must ensure that only those who clean up their power stations reap monetary rewards.â€ 

" Any intelligent fool can make things bigger , more complex and more violent .
It takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction " - E.F. Schumacher
Storyline ( Provided by a reader ) :
This happened in one of the biggest cosmetics companies in Japan .
The company received a complaint that a consumer had bought a soap box that was empty .
Immediately the authorities isolated the problem to the assembly line , which transported all the packaged boxes of soap to the delivery department .
For some reason , one soap box went through the assembly line empty .
Management asked its engineers to solve the problem .
Post - haste , the engineers worked hard to devise an X - ray machine with high - resolution monitors manned by two people to watch all the soap boxes that passed through the line to make sure they were not empty .
No doubt , they worked hard and they worked fast but they spent a lot of time and money to do so .
But when a rank - and - file employee in a small company was posed with the same problem , he did not get into complications of X - rays , etc but instead came out with another solution .
He bought a strong industrial electric fan and pointed it at the assembly line .
He switched the fan on , and as each soap box passed the fan , it simply blew the empty boxes out of the line .

Presidential candidate , Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) appeared on " Meet The Press " this morning and continued his downward spiral into delusion and irrelevance .
With his credibility and campaign circling the drain , McCain 's rhetoric has drawn closer to that of George Bush , repeatedly using such phrases as " consequences of failure " , " they 'll follow us home " and the old debunked standby , " we all had the same intelligence . "
Senator McCain made it quite clear this morning that he would continue to follow directly in the footsteps of President Bush by stating that he , too , would ignore the Iraqi government ( not to mention the will of the American people ) and stay the course in Iraq .

U.S. government ' outsourcing its brain '
RAW STORY
Published : Friday March 30 , 2007 Print This Email This
Due to its increasing practice of contracting out to private firms and agencies , the U.S. government is quickly losing its expertise and competence in vital national security and defense programs , according to a Wall Street Journal report .
" Since the 2001 terrorist attacks and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , the federal government 's demand for complex technology has soared , " writes by Bernard Wysocki , Jr. for the Journal .
" But Washington often does n't have the expertise to take on new high - tech projects , or the staff to oversee them .
" As a result , " he continues , " officials are increasingly turning to contractors , in particular the hundreds of companies in Tysons Corner and the surrounding Fairfax County that operate some of the government 's most sensitive and important undertakings . "
The number of private federal contractors has now risen to 7.5 million , which is four times greater than the federal workforce itself , the report indicates .
Such a trend is leading the government to what Wysocki calls the " outsourcing [ of ] its brain . "
The shift to private firms has not been without its problems , however , with faulty work and government waste becoming rampant .
" Today , the potential pitfalls are legion , " writes Wysocki .
" Big contracts are notorious for cost overruns and designs that do n't work , much of which takes place under loose or ineffective government scrutiny . "
The outsourcing of these government programs " can be a prescription for enormous fraud , waste and abuse , " Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , is quoted as saying during a hearing .
The trend in outsourcing has particularly favored large , established contractors such as Lockheed Martin , Northrop Grumman , and Booz Allen .
Among Booz Allen 's most notable contracts is the Total Information Awareness program , a Defense Department database intended to detect terrorists .
That program has received criticism over concerns of privacy invasion .
Excerpts from the Wall Street Journal report follow ... #
One flashpoint today is whether contractors hire other contractors without enough controls or competition .
In March , Rep. Waxman introduced a bill that would put limits on contracts awarded without competitive bidding .
It passed the House by a wide margin and is raising fears among contractors that it could dent their growth .
Federal procurement is already expected to slow because of budget constraints and the slowing of the post - 9/11 spending boom .
Rep. Waxman 's staff , in a Feb. 8 memo , said that " at least one contractor hired to engage in contract oversight on the border project , Booz Allen Hamilton , may have a conflict of interest with Boeing Co. , " the prime contractor .
Booz Allen has done consulting work for Boeing and has been a member of the Boeing team on other contracts .
Ralph Shrader , chief executive at Booz Allen , flatly denies the charge .
" I take the greatest exception to the idea of conflict of interest , " Dr. Shrader says , adding that Booz Allen is doing " support " and " coordination " work on behalf of the government , and does n't " oversee " Boeing .
He adds that Booz Allen has for decades taken pains to avoid conflicts of interest , and has a rigorous process to avoid such conflicts .
( Dow Jones & Co. , publisher of The Wall Street Journal , has hired Booz Allen to help the company with its news strategy . )

The WHATWG HTML 5 working draft has a specification for a ' video ' element .
I briefly mentioned in a previous post that I was working on implementing this tag natively in Firefox .
The intent is to display Ogg Theora encoded video without needing any plugins , similar to the recent demonstration of Theora playback using a video element by Opera .
Opera have a post about it on their labs page .
I 've made steady progress and can currently display Ogg Theora encoded videos using the video element .
I 've done a screencast of a simple page with a Theora video to give an idea of how it works .
The video looks choppy in the screencast due to the way the screencasting software captures the screens .
It did n't look like that when I played it , honest :-) .
The screencast is also quite large , at about 7MB .
It 's a pity we do n't already have browsers with < video /> support so I do n't have to embed large flash files for screencasts !
The example in the screencast shows a simple video element usage :
< video style = " width :320 ; height : 240 ; " id= " v " src=" test.ogg " ></ video >
The DOM object created by this element has a Javascript API that can control playback .
The button on the page uses this to start the video :
< button onclick =" document.getElementById('v' ) . play ( ) " >
Play </ button >
I 'm not finished with the implementation , and have yet to implement the full WHATWG specification , but it 's coming along nicely .
I 'll post more on my weblog as I get closer to finishing it .
The snippet of video in the screencast is of James Hill playing ' Allegro Con Brio ' on the ukulele .
You can see this and more in the original WMV format on the video page of his website .
James is an amazing ukulele player .
His musics CD's are great and he will apparently be in Auckland , New Zealand in November 2007 to attend the Ukulele Festival of 2007 .
The White House Ca n’t Put Out the Mideast Fires It Ignited
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis
DIGG THIS
Remember when narrow - minded Republican know - nothings launched a hate campaign against French President Jacques Chirac and everything French because Paris would not go along with George Bush ’s jolly little war in Iraq ?
Well , it turns out that Chirac ’s warnings in 2003 that a US invasion of Iraq would set the Mideast on fire , encourage terrorism , and produce a disaster have been tragically born out by events .
Iraq is falling ever deeper into chaos and sectarian conflict .
Outgoing UN Secretary General Kofi Annan calls it u201 Cworse than a civil war .
u201D Lebanon is teetering on the brink of civil war .
The agonies of Palestine — now the world ’s largest outdoor prison — continue without relent .
Iran ’s power and influence are surging , scaring the daylights out of Washington ’s Sunni clients in Saudi Arabia , Jordan , and the Gulf .
For the latter , thank George Bush .
He overthrew two of Iran ’s bitterest enemies , Taliban and Saddam Hussein , then stuck US ground forces in the $ 250 million per day Iraq quagmire that is now estimated to cost at least $ 1 trillion before the United States admits defeat and pulls out .
As Iraq turns into a nightmare of carnage and hate , President Bush and mentor Dick Cheney rushed to Jordan and Saudi Arabia to urge their local allies to pull America ’s bacon out of the fire .
But Iraq ’s hapless u201 Cprime minister , u201D Nuri al - Maliki , presides only over Baghdad ’s US - protected Green Zone .
The US controls what pass for Iraq ’s police and armed forces .
How can Bush expect a powerless figurehead to do what the mighty US cannot ?
At least Malliki had the pluck to make a symbolic protest after humiliating reports leaked in Washington the US intended to dump him .
So much for Iraq u201 Cdemocracy.u201D
Washington may be headed towards installing a ruthless Saddam clone , either the brutal CIA u201 Casset , u201D Iyad Allawi , or some iron - fisted general .
Iraq has no real government or army .
What western reporters and Pentagon spinners term the Iraqi Army is really a collection of Shia militias , death squads , and mercenaries , many former convicts .
The US occupation ’s extensive use of Shia death squads to fight the Sunni resistance has played a key role in igniting Iraq ’s current sectarian bloodbath .
This little - known story is a major scandal .
Meanwhile , Saudi Arabia and Jordan warn they may send troops into Iraq to protect its Sunni minority from ethnic cleansing by the Shia majority .
Such a move could provoke the powerful Turkish Army to invade independence - seeking Kurdish regions of northern Iraq .
Iran would be quickly drawn into the mle .
Iraq ’s neighbors deeply fear its chaos will spread across their borders , with dangerous , unpredictable consequences for all concerned , particularly Jordan , Kuwait , and Saudi Arabia .
The long - awaited Iraq Study Group ’s report comes out this week .
It is expected to call for a phased withdrawal of US combat troops from Iraq , and retention of some u201 Cintervention unitsu201D in neighboring countries .
France ruled its West African empire for a half a century this way : installing compliant puppet rulers kept in power by strategically located French Foreign Legion and Air Force units ready to swiftly intervene at signs of unrest .
The Iraq Study Group will also likely call for direct talks with u201 Caxis of evilu201D members , Iran and Syria .
Their cooperation is essential to stabilizing Iraq .
But a furious , behind - the - scenes battle is raging in Washington between advocates of diplomatic engagement with Damascus and Tehran , and the powerful Israel lobby , which has successfully blocked for decades all attempts to open such badly needed dialogue or press Israel over Palestinian rights .
Israel , its American supporters , and u201CChristian Zionistu201D evangelicals are pushing hard for US attacks on Iran ’s nuclear infrastructure .
In another welcome sign of the expanding purge of neocon extremists from the administration , the odious John Bolton just resigned as UN Ambassador , producing sighs of relief in the world organization .
His main role there was to promote neocon causes , punish the UN for rebuking Israel , and sabotage UN collective undertakings .
Bolton jumped before the new Democratic - controlled Congress made him walk the plank .
A second important neocon , senior Pentagon official Stephen Cambon , was also purged this week .
He played a key role in producing faked intelligence over Iraq for his boss , Paul Wolfowitz , and in engineering the war .
The Pentagon brass is delighted by what they are gleefully terming u201 Cethnic cleansingu201D of the pro-war neocon ideologues from the Pentagon .
So far , so good .
But if and when Washington announces u201 C phased withdrawalsu201D of US forces from Iraq , the already shaky morale of American troops there will plummet .
Who wants to risk life or limb for a phased withdrawal ?
This is exactly what I saw happen to US forces in Vietnam after President Lyndon Johnson announced military victory was no longer his goal .
No GI wanted to be the last soldier killed in a lost war started by bungling politicians .
I organized a protest in officers ’ school over Johnson ’s u201 Cno - winu201D policy that ended up getting 200 of us sent to u201 Cdeath units .u201D
( See my column on Gen .
Ware for more on this interesting story ) .
Once Washington utters the dreaded u201 Cwu201D word — withdrawal — Iraqis working for the US occupation will decamp to the Sunni or Shia opposition .
Iran ’s influence in Iraq will soar .
America ’s Arab allies — nastily described as u201 Cfat womenu201D by a jihadist web site — will panic .
Actually , they are panicking already , and with good reason .
America ’s defeat in Iraq by a bunch of rag-tag Sunni guerillas is going to electrify the Muslim World and jeopardize the continued rule of all the US - backed despots , generals , and feudal monarchs who so badly misgovern the Mideast .
Wherever he is , Osama bin Laden must be smiling broadly .
His master plan is working right on schedule .
But President Bush keeps insisting u201Cno retreat.u201D
He still seems unable to see the writing on the wall in Babylon .

Pentagon kills Rumsfeld ' propaganda ' unit Michael Roston
Published : Friday July 13 , 2007 Print This Email This Current Defense Secretary Robert Gates has scrapped an institution established by his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld to rapidly counter messages in the press that the Pentagon considered negative , according to a report in Friday 's Washington Times .
" Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has shut down a rapid - response press operation run out of the Pentagon speechwriting shop because it is not suited to his style of press relations , " reports Bill Gertz in his weekly ' Inside the Ring ' column .
A former Pentagon official explained to Gertz how the rapid - response unit worked .
" The unit would monitor U.S. and foreign press reports and highlight stories that were ' missing key elements , ' " he writes .
" It then would quickly send information to congressional and press contacts ' so people could see the rest of the story . ' "
Rumsfeld during his tenure spoke vocally about America needing to win its wars in the media as well as on the battlefield .
" [ T ] hese are terrorists and they have media relations committees that meet and talk about strategy , not with bullets but with words , " he warned in a February 2006 speech at the Council on Foreign Relations .
" Theyve proven to be highly successful at manipulating the opinion elites of the world .
They plan and design their headline - grabbing attacks using every means of communication to intimidate and break the collective will of free people . "
The ex-Defense Secretary tried to use torture and inhumane treatment by the US military to prove the imbalance in the press against the United States .
" Consider for a moment the vast quantity of column inches and hours of television devoted to the allegations of unauthorized detainee mistreatment , " he said .
" But weigh the numbers of column inches and hours of television involving that event , for example , against the discovery of Saddam Husseins mass graves , which were filled with literally hundreds of thousands of human beings , innocent Iraqis who were killed . "
And , at the time , he outlined some of the requirements for the Pentagon to respond to such challenges .
" The U.S. government will have to develop an institutional capability to anticipate and act within the same news cycle , " he said in the address .
" That will require instituting 24 - hour press operation centers , elevating Internet operations and other channels of communication to the equal status with the traditional 20th Century press relations .
It will result in much less reliance on the traditional print press , just as the publics of the U.S. and the world are relying less on newspapers as their principal source of information . "
While Rumsfeld 's media response unit is gone , Gertz noted that Gates had some of its operations " folded into other elements of the Pentagon "s public - affairs office . "
Scientists say they have made the world 's strongest nanowire , reaching the theoretical limits of what they haddesigned .
The nanowire , which is about 1,000 times thinner than a human hair , is so strong it could support 16 African elephants if it were scaled up to the size of a child 's finger , says associate professor John Sader from Australia 's University of Melbourne .
Sader is part of an international team of scientists that grew the semiconducting nanomaterial , publishing the results in the journal Nano Letters .
" The ultimate strength we report is the highest recorded for any semiconductor material system and is at the theoretically predicted limit , " says Sader , who was involved in measuring the strength of the wires using an atomic force microscope .
" This indicates that these nanowires are near perfect materials . "
Experts say that such nanowires could one day be used to make electrical and electromechanical devices such as environmental sensors or even ultra-precise clocks .
The nanowires were built from germanium , an element the researchers say has similar chemical properties to tin .
They built the material on a surface coated with gold nanocrystals , which allowed the germanium to nucleate and grow .
Amazing strength
They then tested the strength by placing it across a small trench and manipulating it sideways .
They found it could bend and stretch farther than any nanowire made previously , sustaining 15 gigapascals before snapping .
If the wire were one centimetre in diameter it could hold up to 100 tonnes without breaking , Sader says .
This resilience will result in failproof nanodevices , Sader said , adding it is not theoretically possible to make a stronger nanowire .
" This exhibits the theoretical limits , so this is basically it . "
Paul Mulvaney from the University of Melbourne 's school of chemistry , who was n't involved in the research , says the nanowires could be used as sensors to detect gases , air pollutants or biological agents .
This is because they function as super - sensitive " tuning forks " that change frequency when molecules become attached to them .
" Because the wires are so small , they can detect very small amounts of materials absorbing on to their surface , " he says .
They could also be used as nanoscale metronomes that vibrate in high - frequency timing devices or in computer chips , he says .
Germanium nanowires are also ideal candidates for making optical devices such as light - emitting diodes and tuneable lasers , Mulvaney said .

Kim Jong
Un apologizes for killing of South Korean official
SEOUL , Sept. 25 ( UPI ) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong
Un apologized for the killing of a South Korean fisheries official earlier this week , saying he was " very sorry " for disappointing President Moon Jae-in and the South Korean people .
Here ’s an unwelcome birthday gift for Rudy Giuliani , as he travels around the city raising money : protests from fire fighters and family members of September 11th victims .
They 've shown up in the past at Giuliani 's presidential events .
Today , they ’re gathering in Bay Ridge , and they have plans to follow him nationwide starting sometime around January , according to Jim Riches , a deputy chief with the fire department whose son was killed in the World Trade Center attacks .
“ We have all the UFA , the UFOA , and the fire members are all behind us — the International Association of Fire Fighters , ” said Riches .
“ And we ’re going to be out there today to let everybody know that he ’s not the hero that he says he is . ”
The group ’s complaints center on the faulty radios used by the fire department that day and what they say was a lack of coordination at Ground Zero .
And Riches disputes the notion that Giuliani provided any form of leadership on September 11 or in the days following .
“ If somebody can tell me what he did on 9/11 that was so good , I ’d love to hear it .
All he did was give information on the TV ”
“ He did nothing , ” Riches continued .
“ He stood there with a TV reporter and told everyone what was going on .
And he got it from everybody else down at the site . ”
Emily Lawrimore , a White House spokeswoman , said the surgeon general “ is the leading voice for the health of all Americans . ”
“ It ’s disappointing to us , ” Ms. Lawrimore said , “ if he failed to use this position to the fullest extent in advocating for policies he thought were in the best interests of the nation . ”
Dr. Carmona is one of a growing list of present and former administration officials to charge that politics often trumped science within what had previously been largely nonpartisan government health and scientific agencies .
Dr. Carmona , 57 , served as surgeon general for one four - year term , from 2002 to 2006 , but was not asked to serve a second .
Before being nominated , he was in the Army Special Forces , earned two purple hearts in the Vietnam War and was a trauma surgeon and leader of the Pima County , Ariz . , SWAT team .
He received a bachelor ’s degree , in biology and chemistry , in 1976 and his M.D. in 1979 , both from the University of California , San Francisco .
He is now vice chairman of Canyon Ranch , a resort and residential development company .
His testimony comes two days before the Senate confirmation hearings of his designated successor , Dr. James W. Holsinger Jr. Two members of the Senate health committee have already declared their opposition to Dr. Holsinger ’s nomination because of a 1991 report he wrote that concluded that homosexual sex was unnatural and unhealthy .
Dr. Carmona ’s testimony may further complicate Dr. Holsinger ’s nomination .
In his testimony , Dr. Carmona said that at first he was so politically naïve that he had little idea how inappropriate the administration ’s actions were .
He eventually consulted six previous surgeons general , Republican and Democratic , and all agreed , he said , that he faced more political interference than they had .
On issue after issue , Dr. Carmona said , the administration made decisions about important public health issues based solely on political considerations , not scientific ones .
Math proves that the Buffy universe harbors no more than 512 vampires
One of the most totally fun areas of publishing in recent years has been the emergence of books that probe the scientific bases of fictional universes — like The Physics of Star Tre or The Science of Star Wars .
Thus I was tickled to discover a paper called “ Ghosts , Vampires and Goblins : Cinema Fiction vs. Physics Reality ” , authored by Costas Efthimiou and Sohang Gandi ( PDF here ) .
Among their conclusions ?
Vampires ca n’t exist .
Why ?
Because they ’d quickly depopulate the earth .
To prove it , the scientists do some calculations by picking a random year in history — 1600 , specifically — and imagining what would happen if one person suddenly appeared on earth .
They assume , for the sake of argument , that a vampire needs to feed “ only once a month ” , and that in the course of feeding , the vampire turns its victim into another vampire .
They note that the global population of humans was 536,870,911 in the year 1600 .
Then the calculations begin .
If a single vampire fed on a single human in the first month , this would create two vampires — and decrease the human population by one , leaving it at 536,870,911 - 1 = 536,870,910 .
In the second month , those two vampires would each feed , transforming two people into vampires — so you get four vampires and a human population of 536,870,911 - 3 = 536,870,908 .
So you can see where this is headed .
The vampire population is increasing in a geometric progression , and the population of humans is similarly decreasing — and at that rate , the authors calculate , the entire human population would be transformed into vampires in only 30 months .
QED !
Sure , humans could increase their numbers by having children — but the birth rate could never keep pace .
Thus , the authors ’ implacable logic leads them to only one conclusion :
We conclude that vampires cannot exist , since their existence contradicts the existence of human beings .
Incidently , thelogical proof that we just presented is of a type known as reductio ad absurdum , that is , reduction to the absurd .
Another philosophical principal related to our argument is the truism given the elaborate title , the anthropic principle .
This states that if something is necessary for human existence , then it must be true since we do exist .
In the present case , the nonexistence of vampires is necessary for human existence .
Apparently , whomever devised the vampire legend had failed his college algebra and philosophy courses .
It ’s worth checking out the full paper , if only to see a bigger version of the their spreadsheet ( excerpted above ) showing how the vampire - vs - human population evolves , month - by - month .
This would seem to strike a horrible blow to the whole concept of Buffy the Vampire Slayer , eh ?
And indeed , when this study came out last year , Buffy fans worldwide wept hot , bitter tears .
But wait !
The whole point behind the Buffy universe is that there ’s a slayer out there killing vampires and keeping their population down .
This is something the authors did n’t consider in their paper .
So could n’t a vampire killer simply slaughter vampires as fast as they ’re created ?
Sure — except then the math gets even more interesting .
Because the thing about the Buffy universe is that the population of vampires is reasonably stable .
There are a fair number of vampires around , but not enough to overwhelm the earth .
But as it turns out , if you look at that chart above , there ’s a very narrow vampire - population window at which equilibrium can be kept .
That ’s because powers of two increase slowly at first , then at a hellacious rate .
Think of it this way : According to the numbers calculated by the academics , at month five in the year 1600 , there are only 16 vampires .
That ’s such a paltry number than any self - respecting slayer could quickly dispatch them in a few evenings , and the vampire menace would permanently be extinguished .
But at month 12 — only a few months later — the number of vampires , unchecked , rises to 2,048 .
That ’s probably too many vampires for a slayer to squelch in a single month .
So the really sweet spot seems to be months eight to ten — when the vampire population would range from 128 to 512 , respectively .
Those seem like realistic numbers of vampires for a slayer to kill in a single month , assuming she kills 2 to 8 per night .
With that kill - ratio , a slayer each month could kill enough vampires to knock the population back a month or two .
This would keep the vampire menace sustainable — neither fully depleting it nor letting it race out of control .
So there you go .
I ’ve calculated the precise number of vampires that probably exist in a Buffy universe : No more than 512 .
Granted , this number could change depending on one ’s assumptions of how many vampires a single slayer can kill in a month , or how many slayers exist at any one point in time , or how many other people might be killing vampires in addition to the slayer ( s ) .
I ’m not actually a Buffy fan , so I ’d be interested to hear what other assumptions that more - informed fans might make — and calculations would ensue .

Kacey was grossly overweight
On the day I met her she was racing around her grandparents ' garden in the sunshine , chatting non-stop .
What makes her stand out is her height and size .
As a result of becoming obese when she was still a baby , Kacey has had a premature growth spurt and is now the height of an average 10 - year - old and still weighs five stone ( 31.7kg ) .
Kacey 's weight began escalating when she was barely six months old .
In the red book given to every parent to chart their child 's development you can see the point when Kacey quite literally went off the scale .
Ballooning
Her mother Nadine was terrified to see her baby girl ballooning almost visibly .
" I was scared , worried - because the weight gain was so fast .
It was n't like a couple of ounce , it was like two , three pounds every week .
" And it was getting so fast her breathing was getting bad - she had bad asthma , running around she was getting so breathless . "
If we had n't had cut down on everything she eats - by the time she was eight , Kacey would have been about eight and a half or nine stone
Kacey 's mum
By the time Kacey was 18 months old she weighed more than three stone .
Her parents could barely lift her , and Kacey would n't fit in the child seat of a supermarket trolley .
A whole team of doctors carried out a range of tests which failed to find any underlying medical cause for her condition .
Nadine became increasingly distressed and worried about her daughter , as no - one else in the family had shown the same tendency to rapid weight gain .
Kacey has slimmed down
On holiday at the age of two Kacey looked visibly bloated and large .
The turning point came when Kacey was two .
Her parents decided they had to control what she was eating much more closely .
Nadine drew up a list of healthy foods and told Kacey she had to choose off her special list of " princess " foods .
A typical lunch might now be a bowl of soup with a slice of bread , and a piece of fruit .
Nadine says what prompted them to act was thinking about Kacey 's future .
" If we had n't had cut down on everything she eats - by the time she was eight , Kacey would have been about eight and a half or nine stone .
" It completely frightened me .
When you 're seeing your only daughter and she 's running and getting breathless and you can hear the breathing .
She could n't climb things - it was choking , extremely upsetting to see her like that . "
Gradually over the last two years Kacey 's weight has stayed almost stable and she has grown into it .
Her mum hopes that will continue and by the time Kacey is reaching her teenage years her height and weight will be much closer to the average child .
By taking control of Kacey 's food her parents have transformed their daughter 's future .
SFO nightmare -- 400 stuck on plane 7 hours
airline_012.JPG
Mark Valenta and his wife Noy were supposed to start their honeymoon , but were stuck at the airport trying to sort things out with Cathay Pacific Tuesday evening .
A Cathay Pacific airline flight to Thailand from SFO due to leave early Tuesday morning was delayed more than 7 hours with passengers being stuck on the plane .
They got no explanation why the flight was delayed and then never took off .
Tuesday evening they were still searching for answers at the International terminal at SFO .

Nearly 400 passengers were stranded aboard a Cathay Pacific Airways jet for more than seven hours Tuesday at San Francisco International Airport , adding yet another planeload of angry consumers to a growing industry backlash .
Passengers boarded Flight CX873 to Hong Kong just after midnight Tuesday for a 1:20 a.m. departure .
But the Boeing 747 never left the gate .
" We sat there three hours before they said anything , " said Mark Valenta , a newlywed for whom the flight was to have been the start of a dream honeymoon to Asia .
" Then the PA system went down , the lights were going on and off , babies were crying .
It was a nightmare . "
And it lasted the entire night .
It was n't until 7:30 a.m. that the flight finally was canceled due to equipment problems and passengers disembarked .
Airline officials and the passengers told markedly different accounts of how the hours were passed .
The passengers , for instance , said they were n't offered food or refreshments , except perhaps in business class , and they complained that they were not regularly informed about the cause or expected length of the delay .
The airline , in a written statement , described the evening as something akin to a well - stocked slumber party while the crew scurried to find a part to fix a mechanical problem .
" While still on board , our cabin crew worked to ensure the comfort of passengers providing snacks , beverage refreshments and a hot meal .
Many passengers were asleep on board as we provided refreshments and updates on the delay , " the airline said .
Airlines have been struggling to keep consumers from open rebellion against extended airport delays and diverted flights .
A consumer group has been started by a Napa real estate broker , Kate Hanni , who was trapped on an airplane with her husband while trying to reach Alabama and has been pushing Congress to force airlines to take better care of stranded passengers .
Hanni said she keeps getting caught at more airports while flying to New York or Washington , D.C. , as head of the Coalition for an Airline Passengers ' Bill of Rights .
The group 's hot line -- ( 877 ) 359-3776 -- lit up with the latest outrage at SFO starting Tuesday morning .
Passengers said they were upset not so much because they were stuck in their seats but by a pronounced lack of concern communicated by the airline .
" It 's like the lights are on but nobody 's home , " Valenta said .
The 35 - year - old corporate communications writer for a software company was married Sunday at Fort Mason to Noy Phengrasamy , 33 , an environmental health and safety manager .
The couple planned to honeymoon in Asia .
Instead , they found themselves cozying up with 379 other Cathay Pacific passengers in a marooned cabin , where the mood in the wee hours was anything but romantic .
" They finally said there was some kind of technical issue , but they were not sure what it was , and were trying to resolve it , " Valenta said .
" But the pilot was so nonchalant about it .
There were no snacks , no drinks , nothing . "
While stuck on board , the passengers were free to use the restrooms and the flight crew was polite and apologetic , but otherwise there were few attempts by airline staff to make for a reasonably pleasant wait , passengers said .
They did n't even get to watch a movie .
Eventually , passengers were given the option of exiting about 4 a .m. for juice in the terminal , he said , and about 50 people got off at that point .
The crew finally did tell passengers there was a problem with a hydraulic pump and said a spare had to be flown in from the East Coast .
But it was n't until 7:30 a.m. -- more than seven hours after passengers had boarded -- that the airline finally announced the flight was scrapped .
When they finally disem - barked , the scene was pandemonium , with no airline staff there to direct passengers or indicate how or when their flight would be rebooked , passengers said .
" The real problem was the chaotic customer service , " said passenger Aron Starratt , 49 , a Silicon Valley building contractor .
" Nobody knows what 's going on . "
Eventually , the passengers were given vouchers for free hotel rooms and invited to return Tuesday night for the next flight .
Starratt and the other passengers spoke Tuesday afternoon as they stood before an empty bank of Cathay Pacific check - in counters at the San Francisco airport , having just spent the day in a Burlingame hotel awaiting another flight to Hong Kong .
Valenta and Phengrasamy had planned to spend four days in Thailand before visiting Phengrasamy 's native Laos at the outset of a 2 1/2 - week tour of Southeast Asia .
The Thailand part of the trip was down to two days because of the delay , Valenta said .
But that was before he found out their Tuesday night flight also had been delayed by at least an hour and a half .
Most of the passengers found out about the departure delay only by checking monitors .
After one Cathay Pacific staff person appeared behind an airline counter , he declined to talk on the record and directed annoyed customers back to the main check - in line .
" I 've been flying Cathay for 15 years , " said another stranded passenger , Maria Yee , 44 , a businesswoman based in Manila .
" They are really a very , very efficient airline .
Nothing like this has happened to me ever . "
That was little comfort for the newlyweds , who found themselves worrying about missed connections , paid - for hotel nights and lost quality time on a Thai beach as they waited at the head of a snaking line of anxious travelers .
They kept smiling though , and sounded philosophical .
They credited the airline for keeping safety foremost .
" In the grand scheme of things , we 're going to get on our honeymoon later than we would have liked .
That sucks , but as long as we get there safely , that 's important too , " Valenta said .
It would take more than a mere airport delay to kill the honeymoon spirit .
" It 's not going to take any sizzle out of it , " Valenta said .

The group of young intellectuals who often gathered at Ayn Rand ’s Manhattan home in the early 1950s had a couple of different names for themselves .
One was the “ Class of ’ 43 , ” after the year that Rand published her first successful novel , “ The Fountainhead . ”
Another , with intentional irony , was “ the Collective . ”
To most Americans , still basking in the successes of the New Deal and victory in World War II , government — that is collective solutions — seemed to be working pretty well at the time .
But to Rand and her followers , collectivism was the single greatest problem facing the country .
As they saw it , government programs forced citizens to comply with goals they often did not share while stifling the creative energy of individuals and even laying the groundwork for totalitarianism .
In Rand ’s apartment on East 34th Street , her collective sat around imagining a better , freer world .
The movement remained on the political fringe , however , and not only because its adherents were out of step with the times .
By any definition , they were also a little odd .
As Brian Doherty writes in “ Radicals for Capitalism , ” his history of libertarianism , every member of the group had to subscribe to a series of cultish premises beginning with “ Ayn Rand is the greatest human being who has ever lived . ”
Rand and her protégé Nathaniel Branden began an affair in 1954 , with scheduled liaisons that their spouses were told to tolerate .
Rand later described the group , Doherty writes , as the only “ fully moral , fully happy ” people in human history .
In spite of all this , the group left a deep imprint on the culture in the years to come .
Rand ’s magnum opus , “ Atlas Shrugged ” — Branden and others read portions of the drafts — became a best seller when it was published in 1957 .
Its story of a strike leader who is transformed into a charismatic crusader for individual genius became “ a cornerstone of the modern libertarian movement , ” Doherty writes .
One Rand acolyte was a young economist , Alan Greenspan , whose belief in the power of markets — or , in Randian terms , the power of individual decisions — later helped shape the American economy during his two decades as chairman of the Federal Reserve .
Another young economist , Martin Anderson , who joined the group in the early 1960s , went on to advise Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan and was instrumental in abolishing one of the most notorious collectivist policies of all , the draft .
I just read about the story of a young Army Sergeant by the name of Erik Botta .
Botta is 26 years old and hails from Port St. Lucie .
Erik is like most 1st generation Americans , he wants to work hard and make something of himself and he feels lucky to be in the United States and to have the ability to advance himself .
But young Sergeant Botta , an Army reservist , has a slight problem .
It seems as if every time that he gets comfortable and gets moving on all eight cylinders , he gets sent to Iraq .
Sure , many guys have been sent to Iraq .
They have to make due , right ?
Well this would be true for most , but Botta is getting tired of it , after all he has served in Afghanistan and Iraq on four other tours , this will be his fifth !
Come on , enough is enough !
How many times can a guy kiss his wife and kids goodbye and go to a foreign land and kill people ?
What ’s that done for his marriage ?
What ’s that done to his head ?
Would you feel comfortable being around a guy that spent five tours in a combat zone in less than six years ?
I ’m a retired Army Sergeant myself , and I ’ll tell you point blank , I would n’t .
He could flashback and make a grab at someone ’s throat at the slightest provocation !
Of course I ’m exaggerating here , and I do n’t believe that Erik would do any such thing , but really , what ’s it done to his head ?
Enough is enough .
You ca n’t tell someone to do five hardship tours back to back .
Think of this also , this guy is a Reservist !
He ’s not even on active duty !
Erik has done his share of the fighting .
If Bush wants to send this guy on another tour , then he should go with him .
This is too much .
According to those around him , he could lose his home , and his job at Sikorsky , where he works on the Black Hawk military helicopter .
Even that could be on the line .
He 's halfway to his electrical engineering degree , planning a career in defense work , but his professors say he 'll suffer a significant setback if he is deployed .
He does n't mention the danger another deployment would bring , but his wife and parents do .

If rats benefit from the kindness of strangers they are more likely to assist an unfamiliar rat in future .
In doing so , they provide the first evidence of an unusual form of altruism that appears to violate evolutionary theory .
Claudia Rutte and Michael Taborsky of the University of Berne , Switzerland , trained rats to pull a lever that released food for their partner in the next cage .
If the rats subsequently received snacks released by lever - pulling strangers in neighbouring cages , they were more likely to lever - pull and so feed another unfamiliar rat in the future .

The way forward in the Polish doctors and nurses strike
By Marius Heuser
19 July 2007
The weeks - long strikes and protests by Polish doctors and nurses are threatening to end in defeat .
Although protesting nurses have recently undertaken increasingly desperate measures , including a hunger strike , the right - wing Law and Justice Party government led by Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski has refused to make any concessions .
The response by the nurses ’ own trade union has been to break off all demonstrations and dismantle the protest camp set up in front of the government offices in Warsaw .
For four weeks hundreds of nurses and care personnel manned the protest camp demanding pay rises .
Doctors , who have taken strike action over the last nine weeks , have announced they will continue their action but have now been left increasingly isolated by the abandonment of the struggle by the nurses union .
Hospital personnel have been demanding improvements to the run-down Polish health system and a substantial wage increase .
A Polish nurse with 30 years service earns less than 300 euros a month , while young doctors earn slightly more and most take home around 340 euros .
These are wage levels , which make any sort a decent standard of living for an individual in Poland — not to speak a family — impossible .
As a result thousands of qualified doctors and nurses have emigrated to England , Sweden or other European Union states , where they can earn substantially more .
Following protests in the health service last year the Kaczynski government agreed a general 30 percent wage increase for health workers .
The money , however , was awarded to hospital management , which often used it for the renovation of run-down facilities or the repayment of debts rather than supplementing wages .
The crisis within the healthcare system is symptomatic of the economic situation in the entire country nearly 20 years since the restoration of capitalism .
While a narrow elite has access to the very best medical care and private hospitals , the overwhelming majority of the population is dependent on one of the worst health systems in Europe .
At barely 4 percent of GNP , Poland spends less money on healthcare than any other nation in the European Union .
It is usual practice for patients to wait months for treatment — even in the case of life - threatening diseases — because of the lack of hospital beds .
This situation has led to a system whereby patients are forced to pay large bribes in order to move up waiting lists .
The physical survival of many patients is directly bound up with the size of their wallets .
This state of affairs is the product of the ruthless implementation of the free market in Poland over the last two decades .
Up until the collapse of the Stalinist system in 1989 , the Polish constitution of 1952 guaranteed every worker the right to comprehensive and free medical treatment — even though in practice it became increasingly difficult for workers lacking connections to the bureaucracy to realise their entitlements .
The restoration of capitalism , which transferred nationalised state property into the possession of the new elite , resulted in a series of devastating cuts in health service .
At the same time additional funding reductions were made to trim the country ’s budget for entry into the European Union .
Brussels not only demanded the break - up of the country ’s agricultural and mining industry , but cuts in the national budget .
The ratio of hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants subsequently decreased from 6.7 in 1980 to 4.6 in 2002 .
In one year alone — 1991 — nearly 100 hospitals and health centres , i.e. , 2,500 hospital beds , were slashed .
In 1999 the conservative government of Election Action Solidarity ( AWS ) replaced the former , dilapidated state guaranteed healthcare system with a regionally organized obligatory insurance , requiring every citizen to contribute 7.5 percent of his income , irrespective of income level .
This meant hospitals were no longer financed directly by the state , but through health insurance companies .
The result was a drastic supply crisis and a further decline in wages and numbers of personnel .
In 2001 the post -Stalinist Democratic Left Alliance ( SLD ) government replaced the regional funds by a National Health Fund ( NFZ ) , which basically operated on the same system and only served to deepen the crisis .
Hospitals were treated as if they were private companies , which had to negotiate a certain percentage of private treatment in order to subsidise treatment for the rest of the population .
The way in which the meagre funds were distributed was then left to the discretion of the hospital management .
This represented a major step towards the privatisation of the health system .
At the same time , the number of private hospitals shot up .
Speaking on behalf of a private health company , Medicover , Bartosz Maciejewski boasted that his company already had 280,000 customers and the number was increasing .
The latest protests by doctors and nurses are not only directed at improving their miserable wages , but also reflect their alarm at the state of the health system .
Individuals motivated by the desire to care and heal have been forced to look on as increasing obstacles are put in the way of their work .
This also explains the high level of solidarity within the population for the medical personnel .
According to one poll , 75 percent of the population support the demands of the doctors and nurses .
Nurses at the protest camp reported complete strangers coming to bring them food and beverages .
When the police moved in to forcibly break up a protest by nurses , thousands of miners and railway workers spontaneously travelled to Warsaw to protect the nurses against police brutality .
The government led by Kaczynski is very conscious of the significance of the protests as an expression of the fundamental contradiction between the demands of workers and the reality of modern capitalism in Poland .
After seeking to appease workers one year ago with a 30 percent wage increase , the government is now going on the offensive .
It has stated that the doctors ’ demands would cost 2.7 billion euros and exceed the budget limit laid down by the EU .
Prime Minister Kaczynski explained that any concession by the government would “ massively undermine the confidence of other European Union states in the country . ”
The prime minister even went so far as to claim that the strikers were “ being manipulated by foreign forces . ”
In hysterical religious tones , Kaczynski warned against “ the devil ’s work ” and his party colleague Tadeusz Cymanski went further in a later interview , saying the government was in “ a struggle against evil , the powers of darkness . ”
The rhetoric of the Kaczynski brothers cannot hide their utter cynicism .
When it suits their own interests they are prepared to play the nationalist , anti-EU card , but when it comes to the doctors ’ wages they solidarise with the EU and its budget limitations .
In line with its “ struggle against evil ” the government sent in police to brutally break up a completely peaceful demonstration by nurses .
“ You treated us like criminals ... like hooligans in a stadium ” was the reaction of the president of the Polish Nurses Union , Izabella Szczepaniak .
Several injured women had to be treated in hospital while Kaczynski and his health minister Religa have made clear that they regard the protests by nurses and doctors to be illegal and the deployment of police entirely justified .
During the last two years the government has been preparing for precisely such a confrontation with workers .
The Kaczynski brothers ( twin brother Lech is president ) have filled strategic posts in the entire state apparatus with their own supporters .
They have brought the national media under their direct control and created an institution — the Central Anti-corruption Office ( CBA ) — which is directly subordinate to the prime minister and unites the police with Polish intelligence agencies .
Recently the CBA accused the right - wing populist and head of the Kaczynski ’s coalition partner Samoobrona ( Self - Defense ) , Andrzej Lepper , of corruption and thereby sought to put pressure on his organisation .
Lepper had sought to correct the plunging levels of support for his party by expressing some sympathy for the striking hospital personnel .
Flanked by a deliberate campaign of misinformation in the press against the strikers , the government is planning further attacks on the health system by forcing through privatisation .
Jaroslaw Kaczynski has already announced plans for a national referendum on the question of the privatisation of the hospitals and stated that the question must be discussed , otherwise public finances would be bankrupted by the workers ’ wage demands .
“ That would be absolutely irresponsible , ” he concluded .
Upon taking over his post two years ago the Polish Health Minister Zbigniew Religa , ( an independent with close links to the neo- liberal opposition party Citizen ’s Platform — PO ) declared his main priority was the setting up of a private health insurance system .
While promising increased funding for hospitals , the reality of his two years in office has been merely to legalize the practice of bribery for medical treatment .
Those with enough money to insure themselves privately receive premium medical care , while the rest of the population must wait patiently on a list for the chance of a place in an overcrowded ward under miserable conditions .
The latest plans by the Kaczynskis for the complete privatisation of the hospitals mean an inevitable further deterioration of healthcare for the majority of the population , of whom 12.8 percent subsist on an income of 100 euros per month or less .
The trade unions have neither the means nor the intention of opposing the frontal attack made by the government .
From the very beginning they sought to demobilise health workers by presenting their struggle as purely of an economic nature .
The vice - chairman of the National Doctors ’ Trade Union ( OZZL ) , Tomasz Underman , stressed on several occasions that its protests should under no circumstances be considered a political strike .
The OZZL has even declared that it is in principle not opposed to the privatisation of hospitals .
The doctors ’ union reacted in a conciliatory fashion to the government ’s refusal to contemplate wage increases and its declaration that the strikes were illegal .
At the same time the public were told that President Lech Kaczynski was simply not informed about the situation in the hospitals and would probably support the demands of the health workers in future .
Now the nurses union has suspended its protests without any palpable results .
To the extent that trade union leaders play down the attacks being carried out by the government and suppress the political questions involved in the strike — in particular the restructuring of the health service — they are consciously creating the conditions for the defeat of the strike .
Even if they achieve a wage increase of few percentage points — an event which would be presented by the trade union as a “ success ” — this would merely represent hush money aimed at paving the road to complete privatisation with catastrophic consequences both for the majority of health workers and the population at large .
The conciliatory stance of the trade unions has already led some health sector workers to attempt to break out of the bureaucratic straitjacket .
In a protest carried out without the sanction of the OZZL , 200 doctors at a large Warsaw hospital occupied a street adjoining their place of work .
The leader of the hospital ’s strike committee , Maciej Jedrzejowski , explained later that the action had been an expression of despair and frustration on the part of doctors .
While such militant actions outside of the organizational control of the trade unions are to be welcomed , they are insufficient to combat the combined forces of the Polish government , state and media , which requires a political struggle by the working class .
At the same time , the Kaczynski government is very weak , having been voted into power by a small majority of the electorate and only retains power through the continuous shifting of seats and positions within its shaky coalition of right - wing parties .
Opinion polls demonstrate that the former limited support for the government is sinking even further .
This government is only held in power by the complete lack of any effective opposition .
Millions of workers have only contempt for the Kaczynskis , but still recall with dread the policies and rule of the party which held the reins of power longest following capitalist restoration — the post - Stalinist SLD .
Any effective movement against the government must draw a balance of capitalist restoration — including the role played by the Solidarity movement in preparing for such a restoration — and its political helpers over the past two decades , in particular the SLD and the Polish trade union bureaucracy .
Polish health workers must develop their own broad political movement , turning to other sections of workers including miners , teachers and railway workers .
At the same time , they should strive to establish links with their European and international colleagues on the basis of a struggle to repulse all attempts at privatisation in order to defend what remains of the Polish health and welfare system on the basis of a genuine socialist program .
It ’s been 25 years since the release of the iconic movie , Ferris Bueller ’s Day Off .
Here , from our archives , is writer Erin Dionne ’s take on that 80s classic .

P O P C U L T U R E
The Simplicity of Ferris Bueller
By Erin Dionne
Lately , it seems that I ca n’t escape Ferris Bueller .
The movie Ferris Bueller ’s Day Off , which first opened on June 11th , 1986 , has been in regular cable network rotation , and it recently reappeared on the big screen at a local cinema as part of a John Hughes film festival .
Before the movie started , a gaggle of writers spoke about the impact Hughes movies had had on their lives .
They were contributors to the anthology Do n’t You Forget About Me : Contemporary Writers on the Films of John Hughes , edited by Jaime Clarke ( Simon Spotlight Entertainment , 2007 ) .
While waiting for the movie to start , I was struck by some of the panelists ’ interpretations of the film .
Steve Almond , prolific author and creator of the essay “ The Unexpected Heaviosity of Ferris Bueller ’s Day Off ” for the anthology , had a great deal to say about Ferris ( which he admittedly never saw as a teen ) .
One of his points revolved around the observation that Ferris marked the onset of slacker culture in America — the whole , “ taking the day off and not doing anything ” life model .
I wondered if he ’d seen the film at all .
Ferris Bueller is probably the antithesis of slacker culture .
Ferris , instead , is the epitome of the 1980s suburban lifestyle and capitalism .
He ’s a high school mover and shaker .
He works the system to get exactly what he wants , when he wants it .
Just because he takes the day off from school does n’t mean Ferris is a slacker ; he ’s using the day to its best advantage .
Instead of sitting in the stultifying classroom listening to Ben Stein ’s explanation of voo - doo economics , Ferris hits the town to enjoy the benefits of his free time .
I had to check out Almond ’s essay to see what else he thought of the film .
Almond , from the beginning , explains that “ it was …the most sophisticated teen film I had ever seen .
I was n’t entirely sure if qualified as a teen film at all ” ( p.5 ) .
From there , he delves in to Ferris Bueller ’s plot elements and chronicles Cameron ’s breakdown , analyzing his “ experience of pleasure [ as ] an ongoing battle against anxiety ” ( p. 11 ) .
With the weight of the film placed squarely on Cameron ’s shoulders , Almond minimizes the importance of Ferris ’s character , citing him at times as “ nebbishy ” and a “ fabulous cartoon . ”
He also makes the film more complicated than it needs to be .
True , Ferris ’s larger - than - life persona more than pushes the edges of believability , but his outlandishness illustrates the very real flaws of those around him — his parents , so work - obsessed that they do n’t recognize their son ’s lies or daughter ’s needs ; Principal Rooney , focused with laser - like precision on taking Ferris down ; Cameron , mired in anguish over his relationship with his parents ; and Jeanie , stewing in jealousy at her brother ’s antics and peer acceptance .
Ferris shows the audience an alternate , and , some could argue , better extreme –the devil - may - care attitude that allows him to embrace what his life currently is before making the transition to college .
He ’s milking those last perfect days of high school before the world as he knows it ends .
Today , we ’d label Ferris ’s actions with the buzzwords “ living in the moment ” or “ being present . ”
The character of Ferris also serves as the conduit for the film ’s story .
Much like Nick in The Great Gatsby , Ferris is the vehicle through which the audience witnesses Cameron and Jeannie ’s changes .
Almond is correct in one regard — Cameron , more than Ferris , is the focus of the movie .
Ferris , unlike Nick , also serves as the catalyst of the piece .
It is he who puts the plot in motion and causes Cameron and Jeanie ’s breakdown and realizations , respectively .
And Ferris did it on purpose .
At one point , Sloane remarks , “ You knew what you were doing when you woke up this morning . ”
It ’s Hughes ’ big wink to the audience .
Of course Ferris knew what he was doing — he planned the day so he can leave high school secure , knowing Cameron and Jeanie will be okay once he moves on .
Although Steve Almond had the best of intentions in elevating Hughes ’ teen drama to the sophisticated level of a psychoanalytic teen angst therapy session , I still believe he missed the mark .
The beauty of the film is in its simplicity , which is what Ferris extols all along : “ Life moves pretty fast .
If you do n’t stop and look around once in awhile , you could miss it . ”
And if you look too deep or too long , you might miss something , too .

Read an opposing take on gun control from journalist Tom Plate : Let 's lay down our right to bear arms
WACO , Texas ( CNN ) --
Zero tolerance , huh ?
Gun - free zones , huh ?
Try this on for size : Columbine gun-free zone , New York City pizza shop gun-free zone , Luby 's Cafeteria gun-free zone , Amish school in Pennsylvania gun-free zone and now Virginia Tech gun-free zone .
Anybody see what the evil Brady Campaign and other anti-gun cults have created ?
I personally have zero tolerance for evil and denial .
And America had best wake up real fast that the brain - dead celebration of unarmed helplessness will get you killed every time , and I 've about had enough of it .
Nearly a decade ago , a Springfield , Oregon , high schooler , a hunter familiar with firearms , was able to bring an unfolding rampage to an abrupt end when he identified a gunman attempting to reload his .
22 - caliber rifle , made the tactical decision to make a move and tackled the shooter .
A few years back , an assistant principal at Pearl High School in Mississippi , which was a gun- free zone , retrieved his legally owned Colt .45 from his car and stopped a Columbine wannabe from continuing his massacre at another school after he had killed two and wounded more at Pearl .
At an eighth - grade school dance in Pennsylvania , a boy fatally shot a teacher and wounded two students before the owner of the dance hall brought the killing to a halt with his own gun .
More recently , just a few miles up the road from Virginia Tech , two law school students ran to fetch their legally owned firearm to stop a madman from slaughtering anybody and everybody he pleased .
These brave , average , armed citizens neutralized him pronto .
My hero , Dr. Suzanne Gratia Hupp , was not allowed by Texas law to carry her handgun into Luby 's Cafeteria that fateful day in 1991 , when due to bureaucrat - forced unarmed helplessness she could do nothing to stop satanic George Hennard from killing 23 people and wounding more than 20 others before he shot himself .
Hupp was unarmed for no other reason than denial - ridden " feel good " politics .
She has since led the charge for concealed weapon upgrade in Texas , where we can now stop evil .
Yet , there are still the mindless puppets of the Brady Campaign and other anti-gun organizations insisting on continuing the gun- free zone insanity by which innocents are forced into unarmed helplessness .
Shame on them .
Shame on America .
Shame on the anti-gunners all .
No one was foolish enough to debate Ryder truck regulations or ammonia nitrate restrictions or a " cult of agriculture fertilizer " following the unabashed evil of Timothy McVeigh 's heinous crime against America on that fateful day in Oklahoma City .
No one faulted kitchen utensils or other hardware of choice after Jeffrey Dahmer was caught drugging , mutilating , raping , murdering and cannibalizing his victims .
Nobody wanted " steak knife control " as they autopsied the dead nurses in Chicago , Illinois , as Richard Speck went on trial for mass murder .
Evil is as evil does , and laws disarming guaranteed victims make evil people very , very happy .
Shame on us .
Already spineless gun control advocates are squawking like chickens with their tiny - brained heads chopped off , making political hay over this most recent , devastating Virginia Tech massacre , when in fact it is their own forced gun-free zone policy that enabled the unchallenged methodical murder of 32 people .
Thirty - two people dead on a U.S. college campus pursuing their American Dream , mowed - down over an extended period of time by a lone , non-American gunman in possession of a firearm on campus in defiance of a zero - tolerance gun ban .
Feel better yet ?
Did n't think so .
Who does n't get this ?
Who has the audacity to demand unarmed helplessness ?
Who likes dead good guys ?
I 'll tell you who .
People who tramp on the Second Amendment , that 's who .
People who refuse to accept the self - evident truth that free people have the God - given right to keep and bear arms , to defend themselves and their loved ones .
People who are so desperate in their drive to control others , so mindless in their denial that they pretend access to gas causes arson , Ryder trucks and fertilizer cause terrorism , water causes drowning , forks and spoons cause obesity , dialing 911 will somehow save your life , and that their greedy clamoring to " feel good " is more important than admitting that armed citizens are much better equipped to stop evil than unarmed , helpless ones .
Pray for the families of victims everywhere , America .
Study the methodology of evil .
It has a profile , a system , a preferred environment where victims cannot fight back .
Embrace the facts , demand upgrade and be certain that your children 's school has a better plan than Virginia Tech or Columbine .
Eliminate the insanity of gun- free zones , which will never , ever be gun-free zones .
They will only be good guy gun- free zones , and that is a recipe for disaster written in blood on the altar of denial .
I , for one , refuse to genuflect there .

Below you will find a small selection of these e-mails , some of which have been edited for length and spelling :
Travis Carollo , Sullivan , Missouri
I agree 100 percent .
The only thing anti-guns laws will prevent is normal law - abiding citizens from owning them .
Criminals will always find a way to obtain a gun .
They are criminals .
They will never follow the law .
Way to go Nuge !
Doug , Houston , Texas
Frankly I got sick in my stomach reading Mr. Nugent 's article .
According to Mr. Nugent , the solution is very simple :
All citizens should be armed and the world would be a much safer place .
Let 's take a moment to think about the implication of this .
The criminals are not dumb .
If we average law - abiding citizens were allowed to freely purchase weapons , the criminals would do everything they could to ensure they have the upper hands on their firepower .
Of course , we would immediately do the same to regain our upper hands .
What then would you think the criminals would do in return ?
Kathy Culley , Virginia Beach , Virginia
Ted has hit the nail on the head .
Making the right to bear arms illegal is only illegal for the " good " guys .
The " bad " guys will always have access through their illegal ways .
Just thinking that someone may be carrying a gun might deter would - be killers out of their heinous crime .
Way to go Ted for speaking out for our American rights !
Nita Olson , Florence , Mississippi
I believe he is right !
I 'm not fond of guns , but I believe we should have the right to bear arms and protect our loved ones .
I , for one , would not hesitate to shoot someone trying to enter my house , car , etc.
Reason being you ask ?
If the " suspect " is entering my home , armed with a gun , then I feel no remorse about shooting someone who is coming into my " zone " with the intent of hurting / killing me or family and taking things that I have worked hard for and will not give it up " because it can be replaced . "
Joe Russo , Staten Island , New York
Ted Nugent really has a twisted way of looking at the violence that seems to regularly plague us .
As a hunter and gun owner , I do believe in our right to bear arms .
However , that right should not include hand guns and assualt weapons .
Josh Munford , Lincoln , Nebraska
Simply stated , Ted Nugent is right .
The fact of the matter is that these anti-gun activists have created more problems .
Evil will always find a way and giving them more opportunity by creating " anti " laws in all reality protects them .
It 's common sense to a criminal : " Law - abiding citizens wo n't be prepared here or here or here , so I 'll be able to create the most destruction , panic and chaos there . "
What are you thinking by creating anti-gun laws , and gun free zones ?
Linda , Plymouth , Michigan
To back up Ted 's points , when have we ever heard of a gunman killing 32 people in a police station ?
How about at an Army Base in Michigan ?
Nope .
How about at the local shooting range ?
Tons of guns there , you 'd think there 'd be mass killing there every other weekend with all the guns ... oh wait ... at all those places the victims would be armed and would shoot back .
An armed gunman would n't get out more than one shot , if that , before being stopped .
John Thatamanil , Nashville , Tennessee
" A God - given right to bear guns ? " Dear Mr. Nugent , which God , pray tell , are you speaking about ?
Surely not Jesus , you know , the one who said , " He who lives by the sword dies by the sword . "
Frankly , I find Mr. Nugent whatever God he claims to worship terribly frightening .
Stick to rock , Mr. Nugent , you are terrifically good at that !
Fired New Mexico U.S. Attorney David Iglesias has come out with a New York Times op - ed that LithiumCola paraphrases as saying
" Thank you , President Bush , for thanking me via television , from your house .
Upon reflection , I have decided not to find this entirely satisfactory .
I will be requiring , in writing , an admission of chicanery , now . "
Iglesias explains how he viewed the politics of his position :
United States attorneys have a long history of being insulated from politics .
Although we receive our appointments through the political process ( I am a Republican who was recommended by Senator Pete Domenici ) , we are expected to be apolitical once we are in office .
I will never forget John Ashcroft , then the attorney general , telling me during the summer of 2001 that politics should play no role during my tenure .
I took that message to heart .
Little did I know that I could be fired for not being political .
He then points a finger squarely at New Mexico Senator Pete Domenici and Representative Heather Wilson :
Politics entered my life with two phone calls that I received last fall , just before the November election .
One came from Representative Heather Wilson and the other from Senator Domenici , both Republicans from my state , New Mexico .
Ms. Wilson asked me about sealed indictments pertaining to a politically charged corruption case widely reported in the news media involving local Democrats .
Her question instantly put me on guard .
Prosecutors may not legally talk about indictments , so I was evasive .
Shortly after speaking to Ms. Wilson , I received a call from Senator Domenici at my home .
The senator wanted to know whether I was going to file corruption charges — the cases Ms. Wilson had been asking about — before November .
When I told him that I did n’t think so , he said , " I am very sorry to hear that , " and the line went dead .
A few weeks after those phone calls , my name was added to a list of United States attorneys who would be asked to resign — even though I had excellent office evaluations , the biggest political corruption prosecutions in New Mexico history , a record number of overall prosecutions and a 95 percent conviction rate .
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is trying to see to it that Wilson pays a political price for that illegitimate political pressure ; the New York Times is reporting that the DCCC has already begun running radio ads focusing on the scandal :
The 60 - second commercial , to be broadcast for five days in her district , begins with a ringing telephone .
" A phone call is made , " the announcer says .
" A scandal begins . "
The spot includes Mr. Iglesias ’s voice before a Congressional panel as he recounts Ms. Wilson ’s call and her question about " sealed indictments . "
" Serious questions remain about Heather Wilson and violation of Congressional ethics rules , " the announcer says .
While it 's good to hear that Democrats are moving to heighten the electoral costs of Wilson 's actions , though , there 's something else they could do .
As DavidNYC posted more than ten days ago , although CREW has filed an ethics complaint against Wilson , it takes a complaint from a member of the House to actually force an investigation , and so far , none have complained .
If they 're willing to run ads against her , why are they not willing to formally investigate ?
It might be time for another round of friendly requests to your Democratic representatives that they file an ethics complaint against Wilson .
Late Update : Here 's the DCCC ad .
Pandora will no longer be available to many users outside of the US
Mounting pressure from record labels has forced the company to stop streaming music to countries where licensing deals have not been agreed .
In the US , web music is licensed under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act , but to stream legally abroad , licences must be agreed with the rights holders .
Pandora founder Tim Westergen said he was " deeply sorry " to non-US users .
In an e-mail to registered listeners outside of the US , he said : " Other than in the UK , we have not yet been able to make significant progress in our efforts to obtain a sufficient number of international licences at terms that would enable to run a viable business . "
Pandora has always been labelled a US - only service .
However , this was easy for listeners outside of America to circumvent because all that was required to register was a US zip - code .
Now , from Thursday 3 May , Pandora will check a listener 's country of origin by looking at their computer 's IP address - the unique number which will identify the country in which the PC has connected to the net .
Devastating
Pandora along with many other US webcasters is also facing pressures from a forthcoming increase in royalty fees put forward by the Copyright Royalty Board ( CRB ) .
This was due to come into place on 15 May , but it has now been put back until 15 July .
The new fees , which will apply until 2010 , will charge a flat fee per-song , per-user in addition to a $ 500 fee for every channel owned by a station .
Fees will increase every year until 2010 .
The American Federation of Television and Radio Artists welcomed the forthcoming changes to the royalty system , stating artists " deserve to be paid fairly for the use of the creativity , talent , and hard work they put into making that product " .
But lobby group SaveNetRadio.org has said the hike in royalty could be the death knell for the industry .
It welcomed the two - month " reprieve " and has said it will " continue our fight to free internet radio from these devastating fees " .
Big cities pack a punch equal to some national economies .
The GDP of Tokyo or New York , for example , is broadly similar to that of Canada , a G7 country .
The two cities followed by Los Angeles will hold their position at the top of the table in 2020 , according to forecasts from PricewaterhouseCoopers , an accountancy firm .
However , London will pass Paris and Chicago to take fourth place thanks to buoyant expansion in business and financial services .
At present , the top 15 city economies are dominated by those in the developed world .
But by 2020 , São Paulo will have elbowed its way into the premier league as part of a trend for those in emerging economies to move up the rankings .
Got a call from an ac repair company in McDonough Ga .
They wanted to learn more about Ubunto and if it would work for their HVAC business .
As you would expect they had questions about Ubunto since not many people ever heard about it before .
Apparently , one of their commercial air conditioning clients used it and it peaked their curiosity .
We shared the following :
1- Ubunto is open source code .
This means you do n’t have to Microsoft for the privilege of using their Windows program every time a new version comes out .
Remember that this gets very costly if your business has multiple computers .
2- Ubunto is n’t bloated like Windows .
This means your computers run faster and smoother .
3- Ubuntu is an open source software operating system that runs from the desktop , to the cloud , to all your internet connected things .
What about business software ?
So JSC Enterprises has certain software they use for their heating and air business .
Software for accounting , purchasing , maintenance contracts and estimates .
They were concerned about not being able to use these programs on Ubunto .
Here is the good news …
First of all , several of these programs are available online .
For instance Evernote has a web portal you can access the software without downloading it .
What about unique windows software for their industry ?
Here is where wine comes in handy … .
Not the wine that comes in a bottle , but the program that allows you to run windows based software on your ubunto server .
This means you can have the best of both worlds .
Lessons learned
Most small business owners have never heard of Ubunto or Linux for that matter .
This means as computer geeks we have to educate them on the differences and the benefits to the business owner .
It also means we will have to provide training and support .
In the end it means happy customers for many years to come .
Ron Paul Interview Excerpts
WHY HE'S RUNNING :
I am arguing that ( Republicans ) have lost their way .
Right now , on the surface , a lot of Republicans in Washington will be critical of my positions , saying " I do n't support the president or the party , " but if you look at our platform , our state platforms , our policy positions , I would say we have lost our way .
And quite frankly , I have not seen anybody running for the presidency on the Republican ticket that 's actually offering to stand up and stand for the principals the Republican Party has been built on .
Advertisement
In the past six years , when the foreign policy really changed , when we accepted the notion of pre-emptive war , a strong violation of our personal civil liberties , ( we ) at the same time ( became ) the party of entitlements , doubling the size of the Department of Education , McCain - Feingold .
These are all things that Republicans used to criticize and not support , and all of a sudden we accept them .
In essence , we have accepted what has traditionally been the Democratic platform -- increase entitlements and foreign intervention , getting involved in quagmires abroad .
IRAQ :
The president , if we are attacked or there is an imminent threat , has the authority to go to war .
That 's been clearly understood since the Constitution .
...
The president , as commander in chief , can defend his country in times of emergency .
But you know what ?
That has never happened in all these years .
Even with the Soviet threat .
...
Under today 's conditions , the policy has significantly changed for the worse .
That is , we now have established that our policy is to pre-emptively strike a country that has not attacked us and is not a threat to us .
We just want to go in and have regime change .
We ought to look to the Constitution .
...
We should only fight when there is a declaration of war , when there is an extreme circumstance .
We should not have all options on the table to attack Iran when they do n't have a weapon .
We should n't finance bad policy or unconstitutional war .
IMMIGRATION :
The problem of illegal immigration is one of the top issues in this country .
...
People are really , really disgusted with it .
I think the immigration problem is in some ways a symptom .
And my position is that if you subsidize something , you get more of it .
And we subsidize and encourage illegal immigration .
It started in the 1980s when amnesty was given after illegals came here .
Amnesty , ... I do n't like that idea ; I do n't want to reward those who are already here .
I do n't think anybody has an easy answer about what to do with those who are already here .
I think we ought to enforce the law , but what kind of an army would you need to round them up ?
I also do n't support a pathway to citizenship .
They can not get in the front of the line ; I would not reward them in any way whatsoever .
I would also get rid of all the mandates from the federal government that say the states must provide free education , medical care and benefits to illegals .
That is another reason they bring their families over here .
I believe we should beef up the borders , and I believe it should be civilian , not military .
I believe we should n't be worried about the border between North and South Korea after 50 years or about the border between Iraq and Syria .
I mean , that 's where all our money and personnel is going .
I think we should bring the troops home and getting them out of the war mode and probably be using the resources … to beef up our borders without adding any cost to the budget .
SPENDING :
I do n't think there is one single budget you can't cut .
Politically , the easiest budget to cut is the overseas expenditures .
And then you deal with other problems as time goes on .
I certainly would not be signing a bill that would double the size of the DOE or increase the size of the entitlement system or a drug company - promoted prescription drug program .
That 's where we as Republicans have fallen down , and that is the reason our base was very unhappy last September .
TAXES :
We lived in this country a long time without income tax , but then we had limited government .
I do n't think we need an income tax .
I promised my people I would do anything and everything I can to get rid of the income tax , to repeal the 16th Amendment , never vote to raise taxes and always vote to lower taxes .
And it 's been a popular position .
My slogan at home has always been " the taxpayers ' best friend , " and most people like that regardless of what party they are in .
CAMPAIGN STRATEGY :
I felt good about every trip I have taken .
We always pick up support and enthusiasm , … and the reception has been good .
We do n't have $ 100 million in the bank ; we are not supported by wealthy special interests , so we are not polling .
...
We actually wanted to limit the campaign to four or five early states , but the pressure is to have everybody together , so small candidates like myself are cut off before we get any traction whatsoever .
Republicans sometimes get intimidated that they have to follow the party instead of the platform and our promises in the Constitution .
My job … is to make conservatives feel comfortable on any number of issues for really following through on what they believe in .
STEM CELL RESEARCH :
I think stem cell research is crucial and is very , very important .
Medically , it has a great future .
The answers are n't in yet , completely .
Politicians and bureaucrats and the FDA do n't know either .
I do n't think that 's where it should be determined .
I think it should be determined in the marketplace .
In Washington , we 've only had two choices .
Either prohibit it or finance it .
My position is we should n't do either .
...
It should be up to the states to devise the rules and laws of what you can or can't do .
...
I am strongly pro-life , and the worst thing I can think of is to manufacture babies to be used for research .
But as an obstetrician , I have on quite a few cases had to do surgery on a woman who had a pregnancy in the fallopian tube .
The fetus is small and alive , but if you do n't operate on them , the fetus dies and the patient dies .
... I do n't see any reason why you can't use that fetal tissue for research .
GOLD STANDARD :
I do n't exactly say , ' Let 's go back to the gold standard , ' and you may chuckle a little bit , … but the question has to be turned around .
What is it that possesses anybody to think that governments , which ( are ) not trusted by anybody , should have the power to create money out of thin air and create runaway spending and allow the politicians to not worry about deficits in order to buy reelection ?
And allow them to police the world and allow them to provide all these big benefits ?
...
That is the most astounding philosophy in the world , and it has never worked , … and now we are in the process of a failing dollar .
...
So , yes , I want to restore integrity to the money , not be a counterfeiter .
My proposal is not to close the Federal Reserve down and go back to the 19th century , it 's just to legalize that which the founders consider ( ed ) very important .

Immune protein makes the body clock turn down a notch .
Sniffling , sneezing , and feeling sleepy can go hand in hand .

Getting sick often means getting tired too .
Now researchers have tracked down how the chemical responsible for such drowsiness works .
The culprit is a small protein called tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - alpha ) , named for its anti-tumour properties .
This compound was known to trigger inflammation in response to infection and some chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis .
And it was known to be linked — somehow — to fatigue .
Cancer patients treated with TNF - alpha sometimes report severe lethargy , for example .
And patients with a sleep disorder called sleep apnea sometimes report less daytime sleepiness after receiving a drug that interferes with TNF - alpha .
But precisely how the protein was affecting sleep habits was unclear .
Thomas Birchler , an immunologist at the University Hospital of Zurich in Switzerland , and his colleagues administered TNF - alpha to mice and then monitored the expression of genes involved in the biological clock , the internal timekeeper that tells us when to go to sleep and when to wake up .
They found that the genes were expressed in their normal rhythm , rising and falling at designated points during the day .
But the overall level of expression of some of these genes was reduced in mice that received the drug .
" The oscillations were still in rhythm , " says Birchler .
" But the output of the clock genes was much reduced . "
Mice given TNF - alpha were also less active and spent less time on their running wheels or walking around their cages — as if they were tired .
" This opens up an area that should be fertile ground for research , " says immunologist Rodney Johnson of the University of Illinois , Urbana - Champaign .
" We 've known for years now that TNF - alpha induces changes in sleep patterns .
This is the beginning of connecting it with genes involved in circadian rhythms . "
Sufficient sleep is crucial for a healthy immune system and may help speed up recovery .
" There is evidence that sleep helps fight against infections , " says Birchler , " and from an evolutionary point of view , fatigue can prevent the infected individual from joining in social activities , and keep the infection from spreading through the whole population . "

But although it may be beneficial in the short term , fatigue can be debilitating in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases .
" The fatigue and altered sleep that was maybe initially beneficial can actually become pathological , " says Johnson .
" Too much of a good thing is not always a good thing . "
Interfering with TNF - alpha ?can help such patients with chronic inflammatory conditions to avoid chronic fatigue .
But the treatment can also weaken the immune system and promote infection and the development of autoimmune disorders .
So researchers are keen to understand the mechanisms behind drowsiness , and perhaps find better ways to beat it back .

Introduction
books for beginners : they teach you the rules of chess , how to move the pieces , then demonstrate a couple of simple checkmates , and that 's it .
They 're intended for people who have never played chess , and are curious about it .
more advanced books : openings theory , one or more openings studied in detail , analysis of classic games between grandmasters , studies of game endings , and so on .
They 're meant for people who know the game very well , have been playing for a while , and take it seriously , possibly even competing in amateur tournaments .
intermediate
( or , more correctly , " advanced beginners " , but let 's be nice . )
Principles
The beginning of the game ( a.k.a. opening ) should be viewed as a " race " with two goals : to control as much of the board as possible
to develop most of the attacking pieces Avoid moving the same piece twice during the opening .
Remember the " race " - try to save moves .
Unless you really know what you 're doing , and why , you should open the game , usually , with one of the center pawns ( king 's or queen 's ) , moving forward 2 squares ( that is , to d4 or e4 ) .
If you 're playing Black and White has just opened with one of those moves , you should answer with the equivalent one ( d5 or e5 ) .
Knights belong in the board 's center .
Move them there as soon as possible .
Trying to attack with the queen early in the game is usually not a good idea .
Your opponent will be able to attack her with less valuable , protected pieces , which will force you to move your queen again and again , preventing you from developing the rest of your pieces , while he will be developing his .
After you have developed your bishops and knights , you should probably castle .
Castling helps protect your king and develop a rook .
For the same reason , avoid moving the king before castling , as you can't castle if he has already moved .
Avoid having two or more pawns in the same column ( which is very common if you capture a piece with a pawn ) .
If capturing with a pawn ( and with impunity ) is the only way , by all means do so , but if you have several ways to do it , choose one that wo n't leave one pawn in front of another .
If a column has no pieces at all ( either yours or the opponent 's ) , try to put a rook there .
The f2 square ( or f7 for Black ) is , in the beginning of the game , a weak spot .
Pay attention to it .
Often , pawn chains are formed , where pawns protect one another , forming diagonals .
That can make it difficult for you to " penetrate " your opponent 's territory .
The trick , usually , is to find an unprotected pawn , at the back of the chain - capturing it ( probably with a knight ) may be a good idea .
Do n't choose moves expecting your opponent to play badly , as in " let 's see if he does n't notice this " .
Always assume he will make the best possible move .
If not , so much the better ...
There are many books on chess out there .
I , myself , have read some .
It seems to me , however , that there 's a big gap in the available literature , since almost all chess books seem to belong to one of the following :
What is missing here ?
In my opinion , something forplayers .
Those who have no doubts about chess rules , who no longer leave pieces unprotected , or lose them because they were distracted ( " where did that bishop come from ? ! ? " ) , and who usually have no trouble winning a game when they have some material advantage .
So , what 's next ?
What should they do to improve ?
Study dozens of openings and variants ?
Analyze games by grandmasters ?
Eventually , yes .
But , for now , The next step , instead , should be to learn a few principles , which , though simple , quickly change your way of playing the game , because , even though you may not be aware that you 're playing opening X variant Y , you know that moving this piece there is a good idea , because ...
Saint McCain is in Iraq this week and proving the " three - months - late " media wrong .
Last week he said that the surge is so promising that you can walk the streets of Baghdad safely .
He reaffirmed that point at a press conference today , only he forgot to mention that you need 100 US soldiers , three blackhawk helicopters and two apache gunships watching your back .
Oops .
Must have slipped his mind .

Of course McCain has to blame the media again .
Newsweek reminds us just how " safe " Baghdad really is :
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A Kurdish woman was brutally raped , stamped on and strangled by members of her family and their friends in an “ honor killing ” carried out at her London home because she had fallen in love with the wrong man .

A Kurdish woman was brutally raped , stamped on and strangled by members of her family and their friends in an " honor killing " carried out at her London home because she had fallen in love with the wrong man .
REUTERS / Metropolitan Police / Handout
Banaz Mahmod , 20 , was subjected to the 2 - 1/ 2 hour ordeal before she was garroted with a bootlace .
Her body was stuffed into a suitcase and taken about 100 miles to Birmingham where it was buried in the back garden of a house .
Her badly decomposed body was found in April 2006 , three months after the killing .
Last month a jury found her father Mahmod Mahmod , 52 , and his brother Ari Mahmod , 51 , guilty of murder after a three - month trial .
Their associate Mohamad Hama , 30 , had earlier admitted killing her .
On Thursday at a pre-sentence hearing for Hama , the Old Bailey heard details about Banaz ’s last moments .
Prosecutors said the three convicted men , along with two other suspects who are still at large , had carried out the killing fearing that the authorities were closing in on them .
They believed Banaz had brought shame on the family by leaving her husband , an Iraqi Kurd she had been forced to marry at 17 , and falling in love with Rahmat Suleimani , an Iranian Kurd .
Her former unnamed partner had raped her as well as repeatedly beating her , the court heard .
Hama , who prosecutors said had been a ringleader in the murder , was caught by listening devices talking to a friend in prison about the murder .
In the recordings , transcripts of which were relayed to the court , Hama and his friend are hearing laughing as he described how she was killed with Banaz ’s uncle “ supervising ” .
“ I was kicking and stamping on her neck to get the soul out .
I saw her stark naked , only wearing pants or underwear , ” Hama is recorded as saying .
His lawyers say there is no evidence to support the prosecution ’s claims .
The decision to kill her came after a meeting on January 23 -- the day before she was murdered -- when the family decided to take action before the police could foil their attempts , said prosecutor Victor Temple .
Hama is due to be sentenced on Friday with Mahmod Mahmod and his brother , Ari .
WASHINGTON , Feb. 5 — Republicans late this afternoon blocked a potentially momentous Senate debate , at least for now , on a bipartisan resolution opposing President Bush ’s troop buildup in Iraq .
Forty - nine senators , almost all Democrats , voted to proceed with the debate , 11 short of the number needed under Senate rules on the issue .
Forty - seven senators , nearly all Republicans , voted not to proceed .
This afternoon ’s result cast doubt on whether the Senate would move toward a vote on what lawmakers of both parties described as the paramount issue of the day .
Now it appears certain that more negotiations will take place on what war - related measure , if any , will be voted upon .
If 60 “ yes ” votes had materialized today , the Senate would have opened debate on a resolution sponsored by Senators John W. Warner , Republican of Virginia , and Carl Levin , Democrat of Michigan , that opposes the president ’s plan to add about 21,500 troops to the American force in Iraq .
Why some people almost always are successful
Like everyone else IÂ´ve spent some time thinking about why some people are so successful in life .
And what factors in success that are under more personal control than others .
Successful people might be intelligent .
Or have had a socially well connected upbringings .
Or be naturally energetic and open and positive .
But a lot of the factors that make some people more successful at almost anything in life are very much under their control .
And much can be improved in anyoneâ€™s life by learning from the people that have gone before us .
Here are some of the thoughts on success that IÂ´ve come up with from reading / watching documentaries throughout the years about people such as Michael Jordan , Thomas Edison , Eleanor Roosevelt and Henry Ford .
The following factors of success are just a few and IÂ´m quite sure there are a lot more .
They make decisions and take action
Right or wrong action , they take it .
Either way itâ€™s always better than making no decisions and taking no action at all .
As Franklin Roosevelt said :
â€ œIt is common sense to take a method and try it .
If it fails , admit it frankly and try another .
But above all , try something .â€ 
They do things even when they donÂ´t feel like it
I think this is a pretty huge factor .
A lot of us back down when we donÂ´t want to do something , even though it may eventually bring us to a wonderful experience or goal .
Successful people may not always like doing some of the things they have to do .
But they do them anyway .
And in the longer run that makes all the difference .
They do the most productive thing right now
Instead of trapping themselves in doing productive but not so important tasks or projects they realise whatâ€™s most important and do that .
And after they Â´re done with that they do what Â´s most important again .
Instead of just doing a lot of things , they think and plan before they act and try to focus as much as possible of their thoughts and actions on those few very important things .
They do one thing at a time
Many of them donÂ´t seem to multi-task .
Some reasons for avoiding that may be that it creates internal confusion , wastes time and spreads the multi- tasker too thinly .
Instead , they do one thing and focus on that until it is done .
Then they do the next thing until it is done .
Focusing 100 % on one task at a time will get it done quicker and better .
They have a positive attitude
A negative attitude can be very damaging and limiting to oneÂ´s life .
A positive one can open new doors every day .
It can open your mind to new ideas and input and create or sustain great relationships .
It helps you through the hard times as a successful person often sees an opportunity within what others would merely see as a problem .
Have a look at Take The Postivity Challenge for more thoughts and practical tips for creating a more positive attitude .
They have redefined failure
While a lot of people see failure as a way to rationalizing the feeling of wanting to giving up or as a sign that it Â´s actually time to do something else successful people tend to see it more as useful feedback .
They may not like to fail , but they donÂ´t fear it â€ “ or at least they have little fear of it – and they know that if they fail they Â´ve been there before and they can start over again and succeed .
This is of course a very useful belief and keeps successful people going while the rest have already given up .
They donÂ´t let fear hold them back
They overcome fear and slay that dragon whenever they face it .
Or they may have defined or redefined reality so that fear is substantially decreased or even gone in some areas of their life .
Doing this enables you to take action on your thoughts .
This pulls down the barriers in the mind and create new roads and opens up to whole new possibilities .
Have a look at 5 Life - Changing Keys to Overcoming Your Fear for more on both slaying your dragons and redefining your reality to contain less fear .
They have found a purpose in life
They are internally driven rather than externally driven .
They do what they have a burning desire to do rather than conforming to what others think they should do .
Even if what the others think may be positive and successful stuff .
The Michael Jordans , the Edisons and the Stephen Kings have figured out what they want to do in life and are doing it ( or did it ) .
The purpose , I think , is largely why they can keep on going and be motivated while others may tire or just go and do something else that they find more purposeful .
The successes love their purpose and when they aligned with it then it seems to push them forward with enthusiasm and energy through life .
They donÂ´t get distracted
When others get too caught up in everyday life to do what they really want to do the successes donÂ´t .
They can really focus on actually doing what Â´s important and what needs to be done .
Again , this seems to go back to having a purpose and more clear sense of direction in life .
They value their time highly and plan it out well
A lot of people donÂ´t value their time that much .
Successful people have a purpose in life and therefore they do .
They have so much they want and an inner urge to do it and therefore need to plan well to use their days effectively .
They Â´ve got awesome communication - skills
So very much of what we do in life has to do with other people .
So it seems quite obvious that to be successful you Â´ll probably have to have good or great communication - skills ( or hire someone that has such skills ) .
People skills is fortunately something anyone can improve and develop .
Have a look at Do You Do these 10 Mistakes in a Conversation and How to Make a Great First Impression for some useful tips .
They have an open mind and are willing to learn
Successful people take the time to study and learn â€ “ and often seem to really like doing it – what is necessary to improve their skills .
They are open to thoughts , suggestions , solutions , new information and change rather than thinking they already know everything , that there is not much more to learn and that everything should be as it has always been .
What to focus on ?
Now , what factors are the most important ones , where should one focus the energy ?
I am currently focusing on improving my ability to take action , doing what I may not feel like doing and doing the most productive thing right now .
To me it seems like these three factors are very important and since they are pretty interconnected they are easy to combine .
I think what you should focus on varies a lot .
And itâ€™s up to everyone to figure that out for themselves .
But if you Â´re anything like me you probably already know what areas you need to work on .
I had mistakenly learned that curry was a form of generalized partial application from the paper : Function Currying in Scheme by Jeffrey A. Meunier
and the Wikipedia entry ( I should have known better ) , however I was mildly reprimanded for making this novice mistake in a recent paper submission to ICFP .
There was a short post to the Scheme mailing list some time back summing up the problem .
In my paper I defined curry in Cat as :
define curry : ( ' b ( ' A 'b -> ' C ) -> ( ' A -> ' C ) ) { swap quote swap compose }
Whereas this really should have been called " partial - apply " , " papply " or something comparable .
So the correct definition should have been :
define papply : ( ' b ( ' A 'b -> ' C ) -> ( ' A -> ' C ) ) { swap quote swap compose } define curry : ( ( ' A 'b -> ' C ) -> ( ' b -> ( ' A -> ' C ) ) { quote [ papply ] compose }
Has anyone else made this mistake ?
It seems to me that I have seen more incorrect definitions than correct ones .
P.S. Anyone here interested in the health of Wikipedia ( I 've given up ) , I 'd suggest fixing the code examples and " intuitively ... " note .
Call it Harry Potter 's invisible sleeve .
New calculations show how to make an electromagnetic " wormhole " — a tube that is invisible from the sides , allowing light to shine down the center unseen [ ] .
The concept is a twist on a spherical cloak of invisibility proposed last year .
Such a device would be made of metamaterial , a thicket of metal rings or other shapes that bends light in funny ways .
A hollow shell of metamaterial could in principle channel a single frequency of light around its inner space without slowing the light down , rendering that hidey - hole invisible to the outside world at that frequency .
But the invisibility cuts both ways .
If light does not enter , then whatever is in the cloak cannot see outside , says mathematician Allan Greenleaf of the University of Rochester .
So Greenleaf turned the cloak inside out .
In work submitted to a major physics journal , he and colleagues report that the light - warping trick works for an open tube with flared ends .
Viewed straight on , light zipping down the cylinder would be plainly visible .
But from the side , the light would appear to come out of nowhere , as though sent on a detour to another dimension and back .
The idea is the same as that of a wormhole linking two distant points in spacetime , hence the nickname .
" We 're tricking the electromagnetic waves into thinking that , actually , space has been changed , " Greenleaf says .
" It 's a very nice twist " on the spherical cloak , says physicist John Pendry of Imperial College London , one of the physicists who first worked out the idea .
" We can invent a secret connection between two parts of space , and that is interesting . "
Building an invisible tunnel should be as hard — or easy , depending on your level of optimism — as making a spherical cloak , Greenleaf says .
A Duke University team demonstrated an imperfect cloak last year that warps microwaves around a disk of concentric copper rings .
But researchers are still struggling to build metamaterials that bend visible light .
Greenleaf 's group speculates that wormholes could be used to pass metal objects into an MRI scanner or , by making a prickly sphere of them , create a 3 - D video display .
Of course , by the time invisibility becomes easy to achieve , modern technology will probably be a bit out of date .

I went to this meetup ( aah Kleenex Xerox ) last night that David Beisel put together .
For the first time , I feel like I am a part of something happening in the web space in New England .
( The other day I met the the founder of bulbs.com , which is a successful ecommerce play and one of the few successful web companies in Worcester .
I got a little giddy when I met him , and I think he thought me a bit weird .
Oh well .
I get a bit excited when I meet people doing web stuff . )
Back to the story ...
I had no idea that this much innovation was happening in and around Boston .
There were - I 'd guesstimate - 60 people - or - so in attendance .
And everyone I spoke to was doing some cool things .
The following companies presented their projects :
Kiko , Emmett Shear & Justin Kan ( Online Personal Calendaring ala eventful , zevents , upcoming.org / yahoo callendar .
Very ajax heavy extremely desktop like interface .
More calendar sharing and contact management capabilities coming soon . )
reddit , Steve Huffman & Alexis Ohanian ( Mix of Stumbleupon/del.icio.us )
Blogniscient , Ben Ruedlinger ( A categorized Blogdex .
Similar to pubsub's new lists , but automated . )
These companies were all pre-revenue and quite new .
Not much in the way of big traction yet .
They are also entering pretty crowded spaces , but they each have some interesting twists .
All were consumer plays with presumably : advertising as their revenue model ( kiko was the only one that confirmed that and as I 've said before , I 'd love to buy local ad inventory on consumer calendar sites . )
I am looking forward to watching these companies as they mature , as I am sure they are moving in the right direction (s ) .
I met the following people for the first time and learned about their businesses through chatting .
Here is the stripped down public version of their stories .
( I did have some good conversations with some people about more in depth things and challenges and opportunities that we are each facing .
If you want to know that stuff , you should come out to the next one . ) :

Maybe its just that Silicon Valley has much louder mouths and Boston is a bit more humble in the blogosphere .
But , there were some very smart people there last night , that are doing some very smart things .
And I had no clue they existed .
I am looking forward to inviting a bunch of other " web innovators " to the next one .
As I am sure Sooz is too .
Here 's some pictures Sooz took .
Here 's some link love for everyone in attendance .
Please trackback ( You too Sooz ) if you blog about this .
I 'd like to keep track of what you all are doing .
And want to subscribe to all your blog feeds .
If you are on this list and you do n't have a blog , you should get one .
The rest of the world needs to hear Boston tech 's collective voices .
And we also need more of the above mixing and mingling .
Online and in person .
Great job , David for getting this rocking .

The long - awaited GAO Report on Peak Oil [ PDF ] , courtesy of EVWorld [ EVWorld link replaced by official GAO link . ]
[ Update by Prof. G ]
Here 's a link to a video of Matt Simmons discussing the GAO report on CNBC , peak oil , and the ramifications from yesterday ( 7 mins ) .
This is a very important video for those learning about peak oil , it 's balanced and it's a great primer !
The report also got a mention this morning on WaPo's Politics Hour .
Arlington , Va. :
You probably wo n't take this question , because its not on " the list , " but I 'll ask anyway hoping that someone will look into it and maybe we 'll see some follow - up someday .
There is a press conference today by Reps. Roscoe Bartlett ( R - Md. ) and Tom Udall ( D - N.M. ) , between 11:30 am and 12:00 noon in HC - 9 of the Capitol to discuss the release of an embargoed GAO report .
The report will reveal the United States is particularly vulnerable to and unprepared to respond to severe consequences from an significant disruptions to world oil supplies from peak oil and other above - ground political and economic factors , which are viewd as an increasing risk .
Some very real questions are how " severe " the consequences are and what " increasing risk " means -- and why no mainstream press will cover this .
Lois Romano : I can't tell you that the press wo n't cover it .
It certainly sounds like a story the way you have described it .
What list ??

When I ask development teams whether their database is under version control , I usually get blank stares .
The database is a critical part of your application .
If you deploy version 2.0 of your application against version 1.0 of your database , what do you get ?
A broken application .
And that 's why your database should always be under source control right next to your application code .
You deploy the app , and you deploy the database .
Like peanut butter and chocolate , they are two great tastes that taste great together .
At Vertigo , we rolled our own tool to reverse engineer the database into a set of files , which we then check into source control .
I 've visited other customers that did the same thing .
But why write what you can buy ?
Leon Bambrick lists a number of great tools you can purchase to help you in get your database under version control where it belongs .
Unfortunately , he omitted one of the best tools : Microsoft 's new Team Edition for Database Professionals .
Team Edition for Database Professionals goes far beyond mere reverse engineering of the database into files .
You get an industrial - strength database project that you can add to your solution , along with a few other goodies :
Create test data .
A blank database schema is n't particularly useful to develop against .
Now you can distribute your database schema along with one - click synthetic data generation plans .
With flexible synthetic data generators , you can avoid dumping production data to developers , or , God forbid , letting developers fend for themselves by creating their own test data .
And you can generate 1,000 rows or 100,000 rows .
I wish I had a dollar every time an application I 've worked on began to have performance problems because none of the developers had the foresight to test the app with more than a few rows of crappy , manually entered test data .
Data generation is a huge increase in development quality .

Schema comparison .
If we can compare two files in source control , why can't we compare two tables ?
A robust schema comparison tool is essential .
Not sure why staging is different than production ?
Run a quick schema compare on 'em .
Did I mention it also creates a real - time update script every time you do a comparison .
.
which it can execute with one additional click ?

On the morning of February 9 , 1998 , an American Airlines 727 on final instrument approach to Chicago ’s O’Hare International Airport suddenly pitched downward .
Despite the pilot ’s corrective actions , the aircraft hit the ground just short of the runway .
Twenty - three people were injured , and the aircraft was substantially damaged .
In statements filed with the National Transportation Safety Board , American Airlines , the Allied Pilot ’s Association , and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants all argued that electromagnetic interference was probably to blame for the crash .
The two professional groups wrote that “ circumstantial evidence ” pointed to an improper glide - path signal received by the aircraft ’s instrument landing system due to electromagnetic interference “ from onboard electronic devices or ground - based equipment . ”
After investigating the accident , the safety board could find no hard evidence that such interference had occurred and blamed the accident on pilot error and an out - of - date setting of the autopilot .
In 1996 , the crew of an airliner that had just taken off from Salt Lake City International Airport was informed by air - traffic control that the craft was 30 degrees off course .
The pilot and copilot ’s flight instruments indicated no error .
On this day , the weather was good and air - traffic control was able to appropriately vector the aircraft .
The flight crew later concluded that electromagnetic interference from a laptop computer being used in the first - class cabin had caused the problem .
In his report on the incident , the pilot stated , “ I would have really been sweating if it had been instrument flight rules in that mountain area . ”
How commonly does radio frequency ( RF ) interference cause safety problems for commercial aircraft ?
We have concluded , based on several types of analyses , that RF interference from consumer electronics is unlikely to have figured in more than a few percent of commercial air accidents , if any at all , during the past 10 years .
There are no documented cases of a fatal aircraft accident caused by RF interference , although it is possible that interference has been an unrecognized factor in some crashes , perhaps simply by momentarily diverting a pilot ’s attention during a critical maneuver .
But there clearly is room for concern .
For one thing , incidents of RF interference by passenger electronics with aircraft systems do happen regularly .
We have estimated that reported events are occurring at a rate of about 15 and perhaps as many as 25 per year , based on a random sample of incident reports filed between 1995 and 2001 with the Aviation Safety Reporting System ( ASRS ) .
Additional events may go unreported .
Moreover , with the rapid proliferation of consumer electronics and wireless technology , these numbers will almost certainly grow .
In addition , RF interference is a complicated and subtle phenomenon .
Pilots and maintenance personnel may not readily identify problems even when they exist .
Problems are likely to increase with aircraft age as avionics are removed , modified , or changed and as gaskets , shielding , and grounding straps become corroded , get left out , or are otherwise rendered ineffective .
In newer “ fly - by - wire ” aircraft , which depend more heavily on complex electronic circuitry , the number of system locations in which RF interference might cause difficulties grows .
Aircraft designers and manufactures , as well as airline maintenance personnel , are aware of these problems , and they work hard to minimize vulnerabilities .
But faced with the slimming down of work forces , expanding job responsibilities , and the retirement of older personnel who had specialized knowledge and experience in electromagnetic compatibility , the potential for problems increases .
The electromagnetic environment
A commercial airliner is a study in electronic complexity .
Aircraft systems–marker beacons , distance - measuring equipment , traffic - alert and collision - avoidance systems , microwave - landing systems , and Global Positioning Systems , among many others–operate across a wide range of radio frequencies .
Likewise , a host of consumer electronic devices–laptops , cell phones , game systems , CD players , and the like –produce emissions that range across all of these frequencies .
In addition to producing emissions at their nominal design frequencies , passenger electronic devices often also produce emissions at other frequencies due to harmonics and other mechanisms .
The physical environment of the aircraft further complicates matters .
Aircraft cabins are large metallic tubes that can act as resonant cavities at some frequencies , and an aircraft ’s windows , which are basically openings in a conducting plane , can radiate as slot antennas .
New consumer electronic devices are required to meet RF emission standards set by the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) .
These standards are intended to prevent interference with other users of the electromagnetic spectrum .
However , because of problems in testing , enforcement , and other areas , it is not clear that all new devices conform to these standards .
In addition , as devices get banged around in use and get modified or repaired by owners or service personnel with limited training , some of them can begin to produce emissions that exceed their designed specifications .
RF interference from consumer electronics can affect various flight - critical aircraft electronic systems in several ways .
Radiation can pass out of the windows and enter antennas located on the outside of the aircraft .
Emissions also can directly enter electronic devices inside the aircraft or induce currents in wiring that is connected to those devices .
Of course , aircraft systems have been designed and tested to minimize the risks of such interference .
But if emissions from passenger electronics are great enough , these measures may be insufficient to protect some properly operating systems .
Of greater concern is the possibility that some of an aircraft ’s systems may not be operating as precisely as intended , perhaps due to aging or maintenance .
In addition , devices that individually test as reliable may exhibit problems when operated together .
RF interference with aircraft systems can often involve very subtle interactions among a number of different system components , and such interference may be difficult or impossible to detect through routine testing and preflight checkout procedures .
Intentional transmitters in the hands of passengers further complicate the picture .
As all Americans now know as a result of the heart - wrenching calls made from Flight 93 on Sept. 11 , 2001 , cell phones can be operated successfully from the air .
The FCC bans cell phones from use in flight , not primarily for safety reasons but to reduce their interference with ground - based communications systems .
At altitude , a cell phone illuminates many base stations , and their ban is intended to avoid overloading the system that coordinates the hand - off of calls from one base station to the next .
Clearly , this ban also helps protect aircraft from on - board sources of electromagnetic radiation – but it is not a perfect solution .
Some passengers occasionally turn on their cell phones during a flight , as evidenced by incident reports to the ASRS and a small survey we conducted of passengers , not to mention by numerous informal observations .
In addition , some passengers forget to turn off their phones when flying .
Such phones emit periodic “ here I am , are you out there ? ” signals in order to locate and coordinate with base stations .
Modern phones may first try this at low power , but if they do not receive a response , they try again at higher power .
How common such short transmissions are on today ’s airliners is not clear .
There are probably a few such phones occasionally transmitting on many flights .
In - flight use of cell phones also is likely to increase under pressure from passengers who want to stay connected .
Several airlines are now installing “ microcell ” systems in their cabins that will support cell phone use during flight .
These systems enable passengers ’ phones to communicate at low power with an on - board base station , which in turn is connected , via a dedicated radio link , to the terrestrial telephone system .
Many airlines also are moving to install electrical power and Ethernet connections at passengers ’ seats .
Because of the high data rates involved in computer processors and in Ethernet communications , and because the systems are being connected directly to aircraft electrical systems , these in - seat facilities hold some potential to cause RF interference with aircraft systems .
The FAA , the FCC , airlines , and equipment manufacturers should form a joint industry - government cooperative program to perform evaluation and testing .
These are not the only sources of radiation likely to appear in aircraft cabins .
Wireless systems are growing in popularity .
Soon , customers will want to operate laptops , personal digital assistants , or game systems in different parts of the cabin while networked together using wireless technology .
For example , the sales representative in seat 12C , preparing for an upcoming presentation to a potential customer , may want to use his wireless system to ask an engineer in seat 19 F for help with some technical details on their product .
Similarly , teenagers in 15B , 16C , and 23 F may want to challenge each other in the latest multiperson computer game .
Pressures on airlines will probably also grow to support wireless Internet connections in aircraft cabins .
In a few more years , even more potentially problematic sources of radiation may become an issue .
For example , “ ultrawideband ” emissions have been demonstrated to interfere with the operation of aircraft Global Positioning Systems , and GPS is playing an increasingly central role in plans for future navigation and instrument approach systems .
Managing hazards
Safety purists might argue that airlines should simply ban the use of all consumer electronic devices in aircraft cabins under the authority they already have through existing Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) regulations .
The FAA specifies that , “ no person may operate … any portable electronic device on any …aircraft ” unless an airline has determined that use of the device “ will not cause interference with the navigation or communication system of the aircraft on which it is to be used . ”
It is unlikely , however , that airlines will issue such a ban .
Competitive pressures among airlines are large and growing .
Business travelers , who are the most likely to want to stay connected and networked , are also the most profitable group of customers .
There will be enormous pressure to introduce new services as airlines search for sources of comparative advantage .
As long as one major airline allows or supports a service , there will be pressure on others to do the same .
Further , since some of these technologies carry clear productivity and other benefits , it would be inappropriate to restrict their use through an overly precautionary policy if more balanced risk management solutions could be developed .
If RF detectors were installed in aircraft cabins , routine records from flight data recorders could be searched to identify potential interference problems .
Instead , there are a number of management and control actions that parties on all sides of the issue can take to help improve air safety .
For one thing , airlines , aircraft and equipment manufactures , and regulators should make greater use of the classic tools of risk analysis to examine the problem of RF interference .
However , because of the enormous diversity and complexity of the systems involved , the constantly changing aircraft environment , and the limited analytical resources , we believe that such conventional studies will not be sufficient for identifying and assessing all important potential accident sequences in a timely manor .
Greater progress can be made through five broad strategies that will foster adaptive management and control .
These strategies involve :
Paying careful attention to aircraft equipment design and certification , and to quality control in maintenance .
Obviously , airlines should maintain due vigilance regarding their existing equipment and systems .
Moreover , airlines should move with great caution as they proceed to consider new aircraft systems .
The potential for problems associated with emerging wireless systems is probably large .
Since individual airlines may not have the resources to adequately evaluate all systems under development , a joint effort is indicated , and in the interests of public safety , some federal money should be provided to augment airline resources .
FAA budgets have long been tight , and today they are stretched even thinner by the demands imposed in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks .
The FAA , the FCC , airlines , and equipment manufacturers should form a joint industry - government cooperative program to perform evaluation and testing , and Congress should appropriate funds to support the federal contribution to this undertaking .
In addition to expanding the extent and quality of analysis and testing , such a program also would help to reduce redundant testing efforts across the industry .
And since participation would be mandatory for all airlines , it would improve information sharing and eliminate free riding .
Today , because of competitive considerations , airlines that have invested heavily in interference testing are sometimes understandably reluctant to share results with other lines that have invested less heavily .
Augmenting the Aviation Safety Reporting System so that once again it can support statistically meaningful analysis of events and trends .
The ASRS is operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) in cooperation with the FAA .
Flight crews , controllers , maintenance staff , and others send confidential reports concerning observed safety problems to NASA , where the reports are summarized in a form that assures confidentiality and avoids punitive consequences for those reporting .
The system has become a cornerstone of aviation safety , as well as a model for other fields , such as medicine .
The ASRS has received more than 500,000 incident reports and issued more than 4,000 safety alerts , and outside researchers have drawn on the database to produce at least 60 reports and papers .
But NASA now can afford to enter only 15 percent to 20 percent of the incident reports it receives .
Entries are chosen on the basis of a “ watch list . ”
Between 1995 and 2001 , only 10 percent of the reports , about half of all entries being made , were randomly selected .
Because of budget cuts , the practice of including an identifiable random sample has been dropped .
Thus , ASRS can no longer be used to do full , statistically valid time series studies of all types of incidents , including those involving RF interference .
Clearly , Congress should provide budgetary support to reinstate the random sample .
Improving characterization and analysis of the RF environment on aircraft .
The only reported studies of potential interference from consumer electronic devices have involved static tests conducted on the ground .
With FAA support the authors are undertaking a pilot program of in - flight measurements ( as well as measurements of a sample of the public ’s laptops and game systems ) , but it will be some time before results are available .
Such measurements could be made a routine function on all flights .
Modern flight data recorders –the familiar “ black boxes ” that serve as tools for investigating aircraft crashes –have hundreds of channels for recording data .
Major airlines now routinely apply data - mining methods to the records from each flight in order to improve operational efficiency and quality assurance and to search for anomalies that may be indicative of problems .
It would be relatively straightforward to install in aircraft cabins a set of RF detectors that would continuously monitor field strength in several spectral bands and record the data in the black box .
Analysts could then include an examination of the cabin electromagnetic environment in their search for potential interference problems .
Developing and deploying simple real - time tools to help flight crews detect RF emissions .
If airline cabins were equipped with RF detectors , then flight crews could take corrective action when strong electromagnetic emissions occurred .
The utility of equipping flight crews with easy - to - use hand - held RF detectors also warrants investigation .
If such observations ultimately identify particular types of electronic devices that are seriously troublesome , then legal or other mechanisms should be available to keep them off of airliners in the future .
Currently , there is no systematic way to keep offending devices off of flights .
Paying greater attention to managing the RF emissions of consumer electronics .
The FCC currently does not confer with the FAA when establishing RF emission standards for consumer devices .
Such coordination would be desirable .
In addition , the national debate over the management of the electromagnetic spectrum and wireless technology should pay greater attention to the consequences that different policies will have for the aircraft environment .
If the expected growth of wireless technology leads to interference problems that are sufficiently grave , then it may prove necessary to adopt more aggressive control measures .
For example , the FCC might require manufacturers to include override capability in wireless devices so that they could be turned off by a centrally transmitted control signal during critical phases of flight , such as take off and final approach .
Such a “ silencing ” capability might also prove beneficial in other critical settings , such as hospital critical care facilities , as well as in such social settings as theaters , restaurants , and library reading rooms .
This type of regulation , however , would raise important questions of civil liberties , social vulnerability , and the potential for “ common - mode failure ” in important communications systems , and such a requirement should not be imposed without careful analysis and a balancing of risks , costs , and benefits .
Taken together , these actions will enable regulators and the airline industry to better characterize and adaptively manage the risk that RF interference from consumer electronics poses to aviation safety .
In an industry that has eliminated or is effectively managing most large and obvious sources of risk , such persistent risks increasingly warrant attention .

A Smoke Angel from Airplane Flares
Credit : Russell E. Cooley IV , USAF
Explanation :
What type of cloud is that ?
It is not a naturally occurring one .
Looking perhaps a bit like a gigantic owl monster , the cloud pictured above resulted from a series of flares released by an air force jet over the Atlantic Ocean in May .
The jet that released the flares , a C - 17 Globemaster III , is seen on the right .
The flares release smoke and the resulting pattern is sometimes known as a smoke angel .
The circular eyes of the above smoke angel are caused by air spiraling off the plane 's wings and are known as wingtip vortices .

Groundbreaking research with credulous primates
I think I would have said , had anyone asked , that reporting on animal communication stories could n't get much dumber .
There just was n't any more room down there : we 're at 87 on the FM dial of intelligence in reporting , and there 's just about nowhere to go but up .
I was wrong .
Says John Berman of ABC News in a piece headed Groundbreaking Research Has Scientists Talking With Apes :
The Great Ape Trust in Des Moines , Iowa , is home to seven bonobos -- a close relative of the chimpanzee -- and three orangutans .
But if you think Iowa might be a strange place for them to live , do n't say it out loud — these apes understand English .
Really .
No kidding .
I think it would be unfair to make you read through the drivel itself to reach the point where Berman interviews Kanzi , a bonobo , and we learn the full extent of Kanzi 's success in EFL class , so here is the crucial bit :
I read Kanzi a series of words , and then without fail , he hit the corresponding lexigram symbol on a touch screen .
I said " Egg . "
He pressed " Egg . "
I said , " M and M . "
He pressed " M and M . "
Then Kanzi took control of the conversation and pressed the symbol for " Surprise ! "
By " Suprise ! " , Kanzi actually means the closed box of candy beside Berman ( it 's Kanzi 's keepers who have supplied the meaning SURPRISE for that lexigram , of course ; they could have called it the CUT THE CRAP AND GIMME SOME OF THAT CANDY I KNOW YOU'VE GOT IN THAT BOX lexigram ) .
Kanzi wants Berman to open it and give him some piece of candy .
He 's prepared to learn which symbols on an electronic board to press in order to induce humans to give him sweet treats .
This is the evidence that Kanzi has learned English .
Are you convinced ?
Because there is more .
Only I do n't mean more from Kanzi , who is a clever ape , who has doubtless learned a remarkable number of new symbol - to - concept associations and lexigram - pressing behaviors but unfortunately has nothing to say to us .
I mean there is more evidence concerning the incredible stupidity of the white , hairless primates doing the reporting .
This is more dim - wittedly credulous than anything I have seen before .
" Moments like this " , Berman says , referring to the above fascinating interspecies communing , " are proof that these conversations help scientists learn about apes , from the apes themselves .
"
He quotes Rob Shumaker , one of the investigators at the Great Ape Trust :
" If we have some common means of communicating with each other , " said Shumaker , " we suddenly have exponentially large number of topics that we can explore . "
( There 's nothing like a floating use of the term " exponential " to reveal a speaker 's innumeracy , I always think .
An exponential function of what , in this particular case ?
Never mind ; it was only a rhetorical question . )
We learn more about Shumaker from this passage , just before the above quote :
Rob Shumaker has known
Azy , a majestic , huge male orangutan , for more than 20 years .
He talks to Azy , just like he would speak to one of his children , or a longtime friend .
" When I 'm around them we just kind of talk normally , " he explained .
" I use my normal vocabulary , my normal voice my normal gestures . "
Berman asks : " Sound beyond belief ? " Well , since he asks , no , it does n't .
The point was meant to be about apes understanding English , not about humans like Rob Shumaker being able to speak it .
What does
Azy say back to Rob ?
Nothing , apparently .
Berman tells us nothing more about Azy .
He just babbles on breathlessly : " During a visit to the Great Ape Trust , I sat down with Kanzi the Bonobo -- the first Ape I have ever interviewed . "
And then he reports the interview above , where , as he accurately describes it himself , " I read Kanzi a series of words , and then without fail , he hit the corresponding lexigram symbol on a touch screen . "
Another member of the staff at the Great Ape Trust is Bill Fields , who has been working with Kanzi for years . "
To communicate , " says Berman , " Fields speaks to Kanzi , who then points to the lexigrams to respond and demonstrate a level of understanding .
"
And then he quotes Fields as saying this :
" Qualitatively , there is no difference between Kanzi 's language and my language , " Fields said .
" It 's a matter of degree . "
Let 's look at that first sentence Fields uttered .
It has a preposed adverb in adjunct function ( qualitatively ) at the beginning of an existential clause with a singular postcopular noun phrase with a negative determiner ( the determinative no ) and a complement preposition phrase headed by between .
The preposition between has as its complement a noun- phrase coordination in which the two noun phrases have contrasting genitive noun phrase determiners ( Kanzi 's and my , respectively ) .
Bill Fields knows how to construct English clauses with typical syntactic sophistication .
Kanzi , on the other hand , sometimes presses the EGG lexigram on hearing a human say " Egg " .
( Read the testimony of Steve Jones about another day when Kanzi was not quite so cooperative . )
And Fields wants to tell us that there is simply no qualitative difference between his linguistic ability and Kanzi's .
He must think he is talking to complete morons who will believe absolutely anything about interspecies communication .
He may be right , too .
John Berman appears to have believed him .
And doubtless millions of other people will .
I do n't know about you , but I am just about ... speechless .
If I had a lexigram board in front of me , I would n't know which lexigram to press .
The BULLSHIT lexigram , maybe ?
Is there a lexigram for that ?
Or an IDIOT lexigram ?
I think I need a stiff drink , actually ; I may press the LARGE SINGLE MALT lexigram .
Oh , one other thing : at one point Berman reports this remark from Bill Fields :
" Language is culturally acquired .
Its not learned , " said Fields .
" It 's acquired in the immediate postnatal antogyny of the organisms life . [ sic ]
On the whole of the web , antogyny only got one hit as of yesterday , and it 's Berman 's piece .
( Soon there will be this post as well . )
The word does not , of course , exist .
Berman heard Fields talking about ontogeny , but did n't know the term ( it means development in the individual rather than evolution in the species ) , so he apparently guessed which lexigram button to hit .
He guessed he was hearing anto- as in antonymy and - gyny as in misogyny .
A sort of learned eggcorn .
( What would " antogyny " mean ?
The property of being the opposite of a woman ? )
It 's further clear evidence that Berman did n't know what he was seeing or hearing , and had no ability to understand the supposed story that someone had sent him to cover .
A wandering human simpleton loose in a community composed of ( i ) apes who spend all day trying to persuade people to give them candy and ( ii ) human keepers trying to hype the non-existent linguistic abilities of the apes .
It looks like the fire season and the silly season are both going to be bad ones this year .

The recent Parker decision , has as usual brought out the opponents of the second amendment ; those who would repeal it , or make it ’s repeal effective through the disingenuous twisting of language .
These people must be opposed , refuted , educated , and actively resisted at all turns , by all free men ; as must all attempts to abrogate our essential rights and freedoms .
The second amendment has a very clear , and very important purpose :
All men by their essential nature have the right to defend themselves and their property from harm or oppression , be it by other individuals , or by the state ; through whatever means necessary up to and including lethal force .
That right is fundamental to our nature as sentient persons .
No law or amendment granted that right .
No repeal or passage of any amendment may abrogate that right .
No repeal or passage of any law may take away that right .
No government or society may say that right is invalid , unnecessary , or â€œuncivilizedâ€ .
That right is absolute .
The second amendment recognizes that right , and specifically limits the governments ability to attempt to infringe upon it .
Some may say that such a right is unnecessary , or outdated , or that the constitution and second amendment did not recognize and should not be construed as protecting that right .
They are wrong ; by ignorance , by denial , or by design .
If you want proof you need not look far …
Sudan , Rwanda , Liberia , Yugoslavia , Cambodia , Congo , Germany , Armenia , Russia …
The only thing that ensures against genocide , is an armed , and educated populace .
The Warsaw ghetto should be all the example you ever need .
It is our duty as free men , and as citizens , to ensure that our populace remains both educated , and armed .

Fitzgerald says Plame was covert agent ; Cheney further scrutinized RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday May 29 , 2007 Print This Email This Special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald has asserted in new court filings that Valerie Plame was indeed a covert agent at the time of her outing , according to a Newsweek report filed by Michael Isikoff and Mark Hosenball .
" In new court filings , special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald has finally resolved one of the most disputed issues at the core of the long - running CIA leak controversy : Valerie Plame Wilson , he asserts , was a ' covert ' CIA officer who repeatedly traveled overseas using a ' cover identity ' in order to disguise her relationship with the agency , " Newsweek reports .
Wilson 's covert status , which is substantiated in an employment report filed by Fitzgerald , was cited as part of a recommendation to sentence former Cheney aide I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby to up to three years in prison .
According to that report , Plame traveled " sometimes in true name and sometimes in alias -- but always using cover -- whether official or non-official ( NOC ) -- with no ostensible relationship to the CIA . "
The report added , " When traveling overseas , Ms. Wilson always traveled under a cover identity ... At the time of the initial unauthorized disclosure in the media of Ms. Wilsons employment relationship with the CIA on 14 July 2003 , Ms. Wilson was a covert CIA employee for whom the CIA was taking affirmative measures to conceal her intelligence relationship to the United States . "
The finding severely hampers a key defense by Libby 's lawyers and supporters who have claimed that , since Plame was not covert , Libby had commited no " underlying crime " in revealing Plame 's identity .
Furthermore , Washington Post columnist Dan Froomkin noted that Fitzgerald 's court filing further points to Vice President Cheney 's involvement in the outing of Plame .
" Special counsel Patrick J. Fitzgerald has made it clearer than ever that he was hot on the trail of a coordinated campaign to out CIA agent Valerie Plame , " writes Froomkin , " until that line of investigation was cut off by the repeated lies from Vice President Cheney 's former chief of staff , I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby . "
Froomkin adds that in response to charges that Libby 's prosecution was unwarranted , " the special counsel evidently felt obliged to put Libby 's crime in context .
And that context is Dick Cheney . "

SOUTHFIELD , Mich. , June 3 — Jack Kevorkian , the former pathologist once known as Doctor Death , says he will never again counsel a terminally ill person on how to die .
But eight years behind bars and a strict list of promises to gain parole have done nothing to mellow the blunt , passionate , combative advocate for physician - assisted suicide .
In an interview here on Sunday , two days after his release from prison , Mr. Kevorkian , 79 , let loose a rush of fierce words about a nation that did not pass any new laws allowing assisted suicide while he was in prison .
Again and again , he called the government “ the tyrant . ”
He called the public “ sheep . ”
He called some of his harshest critics “ religious fanatics or nuts . ”
Mr. Kevorkian says he assisted with more than 130 suicides in the 1990s , when he drew national attention to questions about what rights people have when it comes to dying .
Asked whether he would turn away a gravely ill person seeking his guidance now , he said gruffly , “ I ca n’t help them . ”
Mr. Kevorkian , convicted in one of those 130 cases of second - degree murder , has agreed in his parole provisions not to help anyone else commit suicide .
“ Sorry , ” he said .
“ Do n’t blame me .
Blame your government for passing the laws . ”
Financial Armageddon
Paul grew up in the western Pennsylvania town of Green Tree .
His father , the son of a German immigrant , ran a small dairy company .
Sports were big around there — one of the customers on the milk route Paul worked as a teenager was the retired baseball Hall of Famer Honus Wagner — and Paul was a terrific athlete , winning a state track meet in the 220 and excelling at football and baseball .
But knee injuries had ended his sports career by the time he went off to Gettysburg College in 1953 .
After medical school at Duke , Paul joined the Air Force , where he served as a flight surgeon , tending to the ear , nose and throat ailments of pilots , and traveling to Iran , Ethiopia and elsewhere .
“ I recall doing a lot of physicals on Army warrant officers who wanted to become helicopter pilots and go to Vietnam , ” he told me .
“ They were gung - ho .
I ’ve often thought about how many of those people never came back . ”
Paul is given to mulling things over morally .
His family was pious and Lutheran ; two of his brothers became ministers .
Paul ’s five children were baptized in the Episcopal church , but he now attends a Baptist one .
He does n’t travel alone with women and once dressed down an aide for using the expression “ red - light district ” in front of a female colleague .
As a young man , though , he did not protest the Vietnam War , which he now calls “ totally unnecessary ” and “ illegal . ”
Much later , after the United States invaded Iraq in 2003 , he began reading St. Augustine .
“ I was annoyed by the evangelicals ’ being so supportive of pre-emptive war , which seems to contradict everything that I was taught as a Christian , ” he recalls .
“ The religion is based on somebody who ’s referred to as the Prince of Peace . ”
In 1968 , Paul settled in southern Texas , where he had been stationed .
He recalls that he was for a while the only obstetrician — “ a very delightful part of medicine , ” he says — in Brazoria County .
He was already immersed in reading the economics books that would change his life .
Americans know the “ Austrian school , ” if at all , from the work of Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises , two economists who fled the Nazis in the 1930s and whose free - market doctrines helped inspire the conservative movement in the 1950s .
The laws of economics do n’t admit exceptions , say the Austrians .
You cannot fake out markets , no matter how surreptitiously you expand the money supply .
Spend more than you earn , and you are on the road to inflation and tyranny .
Such views are not always Republican orthodoxy .
Paul is a harsh critic of the Federal Reserve , both for its policies and its unaccountability .
“ We first bonded , ” recalls Barney Frank , the Massachusetts Democrat , “ because we were both conspicuous nonworshipers at the Temple of the Fed and of the High Priest Greenspan . ”
In recent weeks , Paul ’s airport reading has been a book called “ Financial Armageddon . ”
He is obsessed with sound money , which he considers — along with the related phenomena of credit excess , bubbles and uncollateralized assets of all kinds — a “ sleeper issue . ”
The United States ought to link its currency to gold or silver again , Paul says .
He puts his money where his mouth is .
According to Federal Election Commission documents , most of his investments are in gold and silver and are worth between $ 1.5 and $ 3.5 million .
It ’s a modest sum by the standards of major presidential candidates but impressive for someone who put five children through college on a doctor ’s ( and later a congressman ’s ) earnings .
For Paul , everything comes back to money , including Iraq .
“ No matter how much you love the empire , ” he says , “ it ’s unaffordable . ”
Wars are expensive , and there has been a tendency throughout history to pay for them by borrowing .
A day of reckoning always comes , says Paul , and one will come for us .
Speaking this spring before the libertarian Future of Freedom Foundation in Reston , Va. , he warned of a dollar crisis .
“ That ’s usually the way empires end , ” he said .
“ It was n’t us forcing the Soviets to build missiles that brought them down .
It was the fact that socialism does n’t work .
Our system does n’t work much better . ”
Under the banner of “ Freedom , Honesty and Sound Money , ” Paul ran for Congress in 1974 .
He lost — but took the seat in a special election in April 1976 .
He lost again in November of that year , then won in 1978 .
On two big issues , he stood on principle and was vindicated :
He was one of very few Republicans in Congress to back Ronald Reagan against Gerald Ford for the 1976 Republican nomination .
He was also one of the representatives who warned against the rewriting of banking rules that laid the groundwork for the savings - and - loan collapse of the 1980s .
Paul served three terms before losing to Phil Gramm in the Republican primary for Senate in 1984 .
Tom DeLay took over his seat .
Paul would not come back to Washington for another dozen years .
But in the time he could spare from delivering babies in Brazoria County , he remained a mighty presence in the out - of - the - limelight world of those old - line libertarians who had never made their peace with the steady growth of federal power in the 20th century .
Paul got the Libertarian Party nomination for president in 1988 , defeating the Indian activist Russell Means in a tough race .
He finished third behind Bush and Dukakis , winning nearly half a million votes .
He tended his own Foundation for Rational Economics and Education ( FREE ) and kept up his contacts with other market - oriented organizations .
What resulted was a network of true believers who would be his political base in one of the stranger Congressional elections of modern times .
After understanding the exponential function , our next target is the natural logarithm .
Given how the natural log is described in math books , there ’s little “ natural ” about it : it ’s defined as the inverse of $ e^x $ , a strange enough exponent already .
But there ’s a fresh , intuitive explanation :
The natural log gives you the time needed to reach a certain level of growth .
Suppose you have an investment in gummy bears ( who does n’t ? ) with an interest rate of 100 % per year , growing continuously .
If you want 10 x growth , assuming continuous compounding , you ’d wait only $ \ln ( 10 ) $ or 2.302 years .
Do n’t see why it only takes a few years to get 10 x growth ?
Do n’t see why the pattern is not 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 ?
Read more about e .
e and the Natural Log are twins :
$ e^x $ is the amount we have after starting at 1.0 and growing continuously for $ x$ units of time
$ \ln (x ) $ ( Natural Logarithm ) is the time to reach amount $ x $ , assuming we grew continuously from 1.0
Not too bad , right ?
While the mathematicians scramble to give you the long , technical explanation , let ’s dive into the intuitive one .
E is About Growth
The number e is about continuous growth .
As we saw last time , $ e^x $ lets us merge rate and time : 3 years at 100 % growth is the same as 1 year at 300 % growth , when continuously compounded .
We can take any combination of rate and time ( 50 % for 4 years ) and convert the rate to 100 % for convenience ( giving us 100 % for 2 years ) .
By converting to a rate of 100 % , we only have to think about the time component :
Intuitively , $ e^x $ means :
How much growth do I get after after x units of time ( and 100 % continuous growth )
For example : after 3 time periods I have $ e^3 $ = 20.08 times the amount of “ stuff ” .
$ e^x $ is a scaling factor , showing us how much growth we ’d get after $ x$ units of time .
Natural Log is About Time
The natural log is the inverse of $ e$ , a fancy term for opposite .
Speaking of fancy , the Latin name is logarithmus naturali , giving the abbreviation ln .
Now what does this inverse or opposite stuff mean ?
$ e^x $ lets us plug in time and get growth .
and get growth .
$ \ln ( x ) $ lets us plug in growth and get the time it would take .
For example :
$ e^3 $ is 20.08 .
After 3 units of time , we end up with 20.08 times what we started with .
$ \ln ( 20.08 ) $ is about 3 .
If we want growth of 20.08 , we ’d wait 3 units of time ( again , assuming a 100 % continuous growth rate ) .
With me ?
The natural log gives us the time needed to hit our desired growth .
Logarithmic Arithmetic Is Not Normal
You ’ve studied logs before , and they were strange beasts .
How ’d they turn multiplication into addition ?
Division into subtraction ?
Let ’s see .
What is $ \l n ( 1 ) $ ?
Intuitively , the question is : How long do I wait to get 1x my current amount ?
Zero. Zip. Nada .
You ’re already at 1 x your current amount !
It does n’t take any time to grow from 1 to 1 .
$ \ln ( 1 ) = 0 $
Ok , how about a fractional value ?
How long to get 1/2 my current amount ?
Assuming you are growing continuously at 100 % , we know that $ \l n ( 2 ) $ is the amount of time to double .
If we reverse it ( i.e. , take the negative time ) we ’d have half of our current value .
$ \l n ( .5 ) = – \ln ( 2 ) = -.693 $
Makes sense , right ?
If we go backwards .693 units ( negative seconds , let 's say ) we ’d have half our current amount .
In general , you can flip the fraction and take the negative : $ \ln ( 1/3 ) = – \ln ( 3 ) = - 1.09 $ .
This means if we go back 1.09 units of time , we ’d have a third of what we have now .
Ok , how about the natural log of a negative number ?
How much time does it take to “ grow ” your bacteria colony from 1 to - 3 ?
It ’s impossible !
You ca n’t have a “ negative ” amount of bacteria , can you ?
At most ( er… least ) you can have zero , but there ’s no way to have a negative amount of the little critters .
Negative bacteria just does n’t make sense .
$ \ln ( \text{negative number} ) = \ text{undefined} $
Undefined just means “ there is no amount of time you can wait ” to get a negative amount .
( Well , if we use imaginary exponentials , there is a solution .
But today let 's keep it real . )
Logarithmic Multiplication is Mighty Fun
How long does it take to grow 9 x your current amount ?
Sure , we could just use ln( 9 ) .
But that ’s too easy , let ’s be different .
We can consider 9 x growth as tripling ( taking $ \l n ( 3 ) $ units of time ) and then tripling again ( taking another $ \l n ( 3 ) $ units of time ) :
Time to grow 9x = $ \l n ( 9 ) $ =
Time to triple and triple again = $ \l n ( 3 ) + \ l n ( 3 ) $
Interesting .
Any growth number , like 20 , can be considered 2 x growth followed by 10 x growth .
Or 4 x growth followed by 5 x growth .
Or 3 x growth followed by 6.666 x growth .
See the pattern ?
$ \ln ( a * b ) = \ln ( a ) + \ln ( b ) $
The log of a times b = log ( a ) + log ( b ) .
This relationship makes sense when you think in terms of time to grow .
If we want to grow 30x , we can wait $ \ln ( 30 ) $ all at once , or simply wait $ \l n ( 3 ) $ , to triple , then wait $ \ln ( 10 ) $ , to grow 10 x again .
The net effect is the same , so the net time should be the same too ( and it is ) .
How about division ? $ \ l n ( 5/3 ) $ means :
How long does it take to grow 5 times and then take 1/3 of that ?
Well , growing 5 times is $ \l n ( 5 ) $ .
Growing 1/3 is $ - \l n ( 3 ) $ units of time .
So
$ \ln ( 5/3 ) = \ln ( 5 ) – \l n ( 3 ) $
Which says : Grow 5 times and “ go back in time ” until you have a third of that amount , so you ’re left with 5/3 growth .
In general we have
$ \ln ( a / b ) = \ln ( a ) – \ln ( b ) $
I hope the strange math of logarithms is starting to make sense : multiplication of growth becomes addition of time , division of growth becomes subtraction of time .
Do n’t memorize the rules , understand them .
Using Natural Logs With Any Rate
“ Sure , ” you say , “ This log stuff works for 100 % growth but what about the 5 % I normally get ? ”
It ’s no problem .
The “ time ” we get back from $ \ln ( ) $ is actually a combination of rate and time , the “ x ” from our $ e^x $ equation .
We just assume 100 % to make it simple , but we can use other numbers .
Suppose we want 30 x growth : plug in $ \ln ( 30 ) $ and get 3.4 .
This means :
$ e^x = \text {growth} $
$ e^ {3.4} = 30 $
And intuitively this equation means “ 100 % return for 3.4 years is 30 x growth ” .
We can consider the equation to be :
We can modify “ rate ” and “ time ” , as long as rate * time = 3.4 .
For example , suppose we want 30 x growth — how long do we wait assuming 5 % return ?
$ \ln ( 30 ) = 3.4 $
$ \text{rate} * \text{time} = 3.4 $
$ .05 * \text{time} = 3.4 $
$ \text{time} = 3.4 / .05 = 68 \ text{years} $
Intuitively , I think " $ \ln ( 30 ) = 3.4 $ , so at 100 % growth it will take 3.4 years .
If I double the rate of growth , I halve the time needed . "
100 % for 3.4 years = 1.0 * 3.4 = 3.4
200 % for 1.7 years = 2.0 * 1.7 = 3.4 [ 200 % growth means half the time ]
50 % for 6.8 years = 0.5 * 6.8 = 3.4 [ 50 % growth means double the time ]
5 % for 68 years = .05 * 68 = 3.4 [ 5 % growth means 20 x the time ]
Cool , eh ?
The natural log can be used with any interest rate or time as long as their product is the same .
You can wiggle the variables all you want .
Awesome example : The Rule of 72
The Rule of 72 is a mental math shortcut to estimate the time needed to double your money .
We ’re going to derive it ( yay ! ) and even better , we ’re going to understand it intuitively .
How long does it take to double your money at 100 % interest , compounded every year ?
Uh oh .
We ’ve been using natural log for continuous rates , but now you ’re asking for yearly interest ?
Wo n’t this mess up our formula ?
Yes , it will , but at reasonable interest rates like 5 % , 6 % or even 15 % , there is n’t much difference between yearly compounded and fully continuous interest .
So the rough formula works , uh , roughly and we ’ll pretend we ’re getting fully continuous interest .
Now the question is easy :
How long to double at 100 % interest ?
ln( 2 ) = .693 .
It takes .693 units of time ( years , in this case ) to double your money with continuous compounding with a rate of 100 % .
Ok , what if our interest is n’t 100 %
What if it ’s 5 % or 10 % ?
Simple .
As long as rate * time = .693 , we ’ll double our money :
rate * time = .693
time = .693/rate
So , if we only had 10 % growth , it ’d take .693 / .10 or 6.93 years to double .
To simplify things , let ’s multiply by 100 so we can talk about 10 rather than .10 :
time to double = 69.3 / rate , where rate is assumed to be in percent .
Now the time to double at 5 % growth is 69.3 / 5 or 13.86 years .
However , 69.3 is n’t the most divisible number .
Let ’s pick a close neighbor , 72 , which can be divided by 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 and many more numbers .
time to double =
72/rate
which is the rule of 72 !
Easy breezy .
If you want to find the time to triple , you ’d use ln( 3 ) ~ 109.8 and get
time to triple = 110 / rate
Which is another useful rule of thumb .
The Rule of 72 is useful for interest rates , population growth , bacteria cultures , and anything that grows exponentially .
Where to from here ?
I hope the natural log makes more sense — it tells you the time needed for any amount of exponential growth .
I consider it “ natural ” because e is the universal rate of growth , so ln could be considered the “ universal ” way to figure out how long things take to grow .
When you see $ \ln ( x ) $ , just think “ the amount of time to grow to x ” .
In the next article we ’ll bring e and ln together , and the sweet aroma of math will fill the air .
Appendix : The Natural Log of E
Quick quiz :
What ’s $ \ln(e ) $ ?
The math robot says : Because they are defined to be inverse functions , clearly $ \ln(e ) = 1 $
The intuitive human : ln(e ) is the amount of time it takes to get “ e ” units of growth ( about 2.718 ) .
But e is the amount of growth after 1 unit of time , so $ \ln( e ) = 1 $ .

It 's the first release since I 've become a full time Mono developer .
It 's the first release to incorporate MoMA feedback .
It 's a tremendous improvement over 1.2.2 , with over 100 MWF bugs fixed , and over 800 missing methods reported through MoMA implemented .
. Net 1.1
. Net 2.0
An Example
Mono 1.2.3 / Windows XP
Mono 1.2.3 / OpenSUSE 10.2
There 's obviously a graphical glitch down the left side , but everything else works perfectly on both Windows and Linux , without any modification to the source code .
Hopefully you will have a similar experience with your application !
MS . Net Framework / Windows XP Mono 1.2.3 / Windows XP Mono 1.2.3 / OpenSUSE 10.2
Recently we released Mono 1.2.3 ( and Mono 1.2.3.1 yesterday ) .
I am very proud of this release , for several reasons :
The biggest question of course , is " Is it ready to run your app ? " .
The one thing I learned in school is that the answer to every computer question is " It depends " .
If your app is running on the .
Net framework version 1.1 and is fully managed , the answer is yes .
We consider our support for 1.1 to be feature complete , and encourage everyone to try out their .
Net 1.1 apps on Mono .
If something is n't working , or looks wrong , it 's most likely a bug , and we want to know about it .
The bugzilla database for Mono in general is here , and the bugzilla database for MWF is here
If your app makes unmanaged calls to the Windows API , well , you did n't really expect that to be cross platform , did you ?
You 'll need to work around those calls to do the same thing in managed code , or avoid that code path when running on Mono .
A quick scan with MoMA will report any time you are making an unmanaged call ( they are labeled P / Invokes ) .
If your app is running on the .
Net framework version 2.0 , things are a bit trickier .
Although there has been much progress done on MWF 2.0 , there is still plenty that is unimplemented .
MoMA is definitely your friend here .
It will scan your app for any functionality you use that has not been implemented yet in Mono .
Running it is pretty self explanatory , so I wo n't cover it here .
A lot of the stuff that is reported is n't necessary and you can work around it if you want your app running on Mono today .
Of course , you may run into functionality that you can't live without .
Either way , please submit the report at the end so we know what real - world functionality people need .
( And if you are real adventurous , you can download the source code to Mono and try to implement what you need .
We 'd love to incorporate your contribution . )
Maybe you do n't have an app or Mono is n't ready for your app yet , but you 'd still like to see what Mono is capable of .
I think one of the best places for examples is CodeProject .
Looking for a non-trivial 1.1 app , I found this game of Reversi .
I think I just like it because it animates the pieces , which alleviates the frustration stemming from the fact that I totally suck at Reversi .
Next time I 'll do a guide of how to download Mono and run the game , but for a preview of what it looks like running on the various platforms :

Suppose you have a list in python that looks like this :
[ 'a ' , ' b ' , ' a ' ] # or like this : [ 1 , 2 , 2 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 ]
and you want to remove all duplicates so you get this result :
[ 'a ' , ' b ' ] # or [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ]
How do you do that ?
... the fastest way ?
I wrote a couple of alternative implementations and did a quick benchmark loop on the various implementations to find out which way was the fastest .
( I have n't looked at memory usage ) .
The slowest function was 78 times slower than the fastest function .
However , there 's one very important difference between the various functions .
Some are order preserving and some are not .
For example , in an order preserving function , apart from the duplicates , the order is guaranteed to be the same as it was inputted .
Eg , uniqify ( [ 1, 2, 2,3 ] ) == [ 1,2,3 ]
Here are the functions :
def f1 ( seq ) : # not order preserving set = {} map ( set .
__setitem__ , seq , [ ] ) return set .
keys ( ) def f2 ( seq ) : # order preserving checked = [ ] for e in seq : if e not in checked : checked .
append ( e ) return checked def f3 ( seq ) : #
Not order preserving keys = {} for e in seq : keys [ e ] = 1 return keys .
keys ( ) def f4 ( seq ) : # order preserving noDupes = [ ] [ noDupes .
append ( i ) for i in seq if not noDupes .
count ( i ) ] return noDupes def f5 ( seq , idfun = None ) : # order preserving if idfun is None : def idfun ( x ) : return x seen = {} result = [ ] for item in seq : marker = idfun ( item ) # in old Python versions : # if seen .
has_key ( marker ) # but in new ones : if marker in seen : continue seen [ marker ] = 1 result .
append ( item ) return result def f6 ( seq ) : #
Not order preserving set =
Set ( seq ) return list ( set )
And what you 've all been waiting for ( if you 're still reading ) .
Here are the results :
* f2 13.24 * f4 11.73 * f5 0.37 f1 0.18 f3 0.17 f6 0.19 ( * order preserving )
Clearly f5 is the " best " solution .
Not only is it really really fast ; it 's also order preserving and supports an optional transform function which makes it possible to do this :
>>> a = list ( ' ABeeE ' ) >>> f5 ( a ) [ ' A ' , ' B ' , ' e ' , ' E ' ] >>>
f5 ( a , lambda x : x . lower ( ) ) [ ' A ' , ' B ' , 'e ' ]
Download the benchmark script here
UPDATE
From the comments I 've now added a couple of more functions to the benchmark .
Some which do n't support uniqify a list of objects that can't be hashed unless passed with a special hashing method .
So see all the functions download the file
Here are the new results :
* f5 10.1 * f5 b 9.99 * f8 6.49 * f10 6.57 * f11 6.6 f1 4.28 f3 3.55 f6 4.03 f7 2.59 f9 2.58
( f2 and f4 ) were too slow for this testdata .
UPDATE Dec 2017
Fastest way to uniquify a list in Python >=3.6

The last time a workprint copy of a high profile movie hit the web , a BitTorrent site got shutdown by the FBI and several people went to jail .
A US citizen caught seeding a pre-release movie faces 5 years in jail but according to the President of movie company Lions Gate , a jail sentence must be inappropriate .
What level of devastating financial impact will be felt at the box office due to Hostel : Part 2 piracy ?
" Nothing meaningful " he says .
When workprint copies of Lions Gate ’s violent horror sequel ‘ Hostel : Part II ’ started showing up on BitTorrent networks , I commented glibly to my colleague that it would be a ‘ real horror ’ if a US citizen got caught being involved with the initial seeding of it .
After the EliteTorrents / Star Wars Episode III drama and the subsequent jailing of several people including Scott McCausland , Grant Stanley , Sam Kuonen and Scott D. Harvanek , a high profile pre-release such as Hostel : Part 2 is great propaganda material for the likes of the MPAA when they catch the culprit .
Movie companies and the MPAA tell us of their $ 18bn per annum lost revenue due to piracy and use this to pressure government to bring in more and more restrictive laws and then use them to get people jailed for getting involved in pre-release movies .
So when Lions Gate President Tom Ortenberg spoke about the pre-release of his latest money spinner , one could be forgiven for expecting a speech about millions in lost revenue and how pirates ought to be sent to the electric chair after stealing food from his starving child ’s mouth .
Amazingly , not so .
He said the movie was ‘ in a rough , unfinished form ’ ( normal for a workprint copy ) , something with which amateur reviewers of the leaked version of the movie generally agreed .
But what about the millions of dollars of revenue , lost to piracy ?
“ It ’s distressing and disappointing ” said Ortenberg “ but it will have no meaningful impact on the box office ” .
No Meaningful Impact
… yet in the US , you can get 5 years in jail for it .
Ask sk0t how he feels about that .
Let ’s hope Tom Ortenberg ’s words are admissible in evidence , should the FBI decide that 6 more people need to go to jail for costing the movie industry no money .

War games show Bush wrong on Iraq pullout ; Qaeda unlikely to succeed David Edwards and Will Menaker
Published : Thursday July 19 , 2007 Print This Email This Enjoy this story ?

Supporters of the war in Iraq -- including President George W. Bush -- claim that a withdrawal of US forces would lead to an al Qaeda takeover of Iraq .
Yet according to Pentagon war games , this scenario is highly unlikely .
On Wednesday 's Countdown Keith Olbermann interviewed Washington Post correspondent Thomas Ricks who discussed his article on Pentagon war gaming for a post - US Iraq .
Pentagon simulations on US withdrawal find the most likely scenario would be a three - way split of the country between Kurds , Shias , and Sunnis .
Ricks warns while the breakup would be " very ugly , " with possibly " tens of thousands of people dying , " an al Qaeda takeover of Iraq would not be possible by " any stretch of the imagination . "
In addition , the war games also found Iran would not benefit from US withdrawal , and in fact would be sucked in to the same kind of destabilizing sectarian conflict the US finds itself embroiled in .
Olbermann asked Ricks whether it is fair to draw the conclusion that the best way to stop Iran from interfering in Iraq is to leave , to which Ricks responded , that while there are no " good answers " left in Iraq , leaving would make it significantly easier to deal with Iran .
Ricks noted that while these lessons appear to be taken to heart by members of the military , it is ultimately up to them to convince the White House come September , when this war will become " General Petraeus ' war " just as much as it is Bush's .
The following video is from MSNBC's Countdown , broadcast on July 18 .
Editor ’s note : Antiwar.com Assistant Editor Scott Horton wrote the following essay for the Oxford Forum , whose editors asked him to contribute a piece on the Anglo - American role in international conflict .
Unfortunately , the Forum ‘s editors rewrote the essay without Horton ’s permission , distorting its thesis beyond all recognition .
It appears here in its full , original version .
Most Americans can’t believe that their government maintains an overseas empire of as many as 1,000 military bases .
U.S. interventions are always portrayed to us as defensive in nature , and for one simple reason : Americans do n’t want empire .
Our country was founded in revolution from the clutches of empire , and our culture celebrates those who oppose it , from George Washington to Luke Skywalker .
We do n’t want empire , but we have one .
Since the end of the second World War , the people of the United States and of the world have had to deal with the terrible consequences of our country ’s involvement .
It turns out it ’s nearly impossible to turn a limited constitutional republic into a globe - spanning , war - making leviathan and then go back again .
The Battle of Britain was won .
The Germans had no ability to mount a successful land invasion of England  or even an unsuccessful one .
If they had , certainly the English would have stashed the queen away somewhere and fought an insurgency as ruthlessly as the French , Russians , and Serbs , among others .
The British empire may have been lost without U.S. help , but in the end , it was anyway .
However , the USSR was preserved by American intervention .
The U.S. - UK invasion of Europe simply popped the lid off the jar wherein the two most despicable regimes in the world were stuck fighting each other .
Had America not helped , the Soviets would likely have met defeat , with the vastly overextended Nazi empire on course for the same fate soon after .
Instead , Stalin enslaved half of Europe , helped Communists seize power in China , killed millions more , and ultimately provided the pretext for America ’s dominion over the Old World ’s empires for the next half - century .
( The Holocaust was never a reason for American intervention .
Indeed , Roosevelt delayed doing anything about the death camps for as long as he could . )
The consequences of American intervention for the Eastern Europeans were summed up by former President Herbert Hoover in terms that also foreshadowed the coming propaganda model for the new enemy :
" In June 1941 , when Britain was safe from German invasion due to Hitler ’s diversion to attack Stalin , I urged that the gargantuan jest of all history would be our giving aid to the Soviet government .
I urged that we should allow those two dictators to exhaust each other .
I stated that the result of our assistance would be to spread Communism over the whole world .
The consequences have proved that I was right . "
For a short time after World War II , as after every previous war , the U.S. began to demilitarize , but the inheritance of so many foreign empires demanded a permanent state of military readiness and deployment  and an excuse .
The only way to gain consent to secure this world empire would be to " scare the hell out of the American people "  that is , lie  as Republican Sen.
Arthur Vandenberg advised President Harry Truman .
Suddenly , the Soviet Union , despite having just lost 20 million people fighting the Germans and with blind devotion to a system that had been proved not to work a generation before , was going to take over " the whole world " if we did n’t stop it .
Millions of Americans trusted this new crusade to be " containment , " not world empire .
The " Cold War , " however , was merely a ruse , as former CIA adviser , ardent Cold Warrior , and self - described " spear carrier for empire " Chalmers Johnson now realizes and admits .
Today ’s neoconservative doctrine of " benevolent global hegemony " is merely the newest stage in an empire made permanent long ago .
The role the national government took in the society and economy could not be more than partially scaled back after World War II ; there was just too much money in it .
Companies who prospered during the war wanted their newfound access to the U.S. Treasury preserved .
America has since employed Pearl Harbor - style attacks against populations in dozens of countries as a matter of course , often , it seems , just so it can keep buying more bombs .
And all along the American people have internalized these policies , believing even that they had come up with them .
As Randolph Bourne wrote back in 1918 :
" War is the health of the state .
[ In wartime , ] the State thus becomes an instrument by which the power of the whole herd is wielded for the benefit of a class .
The rulers soon learn to capitalize the reverence which the State produces in the majority , and turn it into a general resistance toward a lessening of their privileges . "
The American people are a captive market of 300 million for many of the world ’s wealthiest corporations  particularly when it comes to raiding the Pentagon vault , what military strategist William S. Lind calls " the largest honey pot in the world . "
Lobbyists representing the munitions industries have multi-million dollar budgets to spend on niceties for congressmen , military officials , and anyone else crucial for access to hundreds of billions of dollars .
For those in the right position , it ’s the best investment in the world .
Former USAID attorney and international law professor Richard Cummings , in his explosive article for Playboy magazine in March , " Lockheed Stock and Two Smoking Barrels , " documented the decisive role played by the military industries in setting the policy of the United States .
Indeed , as Cummings shows , many of the biggest players in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq were closely connected to Lockheed , Boeing , and Northrop Grumman .
Neoconservative ringleader Richard Perle ’s firm Trireme Partners famously cashed in on the Terror War for over $ 20 million .
In 2002 , Lockheed executives actually set up an " advisory board " to come up with excuses for invading Iraq .
( They mostly settled on crimes committed by Saddam back when he was working for the U.S. , since there were no weapons of mass destruction . )
But American Cold War policy created the best enemy the War Party could have ever hoped for in the modern Sunni jihadist movement .
As Professor John Mueller points out in his book Overblown , after the defeat in Vietnam , " containment " lost favor , and the U.S. even turned to encouraging the Russians .
Near the end of the 1970s the United States began a massive covert operation to lure the Soviet Union into invading Afghanistan in order to give them their own " Vietnam War . "
So ceasing to contain the USSR broke their economy , while the training and weapons given to the mujahedeen by the U.S. provided the experience needed for some to coalesce into what is now known as al - Qaeda  whose enemy is no longer Russia .
President Carter ’s National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski admitted as much with a shrug to the French magazine Le Nouvel Observateur in 1998 :
" What is most important to the history of the world  the Taliban or the collapse of the Soviet empire ?
Some stirred - up Muslims or the liberation of Central Europe and the end of the Cold War ? "
The Cold War did end , and it was the perfect opportunity for President George H.W.
Bush to show the world what it means to abdicate power for the sake of liberty by abolishing NATO , but he did n’t .
In fact , when informed of the USSR ’s imminent collapse , Brent Scowcroft and James Baker attempted to intervene and find a way to save the evil empire  to no avail .
Anyone who believed they would get their " peace dividend " by that point was a fool .
The American empire was here to stay .
The first chance George Bush Sr. had , he invaded Panama , killing thousands .
Soon thereafter , with a determined Prime Minister Thatcher as a backbone , he sent the U.S. Army to the Middle East to stay for good .
Osama bin Laden issued his " Declaration of War Against the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Places " in 1996 .
And even though the Clinton administration backed the Muslim Kosovo Liberation Army during the bombing of Serbia in 1999 and paid the Taliban millions of dollars , bin Laden remained hostile .
In his book Dying to Win , Robert A . Pape shows that suicide terrorism has only one cause : foreign occupation .
So the invasion of Iraq has certainly compounded a serious problem .
In 2005 , the Royal Institute of International Affairs wrote :
" There is no doubt that the situation over Iraq has imposed particular difficulties for the UK , and for the wider coalition against terrorism .
It gave a boost to the al - Qaeda network ’s propaganda , recruitment , and fundraising , caused a major split in the coalition , provided an ideal targeting and training area for al - Qaeda - linked terrorists .
Riding pillion with a powerful ally has proved costly in terms of British and U.S. military lives , Iraqi lives , military expenditure , and the damage caused to the counter - terrorism campaign . "
That ’s the kind of thing that keeps BAE Systems on the American dole for the long haul  a perfect setup for all war parties involved .
Osama seems a farsighted hero to radicalized millions , and those who lurk around the U.S. government till have an enemy vague enough to last , according to Vice President Cheney , " decades . "
The Terror War has already spread to Africa , and a new military command , AFRICOM , has been set up there .
The recent U.S. - backed Ethiopian invasion of Somalia in the name of catching three al - Qaeda " commanders "  is only the beginning , as bin Laden predicted in an audio tape in the summer of 2006 .
Many liberals who oppose the invasion and occupation of Iraq are pushing hard for an invasion of Sudan  next on bin Laden ’s wish list .
In his newest book , Nemesis : The Last Days of the American Republic , Chalmers Johnson explains that following World War II the English were left with a choice between becoming the subjects of their own empire or abandoning it , and they chose the latter .
So while the people of Iraq , Afghanistan , and Somalia suffer , the Bill of Rights burns , the U.S. government condones and uses torture , local police become more dependent on the national government , the president ’s lawyers argue for a " unitary executive " with " plenary powers , " the national debt tops $ 9 trillion , and important provisions of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1876 and the Insurrection Act of 1807 are scrapped , very serious questions emerge :
Are these the last days of the American republic ?
Can we never turn back ?
Must we implode like the USSR or be carpet - bombed like the British ?
Peace preserves liberty .
America ’s founders knew this .
They advised the likes of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt , and indeed the American people , to stay out of political entanglements with the Old World and to be friends with everyone , allies with none .
America would be much better served if we gave up " global hegemony " and fought only in defense of our own liberty  our true legacy as a country born in revolution and secession from empire .
Computing Thoughts
Python IDEs
by Bruce Eckel
February 15 , 2006
Summary
I often get questions , mostly from Java programmers , about IDEs for Python .
In Java there 's so much finger - typing that the language would n't be feasible without an auto - completion IDE , so it makes sense that a Java programmer would want one when using Python .
And they exist , but I do n't know many who use them .
Advertisement
Actually , when I 'm writing code for a book I do n't use an IDE even for Java .
I 've been tempted many times , but Eclipse , for example , required that you put everything in packages .
In the first chapters of Thinking in Java , packages have n't been introduced yet so I can't use them ( although I 've heard that Eclipse can now just work with the Ant files , so a recent version might work with my code , which comes with automatically - created Ant files ) .
In addition , I am typically hand - crafting every line of code , so I have n't been as compelled to move to a Java IDE , although it is tempting .
From listening to the Java Posse guys , for example , it sounds like Matisse inside Netbeans has finally -- after 10 years , with JavaBeans in the language almost from the beginning -- created a drag - and - drop GUI builder worthy of competing with VB .
And in general the autocompletion , refactoring and general automation is certainly something I 'd want on a project other than a beginning book .
As far as Python goes , the argument for an IDE is not so compelling .
Most people I know just use regular editors .
I think the reason is that Python is less verbose .
The example I often give is to read each line from a file , which I can do in Python without thinking about it :
for line in file ( " filename.txt " ) : print line
In Java , it 's a research project to open a file .
In Thinking in Java 4e , I added a utility called TextFile to simplify the process , so you can say :
for( String line : new TextFile ( " filename.txt " ) ) { System.out.println( line ) ; }
And you could probably memorize this easily enough , but it's not standard Java , alas ( and there are other interesting ways to use the Text File class ) .
The point is that Java is more verbose and it really is necessary to have an IDE .
But in Python , you can typically figure out what a class does just by using dir ( ) , and you usually have to look up the docs anyway to know what a method does rather than just using it .
The compulsion to use an autocompletion IDE is much lower , in my experience , and it seems true for the people that I know , as well .
I guess another way to put it is that productivity in Python is inherent in the language , whereas in Java you really do need the productivity boost that an IDE gives you .
That said , I would be curious as to the IDE ( or Eclipse plugin , etc. ) that people prefer for Python programming , and what they like about it -- especially if you think it improves your productivity .

The Big Three continues to lose market share , 15 percentage points over the last 17 years to be exact ( 71.6 % in 1990 to 56.6 % today ) , see chart above .
A 15 percent loss of market share translates to more than 2.25 millions vehicles per year that are NOT being produced any more by the Big Three .
That loss of market share also translates into huge losses by the Big Three : Ford lost $ 12.7 billion in 2006 , GM lost $ 2 billion in 2006 after losing $ 10.4 billion in 2005 , and Chrysler lost $ 1.5 billion last year .
Meanwhile , Toyota , Honda and Nissan continue to gain market share ( almost double since 1990 to 33 % ) , and make profits , see the comparison in stocks price above between Toyota ( +150 % in the last 5 years ) and GM ( - 50 % over the same period ) .
The current 4 - year UAW contract expires in September , and negotiations for a new contract will soon be under way .
In advance of the contract talks , 2,500 UAW members have just signed a " no- more - concessions " petition , suggesting they wo n't agree to pay any more of their own health care costs .
From today's
Investor 's Business Daily
, " If the UAW is n't careful , it could kill America 's Big Three .
The union has made it clear that it will oppose the carmakers ' insistence that workers have a larger financial stake in their own health care .
With Ford , GM and Chrysler projecting that they will pay $ 12 billion this year in health care costs for their U.S. employees , retirees and family members , that seems to be a reasonable request .
The UAW 's golden era is over .
Unless its leaders and members concede that it 's been overtaken by economic reality and begin to act accordingly , the UAW will soon move into its rust years . "
The most common form of life on Earth may be tiny forms of bacteria , if new research in Australia is confirmed .
And right now they might be living on Mars , as well as in Earth rocks and even inside your body .
A geologist from the University of Queensland claims to have found minute multiplying bacteria under her microscope .
These would be the first breeding nanobacteria identified .
The nanobacteria grow on minerals
But then a colleague noticed what appeared to be fungus growing on the samples .
She went back to her slides and saw spore - like structures that reminded her of germinating bacteria .
Tests are now underway to try to get DNA out of the nanobacteria .
Dr Uwins does not like the word nanobacteria because she does not know the evolutionary development of her discoveries .
She has called the organisms " nanobes " .
The supposed nanomicrobe in the Mars rock
Nanobacteria are far smaller than any known bacteria .
Indeed , many critics believe they are smaller than the minimum possible size for a living cell .
Some scientists argue that these tiny structures were formed by geological processes , not biological ones .
They point out that there is no evidence for life forms only 10 % of the size of the smallest known microbes on Earth .
But there are scientists who have claimed numerous examples of nanobacteria on Earth .
Foremost among them is Dr Robert Folk of the University of Texas .
Nanobacteria everywhere
After looking at mineral deposits near volcanoes , he claimed , many years before the Nasa announcement , to have identified bacteria very much smaller than hitherto seen .
He believes that such bacteria form the bulk of living things on Earth and may be responsible for the rusting of metal and the " greening " of copper .
The Nasa team picked up Folk 's work when describing the tube - shaped forms they saw in the Martian meteorite as " similar in size and shape to nanobacteria .
But why have nanobacteria escaped biologists ' notice if they are so abundant ?
Robert Folk believes that the minuscule creatures have simply eluded the conventional tools used to study bacteria .
Inside you
Other research suggests that nanobacteria may have direct effects on humans .
They may cause kidney stones
Possible nanobacteria found in limestone
A team from the University of Kuopio say that analyses of 30 human kidney - stone specimens has revealed that all of them contained nanobacteria .
The researchers show that nanobacteria grown in the laboratory produce calcium phosphate formations , much like those found in kidney , gall , and bladder stones .
Since they have found that nanobacteria can be grown in a mixture similar to filtered urine , they may provide valuable information for studying and treating kidney stones .
Mexico's Cave of Giant Crystals
The Naica Mine of Chihuahua , Mexico , is a working mine that is known for its extraordinary crystals .
Naica is a lead , zinc and silver mine in which large voids have been found , containing crystals of selenite ( gypsum ) as large as 4 feet in diameter and 50 feet long .
The chamber holding these crystals is known as the Crystal Cave of Giants , and is approximately 1000 feet down in the limestone host rock of the mine .
The crystals were formed by hydrothermal fluids emanating from the magma chambers below .
The cavern was discovered while the miners were drilling through the Naica fault , which they were worried would flood the mine .
The Cave of Swords is another chamber in the Naica Mine , containing similar large crystals .
The Naica mine was first discovered by early prospectors in 1794 south of Chihuahua City .
They struck a vein of silver at the base of a range of hills called Naica by the Tarahumara Indians .
The origin in the Tarahumara language seems to mean " a shady place " .
Perhaps here in the small canyon there was a grove of trees tucked away by a small canyon spring .
From that discovery , until around 1900 , the primary interest was silver and gold .
Around 1900 large - scale mining began as zinc and lead became more valuable .
During the Mexican Revolution the mine was producing a great deal of wealth .
Revolutionary troops entered the town and demanded money from the owners .
One of them was assassinated when he refused to pay , causing the mine to shut down from 1911 to 1922 .
Just before the mine was closed , the famous Cave of Swords was discovered at a depth of 400 feet .
Due to the incredible crystals , it was decided to try to preserve this cave .
While many of the crystals have been collected , this is still a fascinating cave to visit .
In one part there are so many crystals on one of the walls , they appear to be like an underwater reef moving in a gentle undulating motion in an ocean current .
In April 2000 , brothers Juan and Pedro Sanchez were drilling a new tunnel when they made a truly spectacular discovery .
While Naica miners are accustomed to finding crystals , Juan and Pedro were absolutely amazed by the cavern that they found .
The brothers immediately informed the engineer in charge , Roberto Gonzalez .
Ing .
Gonzalez realized that they had discovered a natural treasure and quickly rerouted the tunnel .
During this phase some damage was done as several miners tried to remove pieces of the mega- crystals , so the mining company soon installed an iron door to protect the find .
Later , one of the workers , with the intention of stealing crystals , managed to get in through a narrow hole .
He tried to take some plastic bags filled with fresh air inside , but the strategy did n't work .
He lost consciousness and later was found thoroughly baked .
When entering the cave our group is issued helmets , lanterns , rubber boots , and gloves .
One must then be driven by truck into the main mining tunnel called Rampa Sn. Francisco .
While the vertical drop is approximately 1000 feet , the drive is almost a half mile long .
The heat steadily increases and women have been observed to begin " glowing " .
The truck stops in front of a concrete wall with a steel door .
The intense heat can prevent brain functioning .
At the end of the tunnel there are three or four steps into the aperture of the cavern itself .
It is in this short tunnel .
In this short distance the temperature and humidity goes from being uncomfortably warm to literally a blast furnace .
Momentarily , the penetrating heat is forgotten as the crystals pop into view on the other side of the " Eye of the Queen " .
The entire panorama is now lighted and the cavern has a depth and impressive cathedral - like appearance that was not visible on earlier trips with just our headlamps .
When inside the great cathedral of crystals , the pressure of intense heat create a gamut of emotions and perhaps hallucinations .
One can only remain for a short period of time .
Geologists report that these natural crystal formations are incredibly complex , yet so simple .
They have a magical or metaphysical personality independent of their chemical structures .
There is a magma chamber two to three miles below the mountain and that heat from this compressed lava travels through the faults up into the area of the mine .
Super heated fluids carry the minerals the miners are seeking as well as form the crystals .
The mine is ventilated ; otherwise , it could not be worked .
Some parts , however , are not air - conditioned , such as the Cave of the Crystals , and there you feel the heat from the magma deep below .
The fluids travel along the Naica fault , enter voids in the bedrock , and then form entirely natural structures that are not easily explained scientifically .
In April 2000 , the mining company became confident that the water table on the other side of the fault had been lowered sufficiently to drill .
When they did this , it is almost as if a magical veil of reality was breached and an entirely new world was discovered .
Two caverns filled with the Earth 's largest crystals were immediately revealed .
More discoveries are expected to be made in this magical kingdom of intense natural beauty .
Selenite , the gypsum crystal , named after the Greek goddess of the moon , Selene , due to its soft white light , is said to have many metaphysical and healing benefits .
Selenite powder has been used cosmetically for thousands of years to enhance one 's natural beauty .
It is believed that this crystal assists with mental focus , growth , luck , immunity , and soothes the emotions .

Naica 's crystal caves hold long - dormant life BBC - February 20 , 2017
Scientists have extracted long - dormant microbes from inside the famous giant crystals of the Naica mountain caves in Mexico - and revived them .
The organisms were likely to have been encased in the striking shafts of gypsum at least 10,000 years ago , and possibly up to 50,000 years ago .
It is another demonstration of the ability of life to adapt and cope in the most hostile of environments .
" Other people have made longer - term claims for the antiquity of organisms that were still alive , but in this case these organisms are all very extraordinary - they are not very closely related to anything in the known genetic databases , " said Dr Penelope Boston .
The new director of Nasa 's Astrobiology Institute in Moffett Field , California , described her findings here at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) .
Crystals Break Slow Growth Record Seeker - September 13 , 2011
Buried a thousand feet below Mexico's Naica mountain , the " Cave of Crystals " are the slowest growing ever measured .
Researchers have measured the slowest crystal growth ever , which created the massive , underground gypsum crystals found in Mexico 's Naica mine .
Some crystals may have taken as much as a million years to form , growing by the width of a hair each century .
The largest crystals in the mine are at 36 feet long and more than three feet across .

what features to add ?
things that are crucial for success ( eg tagging ) – very usable , must be added do n’t add something that exist elsewhere ( e.g. messages ) if something is asked , try understand the reason , what ’s the real problem that needs to be solved some features have a too heavy performance price ( eg query calculus )
put RSS every possible thing always be able to answer : is there new data in this RSS ( by time ) ?
this will save access to data RSS is the heaviest traffic
hide everything of the underlying framework ( e.g. , filename.php )

Afterward , Ms. Rice said : “ We have no desire to have difficult relations with anyone in Iran . ”
She said the United States has been very clear that “ we are prepared to change 27 years of policy and engage in a broad range of issues ” with Iran if Iran accepts international demands that it suspend its nuclear enrichment program .
Whether American and Iranian officials would meet and talk directly here at all has been one of the major questions surrounding the international conference .
On Thursday , Ms. Rice met with her Syrian counterpart , the first high - level diplomatic contact between Washington and Damascus in more than two years .
The meetings with Syrian and Iranian officials appeared to signal a significant , if unstated , change in approach for the Bush White House concerning relations in the Middle East , analysts throughout the region said .
Washington is asking for help , even from foes it has spurned in the past .
Under pressure from its Arab allies , the Bush administration has slowly edged away from its position that direct talks can be conducted only as a reward for what it considers good behavior .
Iranian - American relations have been especially tense lately , with the United States saying that Shiite militias in Iraq have used weaponry from Iran in attacks on American troops , and with the United States pressing Iran to suspend its nuclear enrichment program .
The United States has no diplomatic relations with Iran and has sought to isolate and contain the country .
In today ’s opening remarks at the conference , Iran ’s foreign minister , Mr. Mottaki , did not seem to have changed his country ’s position toward the United States .
“ The terrorists claim that they are fighting the forces of occupation , while the occupiers justify their presence under the pretext of the war on terror , ” he said .
“ Therefore , this axis of occupation - terrorism is the root of all problems in Iraq . ”

Story Highlights • British withdrawal comes as U.S. adds more troops into Iraq
• White House portrays British move as a sign of progress
• British troops that remain will train Iraqi military and police forces
Adjust font size :
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair will order nearly half the British troops in Iraq home by the end of 2007 , British news outlets reported early Wednesday .
Blair will tell the House of Commons Wednesday that 1,500 soldiers will return to Britain within weeks , and 3,000 will follow suit by the end of the year , The Sun newspaper reported .
Britain has a contingent of 7,000 in Iraq now , based mostly in the southern city of Basra .
" Control of the south of the country , unaffected by the civil war raging around Baghdad , will be handed back to the Iraqis , " the Sun reported on page one .
( Watch what may be the factors behind the decision )
The move comes a month after Blair said that an " arbitrary timetable " for withdrawal " would send the most disastrous signal to the people we are fighting in Iraq . "
His anticipated announcement comes as the United States sends more troops into Iraq in an effort to put down a wave of sectarian violence in Baghdad and pacify Anbar province , the heart of the Sunni insurgency .
Blair had discussed his plans with U.S. President George W. Bush during a videoconference Tuesday morning , the White House said .
It portrayed the news from Britain as a sign of progress in the nearly 4 - year - old war .
" We 're pleased that conditions in Basra have improved sufficiently that they are able to transition more control to the Iraqis , " National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
" The United States shares the same goal of turning responsibility over to the Iraqi Security Forces and reducing the number of American troops in Iraq . "
A senior U.S. administration official compared Blair 's plan to the one offered by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group in December .
In the coming months , the British military will consolidate its bases in the Basra area and in some cases hand them over to Iraqi authorities , Bush administration officials familiar with the British plan said .
This will enable British troops to focus on training Iraqi police and troops , while Iraqi units take a greater role in patrolling Basra 's streets .
Opposition to the war has hurt Blair politically , with his ruling Labor Party losing seats in Parliament and in local elections in the past two years .
The prime minister announced in September that he would leave office within a year .
More than 130 British troops have been killed in Iraq .
In January , when the United States announced plans to increase its contingent in Iraq by more than 20,000 , British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett said London would not be following suit .
Britain contributed about 46,000 soldiers , sailors and air force personnel to the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 .
More than half those troops were withdrawn within two months of the invasion , leaving the remaining contingent in Basra .
Report of the withdrawal comes three days after reports that Prince Harry would deploy with his unit to Iraq in April or May .
( Full story )
His father , Prince Charles , was a pilot with the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy .
Harry 's grandfather , Prince Philip , had a distinguished career in the Royal Navy .
Harry 's uncle , Prince Andrew , was a Royal Navy pilot and served in the Falklands War against Argentina 25 years ago .
CNN 's Suzanne Malveaux contributed to this report .
Since the failed car bomb plot was uncovered in London the cable news networks have gone wall to wall terror .
" Hardball " host , Chris Matthews brought in DNC Communications Director , Karen Finney to discuss the politics of terror with her counterpart from the RNC .
Finney makes quick work of the RNC hack , slapping down her talking points about the Iraq war the second they spewed from her mouth .
This is exactly how you deal with right wing spin and lies -- come armed with the truth and never back down .

Major kudos to the DNC for hiring Finney , they could use a few more just like her .
John Amato : I usually like to wait a bit before I post anything about these attacks because the wall to wall coverage on teevee is so full of idiotic speculation .
I found this quote quite interesting though :
Londoners seemed relatively unfazed by the news .
People crowded onto buses and subway trains during the afternoon rush hour , shopping streets were busy and sidewalk cafes did brisk business .
" Sure , it 's disturbing , and obviously it reminds everyone of 7/7 , " said Ian Hiskos , 32 , eating at a cafe across the block from the police cordon on Haymarket .
" I try not to think about these things . "
That 's not the attitude the bed - wetting wingnutosphere embraces or one Rudy can run on ...

And God Himself to man revealing ,
Th' harmonious spheres
Make music , though unheard their pealing
By mortal ears !

Foreword
" We also have a religion which was given to our forefathers , and has been handed down to us their children .
It teaches us to be thankful , to be united , and to love one another !
We never quarrel about religion . "
Thus spoke the great Seneca orator , Red Jacket , in his superb reply to Missionary Cram more than a century ago , and I have often heard the same thought expressed by my countrymen .
I have attempted to paint the religious life of the typical American Indian as it was before he knew the white man .
I have long wished to do this , because I cannot find that it has ever been seriously , adequately , and sincerely done .
The religion of the Indian is the last thing about him that the man of another race will ever understand .
First , the Indian does not speak of these deep matters so long as he believes in them , and when he has ceased to believe he speaks inaccurately and slightingly .
Second , even if he can be induced to speak , the racial and religious prejudice of the other stands in the way of his sympathetic comprehension .
Third , practically all existing studies on this subject have been made during the transition period , when the original beliefs and philosophy of the native American were already undergoing rapid disintegration .
There are to be found here and there superficial accounts of strange customs and ceremonies , of which the symbolism or inner meaning was largely hidden from the observer ; and there has been a great deal of material collected in recent years which is without value because it is modern and hybrid , inextricably mixed with Biblical legend and Caucasian philosophy .
Some of it has even been invented for commercial purposes .
Give a reservation Indian a present , and he will possibly provide you with sacred songs , a mythology , and folk - lore to order !
My little book does not pretend to be a scientific treatise .
It is as true as I can make it to my childhood teaching and ancestral ideals , but from the human , not the ethnological standpoint .
I have not cared to pile up more dry bones , but to clothe them with flesh and blood .
So much as has been written by strangers of our ancient faith and worship treats it chiefly as matter of curiosity .
I should like to emphasize its universal quality , its personal appeal !
The first missionaries , good men imbued with the narrowness of their age , branded us as pagans and devil - worshipers , and demanded of us that we abjure our false gods before bowing the knee at their sacred altar .
They even told us that we were eternally lost , unless we adopted a tangible symbol and professed a particular form of their hydra - headed faith .
We of the twentieth century know better !
We know that all religious aspiration , all sincere worship , can have but one source and one goal .
We know that the God of the lettered and the unlettered , of the Greek and the barbarian , is after all the same God ; and , like Peter , we perceive that He is no respecter of persons , but that in every nation he that feareth Him and worketh righteousness is acceptable to Him .

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) is making waves with a planned amendment to the Higher Education Reauthorization
Act being introduced in time for the next school year .
Reid 's amendment holds select educational funds hostage for US colleges and universities that do not meet a set of criteria meant to bolster the war on file - sharing on college campuses .
This is the legislative carrot - and - stick move that many colleges have feared would arise .
The amendment would essentially put US colleges in the business of aggressively policing copyright on their network in order to stay off of a " blacklist " that would be comprised primarily of RIAA and MPAA accusations .
More disturbing , the US Secretary of Education would conduct an annual review of the top 25 file - sharing schools according to that " blacklist " and place those schools on " probation " pending their mandatory adoption of technological measures meant to block file - sharing .
According to the most recent version of the amendment , such schools must " provide evidence to the Secretary that the institution has developed a plan for implementing a technology - based deterrent to prevent the illegal downloading or peer - to - peer distribution of intellectual property . "
The amendment does not address how copyright holders or their representatives such as the RIAA or the MPAA collect their data or represent it .
It simply assumes that such data constitutes an objective assessment of comparative file - sharing activity at US schools .
This is , of course , utter nonsense , because a school with 70,000 students will likely have more notices than one with 2,000 students .
As such , the bill smells like a favor to the anti-P2P tech industry , in that it 's basically lining up 25 enormous schools as new customers .
Better yet , taxpayers will get to foot the bill , as more than 50 percent of the last RIAA Top 25 was comprised of state schools .
The Digital Freedom Campaign had harsh words for the amendment .
" No one supports illegal downloading or file sharing , but the Digital Freedom Campaign and its members believe that Universities have more urgent things to do with their scarce budgets than collect information on their students for the government and for the RIAA , " said Jennifer Stoltz , a spokesperson for the Digital Freedom Campaign .
" Academic resources would be better spent educating students rather than spying on them at the behest of large corporations . "
The DFC is behind an attempt to educate college - goers about their rights under the law .
Senator Reid 's amendment has undergone several revisions and may be revised again before it is voted on .
A major IT officer with a Boston - area university told me that there are concerns that Reid wishes to expand the requirements so that more schools would be required to adopt technology aimed at stifling file - sharing , but that there is no clear method for doing this without making it mandatory for everyone .
One option would be to set a threshold of infringement notices per year .
The amendment could be introduced as early as tomorrow , and it is certainly expected to be up for a vote before the close of the week .
If this sounds like bad news to you , you should contact your Senators .
Remind them that anti-file - sharing technology is not proven to work and is in fact it known to interfere with plenty of legitimate uses , as we have reported earlier .
P2P arms race , here we come !
Update : Senator Reid 's office confirms that the Senator has dropped the amendment without explanation .
It 's dead , for now !
Because blogging 's healthier than talking to yourself .
At least that 's what the voices tell me ...
One web page for every book ever published .
It 's a lofty but achievable goal .
To build Open Library , we need hundreds of millions of book records , a wiki interface , and lots of people who are willing to contribute their time and effort to building the site .
To date , we have gathered over 20 million records from a variety of large catalogs as well as single contributions , with more on the way .
Open Library is an open project : the software is open , the data are open , the documentation is open , and we welcome your contribution .
Whether you fix a typo , add a book , or write a widget - - it 's all welcome .
We have a small team of fantastic programmers who have accomplished a lot , but we can't do it alone !
Open Library is a project of the non-profit Internet Archive , and has been funded in part by a grant from the California State Library and the Kahle / Austin Foundation .
IMPORTANT NOTE !!!
INTRODUCTION :
GRADING :
For each question below for which you can answer " yes " or " true " , take one point .
At the end of the test , divide the total number of points you scored by the total number of questions in the test .
Treat this number as a percentage that represents your nerdity quotient .
Some of the questions will have parentheticals at the end of them .
What is contained within the parentheticals is a short list of examples relating to the given question .
The list is not to be taken as all inclusive but merely as suggestions that might apply .
All technicalities count - after all , being technical is half of what being a nerd is all about .
RECOMMENDATIONS and HINTS :
Experiment shows that nerdity CAN be cured !
With effort and personal sacrifice ...
The nerdity quotient is a cross between proclivity toward as well as actual current status in nerddom .
Some questions are " have you ever ... " while others are " do you now ... " .
The former register the fact that you have a propensity toward nerdity , while the later acknowledge the fact that you are currently geeking .
Obviously , as your answers toward the " do you now " type questions change , so will your nerd quotient .
Please use only a number two pencil .
Mark all answers in your blue book .
Shake well before using .
Lather .
Rinse .
Repeat as desired .
Show all work .
Refrigerate after opening .
No partial credit will be given .
A table of useful formulas is included at the end .

Just to illustrate what i meant the other day when i exhorted you to pick a powerful enough editor , and , most importantly , learn how to use it , i think this Emacs Screencast is quite adequate .
It ’s made by a Ruby coder , but note that Emacs plays these kind of tricks ( and many more ) for virtually any language out there .
The point is , if your environment is not powerful enough to make this kind of things , you should be looking for something better .
The keyword here is extensibility .
If your environment is not able to automate a task , you should be able to extend it ; and the best way i can imagine is having a full featured lisp at my disposal when i need to write an extension ( here is the list of Emacs extensions used in the screencast , by the way ) .
Phil Windley has also made a similar point recently , in his When you pick your tools , pick those that can build tools mini-article .
And of course , when your editor and your dynamic language conspire to provide an integrated environment , you ’ve reached nirvana : that ’s the case of Common Lisp and Slime , as shown in other widely known videos .
As said , the message is not that you should use Emacs , but that you should use the right tool .
For instance , PLT Scheme users have other alternatives , like DrScheme , which can also be easily extended , as beautifully demonstrated by DivaScheme , an alternative set of key - bindings for DrScheme that you can see in action below :
You see , as programmers , we ’re lucky : we can build our tools and make they work exactly the way we want .
If your environment precludes your doing so in any way , something ’s wrong with it , no matter how much eye - candy it uses to hide its deficiencies .
( Yes , i have some examples in mind ;-) . )
Update : Phil has just posted an interesting follow - up to his tools article .
His closing words nicely summarise what this post of mine is all about :
Note that I ’m not writing all this to convert the dedicated vi users or anyone else .
If you ’ve got something that works for you , then good enough .
But if you ’re searching for a editor that ’s programmable with plenty of headroom , then give emacs a try .
There ’s a steep learning curve , but the view is great from the top ( or even half way up ) !
Exactly !
Next Net 25 Startups to watch
It 's getting crowded on the Web 2.0 frontier , but there are still some startups that truly stand out .
Business 2.0 Magazine identifies the ones most likely to strike gold in 2007 .
1 of 25 www.stumbleupon.com
StumbleUpon now has 2 million registered users drawn by its knack for finding websites that match their interests and those of others with similar tastes as they " stumble " around the Net .
Co-founder Garrett Camp ( shown right ) , who totes around a mid-'80s Nikon F3 ( yes , with actual film ) , came up with the idea as he was working on a master 's in software engineering .
Frustrated as he tried to indulge his hobby online - " There was n't a good way to find the best photo sites , " Camp says - he tapped his own background in clustering technology .
With coding help from Justin LaFrance and Geoff Smith , he created an early version of StumbleUpon .
Having nailed the photo problem , the team quickly saw how the technology could click with all sorts of media .
In the same way that it matches users with like - minded websites , StumbleUpon 's technology also pairs online ads with targeted demographics and interests .
Now StumbleUpon is attempting to do the same for online video and video advertising .
In December the startup launched StumbleVideo , a service that offers the closest thing to channelsurfing that you 'll find on the Web .
Tell us what you think about StumbleUpon 's model :
Is it the next MySpace ?

1 . It 's your body 's largest organ , despite what the readers of Maxim think .
2 . An average adult 's skin spans 21 square feet , weighs nine pounds , and contains more than 11 miles of blood vessels .
3 . The skin releases as much as three gallons of sweat a day in hot weather .
The areas that do n't sweat are the nail bed , the margins of the lips , the tip of the penis , and the eardrums .
4 . Ooh , that smell : Body odor comes from a second kind of sweat — a fatty secretion produced by the apocrine sweat glands , found mostly around the armpits , genitals , and anus .
5 . Yum !
The odor is caused by bacteria on the skin eating and digesting those fatty compounds .
6. Breasts are a modified form of the apocrine sweat gland .
7. Fetuses do n't develop fingerprints until three months ' gestation .
8 . Without a trace : Some people never develop fingerprints at all .
Two rare genetic defects , known as Naegeli syndrome and dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis , can leave carriers without any identifying ridges on their skin .
9. Fingerprints increase friction and help grip objects .
New World monkeys have similar prints on the undersides of their tails , the better to grasp as they swing from branch to branch .
10 . Blowin ' in the wind : Globally , dead skin accounts for about a billion tons of dust in the atmosphere .
Your skin sheds 50,000 cells every minute .
11 . There are at least five types of receptors in the skin that respond to pain and to touch .
12 . One experiment revealed that Meissner corpuscles — touch receptors that are concentrated in the fingertips and palms , lips and tongue , nipples , penis and clitoris — respond to a pressure of just 20 milligrams , the weight of a fly .
13 .
In blind people , the brain 's visual cortex is rewired to respond to stimuli received through touch and hearing , so they literally " see " the world by touch and sound .
14 . " In the buff " became synonymous for " nude " in 17th - century England .
The term derives from soldiers ' leather tunics , or " buffs , " whose light brown color apparently resembled an Anglo - Saxon backside .
15 .
White skin appeared just 20,000 to 50,000 years ago , as dark - skinned humans migrated to colder climes and lost much of their melanin pigment .
16 . I see very , very white people : Albinos are often cast as movie villains , as seen in The Da Vinci Code , Die Another Day , The Matrix Reloaded , and — inexplicably — the 2001 flick Josie and the Pussycats .
Robert Lima of Penn State suggests that people associate pale - skinned albinos with vampires and other mythical creatures of the night .
17 .
More than 2,000 people have radio frequency identification chips , or RFID tags , inserted under their skin .
The tags can provide access to medical information , log on to computers , or unlock car doors .
18 . Flesh for fantasy :
At the Baja Beach club in Barcelona , customers can get an implanted RFID " debit card " and party until their funds are exhausted .
19 . The Cleveland Public Library , Harvard Law School , and Brown University all have books clad in skin stripped from executed criminals or from the poor .
20 .
Hopefully , they did n't have to reprint it :
One such volume is Andreas Vesalius 's pioneering 16th - century work of anatomy , De Humani Corporis Fabrica ( On the Fabric of the Human Body ) .
JULY 25 -- In a verdict that could chill lonely inmates everywhere , a jury today convicted a Florida inmate for masturbating in the privacy of his Ft. Lauderdale cell .
After deliberating for only 45 minutes , a Broward County panel found Terry Lee Alexander , 20 , guilty of indecent exposure for an episode last November .
According to investigators , a female guard -- who was monitoring Alexander 's cell from a jail control room -- spotted Alexander pleasuring himself while seated on his bunk .
At the time , he was jailed on auto theft and gun raps ( Alexander subsequently pleaded guilty to the felony raps and was sentenced to ten years in prison ) .
Alexander , pictured in the below mug shot , was sentenced to 60 days in custody for today 's indecent exposure conviction , though the time will be served concurrently with his lengthier sentence .
No , you 'll get no jokes from us about the penal system , doing ' hard time , ' Alexander behaving like a jerk , or how his lawyer failed to get him off .

The periodic table of elements , all 111 of them , just got a little competition .
A new discovery by a University of Missouri - Columbia research team , published in Angewandte Chemie allows scientists to manipulate a molecule discovered 50 years ago in such as way as to give the molecule metal - like properties , creating a new , " pseudo " element .
The pseudo - metal properties can be adjusted for a wide range of uses and might change the way scientists think about attacking disease or even building electronics .
Five decades ago , Fred Hawthorne , professor of radiology and director of the International Institute for Nano and Molecular Medicine at MU , discovered an extremely stable molecule consisting of 12 boron atoms and 12 hydrogen atoms .
Known as " boron cages , " these molecules were difficult to change or manipulate , and sat dormant in Hawthorne 's laboratory for many years .
Recently , Hawthorne 's scientific team found a way to modify these cages , resulting in a large , new family of nano - sized compounds .
In their study , which was published this month , Hawthorne , and Mark Lee , assistant professor at the institute and first author of the study , found that attaching different compounds to the cages gave them the properties of many different metals .
" Since the range of properties for these pseudo - metals is quite large , they might be referred to as ' psuedo - elements belonging to a completely new pseudo - periodic table , ' " Lee said .
Potential applications of this discovery are abundant , especially in medicine .
" All living organisms are essentially a grand concert of chemical reactions involving the transfer of electrons between molecules and metals , ' " Lee said .
" The electron transfer properties of this new family of molecules span the entire range of those found within living systems .
Because of this , these pseudo - metals may be tuned for use as specific probes in living systems to detect or treat disease at the earliest state . "
In addition , because the compounds possess such a wide range of flexibility , they might have ramifications for nanotechnology and various kinds of electronics .
" This single discovery could open entirely new fields of study because of the controlled variability of the compounds , " Lee said .
" We have the ability to change the properties of these pseudo - metals , which gives us the opportunity to tailor them to our needs , whether that is biomedical , chemical or electronic applications , some of which may utilize nanoscience . "

Your developers have just planned a two week iteration .
The next day Sarah continues her work on the completion of an important New Project .
And here it comes – Urgent Stuff :
> From : Project Manager
> Sent : 2nd Day Of Iteration
> To : Sarah , the Developer
> Cc : Yo , Dev Manager
> Prio : HIGH
> Subject : Coarechon needs Ezhibal
>
> I need you guys to find out if we can add “ ezhibal ” functionality to our old “ Tounaf ” project , and how much time this fix is going to take .
We have a hot deal with an important customer who is almost ready to buy .
> Sarah please investigate ASAP .
We can arrange a phone call to clarify requirements .
Soon there is a dialog that might go like this :
Project Manager : “ Sarah , how long do you think it takes to check if it is feasible to add this ‘ ezhibal ’ feature ? ”
Programmer : “ Well , I do n’t remember the old project details , but I can spend 2 hours to see if I can come up with something . ”
Development manager : “ Sarah has her iteration planned .
Why do n’t we stick to the plan ? ”
Project Manager : “ What ’s the problem ?
It just takes 2 hours !
What harm can it do ? ”
“ It just takes 2 hours .
It ca n’t hurt ! ”
It can .
We development managers learned it the hard way .
We know how programmers think .
We know how expensive switching their context is .
If Sarah spends just two hours thinking of her old project , she loses a day of productive work on the new one .
One day is 10 % of a carefully planned iteration wasted if she spends 2 hours sidetracked .
In the wild nature of software development shops , however , it never takes 2 hours .
2 hours is the time Sarah is on the phone trying to clarify the problem .
2 hours is the time she is waiting for this phone call , reluctant to get into anything serious .
2 hours is the time Sarah is tweaking her development environment to build her old project .
2 hours is the time Sarah is spending to see if she can come up with a very restricted workaround .
2 hours is the time Sarah is on another phone call , explaining the potential workaround .
Not enough time for real solution , no time spent on actually resolving the problem .
10 hours of unplanned and unproductive time is spread out over 3 days .
30 % of iteration wasted .
At this point the planning goes down the toilet .
The iteration is dead .
The new project is slipping late .
The rush around the old project yields little results either : with no time for a real solution the best bet there is a quick and dirty fix .
But the harm goes further .
Sarah was eager to spend time on programming – she wasted it .
She is robbed of her professional satisfaction , the good feeling of achieving the iteration goal and releasing project on time .
On the next iteration planning session Sarah ca n’t help thinking “ Why kill time if we do n’t stick to the plan anyways ? ”
The team gets the message : “ We are NOT seriously doing iterative development .
We are going ad - hoc ” .
Here is what I do :
* Tell the developer to stick to the original plan .
Offer to protect her from switching her mind context .
Remind her how cool it is to work single - mindedly on an important and interesting project .
Ensure her that I ’ll handle the pressure .
This is the good part ; it is always well received 🙂
* Tell the project manager that the iteration is carefully planned with a goal to release the new project by expected date .
The plan leaves no space for switching the context daily .
Our options are :
1 ) Put the issue to the back log and plan it for the next iteration .
2 ) Cancel the iteration , suspend the “ new project ” , replan and work on the issue .
Let them make their call .
This is the tough part ; it is never well received .
But I have to take a stand .
I do n’t have the luxury not to do this .
The iterative development is an act of fine balance between adopting the continuous change and securing some stability for the developers to perform .
We as development managers are responsible for keeping this fine balance .
We do it for our team .
We do it for our project .
And we do it for our fellow project managers .
Cause we know something they do n’t always know : “ How two hours can waste two weeks ”

It ’s great to have all the visitors here from Reddit and Joel on Software – thanks !.
Joel brings up a great question about the other side of this : what about the sales guy who wants the new feature ?
Janet Folger , formerly the National Director of the Center for Reclaiming America and current President of Faith 2 Action , announces that she will not be voting for Tommy Thompson , primarily because he reportedly supports the use of implantable Radio Frequency Identification chips .
And that smacks too much of the Book of Revelations for Folger ’s liking :
He wants us all to be “ chipped ” with Radio Frequency Identification and sits on the board of the VeriChip Corp. , a company currently talking to the Pentagon about inserting the grain - sized microchip into American citizens , beginning with our soldiers .
High - tech stuff like that you can find in the book of … Revelation – written 2,000 years ago .
Here ’s what I remember from Sunday School :
In the end times , there ’s a one - world government and a good - looking charismatic leader who seems like a really great guy , except for the fact that he happens to be the Antichrist .
He talks all about peace and requires that everyone take this mark in order to buy and sell .
The upside of taking the mark : you get to buy and sell ; the downside : you go to hell forever .
Folger , author of The Criminalization of Christianity , has a flair for dramatic rhetoric .
As a featured speaker at the 2006 “ War on Christians ” conference , she stated that Christians have the right to remain silent in the face of persecution and hostility but “ if you use your right to remain silent , those are the last words you ’ll hear before seeing the inside of a prison cell . ”
But even for an expert in hyperbole , Folger ’s insinuation that Thompson may be the anti-Christ , or at least on of his henchmen , is pretty remarkable .
As I wrote about in my book , “ The Criminalization of Christianity , ” a wave of an implanted hand buys you drinks in Barcelona , Spain .
Now it ’s being used to buy groceries and clothes .
But the mark in Revelation is “ required , ” just like in Mexico where many government workers are required to be chipped – all brought to you by Tommy Thompson ’s VeriChip Corp .
And now it ’s in Ohio where workers in Cincinnati are being chipped by CityWatchers – a government video surveillance contractor .
Big Brother full scale .
Now , I ’m not saying that people who get “ chipped ” at this stage are taking the Mark of the Beast – that would take a software change .
But , I can tell you that I ’m not going to let anyone put anything in my hand ( or forehead ) , period .
No matter how “ logical , ” “ reasonable ” or “ practical , ” if it ’s inserted into the hand ( or forehead ) to identify , buy or sell , you can say whatever you ’d like , but I ’m out .
I do n’t care if it means I ca n’t buy anymore .
I do n’t care if it means I ca n’t fly anymore .
I do n’t care if it means I die .
You can make your case , but I already made that decision – when I was about 10 – before any of this technology even existed .
Not surprisingly , Folger is one Religious Right activist who wo n’t be turning to Thompson as an alternative to the GOP frontrunners .
Ron Paul teams up with Dem candidate to end war David Edwards and Adam Doster

Ron Paul , a Republican Presidential candidate who is opposed to the war in Iraq , believes that lawmakers can reach across the aisle to pass legislation that will bring American troops home as soon as possible .
" Sometimes , those [ liberal and conservative ] labels are misleading , " he told Joe Scarborough on MSNBC Tuesday .
" I think if you approach this from a constitutional viewpoint , we can join hands with the left as well as the right and come up with a solution and get our troops home . "
As the host mentioned , the Texas Congressman has co-sponsored a bill with another presidential contender , Democrat Dennis Kucinich , that would repeal President Bush 's authority to use force in Iraq within the next sixth months .
Besides Kucinich , 18 other Democrats have signed on .
Paul has garnered a lot of interest on the Internet .
As a result , he now has more cash on hand than the campaign of the once favored John McCain , Senator from Arizona .
" I know the daily fundraising over the Internet has remained strong , " he said .
" You know , for us , if we can . . . raise $ 50,000 , that 's a lot of money and since we spend it very conservatively , it 's been very helpful to us . "
A strict follower of the constitution , Paul also bemoaned how Republicans have neglected their commitment to fiscal conservatism .
" We 're a big government party of big government conservatives and this war is a disaster , " he said .
" It 's part of the big government . . .
We 're fiscally irresponsible .
The Republican Party has lost its way .
If it expects to do any good at all next year , it has to be a party of limited government . "

Story Highlights • CDC : Airline passengers may have been exposed to drug- resistant TB
• Two flights involved : Air France 385 on May 12 ; Czech Air 0104 on May 24
• Exams urged for passengers in same row , two rows ahead or behind
Adjust font size :
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Federal health authorities said Tuesday that they are looking for people who may have been exposed to a rare and potentially fatal form of tuberculosis from an infected passenger during two trans -Atlantic flights this month .
The man , infected with the extensively drug - resistant form of TB known as XDR TB , departed Atlanta , Georgia , on May 12 aboard Air France Flight 385 and arrived in Paris , France , the next day , said Dr. Julie Gerberding , director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The man , who has not been identified publicly , returned last Thursday to North America aboard Czech Air Flight 0104 from Prague , Czech Republic , to Montreal , Canada , then drove into the United States .
" During these two long flights , the patient may have been a source of infection to the passengers , " Gerberding told reporters .
Those most at risk would have been seated within two rows of the man , she said , adding that she was not sure what seats he occupied .
Still , she said , CDC is recommending that all passengers be notified .
" I do n't think we would compel people to be tested , but we would strongly recommend " that anyone seated near the man undergo a baseline test now and a follow - up test several weeks from now , she said .
Final diagnosis for XDR TB can take six to 16 weeks .
XDR TB was recently defined as a subtype of multiple - drug resistant tuberculosis .
It often proves fatal .
The man 's tuberculosis had been diagnosed before his departure , but he disregarded his doctors ' recommendation that he not travel , she said .
" The patient had compelling reasons for traveling and made the decision to go ahead and meet those personal responsibilities , " she said , adding that federal authorities did not know until he had left the country that he had the rare form of the disease .
The man himself may not have known either , she said .
About his reasons for traveling , she said , " They were compelling , from his perspective , and we understand and certainly respect that . "
Once he returned , the man was ordered into isolation , " and is required to stay in isolation until the responsible public health officials deem that he is no longer infectious to others , " she said .
Treated in Atlanta
He is being treated at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta , Georgia , a spokeswoman for the hospital said .
He is a resident of Fulton County , Georgia , Gerberding said .
Because the man 's sputum does not test positive under the microscope for the bacillus , the chance that he would infect others is considered low , Gerberding said .
" But we know it is n't zero , " she said , adding that 17 percent of TB cases are transmitted by such carriers .
A spokesman for the Public Health Agency of Canada said the CDC contacted the man while he was on vacation with his family in Europe and told him not to return on a commercial flight .
Though the man ignored that caution , spokesman Dr. Howard Njoo noted that planes are equipped with air filters that are designed to trap the long , rod-shaped tuberculosis bacilli .
The man returned via Canada and entered the United States by driving through the border crossing at Champlain , New York , Njoo said .
Customs and Border Protection spokesman Kevin Corsaro said the man did not appear sick to border agents .
CBP said it has not changed its screening or security precautions as a result of the case .
Once he returned to the United States , the man was contacted by health officials , who required that he go to an isolation hospital in New York City for evaluation , said Dr. Martin Cetron , the CDC 's chief of quarantine .
" He drove himself there , voluntarily . "
The man was admitted and served a provisional quarantine order that lasted 72 hours while he was being assessed , Cetron said .
Asked whether he preferred to stay in New York or return to his family in Atlanta for treatment , the man chose the latter option , said Cetron .
CDC officials then arranged for the patient to be flown Monday aboard a CDC plane , an unusual use of agency resources , Gerberding acknowledged .
She said the move was " one that we felt was fair and appropriate , given that he is a citizen of Georgia , his family members are here and his disease does require prolonged treatment . "
Upon his arrival in Atlanta , he was issued a federal isolation order to cover the time while the case was handed over to the jurisdiction of state and local officials in Fulton County , Cetron said .
" That process of the handoff is ongoing right now . "
XDR TB rare in the U.S .
The patient , who has few symptoms , has X - ray evidence of pulmonary TB and tests positive for XDR TB , the agency said .
Between 1993 and 2006 , XDR TB was diagnosed in 49 people in the United States , said Dr. Ken Castro , director of the division of TB Elimination at CDC .
But the disease is more common elsewhere , he said .
" When they looked , they found it in every single continent of the world , " he said .
One in three people in the world is infected with dormant TB bacteria , according to the World Health Organization .
Age , immune suppression and other medical conditions can activate the bacteria , which can usually be treated with a course of four standard , or first - line , anti-TB drugs .
WHO estimates that there were almost half a million cases of multiple - drug - resistant tuberculosis worldwide in 2004 .
People with TB of the lungs , the site most commonly affected , can spread the disease by coughing , sneezing or even talking .
" A person needs only to breathe in a small number of these germs to become infected ( although only a small proportion of people will become infected with TB disease ) , " the WHO said on its Web site .
" The risk of becoming infected increases the longer the time that a previously uninfected person spends in the same room as the infectious case , " it added .
People with XDR TB are resistant to first - and second - line drugs ; their treatment options are limited .
Crowded , poorly ventilated , closed environments are most conducive to the spread of infection , it said .
Cure is possible for up to 30 percent of cases , it added .
People with HIV infection and other diseases that suppress the immune system are most at risk of catching TB and becoming sick .
No one at the disease agency recalls the agency issuing a quarantine order since 1963 , when a possible case of exposure to smallpox emerged , she said .
" From our perspective , no laws were broken here , " Gerberding said .
" Our system works very well . "

Guardian UK :
The House , eager to do something about record high gasoline prices in advance of the Memorial Day weekend , voted narrowly Wednesday to approve stiff penalties for those found guilty of gasoline price gouging .
The bill directs the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department to go after oil companies , traders or retail operators if they take ``unfair advantage ' ' or charge ``unconscionably excessive '' prices for gasoline and other fuels .
The White House called the measure a form of price controls that could result in fuel shortages .
It said President Bush would be urged to veto the legislation should it pass Congress .
After five months Lewis Goodfellow is at home with his parents
Lewis Goodfellow was born at 24 weeks weighing just 1lb 8 oz .
One of his lungs had failed and not enough oxygen was able to get into his bloodstream .
Doctors at Newcastle 's Royal Victoria Infirmary then tried Sildenafil , also known under the trade name of Viagra , and Lewis is now home with his parents .
The drug opened up tiny blood vessels in the baby 's lungs .
Parents Jade Goodfellow and John Barclay , from Walker , Newcastle believe the drug - more usually associated with anti-impotence - saved his life .
At one point they were so concerned he would not survive that they began planning a funeral .
What Sildenafil does is open up the blood vessels so they can capture the oxygen and take it around the body
Alan Fenton
Viagra : A history
Ms Goodfellow said : " Doctors said he could n't be given any more oxygen .
" They were just clutching at straws basically .
They explained it was experimental and may not have any effect at all . "
Alan Fenton , consultant neonatologist at the hospital , said : " The problem we see in premature babies with breathing difficulties is although we can blow oxygen into their lungs to help them , there is n't enough blood supply to various areas of the lungs to take the oxygen around the rest of the body .
" What Sildenafil does is open up the blood vessels so they can capture the oxygen and take it around the body . "
Lewis was born in August 2006 and was finally allowed home in January , to the delight of his parents .
His mother said : " I do n't think you could put into words how we feel .
" The doctors are worth their weight in gold .
We admire each and every one of them for what they have done . "
Lessons In Curtailing Media Freedom
There are a number of ways to curtail press freedom .
You can charge a journalist with murder and put him on death row - Mumia Abu - Jamal , for instance .
You can grant special favors , privileges , and access to corporate media giants while raiding and shutting down low - power , independent radio stations , which the FCC does with some regularity .
You could arrest independent journalists at anti-war demonstrations - again , a regular occurrence .
For instance , I recall my friend and Indy journalist , Jeff Imig , who has been repeatedly threatened with arrest , while recording anti-war demonstrations in Tucson , Arizona , for violating the statute against filming federal buildings .
Jeff finally got arrested - for jaywalking !
Corporate press , on the other hand , seems to have free reign to jaywalk and film federal buildings at these same events - behavior I and countless others have witnessed !
And then there is the Mother of All Media Manipulations : the blackout engineered by the Bush administration which blocks media from showing the arrival of body bags and coffins of newly dead soldiers " coming home " from Iraq .
Those are some pretty good ways of curtailing freedom of speech .
And they 're each and everyone home grown right here in the good ol ' United States of America .
So what 's the deal with Venezuela , anyway ?
So , pardon me if I 'm just a little astounded by all this noise in the media , the Bush administration , the Senate and the House , about how Venezuela is " attacking " free speech and independent media by not renewing the broadcasting license of RCTV .
Perhaps even more disturbing is that this ridiculous assertion is being repeated even among some persons on the Left .
Just last week the Senate passed a condemnation of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ' refusal to renew the license .
Senate Resolution 211 was sponsored by Richard Lugar , ( R - IN ) and Christopher Dodd ( D - CT ) , with vocal , and disappointing , support from presidential contenders Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) and Barak Obama ( D - IL ) .
Rep. Jerry Weller ( R - IL ) has introduced similar legislation into the House .
Puerto Rico's delegate to the House , Republican Luis Fortuno has outspokenly supported this legislation , which is surprising , considering his complete lack of action or outcry when the FBI was harassing Puerto Rican journalists in 2006 .
Anyway , who says bipartisanship is dead ?
Joining in these condemnations are a whole host of so - called " press freedom " advocates , lead by the National Endowment for Democracy funded Reporters Without Borders .
One would think that the iron hand has fallen and the crackdown has begun in Venezuela .
The facts , please ?
Corporate media seems to regularly forget that along with freedom of press is the responsibility of presenting facts to back up their news reporting .
Well , dear reader , you are in for a rare treat - a discussion of some actual facts .
The general situation is this :
In April of 2002 , there was a two - day , illegal coup carried out against Venezuela 's electoral government , which involved the kidnapping and jailing of President Hugo Chavez .
There were four major media outlets , along with others , who actively aided and abetted this coup ( more later ) .
In the intervening five years , none of them were closed , nor were any of their journalists incarcerated .
Rather , the Chavez administration met with them , not to change their editorial slant , but to reach agreements preventing a repeat of such anti-democratic measure and the hyperbolic misrepresentation of facts , and also to discourage such continued infractions as the airing of pornography and cigarette commercials .
Another important fact is that the heads of the media - monopoly in Venezuela , including Marcel Granier - owner of RCTV , also participated in the economic sabotage that occurred between 2002 - 2003 .
Yet , no one went to prison for endangering the country 's social and economic stability .
What is truly amazing is that it has taken five years for the Chavez administration to take action in any way against media that helped carry out this coup .
Certainly , if the same thing happened in the United States , it would n't be tolerated .
Just ask Aaron Burr or Timothy McVeigh what happens when folks plot against the existing , elected government .
The fact is .
you do n't get away with it , you get punished , and pretty severely .
Getting their broadcasting licenses renewed would be the least of their problems .
When RCTV 's broadcasting license came up for review , Pres .
Chavez decided , after exhaustive research and study , not to renew the license .
Chavez is legally responsible for renewing such licenses under laws which were enacted before he became president .
The reasons given for not renewing the license cite RCTV 's participation in the coup , plus the fact that RCTV leads Venezuelan media in infractions of communications laws .
RCTV 's problems pre-date the Chavez administration , having been censured and closed repeatedly in previous presidential administrations .
RCTV leads Venezuela in its violation of communications codes , with 652 infractions .
Another interesting fact is that our corporate media and distinguished Members of Congress have neglected to mention that on April of 2007 the government of Peru did not renew the broadcasting licenses of two TV stations and three radio stations for breaking their Radio and Television laws .
It is obvious that Venezuela continues to be a target .
What , then , are the facts behind the charges made by the Chavez administration ?
On the morning of April 11th , 2002 , the first day of the coup , the anti-Bolivarian opposition had started a march from the headquarters of the state owned oil company .
Across town , supporters of the Bolivarian Revolution were gathered outside the presidential palace .
Breaking with its previously announced plan , the opposition changed directions and headed to the presidential palace , greatly increasing the chances of a violent confrontation between the two opposing sides .
During the midst of this confusion , shots rang out from the rooftops , where snipers were firing on both crowds , resulting in the deaths of 18 persons , with 150 wounded .
Reports on the opposition 's four largest TV stations indicated the violence was the result of pro-Bolivarian gunmen , and this became the immediate catalyst " justifying " the coup .
However , the testimony of eyewitnesses and videos taken from other angles show that a much different scenario was actually taking place .
The following transcript is excerpted from the video documentary , The Revolution Will Not Be Televised , which was produced for television in Ireland .
It sheds important light on the sequence of events .
Note particularly the quotation included from RCTV News Correspondent , Andre Cesara .
NARRATOR : The opposition march was fast approaching and some in the vanguard seemed ready for a fight .
With thousands of Chavez supporters still surrounding the palace a confrontation seemed imminent .
Then at about 2:00 p.m. , we saw the opposition march arrive .
The army tried to act as a buffer between the two groups .
[ shouting ]
NARRATOR : We moved back into the heart of the Chavez crowds when all of a sudden the firing started .
[ sirens ]
NARRATOR : We could n't tell where the shots were coming from , but people were being hit in the head .
[ gunshots ]
NARRATOR : Soon it became clear that we were being shot at by snipers .
One in four Venezuelans carry hand guns and soon some of the Chavez supporters began to shoot back in the direction the sniper fire seemed to be coming from .
WITNESS ( in Spanish ) :
One of the channels had a camera opposite the palace that captured images of people shooting from the bridge .
It looks like they are shooting at the opposition march below , but you can see them , they themselves are ducking .
They are clearly being shot at , but the shots of them ducking were never shown .
The Chavez supporters were blamed .
The images were manipulated and shown over and over again to say that Chavez supporters had assassinated innocent marchers .
ANDRE CESARA , RCTV journalist ( in Spanish ) : Look at that Chavez supporter .
Look at him empty his gun .
That Chavez supporter has just fired on the unarmed peaceful protesters below .
NARRATOR : What the TV stations did n't broadcast was this camera angle which clearly shows the streets below were empty .
The opposition march had never taken that route .
With this manipulation , the deaths could now be blamed on Chavez .
There is no doubt , and no dispute , that RCTV and the three other largest corporate television stations ( Globovision , Venevision , and Televen ) aided and abetted the ensuing coup throughout the three day period it was being carried out .
They knowingly broadcast false and manipulated information , including the lies that Bolivarian supporters instigated violence against demonstrators , and that Pres. Chavez , as a result , had willingly resigned and left the country .
Pres. Chavez had not resigned .
He had been kidnapped and was being held prisoner by traitors within the Venezuelan military .
During all this , RCTV hosted coup plotters , including co-leader Carlos Ortega of the corrupt and US government supported labor union , the CTV , and had broadcast Ortega 's appeal rallying demonstrators to march on the presidential palace .
RCTV and its partners undertook a complete blackout on reporting any news relating to the more than a million citizens who had taken to the street and surrounded the presidential palace in defense of the democratically elected government of Venezuela .
Rather than broadcasting this news , RCTV treated its viewers to reruns of Tom and Jerry cartoons and the movie Pretty Woman .
Vice - Admiral Ramirez Perez spoke for all his fellow coup plotters when told a Venevision reporter , " We had a deadly weapon : the media .
And now that I have the opportunity , let me congratulate you . "
His congratulations were premature , however , as multitudes of people in the street , with the aid of truly independent , community based media and patriots within the Venezuelan military were able to defeat this coup without firing a shot , returning Pres .
Chavez to his rightful office on April 13 , 2002 .
On the Job at RCTV - Eyewitness , Andres Izarra Speaks
If any doubts remain as to RCTV 's complicity in this coup , the voice of one of its own producers should lay them all to rest .
Andres Izarra had worked as the assignment editor in charge of Latin America for CNN before being hired by RCTV as news production manager for Venezuela 's highest ranked newscast , El Observador .
Izarra says , quite clearly , " We were told no pro-Chavez material was to be screened " .
Later , RCTV officials would maintain that they could not film pro-Bolivarian demonstrations for security reasons .
Even if that were true , Izarra notes , footage of these demonstrations was available from sources such as CNN .
RCTV also continued broadcasting reports that President Chavez had willfully resigned and left the country , even though Izarra notes that they were receiving news to the contrary , and that Mexico , Argentina , and France had all issued statements condemning the coup and refusing to recognize the new government .
Conversely , the United States welcomed this illegal government .
Izarra says the last straw came for him when , " We had a reporter in Miraflores and knew that it had been retaken by the Chavistas . [ but ] the information blackout stood .
That 's when it was enough for me , and I decided to leave " .
Asked what he thought the response should be to this level of disinformation , Izarra replied , " I think their licenses should be revoked " .
Having had enough of corporate media 's complicity in blocking news reportage , Izarra now serves as head of Telesur , the joint news channel broadcast by the nations of Venezuela , Argentina , Bolivia , and Cuba .
As Patrick McElwee , of Just Foreign Policy , points out : " It is frankly amazing that this company has been allowed to broadcast for 5 years after the coup , and that the Chavez government waited until its license expired to end its use of the public airwaves . "
Despite their participation in the coup , the Chavez administration entered into repeated negotiations with RCTV and its partners , Venevision , Globovision , and Television to make sure that such crass manipulation of the news would not occur again , and about other infractions .
RCTV refused to reach any agreements .
Despite the nonrenewal of its broadcasting license , cable and satellite broadcasts will still be available to RCTV ; moreover they will continue to broadcast through their two radio stations in Venezuela .
The new broadcasting license is being given to a public station , TVes - Venezuela Social Television , which will run shows produced mainly by independent parties .
The station will be controlled not by the government , but by a foundation of community members , with one chair reserved for a government representative .
TVes also hopes to reach into some of the most remote areas of the nation , not covered before by RCTV .
The coup government and media freedom - an alternative ?
There is , indeed , an example that shows a real alternative to how Pres .
Chavez and the Bolivarian movement deals with freedom of the media and freedom of speech .
The two - day coup government of Pedro Carmona revealed that alternative .
But , first , let 's quickly review the general state of media freedom in Venezuela under the presidency of Hugo Chavez .
Shortly after Chavez became president , media law was reformed so that it became legal for anyone who could broadcast to do so .
In the United States , many fans of underground and independent radio speak fondly of " pirate " radio - low powered , but illegal stations broadcast from small , " renegade " transmitters .
There are no " pirate " radio stations in Venezuela , because such stations are legal .
Rather , there is a significant Community Media movement - community based and non-profit media production centers run locally by community volunteers .
Corporate and opposition media also have great freedom in Venezuela .
In fact , the radio and television airwaves , and the print media as well , continue to be dominated by corporations which support the opposition .
There is no shortage of negative opinions and portrayals of Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution - in fact , these remain the standard among the for - profit news and entertainment industry .
This concept is strange to those of us in the United States , where official party lines and major news sources are virtually indistinguishable from each other .
But while corporate and community media both retain enormous freedoms in Venezuela , the April 11 - 13th , 2002 coup , and the two day coup government , provide a much different example .
Once interloper Pedro Carmona had declared himself President of Venezuela , among the very first actions taken by the coup government involved the suppression of Venezuela 's non-corporate media .
Police troops answering to Carmona raided and shut down Channel 8 , the government TV station .
They ordered the Catholic Church 's Radio Fe y Alegria to play only music and not report national events , lest they also be shut down .
Carmona 's raiders also hit a number of Community Media centers , closing down , among others , TV Caricua , Catia TV , and Radio Perola .
Fortunately , reporters from Catia TV and Radio Perola were able to escape and recapture their transmitters .
Because of this , they were able to provide mobile broadcasts to the people of Venezuela of the news that RCTV and its partners were blacking out .
Another action taken by the Carmona government was to release the persons who had been arrested in connection with the sniper attacks that instigated the coup .
Instead , coup forces arrested independent journalist Nicolas Rivera and accused him of participating in these attacks .
The only weapon Rivera had had with him during these demonstrations was a tape recorder - obviously considered a threat by coup plotters .
Rivera was freed after the two - day coup was defeated and democratic government was reestablished .
However , the scars of his detention remained , with his face disfigured by the torture he had endured while incarcerated .
Rivera 's wife said that the forces that raided their home planted a sack of bullets on Rivera , beat both of them , and threatened to kill their children .
Yet despite these attacks and threats to this journalist and his family , not one , single international organization in " defense " of press freedoms spoke out on behalf of Rivera .
Perhaps it was in this case that Reporters Without Borders found its border .
Also silent about these attacks on freedom of speech and press were both houses of the US Congress , both parties , the Bush administration .. no , there was no resolution of any kind condemning the attacks by the coup government on these freedoms .
Could that be because coup leaders were funded by Congress , via USAID and the so - called National Endowment for Democracy , and were aided , abetted , and advised by the Bush Administration , the State Department , and the US military ?
Just maybe these factors were an influence .
Again : the Facts
While Representatives and Senators weep bipartisan crocodile tears about supposed threats to media rights in Venezuela ; while US and Venezuelan corporate press crow about the " unfair " targeting of RCTV ; while even some segments of the US Left express " concern " about press freedoms in Venezuela ; an examination of the facts leads one to this clear conclusion : these folks are full of a substance that emanates from the hind end of a male bovine .
Fact : not renewing the broadcasting license of coup plotters , lawbreakers , and liars like RCTV is the kind of thing it takes to defend Venezuela and make it the haven of free speech , free media , and participatory democracy that it is today .

Possible timeline shows Gonzales discussing US Attorneys with staff after launch of internal probe Michael Roston
Published : Friday June 1 , 2007 Print This Email
This
An analysis of public testimony and dates by RAW STORY may reveal that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales continued to discuss the process that resulted in the firing of eight US Attorneys with members of his staff other than Monica Goodling after Justice Department offices began an internal investigation into the matter .
Gonzales had insisted that he did not discuss the firings to avoid biasing the outcome of the investigation .
" At some point , it 's clear that the Attorney General stopped talking to people , " former White House liaison Monica Goodling told the House Judiciary Committee on May 23 .
" But it must have been -- I assume that it 's after the point that I left the department or took leave . "
A Justice Department spokesman , Dean Boyd , confirmed to RAW STORY via e-mail that Goodling began her leave of absence on Monday , March 19 , after a staff meeting .
If Goodling was correct in saying that the Attorney General continued to discuss the process for the firings beyond the beginning of her leave of absence , it would mean that Gonzales falsely stated that he had avoided discussing various matters with his staff to preserve the integrity of the investigation .
It would also imply that Gonzales discussed the process with staff other than Goodling .
RAW STORY was unable to confirm the precise date on which the investigation began .
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department 's Office of the Inspector General would not confirm the calendar date on which the OPR investigation was initiated .
" I have no comment , " said Cynthia Schnedar , Counselor to Inspector General Glenn Fine in a Thursday phone call .
She also was unwilling to comment on why her office could not release the date on which the investigation began .
While the precise date could not be determined , earlier reports showed that the investigation began the week Goodling went on leave , which culminated in her resignation in April .
" Gonzales this week directed the Justice Department 's Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate the circumstances of the firings , officials said , " according to the AP report on Saturday , March 24 .
Note : RAW STORY 's timeline is presented at the end of this article .
After the investigations began , Gonzales frequently failed to answer questions during Congressional testimony , insisting that he was trying to avoid compromising the Justice Department 's internal fact finding .
" I have not gone back and spoken directly with Mr. Sampson and others who are involved in this process in order to protect the integrity of this investigation and the investigation of the Office of Professional Responsibility and the Office of Inspector General , " the Attorney General said in one exchange .
" I am a fact witness .
They are fact witnesses .
And in order to preserve the integrity of those investigations , I have not asked these specific questions . "
While it was not possible to determine the precise date the OPR investigation began , it was evident from correspondence between the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Justice Department that the nature of the internal investigation was a source of dispute within members of Gonzales 's staff .
" When the [ Office of the Inspector General ] learned of the request , the OIG discussed with OPR the OIG 's belief that , within the Department , the OIG was the entity who should conduct an investigation .
OPR disagreed because it believed that it had jurisdiction to conduct the investigation , " said a letter sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee by Glenn Fine , the Justice Department 's Inspector General , and H. Marshall Jarrett , the Counsel in the Office of Professional Responsibility .
The letter was sent to RAW STORY by Judiciary Committee staff , and is available at this link .
Ultimately , interim Justice Department Chief of Staff Chuck Rosenberg asked OPR and OIG to carry out the investigation jointly , which the two offices agreed to , according to the letter .
An exchange during the Senate committee 's hearing with the Attorney General made it clear why OIG 's participation in the investigation was so important .
" In choosing OPR as the place that you wish to refer this investigation , did you take into account that OPR does not ordinarily make their findings public and that they are ordinarily limited to the conduct of lawyers in their conduct as lawyers , the things that might subject them to bar disciplinary activity , and there 's really no relation between anybody 's conduct here that 's being questioned and their conduct as lawyers ? "
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse ( D - RI ) asked Gonzales in the April 19 hearing .
Gonzales demurred on the question , noting only that the investigation was now being jointly managed by OIG and OPR .
" Senator , that 's , I guess , a fair question .
And I think that 's the reason why I raised with our acting chief of staff is to have the Office of Inspector General also look at this , " he replied .
While Goodling testified that she was uncomfortable with a conversation the Attorney General initiated with her on the process for firing the Attorneys because she might later be a ' fact witness , ' it was clear from the dates involved that the Justice Department 's internal investigation had not yet started .
" It was the Thursday before the Monday that I took leave .
I can't remember the date .
But it would have been in March , " she told Rep. Adam Schiff ( D - CA ) during her House Judiciary Committee hearing .
The Thursday in question was March 15 , the day before her last full day of work on March 16 .
While Gonzales has maintained that he avoided discussions on the process that led to the firing of the Attorneys since the internal investigation began , another remark from Goodling appeared to suggest that his claimed effort to preserve the integrity of the investigation came too late to be of much use .
" Certainly earlier in this process there were a lot of conversations between a lot of people who were involved in this process , " she said in the hearing .
Considering such problems , Senator Whitehouse said in a press conference last week that he was concerned that an obstruction of justice had occurred .
" It is surprising how often a whiff of obstruction of justice has reared its head in the course of this investigation , " he said when introducing the Senate 's no confidence motion against Gonzales with Senators Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) and Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) .
" There 's been the cloud of that hanging over this entire investigation . "

“ To stimulate creativity , one must develop the childlike inclination for play and the childlike desire for recognition . ”
Albert Einstein
The process of innovation and creation begins with the analysis of current situations .
Once we know where we are , what we want , or what we do n’t want , the next step is the creation and exploration of ideas and alternatives .
Idea creation should be supported and facilitated by all members of the organization .
We must feel free to create .
We should know that the generation of the ideas is of great importance to the organization .
We should feel comfortable and in a supportive environment for this to occur ( children do n’t play unless they feel safe ) .
It should be clear that the next step in the innovation process is the evaluation of the ideas by others in the organization .
Our ideas will eventually be analyzed and criticized to determine their viability or economic impact .
This is a separate and distinct process , and should occur only after the ideas are generated and not during the brainstorming period .
In order to spark discussion and interaction , brainstorming and idea generation here are some simple , low cost methods to get you and your organization moving in the right direction toward the creation of ideas and innovation .
How to promote creative thinking and idea generation
1. Purchase or subscribe to various magazines that have nothing to do with your industry ( not world , national or economic news or analysis ) .
Pass them out and give permission to mark or highlight any articles or ideas of interest .
Give a time limit , 3 or 5 days .
When the magazines come back , send them out to different people .
Examples would include trade magazines from other unrelated industries , magazines dedicated to ; design , art , travel and living , tattoos or wresting , music , movies , technology ( backpacking or camping equipment , boats , bicycles , home office , cameras , computers , etc. ) .
2. Encourage book reading .
Give out gift certificates to the local bookstore once a month .
Start a community bulletin board with recommendations on great books , no matter what the subject .
3 . Ask everyone to identify where or what makes them creative or gives them inspiration .
Where are they when they get their ideas ?
What triggers innovative or creative thinking ?
What time of day and what day of the week ?
4 . Move the furniture .
5 . Bring in toys or puzzles that require manual manipulation .
Toys unlock reasoning and assist in activating parts of the brain required for creativity .
“ Creativity is inventing , experimenting , growing , taking risks , breaking rules , making mistakes , and having fun . ” Mary Lou Cook

' Stark inconsistencies ' emerged in evidence about the death of an Iraqi detainee .
Now the MoD is being pressed for answers
An influential committee of MPs is demanding that the Ministry of Defence urgently explains what , it claims , are ' stark inconsistencies ' over the army 's use of interrogation techniques in Iraq .
The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has written to the MoD asking it to reconcile what appear to be glaring differences between the department 's official line on what is permissible and evidence given at the recent court martial of seven British soldiers .
The court martial into the death of Iraqi hotel worker Baha Mousa , who died after sustaining 93 separate injuries , heard evidence that senior British officers in Iraq sanctioned the ' conditioning ' of prisoners , which included the use of hooding and forcing detainees to stand for hours in stressful positions .
The MoD , however , told the joint committee during its recent inquiry into the UK's compliance with the UN Convention Against Torture that the use of hooding and stress positioning for the purpose of interrogation has been prohibited since 1972 .
The Committee has now written to the Defence Secretary , Des Browne , seeking an explanation .
The move threatens to become a major embarrassment for the MoD , potentially pitting the department against international human rights laws .
' The Government should now accept our recommendation that the provisions of the torture convention should apply to all of our armed forces ' actions , ' Andrew Dismore , the committee 's chairman , said .
' It should ensure that our troops are suitably trained to equip them with the skills and knowledge needed to comply fully with our international obligations . '
Leanne MacMillan , director of policy and external affairs at the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture , welcomed the decision to seek answers from the MoD .
' It is quite clear that assurances given to parliament by the then Prime Minister Edward Heath in March 1972 have not been honoured , ' MacMillan said .
' He stated quite unequivocally in the House of Commons that conditioning techniques such as hooding , stress positions , sleep deprivation , the withholding of food and drink , and bombardment with loud noise would not be used by Britain 's armed forces unless sanctioned in advance by parliament .
It is quite clear , however , both from the court martial , and from what the Medical Foundation has learnt from former army interrogators , that the techniques have continued to be used . '
The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that such techniques are inhuman and degrading .
More recently , the United Nations Committee Against Torture said that they amounted to torture .
Mousa , 26 , was detained in 2003 , with a number of other Iraqis , by members of The Queen 's Lancashire Regiment at a hotel in Basra where weapons and suspected bomb - making equipment were found .
The prosecution said that , while undergoing ' conditioning ' for interrogation , the detainees were forced to stand with their arms outstretched and their knees bent .
The seven soldiers faced a variety of charges ranging from manslaughter , inhuman treatment , perverting the course of justice , causing actual bodily harm and negligently performing a duty .
Six of the accused , including the regiment 's commanding officer , Colonel Jorge Mendonca , were cleared .
Corporal Donald Payne pleaded guilty to ' inhuman treatment of persons protected under the Geneva Convention ' and was jailed for a year .

Family Guy connects Bush , Saddam , Osama and Satan
David Edwards
Published : Wednesday May 23 , 2007 Print This Email This
Last month , Seth MacFarlane 's animated sit-com Family Guy , which airs on the Fox network , poked fun at President Bush by showing his Crawford , Texas ranch house being guarded by his vice president , Dick Cheney , who was shown napping on a rocking chair with a rifle clutched to his chest .
According to The Largest Majority blog , the plot involved Chris Griffin sneaking onto the ranch in an attempt to " steal a pair of his underwear in order to be initiated into the Texas Youth Club . "
" After entering the home , there are pictures of Bush with Reagan , Saddam , Osama , and the Devil , in that order , " Manila Ryce writes .
" Im not sure if they get better or worse from left to right . "
The blog notes that " criticizing the administration is nothing new to Family Guy . "
According to Wikipedia , this is at least the fifth time the show has made Bush the target of its jabs .

The internet has become an inextricable part of contemporary life , both in terms of how we get things done at work and how we get things done in our everyday lives .
The problem is , sometimes our personal use of the internet conflicts with what the bossman has in mind .

As a firm believer that you can do your job well while getting in a little personal time with Sweet Lady Internet , this week I 'm going to highlight a few methods for adding a layer of privacy and freedom to your work browsing .
NOTE : I do n't want to start a debate over what kind of personal browsing you should or should not be able to do at work , so if you 're against the idea that someone might want to have a little browsing privacy at the workplace , then this is n't for you .
Then again , none of these tips are inherently evil by any means - most of them really just increase your privacy ; it 's up to you to decide how you use them .

Install Firefox :
If your company allows you to install your own software , do yourself a favor and install Firefox ; the free , open source web browser is all the rage here at Lifehacker .
Not only is Firefox the basis for most of the following tips , but it 's also one of the safest and extensible browsers available .
Use https :
Whenever possible , you should make sure to take advantage of the additional security and privacy afforded by https connections .
A web site using https scrambles your data , making it harder for someone to listen in on what you 're doing .
For example , yesterday Rick posted about accessing Gmail securely using https rather than the default http ( in fact , a lot of popular webmail clients offer https ) .
Also , most of Google 's web apps ( from Google Calendar to Reader ) offer a secure https connection .

Tech offers this simple tip on keeping hackers at bay when you access Gmail … Read more
You can always remember to type in the extra " s " every time you visit one of these sites , but another nifty solution is the HTTP - to - HTTPS redirector Greasemonkey script , which lets you define a list of URLs you want to make sure always use https .

Regularly clear private data : Firefox has great options for managing your private data , so head to Tools ->
Options and click on the Privacy tab to dig into them .
From here you can tweak how Firefox manages your browsing history , cookies , form and search bar entries , and more .
Of special note , I 'd suggest ticking the checkbox to " Always clear my private data when I close Firefox " so you know that your private data has been cleaned every time you exit Firefox .
Advertisement
To set exactly what is thrown out and what remains , hit the Settings button next to the private data option and check off what data you 'd like to clear .
Naturally , you may be trading a little convenience for your privacy , so it 's up to you to decide what you 're willing to do without .

Disable address bar history :
There are times when having every address you type into your address bar is handy , and then there are those times when it 's not so handy .
Getting rid of this feature at work has obvious advantages .
Here 's how to do it :
Advertisement
On a Windows computer , go to your Start menu and click on Run ... ( or use the Windows - R shortcut ) .
Paste % AppData % \Mozilla \Firefox \Profiles\ into the text input and hit OK .
This will open your Firefox profile folder .
If you 're on a Mac , navigate to ~/ Library / Application Support / Firefox / Profiles .
This folder should contain your default profile folder .
Open that folder .
( Unless you 've created more than one profile , there should just be one choice .
It should follow a format like : xxxxxxxx .
default .
Advertisement
In your profile folder , you should see a file called history .
dat .
This is the file that tracks your address bar history .
If you 're using Windows , right - click the file and select Properties .
Then tick the checkbox next to Read only and hit Enter .
Advertisement
On a Mac , right - click on the history .dat file and click on Get Info .
On the info panel , find the section labeled Ownership & Permissions and set the file to Read only .
Advertisement
Now just restart Firefox and your browser will no longer save any URLs in the address bar .
Install the Stealther Firefox extension :
If you do n't want to totally disable your address bar history , and you feel like clearing your private data every time you restart Firefox is overkill , the Stealther extension is probably your best bet .
When we first posted about Stealther , I joked that Stealther was the ultimate porn - hiding extension ( which is true ! ) .
However , it 's also the perfect extension to use if you want a quick , private browsing session at work without completely disabling features - like history - that you may want to have enabled most of the time .

Secure your saved passwords in Firefox :
If you decide that you can't live without saving passwords at your work computer , you should at least set up a master password that a user will need to enter in order to have access to those saved passwords .
Luckily for us , Gina 's already covered that territory .

Use a proxy or RSS reader to browse personal sites :
If your company restricts your must - visit web sites , there are still ways to get your daily dose of internet .
For starters , you might want to try using a proxy to access restricted sites .
You can read more about proxies here .
Advertisement
If you do n't need to actually browse around a site , but simply want to read the latest it has to offer , you need to get yourself set up with an RSS reader ( our favorite around Lifehacker HQ is Google Reader ) .
If your reader is n't blocked by your company , you can read content from any web site with an RSS feed unrestricted .
Since your reader has already fetched the content for you , everything is being fed to you from a clean domain ( for example , Google ) .
For ultimate browsing privacy , try Torpark :
If you 're really serious about workplace browsing privacy , the free , open source , portable browser Torpark runs off a thumb drive and plugs into a Tor anonymity network to keep your browsing as anonymous as you can get it without an advanced degree .
The downside : The Tor network can be very slow .
However , you can toggle TorPark to drop the Tor connection when you do n't need it .
Either way , TorPark is probably the best free solution for private browsing .

If you 're looking to add a layer of privacy to the browsing you do at work , these tips should get your started - but they 're certainly not the last word on workplace privacy .
If you 've got your own favorite methods for keeping your browsing private at the workplace , let 's hear about them in the comments .

Countries with the fastest broadband use fibre optic networks
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) report says 60 % of its member countries ' net users are on broadband .
The report said countries that had switched to fibre networks had the best speeds at the lowest prices .
In Japan net users have 100 M bps lines , 10 times higher than the OECD average .
Japan 's price for broadband per megabit per second is the lowest in the OECD at $ 0.22 ( 11 p ) , said the report .
The most expensive is Turkey at $ 81.13 ( £ 40.56 ) .
In the US , the cheapest megabit per second broadband connection is $ 3.18 ( £ 1.59 ) while in the UK it is $ 3.62 ( £ 1.81 ) .
CHEAPEST ENTRY LEVEL BROADBAND PER MONTH * Sweden $ 10.79 Denmark $ 11.11 Switzerland $ 12.53 US $ 15.93 France $ 16.36 Netherlands $ 16.85 New Zealand $ 16.86 Italy $ 17.63 Ireland $ 18.18 Finland $ 19.49 * Source : OECD .
Figures for October 2006
Subscribers to Japan 's fibre networks can also upload at the same speed they can download , which is not possible with ADSL ( broadband over a telephone line ) and most cable subscriptions .
Sweden , Korea and Finland also offer 100 M bps net connections , as all four countries have switched to fibre optic networks .
The OECD represents 30 of the leading democratic economies , from Australia to the US , France to Japan .
" Broadband is very quickly becoming the basic medium for sevice delivery on both fixed and wireless networks , " said the report .
JupiterResearch telecoms analyst Ian Fogg said : " It 's very hard to draw comparisons across 30 countries globally because there are different trends happening in each of them .
However , he said the entry price for broadband was an incredibly important criteria to compare .
" Because the market is very fragmented consumers care about cheap prices . "
According to the report , broadband prices for DSL connections across the 30 countries have fallen by 19 % and increased in speed by 29 % in the year to October 2006 .
Cable prices and speeds followed a similar trend .
BT ( in the UK ) has been very slow to switch across ( to ADSL2 + ) .
Ian Fogg , JupiterResearch
The least expensive monthly subscription for always - on broadband was in Sweden , where $ 10.79 ( £ 5.40 ) per month bought a 256 kbps connection .
The country with the most expensive entry point for broadband access was Mexico , where it cost $ 52.36 ( £ 26.18 ) per month for 1 mbps .
Mr Fogg said : " In many of the OECD countries those people without broadband and making the transition are feeling their way and are very conscious of price .
They have n't seen the need to go to broadband historically . "
The entry - level price points do not take into account bundled deals , such as incorporating free broadband with a TV contract , which are becoming increasingly important to the market .
Mr Fogg said many countries had seen a jump in broadband speeds over the last few years as many ISPs utilising existing telephone lines had started to push ADSL2 +.
ADSL2 + is a technology which doubles the frequency band of a typical ADSL connection over a phone line , in effect doubling the amount of data which can be sent downstream to a user .
The theoretical maximum speed of an ADSL2 + line is 24 M bps , still much slower than speeds over fibre optic networks .
" ADSL2 + has n't happened everywhere and it's happened at different times in different countries , " explained Mr Fogg .
" France was the first country in the western world to use the technology , about two or three years ago .
" BT ( in the UK ) has been very slow to switch across .
The only option for UK customers has been to get it from competitors , notably Be , which is owned by O2 , and Sky . "
General Batiste : ' We need a better plan to get out than what we had to get in ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday July 11 , 2007 Print This Email This ABC News reported Wednesday on the tension between " the building pressure on the White House to withdraw US troops from Iraq " and the White House 's instance that to withdraw now would be to invite disaster .
Senior National Correspondent Claire Shipman cited the interim progress report on Iraq which is due out this week , saying " word is there wo n't be much , if any progress detailed at all .
This is a huge problem for an administration under siege . "
" But what would a quick withdrawal actually look like ? " continued Shipman .
" How realistic is a speedy pullout ? "
Lawrence Kolb , who served as Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan administration , told ABC that a pullout would probably take a year or more and that hurrying would increase the risks .
ABC then spoke to Major General ( ret. )
John Batiste , formerly a commander in Iraq and now " an outspoken critic of the Bush administration 's management of the war . "
Batiste agreed that the worst - case scenarios of a bloodbath in Baghdad , a resurgence of al Qaeda , or a regional conflagration are all possible , but insisted that only means " we need a better plan to get out than what we had to get in . "
" Our all - volunteer military cannot sustain the current cycle of deployments , " said Batiste , concluding that withdrawal in some form in unavoidable .
He would like to see the issue addressed in the context of " a comprehensive strategy for the Middle East " that considers the full spectrum of US interests in the region and includes the " diplomatic , economic , and political hard work that is fundamentally important . "
When challenged again with the " nightmare scenario " of a full - blown civil war breaking out as the US leaves Iraq , Batiste acknowledged " it is a tough problem , there 's no question about it . "
However , he saw no alternative to solving that problem and expressed his opinion that the most effective approach would be a diplomatic effort to develop a regional and worldwide coalition of other nations to assure Iraq 's stability as the US pulls out .
The following video is from ABC's Good Morning America , broadcast on July 11 .
Recently unclassified documents suggest that senior officers viewed the killings of 24 Iraqi civilians in Haditha in late 2005 as a potential public relations problem that could fuel insurgent propaganda against the American military , leading investigators to question whether the officers ’ immediate response had been intentionally misleading .
Colonel R. Gary Sokoloski of 2nd Marine Division commander Maj. General Richard A. Huck 's staff released a press release about the killings that investigators later suggested was " intentionally inaccurate " because it asserted , contrary to the facts available , that the insurgents had been killed by an insurgents ' bomb .
Colonel Sokoloski told investigators
“ We knew the , you know , the strategic implications of being permanently present in Haditha and how badly the insurgents wanted us out of there . ”
But Colonel Sokoloski told investigators he believed that the news release was accurate as written .
On what evidence did he base that belief ?
He wanted to get the information that was available to him before the press before the insurgents put out their own information .
Priority one was to win the propaganda war .
Ground truth was n't a factor in the decision process .
Deny the Mess , Blame the Press
Colonel Stephen W. Davis , regimental commander of the Marines in Haditha , said to investigators that " There was nothing out of the ordinary about any of this , including the number of civilian dead , that would have triggered anything in my mind that was out of the norm .
There is nothing about this incident that jumped out at any point to us . "
According to Davis , his big concern was derailing enemy propaganda , which he believed was being abetted by Time Magazine reporter Tim McGirk , who blew the Haditha story open in March 2006 .
“ Frankly , what I am looking at is the advantage he ’s giving the enemy , ” Colonel Davis said of McGirk .
Deny , Deny , Deny
When it came to questions of his own culpability in the Haditha incident , Major General Huck , the division commander , pulled a Sergeant Schultz .
He saw nothing , he heard nothing , he knew nothing .
In a hearing at Camp Lejeune , N.C. months after the Haditha incident , Huck told investigators he did n't recall anyone telling him civilians had been killed at Haditha .
“ I did n’t know at the time whether they were bad guys , noncombatants , or whatever , ” he testified .
He was overseeing several combat operations at the time .
Huck also told investigators that he did n't recall standing orders that required him to alert his superiors and investigate the circumstances of any attack that killed at least three times as many civilians as American forces .
He said that three days after the Haditha incident , he received a slide presentation of the attacks from battalion commander Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey R. Chessani that did not mention civilian deaths .
“ I sat there and took the brief and no bells and whistles went off , ” Huck told investigators .
Two and a half months later , Huck sent his boss , Lieutenant General Peter W. Chiarelli , then commander of ground forces in Iraq , an email on the Haditha incident that stated “ I support our account and do not see a necessity for further investigation …
Allegedly , [ Time reporter ]
McGirk received his info from the mayor of Haditha , who we strongly suspect to be an insurgent . ”
Less than five hours later , Chiarelli forwarded the email to his chief of staff , Brigadier General Donald Campbell , with an attached note that said , “ Don : We need to get together at the first possible moment tomorrow morning .
We ’re going to have to do an investigation . ”
Stuff Rolls Downhill
Four officers have been charged with failing to properly investigate the civilian killings at Haditha .
One of them , Captain Randy Stone , is set to be put under hearings Tuesday Morning ( May 8 ) .
Stone is accused of failing to investigate reports of civilian deaths at Haditha , but in an interview that mirrored frustrations expressed by attorneys for the other accused officers , Stone said that he did n't investigate the deaths because his superiors told him not to .
“ The regimental judge advocate [ Major Carroll Connelly ] informed me that we do n’t do investigations for ‘ troops in contact ’ situations , ” Stone said .
“ That ’s my understanding of what higher [ command ] wanted , ” Stone said , “ and that ’s why there was no investigation . ”
Stone added “ There is a certain level of disappointment that the Marine Corps decided that , in the entire chain of command , that I am the one who should be held accountable . ”
Major Connelly , the regimental JAG officer who told Stone not to do an investigation , was not charged with any crime .
Instead , he was granted immunity to testify at future hearings on the Haditha incident .
General Huck is also scheduled to testify at the officers ' hearings , but he too faces no charges .
The senior officer under investigation is Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey R. Chessani , the battalion commander who supposedly did n't tell General Huck about the civilian deaths at Haditha .
Three enlisted Marines have been charged with the killings at Haditha .
They face courts martial proceedings for commission of capital crimes .
I saw some shameful things up close and personal during my career as a military officer , and have observed many others from a distance since I retired .
But nothing resonates in my memory for complete lack of moral integrity as does this Haditha investigation disgrace .
If General Huck and his bird colonels are allowed to retire in their current pay grades while the O - 5s and below take it on the chin over Haditha , there 's no question .
The entire United States Marine Corps needs to take a one - way march to the front gate , and keep going .

The right way to use a bidet depends on what kind you ’re using , but the process is similar for most bidets you ’ll encounter .
For a toilet seat bidet , locate the controls on the side of the seat .
After you ’ve gone to the bathroom , press the “ wash ” button to clean yourself off .
There may also be a button that allows you to move the position of the bidet ’s nozzle so you can adjust where you ’re spraying yourself .
If you ’re using a non-electric toilet seat bidet , just turn the knob clockwise to release the water .
The more you turn it , the higher the water pressure will be .
Toilet seat bidets may also have controls that let you change the temperature of the water .
For a standalone bidet that ’s not attached to the toilet , sit on the bidet so you ’re either facing at or away from the fixtures , depending on whether you ’re cleaning your front or rear .
Then , turn one of the knobs to release hot or cold water once you ’re positioned over the jet .
Whichever kind of bidet you ’re using , spray yourself for 20 - 60 seconds to make sure you ’re all cleaned off .
Some bidets have a button you can press to dry yourself off when you ’re finished .
If yours does n’t , use toilet paper to dry yourself off before putting your underwear back on .
For more tips , including how to clean up after using a bidet , keep reading !
BOSTON , Massachusetts ( CNN ) --
Nurses understand that they have a tough job , but getting attacked and abused is not what former Boston area emergency room nurse Ellen MacInnis says she signed up for .
This harmonica was turned into a switchblade - like device and used to attack psychiatric emergency room nurse Karen Coughlin .
" It was very frightening , " said the 18 - year veteran .
An angry and frustrated patient had grabbed MacInnis ' hand , dug her nails in and made a chilling threat .
" If you have children , I 'll find them and I 'll kill them . "
This was not the only time MacInnis was assaulted on the job .
Last summer , an intoxicated , H.I.V.- infected female patient tried to hit her and wound up covering her in blood .
MacInnis said the thought that her life was in danger never occurred to her until after the situation was under control .
" Then it sort of hit me , " she said , " And I fell apart . "
Nurses are often on the receiving end of physical assaults , because they are typically the first and most frequent medical personnel by the bedside of ill and sometimes angry or frustrated patients .
Emergency rooms seem to be the hot spots for violent assaults , according to experts interviewed for this article , but general practice nurses are not immune .
Fifty percent of nurses surveyed by the Massachusetts Nurses Association ( MNA ) -- a union of registered nurses -- and the University of Massachusetts said they had been punched at least once in a two - year period .
Some reported being strangled , sexually assaulted or stuck with contaminated needles .
In the past , the biggest problems reported by nurses had to do with back injuries or work related asthma , but that 's changed , said Evelyn Bain , head of the MNA 's Occupational Health and Safety Office .
" Workplace violence has really just been head and shoulders above that , " said Bain .
It 's not just a problem in Massachusetts .
A national survey , conducted last year by the Emergency Nurses Association , a national association for emergency room nurses , found 86 percent of its nurses reported being a victim of workplace violence during the prior three years ; 19 percent said it happened frequently .
Watch how nurses cope with violent patients »
Boston - area psychiatric emergency room nurse Karen Coughlin said she was forced to restrain a disturbed female patient who had fashioned a switchblade - like knife out of a harmonica .
Another time she had to fight off an aggressive , violent male patient .
" He had gone after me , " she said .
" I really thought he was going to kill me . "
This became almost routine , she said .
" I 've been punched , I 've been kicked , I 've been spit at , " she added .
Coughlin had always stood up to the tough challenges of her job , but her family was scared .
" My son asked me , did anybody try to kill you today ? " she said .
Coughlin , who claims she has n't seen this level of violence in her 23 years on the job , started questioning her work environment .
" My kids should n't have to ask me that , you know . "
The MNA claims budget cuts , resulting in a shortage of nurses , are partly to blame for this problem .
The Massachusetts Hospital Association ( MHA ) , an organization representing hospitals and health systems , agrees that violence in the workplace is a problem , but officials there do n't blame staffing levels .
Karen Nelson , senior vice president of clinical affairs at MHA , says assaults on nurses are more a product of a violent society , where mass shootings are no longer rare , than a nursing shortage .
She calls the push to hire more nurses " a knee - jerk reaction . "
Nelson said stepped - up security and safety training for nurses is a more practical solution .
Many nurses are being trained to recognize a potentially violent situation and then find ways to deescalate it .
MacInnis , who had to undergo a debilitating cocktail treatment to prevent contamination from the H.I.V - infected blood , supports a proposed law in Massachusetts that would toughen safety guidelines at hospitals across the state .
" Legislation will be helpful , " she said .
But the MHA said legislation would only duplicate what the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other regulatory agencies already require .
" It 's pretty much redundant with existing rules , regulations , standards , " said Nelson .
As this issue is debated in Massachusetts and in other states , more nurses are standing up to their attackers and reporting assaults , according to Bain of the MNA .
In the past , some nurses and hospitals have tolerated a lot of abuse by patients , she said .
Nurses were sometimes discouraged from taking action and told that unruly and sometimes violent patients were part of the job .
They were guided by a duty to help and heal sick patients , not prosecute them .
Now , the MNA is encouraging nurses to press charges .
" Perpetrators should be held accountable , " said Bain .
Despite the safety concerns , most nurses are relatively satisfied with their jobs .
The ENA says its survey indicates that 64 percent of emergency room nurses are very or somewhat satisfied with their job , and 75 percent expect to be in the nursing profession in 10 years .
MacInnis , who now works in a different unit at the same hospital , says nursing is in her blood .
" It is what we do ; we take care of people . "
E-mail to a friend
New York City ’s chief medical examiner , Dr. Charles S. Hirsch , has for the first time directly linked a death to exposure to dust from the destruction of the World Trade Center .
In a letter made public yesterday , Dr. Hirsch said that he was certain “ beyond a reasonable doubt ” that dust from the twin towers contributed to the death of Felicia Dunn - Jones , 42 , a civil rights lawyer who was engulfed on Sept. 11 as she ran from her office a block away from the trade center .
She later developed a serious cough and had trouble breathing , and she died five months after the terrorist attack .
Dr. Hirsch said he had decided to amend Mrs. Dunn - Jones ’s death certificate to indicate that exposure to trade center dust “ was contributory to her death . ”
The manner of death will be changed from natural causes to homicide .

Presidential records bill seeks to stop ' rewriting of history '

Published : Wednesday March 14 , 2007 Print This Email This
A bill sponsored by the chair of the House Oversight Committee , Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , seeks to stop the " rewriting of history " by restoring full access to presidential records , RAW STORY has learned .
" There are those who would like to rewrite history for their own purposes , " Waxman warned in a floor speech , available at the Speaker of the House 's blog , The Gavel .
Waxman was speaking out in favor of the Presidential Records Act Amendments of 2007 , a bill he co-sponsored to cancel a 2001 executive order by President George W. Bush that " gave current and former presidents and vice presidents broad authority to withhold presidential records or delay their release indefinitely , " according to a fact sheet at Waxman 's website .
" It would allow the records , the raw information to be available , and let those who want to interpret those events do so as they see fit , " Waxman said of the bill .
In a recent hearing conducted by Waxman 's committee , Thomas Blanton of the group National Security Archive slammed President Bush 's executive order as obstructing the availability of documents from previous administrations .
" We had a fair , reasonable , workable , sensible , clear , orderly process producing millions of records before this executive order , and we have n't had it since , " he said .
Waxman 's floor speech and other information can be accessed at the Speaker 's blogsite .

Man slain in home , wife hurt 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
2007-01-10 21:49:28 PST
-- Rex Farrance was a popular senior editor at PC World magazine in San Francisco , a physical - fitness buff and a family man known for his enthusiasm for life and his sensitivity to others , friends say .
But according to police , Farrance , 59 , was involved with illegal drugs and possibly dealing them along with his wife at their Pittsburg home .
The activity , police said Wednesday , led to a home - invasion robbery Tuesday night in which Farrance was killed and his wife , a registered nurse , was pistol - whipped .
However , Farrance 's son , Sterling Farrance , 19 , blasted the police assertion that his parents were involved with illegal drugs in any way .
Sterling Farrance told The Chronicle on Wednesday night that he grew and stored medical marijuana at his parents ' home with his father 's permission .
" I have a prescription .
I 'm a patient .
It was medical , " he said .
" This one officer I remember at the house , he had this predisposition to think it was all illegal . "
At about 9 p.m. Tuesday , four masked men burst into the Farrance home on Argosy Court , a usually tranquil cul - de-sac near an elementary school .
They fatally shot Rex Farrance in the chest and hit his wife in the head with a gun , Pittsburg police Inspector John Conaty said .
Rex Farrance 's wife , Lenore Vantosh - Farrance , 56 , called 911 , but the assailants fled on foot before police arrived .
No arrests have been made in what investigators said was a targeted attack possibly linked to narcotics .
" We have substantial reason to believe that the victim and his wife were involved in the possession of and , potentially , the distribution of illegal narcotics , " said Conaty .
He declined to specify what type of drug , saying only that a " considerable " amount was found in the home .
Police also would not say whether the killers took anything from the house .
Vantosh - Farrance was treated at a hospital and released and unavailable for comment .
Her daughter , Kavita Johnopoulos , 31 , also rejected police statements that her mother and stepfather were involved with illegal drugs .
She said she believes Rex Farrance , an avid hunter , was targeted for money and guns because he 's a member of the Bay Point Rod and Gun Club .
" It 's sick that they would do this , that they would give false information on what 's going on in that home , " Johnopoulos said .
Co-workers and friends expressed shock at Rex Farrance 's slaying and the alleged ties to drugs .
" I never went to his house or knew his wife , but he never came across as someone who would be dealing drugs , " said Todd Fong , a former co-worker of Farrance at PC World .
" Granted , things could have changed -- and I truly hope the police are wrong in their assumptions -- but the Rex I knew and will always remember was a great person . "
Rex Farrance , who turned 59 on Sunday , had been an employee of PC World in San Francisco for 19 years and was senior technical editor , reviewing online and print articles for technical accuracy .
He was also a fitness enthusiast and rock - music aficionado , friends said .
His wife has been a registered nurse in California since 1983 and is employed by Kaiser Permanente , according to acquaintances and public records .
Neither Farrance nor his wife has an arrest record , authorities said .
PC World officials said Wednesday that they had no knowledge about the drug allegations and described Farrance as a well - liked , model employee .
" We are shocked and deeply saddened by the news of Rex 's untimely death , " said Jeff Edman , president and CEO of PC World .
" We will miss not only his many contributions , but also his friendship . "
" We 're all in shock here , " said Denny Arar , a PC World senior editor .
" Rex loved his work .
He really cared about covering technology in a way that was useful for readers .
He cared a lot about people , period . "
Kimberly Brinson , PC World 's managing editor , said Farrance was a " kind - hearted and gracious person who showed tremendous respect for others and their work . "
As a technical editor , Farrance was " part teacher , part diplomat , and part historian , roles he served with great sensitivity and humor , " Brinson said .
For part of Wednesday , police tape surrounded the couple 's yellow , one - story home , which abuts Willow Cove Elementary School .
A piece of plywood covered the damaged front door ; Farrance 's Cadillac was parked in the driveway .
Herculano Darosa , 54 , who has lived on the street for 24 years , said he often saw Farrance jogging or exercising in the neighborhood .
" He looked nice to me , " said Darosa , who expressed shock at the police assertion that the couple were involved in drugs .
Another neighbor who wished to be identified only as Dan said , " We were absolutely shocked to see the police lights , and we were even more shocked to hear from the police that there was drugs going on .
If they were into drugs , then they kept it well - hidden . "
Do n't get me wrong , I apprecaite their support .
As a soldier , it is always nice to be reminded that there are in fact individual citizens who are willing to take time away from their personal lives to give back to the military in a personal way .
While I 'm not actually hungry or thirsty , I 'm glad they 're here with their bottles of water and bags of cookies .
It is refreshing to see people who see soldiers as more then a never ending source of political capital that can be sacrificed for whatever seems most convenient at the time .
And it 's worth noting that the majority of these men , and many of the women , have served in the military themselves .
There are very few people that can understand what it is like to leave your friends and family for a period of uncertainty that is markedly more dangerous them someone who has already done it .
What bothers me is the particular kind of support that they give us .
The men and women I met today were all two things .
First , they were good natured and kind .
Second , they were generally very ignorant , and willfuly so .
They would often ask individual soldiers about how we really thought things were going " over there . "
Of course , they were not looking for truth .
What they wanted to here was this : " Well , things are going alright .
It 's hard to be over there , but I really feel like we 're making progress . "
To be honest , I just did n't say anything .
It was n't worth trying to tell them that , in reality things are n't going alright .
It is excruciating to be over there , and I do n't think we 've done a lick of good since we invaded .
But that 's not what they want to here .
They do n't want to here that at least 65,000 iraqi's have died ; they 'd prefer to hear you laughingly comment that more Americans die in car accidents every year then Iraq .
( Apparently , our lives our more important . )
They do n't want to hear about the disgusting amounts of money companies like Haliburton and KBR make every day while the average Iraqi can't afford air conditioning ; they 'd prefer to hear about that time you handed out candy to the Iraqi children .
( Children who 's parents probably can't afford to by them new clothes , let alone candy of their own . )
Frankly , I 'm tired of having their ignorance lobbed at me like a glob of spit .
If you ask around , you can hear all sorts of anecdotes about soldiers being spit on when they returned from Vietnam ( you probably need to ask someone who did n't actually , you know , go to Vietnam , but you can hear them . )
At least that spit was honest .
That spit was a reaction to a tragically bad policy .
That spit did n't cause innocent men and women to lose their lives .
That spit did n't keep a currupt president in charge and allow him free reign to consume the constitution .
That spit was informed .
I 'd almost rather have that spit then the fake spit I just recieved .
I suppose that it would be heartening for me if next time their was a " support your troops " thing I saw someone with an anti-Bush pin .
I do n't mind though because I 'm pretty sure that the person who would be wearing that pen is using his or her time to be involved in a real way and make this country better .
I suppose it would be nice if more " liberal " books were in the boxes we get from volunteer groups .
Again , it does n't bother me though because I 'm pretty sure that instead of sending me boxes , liberals throughout America are sending letters to their congressmen and women encouraging them to bring home the troops and prevent a war in Iran .
If you are n't , you should be .
I do n't mean to pass the buck , but it is n't the job of servicemembers to interact with politics .
We certainly have rights that should be excercised and some responsibilities , but it is n't on us to mold opinion and make policy .
If you want to see what happens when the military becomes enmeshed in the running of a nation that way , there are several military juntas you could look at .
Anyway , that 's my little soapbox .
DIGG THIS
Many supporters have been wondering or even worrying about the weak 13 % opinion polling support Ron Paul has had .
There are several reasons why opinion polling produces these results that most people do not know about .
1 ) Opinion polls are mostly conducted by using telephone landlines .
The reason is that landline numbers are easy to obtain , and they produce a fairly accurate and random result for most questionnaires .
As known from marketing , each product has a life cycle , and those who hang on to landline numbers tend to be late adopters of new technology .
These late adopters do not use the internet , so they have ( most likely ) not even heard of Ron Paul .
For them the choice is still between Rudy McRomney which is thus reflected on the polling result .
Due to this sampling error the real support for Ron Paul is most likely stronger than the opinion polls show .
2 ) Many opinion polls count answers selectively .
They reason that by counting only certain given opinions , uncertainty and randomness will be reduced in the opinion polling results .
For example , the opinion polls ask questions such as : are you a registered supporter of the Republican party , have you voted in primaries before , what is your yearly income , when where you born etc .
These questions are then used to eliminate groups such as non-registered republicans or young people .
Even if this elimination is mostly statistically justified , it reduces the showing support for surprise candidates such as Ron Paul , especially when an important part of Ron Paul ’s campaign is to mobilize voters who do not usually vote in primaries .
3 ) In order to reduce the inaccuracy between two polls conducted by the same pollster , vote multipliers are added , which can be based on earlier polls , prior elections , “ scientific ” analyzes or just simply guesses .
Here is how they work .
Let ’s say that a vote multiplier for Rudy Giuliani is 1.2 , for John McCain 1.5 and for Ron Paul  3.0 .
If the pure poll gives Giuliani 25 % , McCain 10 % and Ron Paul 10 % of the vote , the opinion polls are counted to show 30 % for Giuliani , 15 % for McCain and only 3 % for Ron Paul .
The chances are that opinion polls for Ron Paul have negative multipliers , since no - one conducting the polls believes that he can win .
The same phenomenon has happened in various European countries during the last five years when so - called far right parties ( with anti-immigration , anti-EU and fiscal conservative views ) have taken many land - slide victories , even if their results in opinion polls have been often either poor or mediocre .
4 ) Opinion polls are not value free or interest neutral .
Even if the opinion polling company would want to conduct a poll on honest scientific standards , they still know that their poll has been ordered by USA Today , NBC , FOX News , the Washington Post or the New York Times .
So a polling company ’s self - interest is to produce a result that the mainstream media likes .
These news agencies are not interested in polls that predict a great result for Ron Paul , if they would get one , they would not publish it .
This can be seen by just looking back at the polling results from as late as late April .
During late April most polls did not even include Ron Paul as a potential running candidate !
He only starts to show up regularly after mid-May , where as undeclared ‘ candidate ’ Fred Thompson has been included since the very beginning .
Opinion polls often lie , just like statistics do .
The opinion polling for the Republican primary clearly underestimates Ron Paul ’s real popularity , which may already be around 10 % .
For example , sportsbook.com ( a betting site  not a proRon Paul site ) currently places his odds 5th in the Republican candidate nomination race and 9th in the 2008 Presidential Elections .
But let ’s suppose that I am wrong and the opinion polls do show the real support for Ron Paul .
Still , his chances for winning are very good , for the following reasons .
1 ) As Justin Ptak correctly pointed out , “ the national polls are entirely a reflection of name identification , not voters ’ views of the candidates . ”
For example Carter was only polling 1 % in 1975 and he won the presidency .
Back in 1991 Clinton ’s support was at 2 % and he became the president .
Joe Lieberman was leading the Democratic presidential nomination in 2003 , yet he failed to win a single primary .
2 ) The opinion polls also fail to grasp that the Ron Paul revolution is not only a revolution of ideas ; it is also revolutionizing campaign methods .
Campaign methods seldom change , but in the US presidential elections they have done so twice in the past .
Back in 1825 when John Quincy Adams won the presidency he revolutionized campaigning by distributing buttons and other campaign gimmicks .
A second campaigning revolution took place in the 1961 elections when the televised mass media made JFK the president .
The Ron Paul revolution of 2008 could be the third campaigning revolution .
Earlier it was easier for politicians to lie and get away with it .
Today prior speeches and voting records are easily obtainable and thus politicians become increasingly accountable of what they have ever said or done .
Furthermore the mass media can no longer determine the election winners .
In such an environment the few sincere honest politicians like Ron Paul will win .
3 ) All conducted opinion polls measure the general opinion on candidates .
In elections where half the nation votes , such as the presidential election , the opinion poll results are crucial .
In elections where only a minority of activists vote the opinion polling results are unimportant .
The primaries are activist elections and despite all attempts to reduce uncertainty and randomness by the opinion polling companies ( e.g. by methods mentioned above ) , the randomness and uncertainty still remain .
This is due to the fact , that it is almost impossible to separate the activists from the rest in an opinion poll .
For example , in the presidential primaries of 2004 only 7.2 % of the Americans voted !
The Democratic turnout was 11.4 % , the Republican turnout only 6.6 % !
In these cases straw polling matters more than general opinion polls , since straw polls are conducted in places where only the best - informed and most active voters gather .
In straw polls Ron Paul has done extremely well , always placing first or second , once he even made a land sliding victory gaining 65 % of the popular support !
4 ) The opinion polls give out the impression that a candidate needs to gather millions of votes in most states in order to get the party ’s presidential nomination .
As noted above , with only 7.2 % of the Americans voting in the 2004 primaries , this is not the case .
For example , in New Hampshire with a population of 1,200,000 the size of the voting age population is around 1,000,000 .
If 20 % of the shire folk would vote ( an extremely high number for a presidential primary ) 200,000 votes would be cast .
Half would be democratic votes .
Thus even if Ron Paul would race himself against all the other republican candidates , he would win with just 51,000 votes .
And this is the pessimist scenario .
Most likely the voting turnout will be around 10 % and no other GOP candidate will gather more than 30 % of the state ’s votes .
In this case Ron Paul will win the New Hampshire primary with only 15,000 votes !
As the CNHT straw poll shows , Ron Paul already has 200 votes and judging by some videos , there are at least a thousand dedicated Ron Paulians in New Hampshire .
How hard can it be for them to gather 14,000 more votes for Dr. Paul ?
Using the same analogy , in California , the most populous state of the Union with 36,500,000 people , the GOP primary can be won with only 450,000 votes .
Ron Paul will be aided further by the fact that five small states of Iowa , Nevada , New Hampshire , Wyoming and Maine hold their primaries before Super - Tuesday and every single primary victory will give him an election boost .
The smaller the state is , the easier it is to gather a grassroots movement that can influence the election result .
In the primary phase of the presidential elections the ingenuity of the Ron Paul campaign will be clearest .
All other GOP candidates adhere to some stripe of neoconservatism , which will only attract the support of the old voters ( i.e. of those 6.6 % of the Republicans that voted in the 2004 presidential primary ) .
The neoconservative message is old and widely hated .
Ron Paul provides a culturally conservative , libertarian option with fresh ideas that appeal not only to many old voters , but to thousands of new voters who have never voted in primaries before .
He has already succeeded in turning the whole Constitution party , half of the Libertarian party and many , many anti-war Democrats into registered Ron Paul Republicans .
Ron Paul is also about to succeed in waking up the elderly Republican voters with the traditional conservative Republican message of life , liberty and property .
The neoconservatives cannot beat him .
Their individual candidates are all too power hungry to give up the race and join forces under one name in order to defeat Dr. Paul .
With the primaries moved closer to each other they have no longer the option to drop out in the middle of the race , meaning that the neoconservative vote will be shattered between a dozen candidates in every , single , state .
The Ron Paul revolution has already succeeded .
It has brought a lot of attention to the libertarian ideas of peace and a limited government .
It has also put a strain on the mass media , who can no longer deliver any information they want in any manner they please .
Just like a real revolution the Ron Paul revolution has become a movement everyone wants to join .
The real test for the Ron Paul revolution is not the victory over the GOP nomination , the question is how to win the presidency from a Hillary - Obama ticket , which will undoubtedly be seen as a dream team by the academia , the mass media , the special interest groups , the bureaucrats and the politicians .

The Best of Lasse Pitkaniemi
In all , the report , which was mandated by Congress as a preliminary analysis of the success of Mr. Bush ’s latest Iraq strategy , gave unsatisfactory marks to eight of the 18 benchmarks identified as fair standards upon which to assess progress .
The report gave eight satisfactory marks and said it was too early to determine progress for two benchmarks .
Many of the satisfactory grades were on military and security matters .
Many of the unsatisfactory ones were given to measures meant to foster political reconciliation , including a proposed “ de - Baathification ” law to set conditions for some Saddam Hussein - era officials to return to government posts .
In a speech in Washington in early May , Mr. Bush said : “ Leaders have taken initial steps toward an agreement on de-Baathification policy .
That ’s an important piece of reconciliation that we think ought to go forward . ”
On May 23 , Mr. Bush struck a more demanding tone , saying : “ The Iraqi government has a lot of work to do .
They must meet its responsibility to the Iraqi people and achieve benchmarks it has set , including adoption of a national oil law , preparations for provincial elections , progress on a new de-Baathification policy . ”
But for the past several months , he and other administration officials have said that the Iraqis deserve patience , as even the United States Congress has been slow to enact new laws of national import .
The report offered a less forgiving assessment : “ The Government of Iraq has not made satisfactory progress toward enacting and implementing legislation on de-Baathification reform . ”
It also said , “ Given the lack of satisfactory progress , we have not achieved the desired reconciliation effect that meaningful and broadly accepted de-Baathification reform might bring about . ”
The report expressed dissatisfaction on a focal benchmark , the ability of Iraqi security forces to act efficiently without American help , saying , “ The Iraqi government has made unsatisfactory progress toward increasing the number of Iraqi security forces units capable of operating independently . ”
Yet in a news release given to reporters on June 28 , two weeks before the report was made public , the White House said it was encouraged by improvements in the security forces , declaring , “ The Iraqi security forces are growing in number , becoming more capable , and coming closer to the day when they can assume responsibility for defending their own country . ”
Gordon D. Johndroe , a spokesman for the National Security Council , which oversaw the drafting of the report , said that the Congressional report required the White House to take a snapshot in time , and that developments in Iraq appeared different from one moment to the next .
“ For example , the oil law has not been passed , so it was deemed unsatisfactory , ” he said .
“ But over the course of the last six months , when it moved through the various legislative steps after starting from nothing , those were signs of progress . ”

Delimited Continuations in MzScheme
A Tour - Part 1
Prompts
Going further with the Primitives
Our journey continues into the deep waters of delimited continuations .
The last time we talked on this matter we saw some interesting behavior exhibited from the code of our very last example .
You may remember that I mentioned at the time that this behavior came about because we had put our primitive operators together in such a way as to resemble that of the operators on which PLT 's delimited continuations are modeled , which exhibit similar behavior .
You should expect to learn the names of these higher level abstraction operators by the end of this post as well as the name of their author .
However , for bonus points , if you take a look at ../ PLT / collects / mzlib/control.ss , you already have enough knowledge to figure out which operators we were mimicking on the last example of the previous post on this tour .
That file , control.ss , is the file that defines all the higher level abstraction operators ; the ones published in journal articles .
If you are adventurous , and I suspect you are or you would n't be reading my blog , when you look at control.ss you should notice that these higher level abstraction operators are all defined in terms of the primitive operators .
That is precisely why we are going to spend this post , revisiting those primitives , since we hardly did more than get introduced in the last installment , and see what other gems of insight are laying around for the picking for anyone who will spend a little time experimenting with them .
There is another reason to have the primitives well established in our tool box , as will see today ; you are simply more flexible and have more options if you know , and are n't afraid to use , the primitive operators .
So , with this as prelude , lets do some experiments .
First off , lets setup our support syntax , so that you can simply cut and paste this entire post to try out the code from this post by yourself in DrScheme .
Speaking of DrScheme , it will be imperative that you have up to the minute versions of DrScheme to ensure that this code runs as advertised .
You may pickup the latest binary installers from PLT Nightly Builds .
This is because DrScheme has just made some fairly exhaustive changes to their system to further integrate delimited continuations into the REPL among other changes .
I 'm afraid if you do n't use the most current version of DrScheme you 'll be disappointed when you attempt to run the code from this post and especially from future posts , where I will intentionally rely on this integration to be available for the examples to work .

Lets start right off with that last example from the previous installment .
The code has been changed to allow more tests to be run on the same core code , which is essentially what we had before .
Except now the prompts have been parameterized , and the function passed to the default handler has been designed to display the availability of all three prompt tags within the handler .
This gives us better insight into why control flow is the way it is .

What happens is that when a prompt is targeted , all the prompts proximal to the targeted prompt become unavailable , and consequently the continuation does not include the code enclosed by those no -longer available prompts .
In our example above , when tag1 is targeted , the default handler calls our thunk , which is arranged to display the available tags first and then apply the continuation from the let / wcc ( call - with - composable - continuation ) to the number two ( 2 . )
This results in the value two ( 2 ) being returned as the value of the let / wcc expression , and it is then multiplied by four ( 4 ) to give us eight ( 8 ) .
Then it prints let / wcc
8 .
Now , since the next available prompt tag is tag1 , it does a jump to the prompt tagged with tag1 , where it is multiplied by 32 to give us 256 and it displays continuation - prompt - tag : =1 256 .
Similarly , when tag2 is targeted , let / wcc takes the value of two ( 2 ) and then is multiplied by four ( 4 ) to give us eight ( 8 ) , and let / wcc 8 is displayed .
This time prompt tag1 and tag2 are available , so the continuation takes us to the prompt tagged with tag2 , where it is multiplied by 16 and it displays continuation - prompt - tag : =2 128 .
It then continues through prompt tag1 being multiplied by 32 to yield 4096 , and it displays continuation - prompt - tag : =1 4096 .
Finally , when tag3 is targeted , all tags are available , and the process goes right up being multiplied at each step to finally yield (* 2 4 8 16 32 ) = 32768 , and it displays continuation - prompt - tag := 32768 .
Note that regardless of which tag was available , it always passed through the multiplication between prompt tag3 and let / wcc .
That is it always executed the body of the most proximal tag .
The jumps are made to the prompts themselves , and not their bodies .
Lets see what happens when we change the tag specified in the let / wcc statement .
|# ( test - case / result ' tag1 -> tag1 ( parameterize ( [ let/wcc- tag tag1 ] [ target - tag tag1 ] ) ( triple - tag ) ) => 32768 => " tag1 - avail ?
#t tag2 - avail ?
#f tag3 - avail ?
#f let/wcc 8 #<continuation - prompt-tag:=3 > 64 #<continuation - prompt-tag: =2 > 1024 #<continuation-prompt-tag:=1 > 32768 " ) ( test- case / result ' tag2 -> tag1 ( parameterize ( [ let/wcc- tag tag2 ] [ target - tag tag1 ] ) ( triple - tag ) ) => 2048 => " tag1 - avail ?
#t tag2 - avail ?
#f tag3 - avail ?
#f let/wcc 8 #<continuation - prompt-tag:=3 > 64 #<continuation - prompt-tag:=1 > 2048 " ) ( test- case / result ' tag2 -> tag2 ( parameterize ( [ let/wcc- tag tag2 ] [ target - tag tag2 ] ) ( triple - tag ) ) => 32768 => " tag1 - avail ?
#t tag2 - avail ?
#t tag3 - avail ?
#f let/wcc 8 #<continuation - prompt-tag:=3 > 64 #<continuation - prompt-tag: =2 > 1024 #<continuation-prompt-tag:=1 > 32768 " ) #|
In both cases we targeted tag1 , but in the first case we had let / wcc reference tag1 , and in the second it referenced tag2 .
You can see that nothing changed with regard to what prompts are available , given that tag1 is targeted , i.e. , only tag1 is available .
However , the continuation of let / wcc has been changed dramatically by changing which tag it references .
When it references tag2 , the second case , the continuation takes the computation through prompt tag3 , even though it is not available .
The tag referenced in let / wcc is in effect setting a lower - upper bound , while the targeted tag of the abort (!! ) sets the upper - lower bound of the functional geography .
Thus when in the last case we set both to tag2 the lower - upper bound takes us all the way up to tag2 and the upper - lower bound takes us to tag2 and beyond , yielding 32768 .
The same thing occurs when we set both to tag1 .
And we have previously shown the case where both were set to tag3 .
Now what would happen if we were to reference and / or target the default prompt tag .
Lets try some new scenario's .
|# ( test - case / result '@ ->@ ( parameterize ( [ let/wcc-tag ( @ ) ] [ target - tag ( @ ) ] ) ( triple - tag ) ) => 32768 => " tag1 - avail ?
#f tag2 - avail ?
#f tag3 - avail ?
#f let/wcc 8 #<continuation - prompt-tag:=3 > 64 #<continuation - prompt-tag: =2 > 1024 #<continuation-prompt-tag:=1 > 32768 " ) ( test- case / result ' tag1 ->@ ( parameterize ( [ let/wcc - tag tag1 ] [ target - tag ( @ ) ] ) ( triple - tag ) ) => 1024 => " tag1 - avail ?
#f tag2 - avail ?
#f tag3 - avail ?
#f let/wcc 8 #<continuation - prompt-tag:=3 > 64 #<continuation - prompt-tag : =2 > 1024 " ) ( test- case / result ' tag2 ->@ ( parameterize ( [ let/wcc - tag tag2 ] [ target - tag ( @ ) ] ) ( triple - tag ) ) => 64 => " tag1 - avail ?
#f tag2 - avail ?
#f tag3 - avail ? # f let/wcc 8 #<continuation - prompt-tag:=3 > 64 " ) ( test- case / result ' tag3 ->@ ( parameterize ( [ let/wcc- tag tag3 ] [ target - tag ( @ ) ] ) ( triple - tag ) ) => 8 => " tag1 - avail ?
#f tag2 - avail ? # f tag3 - avail ? # f let/wcc 8 " ) # |
This is behavior we have n't seen before , but we can still explain it with our lower - upper bound and upper - lower bound terminology , while taking into account which prompts are available .
In the first case , we are referencing and targeting the default prompt tag .
Not surprisingly , given our previous results where we have referenced and targeted the same tag , we get a single full execution of the functional topography , yielding 32768 .
Now for those still with me , I have a special bit of information to pass along .
You may have noticed that triple - tag , the parameterized function we 've been using throughout this installment has four ( 4 ) tags .
It has tag1 , tag2 and tag3 , which are all we 've talked about so far , but it also starts of by installing a default tag .
We 'll the reason we have n't mentioned the default tag until now , is that while writing this post , up until this part in the post , there was n't a default tag installed at the start of triple - tag .
It was only after referencing a named tag while targeting the default tag that the requirement for a default tag to be installed at the beginning of the function became apparent .
At first thought , since there is always a default tag around , it had n't seemed necessary to explicitly install one .
But the code would prove me wrong .
Without it , the strangest things started to happen : it would execute a tag1 ->@ ( reference tag1 - > target default ) function call and the next thing you know it 's executing code a page down in the source file .
I never really did figure out what was going on , I just inferred that the function needed to have a more proximal default prompt installed , and thus we now have a default prompt installed at the beginning of triple - tag ( I did n't bother renaming it to quarto - tag , since only three are named .
and I 'm a lazy typist . )
That 's all it took , and the behavior becoming steady and predictable once again .
The other thing to note is that absolutely nothing in the results changed as a result of installing the default prompt tag at the beginning of the function .
I was very glad that I am in the habit of using test - cases on everything I post at that point , because that meant nothing I had said earlier had to be changed , since the data was identical .
Let 's start with the tag1 ->@ case .
In this case , as in all three of these examples where we target the default prompt , none of the named tags are available .
So that leaves us with only the continuation created by the referenced tag in the let / wcc statement , which serves as a lower - upper bound on how far up the computational tree we will execute before jumping to the targeted tag .
In the case of tag1 -> @ our lower - upper bound is tag1 , so it 's going to take two ( 2 ) and multiply it by 4 , 8 and 16 to yield 1024 .
For the case of tag2 - >@ , tag2 is our lower - upper bound , so the product will be (* 2 4 8 ) to yield 64 .
And finally , in the case of tag3 -> @ we get a product of (* 2 4 ) to yield 8 .
Since no computation occurs beyond the default prompt tag installed at the beginning of the function , in all three cases , despite jumping to the default prompt tag at the end , the result of the application is determined completely by the computation done during the initial backtracking due to the continuation of let / wcc .
We get a bit more interesting behavior when we reference the default prompt tag and target a named tag , as in @ -> tag3 , our first example below .
|# ( test - case / result '@ -> tag3 ( parameterize ( [ let/wcc-tag ( @ ) ] [ target - tag tag3 ] ) ( triple - tag ) ) => 134217728 => " tag1 - avail ?
#t tag2 - avail ?
#t tag3 - avail ?

#t tag2 - avail ?
#f tag3 - avail ?
#f let/wcc 8 #<continuation - prompt-tag:=3 > 64 #<continuation - prompt-tag : =2 > 1024 #<continuation-prompt-tag:=1 > 32768 #<continuation-prompt-tag:=1 > 1048576 " ) ) #|
This all fits within our model of the continuation being structured by a lower - upper bound from the referenced prompt tag , and the upper - lower bound coming from the targeted tag .
In all three of these cases we are referencing the default prompt tag , but it is installed at the very beginning of the function , so our lower - upper bound is the beginning of the function itself .
Thus , in each case , regardless of the targeted tag , we get an initial computation of 32768 from backtracking all the way to the top of the function .
Then depending on the individual case , the targeted tag determines how far back up we go before we recommence with the computation .
Starting with the case of @ -> tag3 we start off with 32768 from our referenced tag , and proceed through the entire computational tree once again , because all prompts are available .
So we get the product (* 32768 8 16 32 ) => 134217728 .
And likewise for the next two examples , for @->tag2 we have (* 32768 16 32 ) => 16777216 . and finally for @->tag1 (* 32768 32 ) => 1048576 .
It would seem that our computational model of the interplay between referenced and targeted tags is sound , having been born out in all combinations of our functional prototype .
Still , when dealing with first class continuations , your intuition can often be wrong , so we would prefer formal mathematical proof .
Actually , that 's a paraphrase of a quote from the very gifted Oleg Kiselyov , as he set out to prove ( call / cc call / cc ) was self - application , or put another way , the fixed - point of call / cc is ( lambda ( x ) ( x x ) ) .
I had actually spent some time at trying to see if the fixed point of ( @@ ( @ ) let / wcc k ) , which roughly behaves as call / cc , would turn out to be the same .
The function I actually tested was ( define ( call / cc % f ) ( call-with-continuation - prompt ( lambda ( ) ( call-with-composable -continuation f ) I can report that it was an ill conceived venture from the beginning .
Hopefully , by the end of this installment it will be clear why the continuation of call / wcc could never mimic that of call / cc .
For your reference , the paper is at http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/callcc-calc-page.html, " Normal - order direct - style beta- evaluator with syntax - rules , and the repeated applications of call / cc " , The presentation at the Workshop ``Daniel P. Friedman : A Celebration . ''
December 4 , 2004 .
Bloomington , IN .
There are just a couple other things I 'd like to demonstrate in this installment before we close .
We 've been working with let / wcc hand - in - hand with !!.
That is , in our prototype function , we have always been aborting the continuation with abort - current - continuation immediately after capturing it with call - with - composable - continuation .
This need not be the case .
After all , let / wcc provides us with a perfectly fine working continuation in a manner similar to call / cc , and we can go about exploiting that continuation all on its own , without ever resorting to calling abort - current - contination .
In these next examples we leave triple - tag behind us and explore just this topic .
Read carefully and you 'll catch the difference that doomed my attempt at mimicking call / cc that I mentioned above .
|# ( let ( ) ( define ( dhandler x ) ( @@ ( @ ) dhandler ( x ) ) ) ( test- case / result ' let/wcc-k - tag1 ( cp ' expr= ( let ( [d 2 ] ) ( let ( [ tag1 ( make / prompt/tag ' =1 ) ] ) (* 16 ( cp tag1 ( @@ tag1 dhandler ( cp ' inside - tag1 (* 4 ( cp ' let / wcc= ( let/wcc k tag1 (* 1 ( k d ) 3 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) =>
1536 => " let/wcc= 2 inside- tag1 8 let/wcc= 24 inside-tag1 96 #<continuation-prompt-tag:=1 > 96 expr= 1536 " ) #|
In this example we have a single prompt tag1 .
This time , however , when we get to the let / wcc statement , which incidentally is referencing our single prompt tag1 , it is not followed by an abort , but rather by an expression , part of which applies the continuation , in k , to the variable d , which has been bound to the number two ( 2 ) in a let statement enclosing the whole application .
We see that upon k being applied to 2 , the control transfers immediately back to the let / wcc clause which assumes that value , and let / wcc= 2 is displayed .
It continues , being multiplied by four ( 4 ) and inside - tag1 8 is displayed .
This is really beautiful how it shows the natural continuation of let / wcc ( call - with - composable - continuation ) , because the next thing it does is return to finish the expression inside the let / wcc body , having encountered the referenced tag1 .
Here the 8 is multiplied by three ( 3 ) to yield 24 and let / wcc= 24 is displayed .
Here we have let / wcc in isolation of abort - current - continuation faithfully executing on that lower - upper bound paradigm we established while working with triple - tag .
Now it simply continues up the computation unimpeded by a targeted tag , with the product (* 24 4 16 ) => 1536 yielding the result of the application .
|# ( test - case / result ' let / wcc -k -@ ( let ( [d 2 ] ) ( let ( [ tag1 ( make / prompt/tag ' =1 ) ] ) ( cp tag1 (* 16 ( @@ tag1 dhandler ( cp ' inside - tag1 (* 4 ( @@ ( @ ) dhandler ( cp ' let /wcc= ( let/wcc k ( @ ) (* 1 ( k 2 ) 4 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) => 512 => " let/wcc= 2 let/wcc= 8 inside-tag1 32 #<continuation -prompt-tag:=1 > 512 " ) #|
Here we are referencing the default tag once again , and it was indeed necessary to explicitly set a default prompt tag , this time directly behind the let / wcc statement .
I think you have the gist of this by now .
K is applied to 2 and let / wcc= 2 is displayed .
We have reached our referenced tag , so control returns to complete the expression where it is multiplied by 4 and we have let / wcc= 8 displayed .
Finally , the product (* 8 4 16 ) => 512 is displayed as the value of the entire application .
|# ( test - case / result ' let / cc-k ( let ( [d 2 ] ) ( let ( [ tag1 ( make / prompt/tag ' =1 ) ] ) ( cp tag1 (* 16 ( @@ tag1 dhandler ( cp ' inside - tag1 (* 4 ( cp ' let / cc= ( let / cc k (* 1 ( k d ) 5 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) =>
128 => " let/cc= 2 inside - tag1 8 #<continuation - prompt-tag: =1 > 128 " ) #|
This example is simply to differentiate the behavior of let / cc from let / wcc .
We see k is applied to two ( 2 ) and let / cc= 2 is displayed , but unlike let / wcc , let / cc has abandoned the expression from which it first jumped out of completely and merely completes the product (* 2 4 16 ) => 128 .
|# ( test- case / result ' let/wcc-k - tag2 ( let ( [d 2 ] ) ( let ( [ tag1 ( make / prompt/tag ' =1 ) ] [ tag2 ( make / prompt/tag ' =2 ) ] ) ( cp tag2 ( @@ tag2 dhandler (* 16 ( cp tag1 ( @@ tag1 dhandler ( cp ' inside - tag1 (* 4 ( cp ' let / wcc= ( let/wcc k tag2 (* 1 ( k d ) 6 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) => 49152 => " let/wcc= 2 inside- tag1 8 #<continuation - prompt-tag:=1 > 8 let/wcc= 768 inside-tag1 3072 #<continuation-prompt-tag:=1 > 3072 #<continuation -prompt-tag:=2 > 49152 " ) #|
There is nothing particularly different about this example , except we 're using two ( 2 ) prompt tags .
I 'll leave this one for you to work through .
|# ( test - case / result ' let / wcc - k -@ ( let ( [d 2 ] ) ( cp '@ - outer ( @@ ( @ ) dhandler (* 16 ( cp '@ - inner ( @@ ( @ ) dhandler ( cp ' inside - inner - @ (* 4 ( cp ' let /wcc= ( let/wcc k ( @ ) (* 1 ( k d ) 7 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) => 3584 => " let/wcc= 2 inside - inner-@ 8 let/wcc= 56 inside-inner-@ 224 @ -inner 224 @-outer 3584 " ) #|
We 've not seen this before .
We 've got two ( 2 ) default prompt tags installed in this application .
So , really , it 's all about what happens in a situation where we are referencing a tag which has been installed more than once in the application .
Your intuition , is probably like mine , in that it will use the most proximal , that is the first encountered referenced tag as its lower - upper bound .
Lets see .
We have k applied to 2 and let / wcc= 2 is displayed .
There is nothing in the way so it clearly must be multiplied by four ( 4 ) yielding 8 , and inside - inner - @ 8 is displayed .
Next , just as we assumed , it encounters the referenced tag and returns to complete the expression , being multiplied by seven and let / wcc= 56 is displayed .
Now , with no targeted tags to worry about it just completes the product (* 56 4 16 ) => 3584 to yield the final value of the application .
I 'm sure by now you feel confident that you could predict and explain the behavior of the primitive functions in similar settings without much difficulty .
Without formal proof , I would say we have pretty good evidence that our working paradigm on how the continuations of call - with - composable - continuation and abort - current - continuation work is a reliable model on which to base the assessment of code .
However , I should warn you , and remind you of Oleg 's comment about first class continuations .
There are interactions with continuations at all levels of DrScheme or MzScheme , error handlers being one of them .
You have to be willing to accept that not all that is known about these functions has been revealed , and more importantly , not all that these functions are capable of may yet be known .
Keep it in your mind the example I gave today about running into trouble with default prompts which were not explicitly installed , and the weird behavior that came from that simple problem .
Another warning is that the behavior of these functions relies heavily on the definition of any custom handler , as you will see below .
Finally , if you do run into anything that seems beyond explanation , please forward it on to me , as I am trying to build my own database of areas to avoid or investigate further .
With that let me make good on my promise at the beginning of the post and introduce you to one of the derived , or non-primitive , sets of operators on which the delimited continuations of DrScheme are said to have been based .
This is the definition of Sitaram 's % operator , think ( @@ ( @ ) #f f ) , pronounced , prompt , as put forward in the library file , control.ss .
Note , % can take a custom prompt tag and handler , or if not specified will use the default - prompt - tag and default - handler .
This would be a useful feature except that fcontrol , think ( let/wcc k ( @ ) ( !! ( @ ) f k ) , as written in control.ss , has no way of specifying a thunk as an argument to %'s handler , which , if you remember , the default handler requires .
( define - syntax % ( syntax - rules ( ) [ ( _ expr handler ) ( call - with - continuation - prompt ( lambda ( ) expr ) ( default - continuation - prompt - tag ) handler ) ] [ ( _ expr ) ( call - with - continuation - prompt ( lambda ( ) expr ) ) ] ) )
This is the definition of Sitaram 's fcontrol operator as put forward in the library file control.ss .
Notice that the continuation from call / wcc is being passed back as an argument to the function f .
This could not be used with the default prompt handler , which expects a thunk .
( define ( fcontrol f ) ( call-with-composable -continuation ( lambda ( k ) ( abort - current - continuation ( default-continuation - prompt - tag ) f k ) ) ) )
These are my alternate definitions of Sitaram 's % and fcontrol operators , named % % and fc respectively .
We need these alternate definitions because the ones defined in control.ss , while correct if used with the right custom handler , will not work with the default handler , so we remove that option , and install the handler that Sitaram used in his paper .
|# ( let ( [ tag1 ( make / prompt/tag ' =1 ) ] ) ( define - syntax % % ( syntax - rules ( ) ( ( _ tag . body ) ( call - with - continuation - prompt ( lambda ( ) . body ) tag ( lambda ( r k ) r ) ) ) ) ) ( define ( fc tag f ) ( call - with - composable - continuation ( lambda ( k ) ( abort - current - continuation tag f k ) ) tag ) ) #|
What follows is the final example of the post , and represents a simple non-local exit use of continuations for which we are all familiar , and would normally use let / ec to handle the task .
let /ec is still the answer to this type of problem , by the way .
The example only gives you a simple taste of what is in store for the next post when we go over some very interesting examples , and where delimited continuations really come into their own as a unique set of tools no one should be without .
|# ( define product ( lambda ( s ) ( % % tag1 ( let loop ( [s s ] ) ( if ( null ? s) 1 ( let ( [ a ( car s ) ] ) ( display a ) ( if ( = a 0 ) ( fc tag1 0 ) (* a ( loop ( cdr s ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ( lambda ( r k ) r ) ) ) ) ( test - case / result ' product ( product ' ( 1 2 3 4 0 6 7 8 9 20 ) ) => 0 => " 12340 " ) ) ) ( let ( [n 38 ] ) ( printf " ~nPassed all ~a tests ?
~a " n ( check - passed ? n ) ) ) ( check - report ) #| Passed all 38 tests ?
#t ; *** checks *** : 38 correct , 0 failed .
And we get the expected result on this use of fcontrol to execute a simple escape from a loop .
BTW , this example is a modified version of an example from Dorai Sitaram's , " Handling Control " , 1993 .
The only change is that I 'm using the prompt enabled versions of the functions , that I defined earlier .
In fairness to Sitaram , he saw the need for a hierarchy of prompts years before this paper , and works with prompted versions of his functions later on in the paper itself .
This would be a good paper for you to read , because the next installment will feature a couple of non-trivial examples from his paper , and the more you are familiar with the algorithms the better .
The examples involve working with concurrency through the use of delimited continuations .
One example looks at nested engines .
This is definitely a topic worthy of some self study before the next installment .
I can suggest , in addition to reading Sitaram 's paper , that you look at the final problem in " The Scheme Programming Language " 3rd ed. , Kent Dybvig .
I also believe Sitaram devotes some time to this topic in his book , Teach Yourself Scheme in FIXNUM Days .
Have fun .

We have no idea whether thoroughbred horses love to race .
We like to think they do , and maybe , on a glorious spring day in Triple Crown season , a 40 - mile - an - hour run around a dirt oval under a jockey 's whip in front of a cheering crowd really does feel wonderful to an animal that has , after all , been bred and trained for just such an activity .
But we do n't know , and it is hard to sustain an illusion of joy for anyone who has sat in a nearly deserted grandstand on a dreary afternoon , watching horses cross the finish line covered with mud from a sloppy track .
And do even champions really love being loaded into vans or onto airplanes for a trip to a distant racetrack when the reward , for them , is little more than a blanket of roses ?
I have been a racing fan for years , and my point is not that horse racing is cruel or morally ambiguous .
I will let others make that argument , as many have in the past week .
Yes , we feel a special obligation to these fragile , beautiful creatures whom we place in harm 's way for our own sporting pleasure .
And yes , when their perfection is marred , we shudder as we would at the destruction of a work of art .
But I think the sense of obligation runs at a deeper , even subliminal level .
We are responsible for racehorses because we in a very real sense created them .
Today 's thoroughbreds are a result of more than 300 years of selective breeding that has carried them very far from their roots on the steppes and deserts of the Middle East .
Every thoroughbred is descended from one of three stallions , the Darley Arabian , Godolphin , and the Byerly Turk , brought to England toward the close of the 17th century and bred to mares initially under the patronage of King Charles II .
A great - great - grandson of the Darley Arabian , bred by a son of King George II , was born during a solar eclipse in 1764 and named Eclipse .
An undefeated champion on the track , he sired 344 winners , and his powerful bloodline literally eclipsed all others .
In fact , 95 percent of the thoroughbreds alive today are his descendants .
During the ensuing centuries , theories about the best strategies for fulfilling the injunction to " breed the best to the best " have come and gone , but almost nothing has been left to chance .
Barbaro 's sire , Dynaformer , stands for a stud fee of $ 100,000 .
Human intervention has been so pervasive that on some level these are scarcely horses any longer but centaurs , part equine and part human , their lives so intermingled with ours that there is no separating the two .

I got a vasectomy .
I met a girl soon afterwards .
She was nice and attractive but with a selfish streak that raised a big red flag .
She was 32 at the time and I could practically HEAR her biological clock ticking .
Regardless , she was a good lay , easy on the eyes , and reasonably good company .
I did NOT tell her about my vasectomy and I always used a condom with her to protect against STDs .
She assumed , obviously , that the condom was only used for birth control .
Silly girl .
We date for a few months .
I never made any move towards commitment but she brought it up ocassionally .
For me , this was a casual but pleasant relationship .
For her - as I was to find out - it was part of life - changing series of events that she was planning very carefully .
Four months into dating , I get the " I'm pregnant " talk .
She 's going on and on about how the condom must have broke and now we really need to think about getting married " for the baby " .
She 's positively giddy .
She has a baby in her and she thinks she 's gonna have a good meal ticket ( me ) to go along with her new 7lb annuity .
At this point , I 'm just as giddy .
I get to pull the reverse " oops " on her .
I figured that she slept with some bad boy and got knocked up .
Good thing I was using condoms !
Better still that I have a serious mistrust of women who can't think beyond their own uteri .
So I wait a couple of days to " think about all this . "
I meet her again .
I say I do n't want kids and that she should have an abortion .
I know where this is going and sure enough it goes there .
She goes completely batshit insane on me .
There were the usual insults about my manhood .
There were threats of legal action .
It was all very ugly and I was loving every minute of it .
Well , I let her stew for a few days .
She leaves me nasty messages on my phone .
She sends awful emails .
I 'm laughing hysterically .
It was time to drop the hammer .
While she was stewing I was busy .
First I get a notarized copy from the urologist who performed the vasectomy .
Next I get a notarized copy of the TWO test results indicating a " negative test result for sperm " to show I 'm sterile and shooting blanks .
Finally , I get a letter from a shark attorney stating he has seen the other documents and is prepared to litigate against this woman if she continues to communicate with me in such an unpleasant manner .
Also , the letter states that we will insist on DNA testing to show that the baby is not mine .
I 'm ready .
I meet with this woman at her place .
I bring flowers and a small bit of jewelry to show I am willing to reconcile and assume my responsibilities as a new father .
I also have stuck in my pocket the documents I have prepared .
She 's all giddy again .
Her plan is going perfectly - or so she thinks .
We talk about our future .
We have some pretty good sex .
Then , as I am about to walk out the door , I ask her the $ 64,000 question .
" Are you sure that this baby is mine ?
" Well , she goes batshit insane again .
Hell , she ought to .
Her plan could completely unravel if there is ANY question about my paternity .
Oh , she 's really screaming now .
How dare I question her morals .
Do I think she 's a slut .
I 'm just trying to weasel out of my responsibilities ... blah , blah , blah , yadda , yadda , yadda .
I 'm not really mad .
I 'm kind of embarrassed for her .
But since she wo n't shut up and the neighbors can hear all of this , I ask her to step back inside and sit down .
She sits on the sofa and calms down a bit .
She is glaring at me with all the moral self - righteousness that only a woman can muster up .
She thinks she has me trapped .
She is 100 % convinced her plan has worked .
Oh , the tangled web of lies and deceit she has wrought around herself and I am about to hack through them with a few pieces of paper .
I reach into my pocket slowly .
I extract the three pieces of paper and unfold them slowly and deliberately .
I tell her simply , " You 're screwed " .
Her look does n't change .
There is no way she can fathom what I have prepared .
I continue .
" I am sterile " Her look changes just a bit .
Something is beginning to sink in .
Naturally , she reverts to women 's logic .
" You 're full of shit .
You 're trapped and you know it .
" I hold up the letter and the test results .
" Three months before we met , I had a vasectomy .
Here is a notarized letter from him stating what I had done .
Here are two test results showing that I tested negative for the presence of sperm .
Blanks .
I am shooting blanks .
That baby inside you is simply not mine .
" This woman is not to be swayed by logic and clear documentation .
" Bullshit , those are fakes .
" I was ready for that .
" No , they are real .
This last piece of paper is from my attorney .
It 's a simple letter to you that states if you pursue any kind of legal action against me for child support that I will insist on a DNA test to prove paternity , that is , to prove that your baby is not mine .
" I give the woman all the documents .
She reads them slowly , deliberately .
With each passing second she can feel in her soul that she has made a very bad mistake .
With denial swept away , she started to cry .
It 's a small cry at first .
Then it becomes deeper and more painful .
By the time she gets to the letter from the lawyer she is sobbing .
I had no sympathy for her .
I turned and walked out the door .
Even after I closed the door I could still hear her sobbing .
Epilogue - I never heard directly from this woman again .
I did hear through my friends that she did indeed have the baby .
I also heard that the real father was some guy in a band she had met .
I assumed that after 30 , women stopped going after musicians , bikers , criminals , and thugs .
Silly me for thinking the best of American women .
The Moral of the Story - Get a vasectomy but keep it a secret .
This is a great idea :
Lawmakers in Iowa are proposing a special “ passport ” meant to protect victims of identity theft against false criminal action and credit charges .
The “ Identity Theft Passport ” will be a card or certificate that victims of identity fraud can show to police or creditors to help demonstrate their innocence , Tom Sands , a state representative of the Iowa House and supporter of the proposal , said in an e-mail interview Tuesday .
Deep in the Congolese jungle is a band of apes that , according to local legend , kill lions , catch fish and even howl at the moon .
Local hunters speak of massive creatures that seem to be some sort of hybrid between a chimp and a gorilla .
Their location at the centre of one of the bloodiest conflicts on the planet , the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo , has meant that the mystery apes have been little studied by western scientists .
Reaching the region means negotiating the shifting fortunes of warring rebel factions , and the heart of the animals ' range is deep in impenetrable forest .
But despite the difficulties , a handful of scientists have succeeded in studying the animals .
Early speculation that the apes may be some yeti- like new species or a chimp / gorilla hybrid proved unfounded , but the truth has turned out to be in many ways even more fascinating .
They are actually a population of super - sized chimps with a unique culture - and it seems , a taste for big cat flesh .
The most detailed and recent data comes from Cleve Hicks , at the University of Amsterdam , who has spent 18 months in the field watching the Bili apes - named after a local town - since 2004 .
His team 's most striking find came after one of his trackers heard chimps calling for several days from the same spot .
When he investigated he came across a chimp feasting on the carcass of a leopard .
Mr Hicks cannot be sure the animal was killed by the chimp , but the find lends credence to the apes ' lion - eating reputation .
" What we have found is this completely new chimpanzee culture , " said Mr Hicks .
Previously , researchers had only managed to snatch glimpses of the animals or take photos of them using camera traps .
But Mr Hicks used local knowledge to get closer to them and photograph them .
" We were told of this sort of fabled land out west by one of our trackers who goes out there to fish , " said Mr Hicks whose project is supported by the Wasmoeth Wildlife Foundation .
" I call it the magic forest .
It is a very special place . "
Getting there means a gruelling 40 km ( 25 - mile ) trek through the jungle , from the nearest road , not to mention navigating croc-infested rivers .
But when he arrived he found apes without their normal fear of humans .
Chimps near the road flee immediately at the sight of people because they know the consequences of a hunter 's rifle , but these animals were happy to approach him .
" The further away from the road the more fearless the chimps got , " he added .
Mr Hicks reports that he found a unique chimp culture .
For example , unlike their cousins in other parts of Africa the chimps regularly bed down for the night in nests on the ground .
Around a fifth of the nests he found were there rather than in the trees .
" How can they get away with sleeping on the ground when there are lions , leopards , golden cats around as well as other dangerous animals like elephants and buffalo ? " said Mr Hicks .
" I do n't like to paint them as being more aggressive , but maybe they prey on some of these predators and the predators kind of leave them alone . "
He is keen to point out though that they do n't howl at the moon .
" The ground nests were very big and there was obviously something very unusual going on there .
They are not unknown elsewhere but very unusual , " said Colin Groves , an expert on primate morphology at the Australian National University in Canberra who has observed the nests in the field .
Prof Groves believes that the Bili apes should prompt a radical rethink of the family tree of chimp sub-species .
He has proposed that primatologists should now recognise five different sub-divisions instead of the current four .
Mr Hicks said the animals also have what he calls a " smashing culture " - a blunt but effective way of solving problems .
He has found hundreds of snails and hard - shelled fruits smashed for food , seen chimps carrying termite mounds to rocks to break them open and also found a turtle that was almost certainly smashed apart by chimps .
Like chimp populations in other parts of Africa , the Bili chimps use sticks to fish for ants , but here the tools are up to 2.5 metres long .
The most exciting thing about this population of chimps though is that it is much bigger than anyone realised and may be one of the largest remaining continuous populations of the species left in Africa .
Mr Hicks and his colleague Jeroen Swinkels surveyed an area of 7,000 square kilometres and found chimps everywhere .
Their unique culture was uniform throughout .
However , the future for the Bili apes is far from secure .
" Things are not promising , " said Karl Ammann , an independent wildlife photographer who began investigating the apes 1996 .
" The absence of a strong central government has resulted in most of the region becoming more independent and lawless .
In conservation terms this is a disaster . "

Native crayfish in the UK could be wiped out by a new marbled species which carries a deadly plague .
And these alien invaders can reproduce in great numbers at great speed without mating - if just one enters the waterways it will be capable of establishing a population .
Scroll down for more ...
British crayfish have been up against larger American cousins for 20 years , leading to a rapid decline in numbers .
Now marine experts say the emergence of the new marbled crayfish presents an even grimmer future for the British freshwater crustacean , highly susceptible to the plague .
Trading of marbled crayfish is banned in EU countries because they carry the crayfish plague .
But it is believed that private collectors on the continent have illegally imported them to put them in aquariums .
The authorities became aware of a small number of collections in Britain after a woman from Southampton took some in to an aquatic pet shop .
Experts say the fish take their owners by surprise by the speed in which they reproduce - and that leads to dumping in rivers .
Although the woman was quizzed by officials from the Centre for Environment , Fisheries and Aquaculture Science ( CEFAS ) she could not recall who supplied them to her .
Alasdair Scott , a senior fish health inspector at CEFAS , said : " We have become aware of an increase in numbers of illegal crayfish in Britain because we have had species handed to us from aquatic outlets .
" The woman in Southampton bought a female that was carrying eggs and then the next minute her small aquarium was overrun with juvenile crayfish .
" She handed them over to a pet shop and that is how we cane to realise somebody has brought them into the country .
" We spoke to her but she could n't remember who she got them from .
" This could be a one - off incident but we suspect there are others here .
" The fear is that is these can reproduce then all of a sudden people do n't know what to do with the juveniles and end up dumping them in the wild which is very bad news for our crayfish population .
" Because you do n't need a pair of them they are able to breed on their own .
" Marbled crayfish is thought to be an American species and therefore a carrier of crayfish plague - a fungal infection to which our native crayfish are highly susceptible . "
The crayfish are a brown - green colour and grow up to three inches long .
They are larger and more aggressive than native varieties , giving them a competitive edge in the hunt for food .
Gerhard Scholtz , a German biologist from the Humboldt University of Berlin , has studied the marbled crayfish in the past .
He said : " This crayfish could become a menace to European freshwater ecosystems , as the release of even one into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out - compete native crayfish .
" As an American species , it is a potential transmitter of the crayfish plague that almost caused the extinction of the native European crayfish and which still threatens wild and farmed populations . "
The red signal crayfish - Pacifastacus leniusculus in Latin - were imported to Britain in the 1970s to be commercially bred for food .
When the live crayfish farming market collapsed during the mid 1980s , commercial stocks were abandoned or neglected and ended up colonising our waterways .
But by April of 2004 , the main Iraq insurgency had broken out , greatly complicating reconstruction efforts .
And at the same time , American government agencies overseeing the effort struggled to fill staff positions .
The aid agency filled only 170 of 251 authorized positions in Iraq , the inspector general ’s report says , while the Army Corps filled just 18 of 37 positions it had created to support the agency in the country .
Image Stuart W. Bowen Jr. , the head of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction , testified before a House committee in May .

Adding further turmoil to the program was the decision by the United States to shift billions of dollars from reconstruction to arming and training Iraqi security forces , causing dozens of projects to be cut back or canceled .
Even on the projects that survived , contractors like Bechtel subcontracted much of the work to companies that in turn subcontracted parts of the work to other companies , and so on , making oversight of progress in a dangerous , war - torn country nightmarish at times .
The inspector general ’s report is careful to point out that even under these conditions , Bechtel was successful on a number of projects , and a few  including a $ 22 million water plant  actually came in at under the expected cost .
“ In other instances , however , ” the report says , “ millions of dollars were spent and requirements were not met , reduced or clearly established . ”
Among the work that failed was a huge project to add desperately needed electrical output to the Musayyib power plant , south of Baghdad .
Originally budgeted at $ 23 million , the project ran into problems with American subcontractors , the Iraqi Electricity Ministry and deteriorating local security .
Finally , only $ 6.6 million was paid out before the project ended , and even then , the report says , there is no clear indication of whether anything actually improved at the plant .
“ Thus , it is difficult to establish the value of the product received for the $ 6.6 million cost of this job order , ” the report says .
Perhaps even more telling was a Baghdad landfill project originally budgeted at $ 14 million but never dug , even after $ 4 million had been spent on the project .
Highly trumpeted by the American authorities in Iraq , the project was to be something entirely new for a country never known for the quality of its sanitation facilities .
The report says in dry language that the project was canceled after three sites were considered and rejected “ because of land ownership issues and security concerns . ”
Posted by Scott Knaster , Mac Team Technical WriterWhen you start work at Google , you get to choose whether you want a Mac , Windows , or Linux computer .
For many new employees who have never used a Mac ( or who have n't used one for a long time ) , this choice represents a chance to try living in Mac OS X .
Google provides a supportive environment for users of various operating systems , so newbie Mac users can count on something of a comfort zone .
And , just as elsewhere in the world , new Mac users at Google are often won over by Apple 's excellent combination of hardware and software .
I spend part of my time at Google writing documentation for Google Checkout , and in that group I work with several of these recent Mac converts .
Some of the folks in the group became intrigued with the idea of visiting Apple 's headquarters , located just a brief drive down the road , and I mentioned that I could probably convince a couple of Apple friends to host us for lunch in Apple 's cafeteria .
The Mac newbies thought that was a fine idea , and lunch was arranged .
When the date arrived , my gang and I piled into our cars for the quick trip to Cupertino .
We met up with my friends and spent the first part of our visit at Apple 's legendary Company Store , where we admired all the new Macs and iPods , and wandered through the selection of Apple - logoed clothing , pens , notebooks , and other chotchkas .
Strong willpower kept us from buying too much stuff .
After the store visit , our Google gang entered the main Apple building at 1 Infinite Loop and walked to Caffé Macs .
We chose our food from among the sushi , burritos , soups , and other fare that was somewhat Google - like , paused to pay for our lunches ( which was not Google - like at all ) , then took our seats .
A few minutes later , as we were enjoying our lunch and chatting with Apple friends , we noticed a slight disturbance in the room , as if all the air had rushed to a single place , over by the salad bar .
As you have probably guessed , it was Apple CEO Steve Jobs , grabbing some lunch with Jonathan Ive , Apple 's industrial design guru .
As the two moved across the room , there was no great commotion -- after all , this probably happens just about every day at Apple -- but our Google group and many other folks stopped eating long enough to follow the two rock stars around the room for awhile .
Later , as we drove back to Mountain View , we reflected on our visit .
My coworkers enjoyed the entire trip , but were most impressed with the impromptu Steve Jobs flyby .
They even accused me of timing our visit to correspond with Steve 's lunch ( as if ! ) .
And so , a gang of new Mac fans at Google visited Apple and became full on converts .
Founders Unite for Startup School
[ The following article was originally intended for Wired News , but was rejected for not being about any of its advertisers . ]
Experts agree that it smells like a new startup age is beginning to boom .
This time , however , it ’s being led by geeks themselves instead of business guys .
At the center of this democratizing force is the new funding firm Y Combinator , led by Internet entrepreneur and essayist Paul Graham .
Y Combinator burst onto the scene by offering small grants to promising graduates ( average age : 23 ) to pursue their ambitions in startup form over the summer .
And this past weekend , the people behind Y Combinator , in association with the Harvard Computer Society , took their show to the masses , inviting 500 of the most promising startup founders to Harvard University for an intense one - day lecture series on all aspects of starting a company .
The weekend was kicked off with a smaller reception at Y Combinator ’s offices the night before .
The room pulsed with networking between the various would - be founders , as well as some interesting meeting with some of the guests of honor .
“ Last night was the first time I met my lawyer , ” said Steve Huffman , Lord Ruler and Supreme Leader * of Reddit , one of the companies Y Combinator has funded .
“ The first thing I said was ‘ Am I getting charged for this ? ’
‘ No , ’ she told me .
‘ There are rules preventing us from charging for parties . ’ ”
Meanwhile , clusters of people formed around the night ’s VIPs , including blogger Joel Spolsky , scientist Stephen Wolfram , and , of course , the Reddit developers themselves , who found themselves deluged by excited fans .
The startup school itself was a similarly star - studded event , with Apple Computer co-founder Steve Wozniak telling the story of how his company got started .
Michael Mandel , chief economist for BusinessWeek touted the virtues of America ’s entrepreneurial culture to the assembled crowd .
“ People starting companies and risking failure are what makes America so great .
The people in this room are doing God ’s work , ” he said to applause .
Senior officials from Google and Yahoo both espoused the virtues of their respective companies .
Lawyers from top - tier law firms provided advice on protecting a company ’s intellectual property and navigating some of the complex legal waters of the modern business world .
Founders Langley Steinert , Marc Hedlund , and Olin Shivers tried to share some of their assembled experience .
Because space was limited , people who wanted to attend simply needed to fill out a simple questionnaire about their background , but the event was entirely free of charge .
It might seem unusual for a company interested in helping hackers start companies to try to give some of that value away but Paul Graham had an explanation .
“ There ’s a concept in venture capital known as ‘ deal flow ’ , ” he said in an interview .
“ The deal flow is all the interesting startups to fund flowing by .
And venture capitalists just try to grab the best ones for themselves .
Well , we think the real solution to this is to increase the total deal flow for everyone . ”
Paul Graham himself gave a very well - received talk on how to come up with ideas for startups .
The thing that trips people up , he suggested , was mistakenly thinking that a good startup idea needed to be a million - dollar idea .
Instead , he proposed prospective founders simply look around for things that are broken with the world and try to fix them .
Video of the talks will be available on the startup school website shortly .

A Federal Appeals Court in Ohio has issued a ruling that broadly expands the privacy protections given to electronic mail stored on internet servers :
WASHINGTON , DC , United States ( UPI ) — A U.S. appeals court in Ohio has ruled that e-mail messages stored on Internet servers are protected by the Constitution as are telephone conversations and that a federal law permitting warrantless secret searches of e-mail violates the Fourth Amendment .
(…)
An Ohio man whose e-mail was searched after his Internet service provider was ordered to turn it over to federal investigators and not tell him about it sought and won an injunction against the government last year in U.S. District Court .
On Monday , that injunction was upheld by the 6th Circuit Appeals Court .
‘ The District Court correctly determined that e-mail users maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of their e-mails , ’ ruled the three - judge panel .
They held that the 1986 Stored Communications
Act , which allows the government to obtain an ex-parte order requiring ISPs to turn over e-mail stored on their servers , violated the Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures .
Ex -parte orders are those issued by the courts at the government`s request without any opportunity for the subject of the order to contest them .
The court ruled that there was a difference between the so - called meta - data stored by the ISP about each e-mail — the addressee , time of transmission and so forth — and the content of the e-mail message itself .
The distinction , the court held , was analogous to that between the so - called pen register information about phone calls like the number dialed , or the time and length of the call , and the actual phone conversation itself

 There ought to be limits to freedom .  ~ George W. Bush
The fabric of our nation is unraveling , and our freedoms are hanging by a thread .
In a world where the president has the power to label anyone , whether a citizen or permanent resident , an enemy combatant and detain that person indefinitely without trial , no liberty exists and everyone is potentially an enemy combatant . 
According to the Bush Administration , Ali Saleh Kahlah Al - Marri is such a person .
This legal alien , residing in Peoria , Ill. , with his wife and children , was attending college when he was swept up by government agents .
He was held in a military prison for four years without ever being charged with a crime .
And for the first 16 months of his imprisonment , this mans family was not even allowed to see him , speak to him or reassure themselves that he was alive and well .
Because Al - Marri is not a U.S. citizen , the government denied him basic constitutional protections such as the right to hear the charges against him , consult an attorney and appear before a judge to determine if , in fact , he is guilty of anything .
To some people , this is as it should be .
But that s not the way things are supposed to work here in America .
Even the worst criminals in American history , from flesh - eating Jeffrey Dahmer to terrorist bomber Timothy McVeigh , were afforded an attorney and a trial .
This issue is bigger than Al - Marri .
It s even bigger than the Bush Administration and its so - called war on terror .
The groundwork is being laid for a new kind of government where it will no longer matter if you re innocent or guilty , whether you re a threat to the nation or even if you re a citizen .
What will matter is what the president  or whoever happens to be occupying the Oval Office at the time  thinks .
And if he or she thinks you re a threat to the nation and should be locked up , then youll be locked up with no access to the protections our Constitution provides .
In effect , you will disappear .
Pandoras
Box has been opened for presidents to become imperial presidents , which should terrify anyone with any sense of history .
Sadly , few Americans are up in arms over the ramifications , let alone concerned that it might impact them in any way .
 Im a law - abiding citizen ,  one man recently remarked .
 I have nothing to worry about . 
That statement might have been true once upon a time , when a person was innocent until proven guilty and the judicial system could be relied upon to hear facts and ascertain truth .
But such is no longer the case .
We are now operating under a system of government where anything goes and everyone is suspect .
A recent ruling from a three - judge panel of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals seems to have provided a temporary reprieve from the fear that our constitutional republic is floundering .
In a 2 - 1 decision , the court ruled that American citizens and legal aliens like Al - Marri must be afforded basic constitutional rights such as access to an attorney and a court and the right to not be imprisoned unless charged with a crime .
Even so , the courts will not be our savior on this one .
The ruling will likely be overturned by the full Fourth Circuit , and the U.S. Supreme Court will probably uphold the reversal .
So what do we do in light of that ?
First , we must recognize that , at a minimum , the accused has the right to present his side to a judge and jury .
We must remember that our Constitution protects persons ,  not just citizens .
Indeed , the Fifth Amendment guarantees that no person will be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law . 
The Sixth Amendment secures our right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury , to be informed of the charges brought against us and access to a lawyer .
Together , they ensure that the government cannot take our freedoms away unless they charge us with a crime , place us before a judge and jury and give us a fair opportunity to confront the witnesses and evidence presented against us .
Second , we must remember that Americas reputation as a defender of the rule of law is worth preserving .
At one time , the Statue of Liberty symbolized our commitment to fairness and liberty .
Today , our military commissions and secret military detention camps represent Americas hypocrisy .
Finally , the Bill of Rights ensures that no public official can by fiat declare us outside the boundaries of the Constitution .
We must always be leery of government reactions to emergencies and crises because the governments natural response is to rein in liberty for safety .
But as Benjamin Franklin once insisted ,  Those who would give up essential Liberty , to purchase a little temporary Safety , deserve neither Liberty nor Safety . 
In the end , it always goes back to we the people .
It s up to each of us to decide what America should stand for and what is worth fighting for .
It s up to us to elect public officials who understand and revere the Constitution .
And its up to us to set the standard of fairness that should be the basis of all we do .

The Best of John W. Whitehead
Richard Louv , who we ’ve mentioned before , has published a new and interesting article discussing the benefits of outdoor play , the problems caused when it ’s neglected , and what we might do to encourage it .
The article is in the March - April 2007 issue of Orion magazine , and is entitled “ Leave No Child Inside ” ( link to the full article ) .
Louv has no trouble documenting an overall decline in the amount of time American kids spend outside , and likewise the numerous problems associated with this “ virtual house arrest ” ( “ threats to their independent judgment and value of place , to their ability to feel awe and wonder , to their sense of stewardship for the Earth — and , most immediately , threats to their psychological and physical health ” ) .
Despite the forces behind this “ nature - deficit disorder ” ( “ disappearing access to natural areas , competition from television , smart phones and computers , dangerous traffic , more homework , and other pressures ” ) , Louv also finds a “ growing movement to reconnect children and nature . ”
What ’s crucial here is the positive childhood experience of nature most of us adults share and recall fondly .
No matter what our current profession , level of income , or political views , we love those experiences … turning over rocks in the stream , hiking through tall ferns , catching a glimpse of a hawk overhead … and we want our children to have them too .
Louv ’s point is that with this kind of broad agreement on an issue , we should be able to do something about it .
There ’s power to this movement because “ no one among us wants to be a member of the last generation to pass on to its children the joy of playing outside in nature . ”
Fortunately there is camp .
There is a special community designed to help children reconnect with the the natural world , and fortunately , they love it !
Americans will devote half their lives to forms of media next year Americans love their media — so much that next year they 'll spend nearly half their lives watching TV , going online , listening to the radio ( or music ) and reading .
That 's what the U.S. Census Bureau is predicting in its " Statistical Abstract of the United States : 2007 , " out Friday .
The annual report uses data from several sources , including private industry and non-profits .
It has statistics on everything from elections to transportation to finances .
In 2000 , Americans spent 3,333 hours consuming media — and most of that time ( 1,467 hours ) was spent in front of the TV , according to Veronis Suhler Stevenson , a media - oriented money management company that supplied much of the media data used in the report .
Next year , Americans will spend 3,518 hours with their beloved media , including 1,555 in front of the TV , says Veronis Suhler Stevenson .
That means the average American will spend roughly 146 days , or five months , consuming media .
" It 's the activity we do more than anything else , " said Leo Kivijarv , vice president of research at PQ Media , which collaborated with Veronis Suhler Stevenson .
However , the numbers do n't mean we 're just sitting in front of our machines ; we 're multitasking .
" I know people who use television as wallpaper , " said Paul Saffo , a technology forecaster based in Silicon Valley .
But , he added , " The news means that America is making a smooth transition from a couch potato to a mouse potato .
Put another way , I suspect the only exercise Americans are getting is walking between their TVs and their computers . "
The numbers mean that " people want to have — and almost need to have — information and entertainment at their fingertips now , 24 hours a day , " Kivijarv says .
They also mean that technology tools are continuing to shift our " social , political and economic lives , " said Lee Rainie , director of the Pew Internet & American Life Project , which also supplied data for the report .
" In the past decade , the Internet and cellphones have changed the way people interact with each other , the way they work , the way they spend their leisure time , " Rainie said .
Also changed : " The way they maintain and grow their social networks , and the way they share their stories with others through blogs ( and ) social networking sites . "
The Census report , available in book form ( bookstore.gpo.gov ) , also contains other nuggets of data : • Nearly half ( 47 % ) of college freshmen enrolled in 2005 had an A average in high school , compared with 20 % in 1970 .
• The majority ( 79 % ) of freshmen in 1970 had a personal objective of " developing a meaningful philosophy of life . "
By 2005 , 75 % said their primary objective was " being very well off financially . "
• In 2005 , there were nearly 1.4 million men and women serving in the U.S. armed forces ; in 1970 there were more than 3 million .
That was a close one !
The video shows the Shatabdi Express narrowly miss a stupid couple .
Hope they use the railway overbridge next time instead of taking such a humongous risk .

Without your mom and my mom , the global economy would fall apart .
Here are the top five reasons why mothers are vital to the growth of our economy :
Moms Influence Spending Decisions
Running a household means spending money .
Over the course of her busy life , a mother will purchase many different products or services for her family .
Even in families where the dad has the final say about how money is spent , moms have considerable influence on this decision , often more influence than the dad would like to admit .
Moms Teach Us About Money
How many times did your mom warn you about blowing your allowance all at once ?
Of course
We ’d do it anyways but eventually we ’d realize that she was right .
The example that mom ’s set and the money lessons they teach stick with us the rest of our lives .
Moms Earn an Income
Many modern day moms have two jobs ; being a mom plus a day job .
The increase in the number of working mothers over the past few decades has probably added millions of dollars of value into our economy .
The more money moms earn , the more taxes they pay and the more products their family can consume .
Moms Raise the Future Workforce
As an employer who are you looking to hire ?
Probably someone with the qualities that a mother would teach : be honest & friendly , work hard , be patient & polite , play nice .
The qualities that moms instill in their children help determine the makeup & productivity of the future global workforce .
If only the Enron executives had listened to their mothers … …
Moms Inspire Gift Giving
Birthdays , Christmas , Valentine ’s Day , & Mother ’s Day are only some of the occasions that families spend millions of dollars to express their appreciation and love with gifts for their moms .
What would the earnings of Hallmark cards , flower shops , and even Best Buy look like if moms were n’t around to inspire us to buy gifts ?
Thanks mom for carrying the global economy on your back and raising me at the same time 🙂
Being a mom’s not an easy job but you did a great job !
This article is part of ProBloggers Top 5 Reasons group writing project .
I invite the other participants in the project to celebrate Mother ’s Day this week and honor motherhood with a top five list about their mom .

KARBALA , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Attackers who killed five U.S. troops at a government building in Karbala posed as U.S. military officials to get past Iraqi guards , a Karbala police spokesman said .
The attack happened Saturday as the U.S. military convened a meeting to discuss security for Ashura , the upcoming Shiite pilgrimage to Karbala .
According to police spokesman Abdul Rahman al - Mishawi , about 30 gunmen traveling in a convoy of at least seven SUVs with tinted windows -- similar to the vehicles used by top U.S. military officials -- drove up to the Karbala Provincial Joint Coordination Center wearing uniforms similar to those worn by the U.S. military .
About a dozen U.S. troops were inside the compound at the time , al - Mishawi said .
Around 5:45 p.m. , the gunmen cleared an Iraqi police checkpoint outside the center by flashing fake identification badges and speaking some English , al - Mishawi said .
Al - Mishawi said it is standard procedure for U.S. troops not to jointly man the checkpoint .
He said U.S. personnel insist on passing without going through a security screening .
The attackers went through three checkpoints to enter the center , he said .
The first U.S. casualty in the attack was a soldier sitting in a Humvee outside a meeting of U.S. and Iraqi security officials .
The assailants targeted only U.S. soldiers , al - Mishawi said , adding that not a single Iraqi soldier or police officer was killed .
Several of the SUVs used in the attack were found late Saturday in neighboring Babil province , along with two of the suspected gunmen , an official in Baghdad said .
The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said the gunmen were wounded and detained by the Americans , but the U.S. military said the two were found dead .
When asked why Iraqi police did not intervene to stop the gunmen from fleeing , al - Mishawi said " they assumed it was American - on - American violence and wanted to stay out of it . "
Al - Mishawi said Monday that " the Americans have shut down the provincial government compound and everyone is being interrogated from the police chief , officers , down to the average policemen . "
The Karbala deaths made Saturday one of the deadliest days for the U.S. military since the war began almost four years ago , with 25 troops killed .
Twelve of those troops died in a military helicopter crash .

Ashura commemorates the martyrdom of Hussein , the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed .
It attracts millions of pilgrims .
Karbala has two of the holiest shrines for Shiites -- the Imam Hussein and Imam Abu Fadhel al - Abbas .
In Baghdad on Monday , at least 75 people were killed and 160 wounded in a pair of nearly simultaneous car bombings in a used clothing market .

So often those “ everybody knows ” facts we naively place reliance upon turn out to be embarrassingly false .
Such is not the case here , in that there is some truth to the “ U.S. currency tainted by cocaine ” claim , but the implications of this conversation - stopping fact are far more mundane than we might initially presume .
To put it another way , it ’s less shocking a fact than we first perceive it to be because the underlying assumption — that every bill bearing traces of cocaine got that way through having been used to inhale lines of cocaine — is false .
Contrary to our first thought upon encountering this interesting little fact , that trace amounts of cocaine turn up on approximately four of every five bills in circulation does n’t mean the now - contaminated currency was at one time used to snort coke or passed through the dope - laden paws of seedy characters .
Rather , the drug is easily conveyed from one bill to another because cocaine in powdered form is extremely fine .
When a cocaine - contaminated bill is processed through a sorting or counting machine , traces of the drug are easily passed to other bills in the same batch .
ATMs serve to spread tiny amounts of cocaine to nearly all the currency they distribute , as do the counting machines used in banks and casinos .
How widespread is the contamination ?
No one appears to have the definitive answer , as every study comes up with a different percentage .
( For simplicity ’s sake , we ’ll say “ four of five ” throughout this article because that ’s the worst - case scenario , and the figure is representative of the results of some reports , including the most recent one we could find . )
In one 1985 study done by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration on the money machines in a U.S. Federal Reserve district bank , random samples of $ 50 and $ 100 bills revealed that a third to a half of all the currency tested bore traces of cocaine .
Moreover , the machines themselves were often found to test positive , meaning that subsequent batches of cash fed through them would also pick up cocaine residue .
Expert evidence given before a federal appeals court in 1995 showed that three out of four bills randomly examined in the Los Angeles area bore traces of the drug .
In a 1997 study conducted at the Argonne National Laboratory , nearly four out of five one - dollar bills in Chicago suburbs were found to bear discernible traces of cocaine .
In another study , more than 135 bills from seven U.S. cities were tested , and all but four were contaminated with traces of cocaine .
These bills had been collected from restaurants , stores , and banks in cities from Milwaukee to Dallas .
A single bill used to snort cocaine or otherwise mingled with the drug can contaminate an entire cash drawer .
When counting and sorting machines ( which fan the bills , and thus the cocaine ) are factored in , it ’s no wonder that so much of the currency now in circulation would n’t pass any purity tests .
The average person need not fear that the money in his wallet will inadvertently get him high , or that the act of paying for his burger and fries at McDonald ’s will cause him to fail a random drug test .
Only those whose jobs call upon them to handle an extremely large number of bills every day need worry that enough cocaine is getting on their hands to be detectable .
Bank tellers or those who work in the soft count rooms of casinos , for instance , might need to consider the effects of this contamination , but not average folks — not even ones who occasionally carry a great deal of cash about their persons .
As to how much cocaine will be on a contaminated bill , the expert witness in that 1995 court case charted results from as small as a nanogram ( one - billionth of a gram ) to as much as a milligram ( one - thousandth of a gram ) .
The Argonne National Laboratory study revealed that the average contamination was 16 micrograms ( which is 16 one - millionths of a gram ) .
If you ’re not quite sure how much a gram of cocaine is , picture the head of a thumbtack .
These are very small amounts indeed , a fact that should be kept in mind as we speed off to share this startling new information about drugs on our money with friends and neighbors .
This is not the latest , newest lurking danger to our health and welfare , nor is it an apocalyptic sign that drugs are taking over .
Yes , drug use in our society is real , but it has yet to reach the proportions where four of every five bills in our wallets has been used to snort cocaine .
That four of five bills might test positive only means that 80 % of our paper money has at some time come into contact with contaminated bills or counting machines .
It takes only one bill to contaminate hundreds or even thousands of others , so the number of bills that have actually come into direct contact with the drug trade is far smaller than we might first assume upon seeing that “ four of five ” claim marked as true .
Even most Americans probably gave up trying to follow the threads of the trial of I Lewis " Scooter " Libby long ago .
So it is asking a lot to expect non-Americans to grasp the full significance of the former White House official 's conviction on four counts of perjury and obstruction of justice yesterday .
After all , the leak to the press of the name of a CIA agent who played a cameo role in the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction debacle in 2002 was itself a recondite enough affair .
The role of Mr Libby , the vice - president 's chief of staff , in efforts to frustrate a special prosecutor appointed to investigate the leak made an already complex story more labyrinthine still .
The investigation was then diverted for many months into an introspective media debate about whether journalists should be required to testify about their conversations with Mr Libby .
The eventual trial may have fascinated the Washington Beltway crowd , to whom Mr Libby , the former CIA analyst Valerie Plame , and her husband Ambassador Joseph Wilson are seasoned and familiar figures .
But why should outsiders have to take it seriously too ?
For two main reasons .
The first concerns the ethics of the administration of which Mr Libby , as top aide to Dick Cheney , was such a senior member .
George Bush came to the White House in January 2001 pledging to " change the atmosphere in Washington DC " .
By this he apparently meant two things : one , that he would govern in a dignified and rule - respecting way that supposedly contrasted with that of Bill Clinton ; and , two , that he would try to end the intense partisan bitterness that had marked the Washington of the Clinton era .
The Libby case is prosecution exhibit number one in support of the charge that Mr Bush never attempted to do any such thing .
On the contrary .
The Bush administration has been ruthlessly partisan , fuelled by enmities worthy of the Nixon era .
The outing of Ms Plame was a criminal act against the wife of an administration critic .
Mr Libby lied about it .
He presumably did it to protect Mr Cheney , who wanted to punish the Wilsons .
Mr Libby 's conviction therefore raises very direct questions about Mr Cheney 's own position .
The second reason is because , at bottom , Mr Libby 's lies concerned Iraq .
The administration wanted to invade Iraq .
Mr Cheney , and through him Mr Libby , was not particular about how to do it .
When Mr Wilson publicly questioned the weapons of mass destruction case for war he therefore made himself a Cheney enemy .
As a consequence , the White House took its revenge on him through his wife .
Mr Libby lied to protect not just his boss but his boss 's unjust war .
That 's why yesterday 's verdict matters .
This affair is not over yet - not by a long chalk .

While history portrays the Vikings as skillful masters of the sea , sailing treacherous routes in the northern Atlantic Ocean during the 10th - 13th centuries , just how much knowledge , technology and ability they possessed is debatable .
One theory claims that the Vikings could navigate even on cloudy or foggy days using skylight polarization , which would not only require specific atmospheric conditions , but technology beyond anything known in Viking culture .
Scientists Ramon Hegedus , Susanne Akesson , Rudiger Wehner , and Gabor Horvath have recently investigated the idea of polarimetric Viking navigation , which was first proposed in 1966 by the archaeologist Thorkild Ramskou .
While no archeological evidence has been found to support the idea , several pieces of published material cite the Viking polarization hypothesis as an assumed fact .
The scientists , however , have found that more light needs to be shed on the Viking navigation polarization hypothesis for confirmation .

“ Since the Vikings did not possess a magnetic compass , it is an enigma how these excellent sailors could have navigated on the open waters , ” Horvath told PhysOrg.com .
“ This enigma was partly solved when archaeologists found some remains of a Viking sun-dial , a splendid instrument composed of a wooden disk with a perpendicular gnomon in its center .
In the disk , some hyperbolas were engraved , which corresponded with the curves described by the tip of the gnomon ’s shadow cast on the disk from sunrise to sunset during the sailing season from April to August on the 61 degrees north latitude .
“ To read the direction of geographical North , the disk was rotated around the vertical gnomon until the tip of the gnomon ’s shadow touched the appropriate hyperbola .
This is the so - called ' solar Viking navigation ' .
However , the Viking sun-dial could have functioned only in sunshine .
Thus the next enigma was how the Vikings could have navigated by their sun-dials under cloudy or foggy conditions . ”
To detect skylight polarization on cloudy or foggy days , the idea is that the Vikings could have used a sunstone , an enigmatic birefringent ( double - refracting ) crystal , like cordierite , turmalin , or calcite , which are common in the Scandinavian region and even mentioned in a Viking saga .
The sunstone could signal the direction of the sun by the display of polarized light traveling through the crystal , which would be useful on the Viking ’s typical east - west route between Greenland and Norway .
“ In polarimetric Viking navigation , first the direction of polarization of light from a clear , blue sky region should be determined , ” Horvath explained .
“ Then , from the direction of polarization of skylight , the azimuth direction of the solar - antisolar meridian is obtained ( according to the Rayleigh theory of skylight polarization , these two directions are perpendicular to each other ) .
“ The idea that the azimuth direction of the sun occluded by a cloud can be determined from the direction of polarization of light from the clear , blue sky regions , originates from the Austrian biologist Karl von Frisch ( later Nobel Prize winner ) .
In 1949 , von Frisch discovered the polarization vision of honey bees , and showed that these insects are able to navigate by means of the sky polarization when the sun is hidden by clouds , as long as there are some clear , blue sky regions . ”
In investigating the validity of the idea , a group Horvath belongs to at the Biooptics Laboratory at the Eotvos University in Hungary has been traveling on a journey of its own .
In 2005 , this group tested an assumption that solar positions , or solar azimuth directions , could be estimated by the naked eye , even if the sun is behind the clouds or below the sea horizon ( Roslund and Beckman , 1994 ) .
If true , then the Vikings would have had no need for using skylight polarization during cloudy or foggy skies to determine the sun ’s position .
“ Our data from 2005 , obtained in psychophysical laboratory experiments , did not support the common belief that the invisible sun can be located quite accurately from the celestial brightness and / or color patterns under partly cloudy or twilight conditions , ” said Horvath .
” Thus , Roslund and Beckman ’s counter - argument cannot be a valid criticism of the hypothesis of polarimetric Viking navigation . ”
In their current paper , Horvath ’s group performed a second important step , defining five prerequisites for the possibility of navigation by polarization .
The group investigated two of them : how similar the pattern of the angle of polarization of a foggy or cloudy sky is compared with a clear sky , and whether or not an adequate degree of linear polarization exists on cloudy or foggy days .
The other three conditions were based on the Vikings ’ knowledge and technology , which require further examination .
“ Using full - sky imaging polarimetry , we have shown that one of the two atmospheric optical prerequisites of the polarimetric Viking navigation is always fulfilled under both foggy and cloudy conditions , ” said Horvath .
“ The distribution ( pattern ) of the direction of polarization of skylight on the foggy or cloudy celestial hemisphere is similar to that of the clear sky , which was a great surprise for us .
However , we would like to emphasize that the Dutch meteorologist Guenther P. Koennen has already hypothesized this phenomenon in his famous book Polarized Light in Nature ( Cambridge University Press , 1985 ) .
“ If the fog layer is illuminated by direct sunlight , the other prerequisite is usually satisfied only for cloudy skies , ” he continued .
“ In sunlit fog , the Vikings could have navigated by polarization , only if the polarization of light from the foggy sky was sufficiently strong . ”
Although by using modern linear polarization filters , the scientists could determine the sun ’s approximate location on an average cloudy day , they speculate that the Vikings ’ crystals likely would have required more than the available amount of polarization .
For now , physics cannot rule one way or another until further research reveals more about the Vikings ’ culture and technology — anything else is speculation .
But the political aspect of speculation is intriguing in itself : it ’s easy to romanticize the past , to project modern knowledge onto ancient peoples , without realizing that we may be making too many assumptions .
On the other hand , we have often underestimated the abilities of past peoples , and been surprised at discovering that some of our modern inventions have been invented more than once .

Life for an estimated 100,000 people in poverty - stricken rural India has been improved dramatically by several hours of reliable solar - powered lighting every night , made available by a UN - led pilot project to facilitate household financing for solar home systems .
The $ 1.5 million pilot , managed by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , has improved so many lives in India that sister programmes to boost energy access are being initiated in other developing countries .
Even a few hours of 20 to 40 - watt solar - powered lighting in homes and small shops nightly has been credited with better grades for schoolchildren , better productivity for needlework artisan groups and other cottage industries , and even better sales at fruit stands , where produce is no longer spoiled by fumes from kerosene lamps .
Behind these quality - of - life upgrades is an innovative UN - led project to persuade Indian bankers to finance small loans for solar systems – typically $ 300 to $ 500 for a system to power two to four small lights or appliances .
A report on the programme will be offered at the UN Commission for Sustainable Development , the annual two - week meeting of which opens in New York Monday April 30 with a focus on energy issues .
“ Kerosene used by the poor for lighting is often unaffordable , unavailable , unsafe and unhealthy while the electricity power grid is unreliable .
To provide even this little degree of electricity reliability and independence is to empower the poor in ways that can profoundly alter lives for the better , ” says Timothy E. Wirth , President of the UN Foundation , which , with the Shell Foundation , provided the project ’s core funding .
He notes that international study after study has established strong , direct links between electricity use and financial success and well - being .
“ The project underlines the multiple benefits accruing by providing clean and renewable energies in developing countries , ” says UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner .
“ These range from reducing the emissions that are causing climate change to overcoming poverty and the serious health toll taken by dirty fuels – especially on women and children and particularly in the home .
In doing so , such projects can help towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 .
“ The success of this project should also serve as a catalytic blue - print for similar schemes across the developing world and lead to the scaling up of renewable energies everywhere . ”
“ To average citizens of most developed countries , with perhaps dozens of lights and unlimited electric power on every floor of a home , conditions in rural parts of India may seem unimaginable , ” says Jyoti Painuly , Senior Energy Planner at the UNEP Risoe Centre on Energy , Climate and Sustainable Development .
“ We are n’t talking about operating a toaster , kettle , computer or microwave oven – just a handful of low - wattage lights , and perhaps a small fan , radio or TV for a few hours nightly – but even that can make a world of difference .
“ The 45 % or so of people in India hooked up to a power grid suffer chronic , daily electricity outages .
Others trek long distances to buy a few expensive liters of polluting kerosene for lamps , often finding no supplies , much of it sold on the black market as an illegal way to dilute gasoline and diesel fuel .
“ This project removes one of the main barriers to the shift to solar power – lack of financing .
Asking customers previously to pay cash for solar systems meant asking them to pay upfront an amount equal to 20 years of electricity bills . ”
With just $ 1.5 million , the project has posted very high returns in four years , causing a 13 - fold increase in the number of solar systems financed in the pilot area of Karnataka state , Southern India , from 1,400 to 18,000 .
In addition to the many social and health benefits produced , the project has created much new employment at factories producing solar panels and related products , at sales dealerships and for maintenance workers .
Although in 2003 the solar sector was mostly a cash - only business , today more than 50 % of sales are bank financed .
It recently won a top - of - category Energy Globe “ World Award for Sustainability , ” considered today ’s most prestigious energy - related environmental prize .

Free market forces and competition is changing the complexion of and expanding the market , says Eric Usher , head of UNEP ’s Renewable Energy and Finance Unit , UNEP Division of Technology , Industry and Economics , Paris .
Encouragingly , Indian banks not included in the initial partnership have launched competing solar loan products and competition is heating up .
“ Lack of access to affordable energy produces one of poverty ’s most powerful grips , ” he says .
“ This project empowers people to invest and helps free them from reliance on government interventions . ”
The India program ’s success has already inspired a sister effort in Tunisia , where the market for solar water heaters has been shifted from cash to credit , with over 16,000 systems financed .
Similar programmes are upcoming for China , Indonesia , Egypt , Mexico , Ghana , Morocco and Algeria .
How the project works
When the program began , only 31 % of India ’s rural households had electricity connections compared to 76 % of urban households .
On average , power went down for one hour of every six in peak periods .
And tariffs for grid power , up drastically in recent years , are expected to rise even further .
Despite high capital costs ( $ 500 ) , Solar Home Systems have emerged as an attractive long - term option – relatively simple , reliable and quickly installed .
However , even if a solar home system was the best option from a villager ’s economic standpoint , little or no access to credit meant it was simply beyond reach .
Two of India ’s largest financial institutions became the project ’s initial partners : Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank .
Two more banks , the Bank of Maharashtra and Sewa Bank , were added as partners this year .
Although banks in India are required to make 40 % of their loans in priority sectors ( e.g. causes with strong social objectives ) , “ bankers seldom lend for an unfamiliar product , ” according to Mr. Usher .
“ Solar Home Systems were unfamiliar gambles .
The Indian Loan Program used a competitive market development model to help banks enter the sector , remove information and perception barriers while creating standards for quality products , sales and service . ”
The program involved an interest rate buy - down , marketing support and a vendor qualification process .
The commercial interest rate for equivalent loan types at programme inception was 12 % .
UNEP ’s subsidy initially brought this rate down to 5 % , the subsidy phased out over time .
Loans were offered through more than 1,000 Canara and Syndicate branches and over 1,000 branches of the rural regional banks ( the so - called Grameens ) affiliated with Canara and Syndicate .
Solar vendors , once qualified , could direct any interested customer to their local Canara , Syndicate or Grameen bank branch for financing .
Five solar vendors achieved qualification to take part in the program , therefore there were plenty of competitive products .
Vendors offered long - term warranties and five - year maintenance contracts and agreed to recondition systems for resale in the event of a loan default .
Partner banks agreed to let borrowers pay only 15 % of their purchase up front , as opposed to the conventional 25 % deposit , loans could be repaid over five years instead of the usual three years allowed for non-mortgage loans , and security and documentation requirements were simplified .
Initially , banks were paid 300 Rupees ( approx US $ 7 ) per loan account to help with publicity and information sessions , and defray processing costs .
As the subsidies phased out and project - inspired competition began , the UNEP - sponsored banks gradually surrendered predominance in solar loan financing .
Loans are now available across several thousand mostly rural bank branches – a development considered the key growth driver for home solar systems .
A survey showed borrowers ’ average annual household income was 50,000 Rupees ( US $ 1,200 ) or more .
It also revealed the # 1 reason behind buying a system : chronic grid power failures and shortages .
The typical home system comprised a roof - mounted solar photovoltaic module , storage battery , charge controller , interior wiring and switches and electric lighting fixtures .
The solar panels have generally been in the 18 Wp to 40 Wp range , capable of powering up to 4 CFL lights and a DC fan .
In addition to private homes , the project found household clusters ( 30 - 40 houses each ) in an estimated 50 villages pooling resources to install solar home systems as an alternative to the grid .
As well , an independent initiative by the Small - Scale Sustainable Infrastructure Development Fund ( S3IDF ) , an international NGO , in collaboration with vendor Selco , has spawned several small street hawker solar lighting projects .
More and more small town hawkers are switching from kerosene lamps to solar lights .
Most kerosene lamps , especially the open wick type commonly used in rural India , provide very low lighting intensities , far below those required to meet reading needs adequately .
The efficiency of these lamps is not even 10 percent of the most in - efficient incandescent electric lighting .
This means high costs for lighting and undesired emissions .
A study shows kerosene and similar fuels account for 20 % of global lighting costs but provide only 0.1 % of lighting energy services .
In terms of greenhouse gas emissions , a single wick burns about 80 litres of kerosene , producing more than 551 pounds of carbon dioxide per year .
Kerosene emits several other harmful gases while burning , and due to its low efficiency contains large amount of unburned hydrocarbons and soot .
And since a majority of homes in rural India are poorly ventilated , it poses a health hazard , commonly causing respiratory , and eye problems .
Eye , nose and throat irritation are caused by inhalation of the fumes .
Kerosene use in lamps is also a safety risk – lamps can easily get knocked over setting fire in the home .
An estimated 100 million families use kerosene for lighting in India , exposing themselves to these health and safety hazards .
“ Our bank takes great pride in contributing to social change in association with UNEP , ” says Mr. M. B. N. Rao , Chairman and Managing Director of Canara Bank .
“ Putting Solar Home Lighting Systems and reliable energy supplies within the reach of the common citizen kindles hopes and aspirations of many for a better life and well being . ”
“ As governments meet next week in New York for the 15th Session on the Commission on Sustainable Development , the topic of energy will be at the top of the agenda , and particularly how to finance the global shift to a cleaner energy mix , ” says Mr. Steiner .
“ This programme has shown one important area where this is being done on the ground , bringing together local banks , a clean energy technology and the entrepreneurial drive of modern India . ”
I ’ve had a number of people ask me ( especially in light of some recent publicity ) exactly what “ compressed sensing ” means , and how a “ single pixel camera ” could possibly work ( and how it might be advantageous over traditional cameras in certain circumstances ) .
There is a large literature on the subject , but as the field is relatively recent , there does not yet appear to be a good non-technical introduction to the subject .
So here ’s my stab at the topic , which should hopefully be accessible to a non-mathematical audience .
For sake of concreteness I ’ll primarily discuss the camera application , although compressed sensing is a more general measurement paradigm which is applicable to other contexts than imaging ( e.g. astronomy , MRI , statistical selection , etc. ) , as I ’ll briefly remark upon at the end of this post .
The purpose of a camera is , of course , to record images .
To simplify the discussion , let us think of an image as a rectangular array , e.g. a 1024 x 2048 array of pixels ( thus there are 2 megapixels in all ) .
To ignore the ( minor ) issue of colour , let us assume that we are just taking a black - and - white picture , so that each pixel is measured in grayscale as an integer ( e.g. an 8 - bit integer from 0 to 255 , or a 16 - bit integer from 0 to 65535 ) which signifies the intensity of each pixel .
Now , to oversimplify things quite a bit , a traditional digital camera would take one measurement of intensity for each of its pixels ( so , about 2 million measurements in the above example ) , resulting in a relatively large image file ( 2MB if one uses 8 - bit grayscale , or 4 MB if one uses 16 - bit grayscale ) .
Mathematically , this file can be represented by a very high - dimensional vector of numbers ( in this example , the dimension is about 2 million ) .
Before I get to the new story of “ compressed sensing ” , I have to first quickly review the somewhat older story of plain old “ compression ” .
( Those who already know how image compression works can skip forward a few paragraphs . )
The images described above can take up a lot of disk space on the camera ( or on some computer where the images are later uploaded ) , and also take a non-trivial amount of time ( and energy ) to transfer from one medium to another .
So , it is common practice to get the camera to compress the image , from an initial large size ( e.g. 2MB ) to a much smaller size ( e.g. 200 KB , which is 10 % of the size ) .
The thing is that while the space of all images has 2MB worth of “ degrees of freedom ” or “ entropy ” , the space of all interesting images is much smaller , and can be stored using much less space , especially if one is willing to throw away some of the quality of the image .
( Indeed , if one generates an image at random , one will almost certainly not get an interesting image ; instead , one will just get random noise looking much like the static one can get on TV screens . )
How can one compress an image ?
There are many ways , some of which are rather technical , but let me try to give a non-technical ( and slightly inaccurate ) sketch of how it is done .
It is quite typical for an image to have a large featureless component – for instance , in a landscape , up to half of the picture might be taken up by a monochromatic sky background .
Suppose for instance that we locate a large square , say pixels , which are all exactly the same colour – e.g. all white .
Without compression , this square would take 10,000 bytes to store ( using 8 - bit grayscale ) ; however , instead , one can simply record the dimensions and location of the square , and note a single colour with which to paint the entire square ; this will require only four or five bytes in all to record , leading to a massive space saving .
Now in practice , we do n’t get such an impressive gain in compression , because even apparently featureless regions have some small colour variation between them .
So , given a featureless square , what one can do is record the average colour of that square , and then subtract that average off from the image , leaving a small residual error .
One can then locate more squares where the average colour is significant , and subtract those off as well .
If one does this a couple times , eventually the only stuff left will be very small in magnitude ( intensity ) , and not noticeable to the human eye .
So we can throw away the rest of the image and record only the size , location , and intensity of the “ significant ” squares of the image .
We can then reverse this process later and reconstruct a slightly lower - quality replica of the original image , which uses much less space .
Now , the above algorithm is not all that effective in practice , as it does not cope well with sharp transitions from one colour to another .
It turns out to be better to work not with average colours in squares , but rather with average colour imbalances in squares – the extent to which the intensity on ( say ) the right half of the square is higher on average than the intensity on the left .
One can formalise this by using the ( two - dimensional )
Haar wavelet system .
It then turns out that one can work with “ smoother ” wavelet systems which are less susceptible to artefacts , but this is a technicality which we will not discuss here .
But all of these systems lead to similar schemes : one represents the original image as a linear superposition of various “ wavelets ” ( the analogues of the coloured squares in the preceding paragraph ) , stores all the significant ( large magnitude ) wavelet coefficients , and throws away ( or “ thresholds ” ) all the rest .
This type of “ hard wavelet coefficient thresholding ” compression algorithm is not nearly as sophisticated as the ones actually used in practice ( for instance in the JPEG 2000 standard ) but it is somewhat illustrative of the general principles in compression .
To summarise ( and to oversimplify somewhat ) , the original image may have two million degrees of freedom , and in particular if one wants to express this image in terms of wavelets then one would need thus need two million different wavelets in order to reconstruct all images perfectly .
However , the typical interesting image is very sparse or compressible in the wavelet basis : perhaps only a hundred thousand of the wavelets already capture all the notable features of the image , with the remaining 1.9 million wavelets only contributing a very small amount of “ random noise ” which is largely invisible to most observers .
( This is not always the case : heavily textured images – e.g. images containing hair , fur , etc. – are not particularly compressible in the wavelet basis , and pose a challenge for image compression algorithms .
But that is another story . )
Now , if we ( or the camera ) knew in advance which hundred thousand of the 2 million wavelet coefficients are going to be the important ones , then the camera could just measure those coefficients and not even bother trying to measure the rest .
( It is possible to measure a single coefficient by applying a suitable “ filter ” or “ mask ” to the image , and making a single intensity measurement to what comes out . )
However , the camera does not know which of the coefficients are going to be the key ones , so it must instead measure all 2 million pixels , convert the image to a wavelet basis , locate the hundred thousand dominant wavelet coefficients to keep , and throw away the rest .
( This is of course only a caricature of how the image compression algorithm really works , but we will use it for sake of discussion . )
Now , of course , modern digital cameras work pretty well , and why should we try to improve on something which is n’t obviously broken ?
Indeed , the above algorithm , in which one collects an enormous amount of data but only saves a fraction of it , works just fine for consumer photography .
Furthermore , with data storage becoming quite cheap , it is now often feasible to use modern cameras to take many images with no compression whatsoever .
Also , the computing power required to perform the compression is manageable , even if it does contribute to the notoriously battery - draining energy consumption level of these cameras .
However , there are non-consumer imaging applications in which this type of data collection paradigm is infeasible , most notably in sensor networks .
If one wants to collect data using thousands of sensors , which each need to stay in situ for long periods of time such as months , then it becomes necessary to make the sensors as cheap and as low - power as possible – which in particular rules out the use of devices which require heavy computer processing power at the sensor end ( although – and this is important – we are still allowed the luxury of all the computer power that modern technology affords us at the receiver end , where all the data is collected and processed ) .
For these types of applications , one needs a data collection paradigm which is as “ dumb ” as possible ( and which is also robust with respect to , say , the loss of 10 % of the sensors , or with respect to various types of noise or data corruption ) .
This is where compressed sensing comes in .
The main philosophy is this : if one only needs a 100,000 components to recover most of the image , why not just take a 100,000 measurements instead of 2 million ?
( In practice , we would allow a safety margin , e.g. taking 300,000 measurements , to allow for all sorts of issues , ranging from noise to aliasing to breakdown of the recovery algorithm . )
In principle , this could lead to a power consumption saving of up to an order of magnitude , which may not mean much for consumer photography but can be of real importance in sensor networks .
But , as I said before , the camera does not know in advance which hundred thousand of the two million wavelet coefficients are the important ones that one needs to save .
What if the camera selects a completely different set of 100,000 ( or 300,000 ) wavelets , and thus loses all the interesting information in the image ?
The solution to this problem is both simple and unintuitive .
It is to make 300,000 measurements which are totally unrelated to the wavelet basis – despite all that I have said above regarding how this is the best basis in which to view and compress images .
In fact , the best types of measurements to make are ( pseudo - ) random measurements – generating , say , 300,000 random “ mask ” images and measuring the extent to which the actual image resembles each of the masks .
Now , these measurements ( or “ correlations ” ) between the image and the masks are likely to be all very small , and very random .
But – and this is the key point – each one of the 2 million possible wavelets which comprise the image will generate their own distinctive “ signature ” inside these random measurements , as they will correlate positively against some of the masks , negatively against others , and be uncorrelated with yet more masks .
But ( with overwhelming probability ) each of the 2 million signatures will be distinct ; furthermore , it turns out that arbitrary linear combinations of up to a hundred thousand of these signatures will still be distinct from each other ( from a linear algebra perspective , this is because two randomly chosen 100,000 - dimensional subspaces of a 300,000 dimensional ambient space will be almost certainly disjoint from each other ) .
Because of this , it is possible in principle to recover the image ( or at least the 100,000 most important components of the image ) from these 300,000 random measurements .
In short , we are constructing a linear algebra analogue of a hash function .
There are however two technical problems with this approach .
Firstly , there is the issue of noise : an image is not perfectly the sum of 100,000 wavelet coefficients , but also has small contributions from the other 1.9 million coefficients also .
These small contributions could conceivably disguise the contribution of the 100,000 wavelet signatures as coming from a completely unrelated set of 100,000 wavelet signatures ; this is a type of “ aliasing ” problem .
The second problem is how to use the 300,000 measurements obtained to recover the image .
Let us focus on the latter problem first .
If we knew which 100,000 of the 2 million wavelets involved were , then we could use standard linear algebra methods ( Gaussian elimination , least squares , etc. ) to recover the signal .
( Indeed , this is one of the great advantages of linear encodings – they are much easier to invert than nonlinear ones .
Most hash functions are practically impossible to invert – which is an advantage in cryptography , but not in signal recovery . )
However , as stated before , we do n’t know in advance which wavelets are involved .
How can we find out ?
A naive least - squares approach gives horrible results which involve all 2 million coefficients and thus lead to very noisy and grainy images .
One could perform a brute - force search instead , applying linear algebra once for each of the possible set of 100,000 key coefficients , but this turns out to take an insanely impractical amount of time ( there are roughly combinations to consider ! ) and in any case this type of brute - force search turns out to be NP - complete in general ( it contains problems such as subset - sum as a special case ) .
Fortunately , however , there are two much more feasible ways to recover the data :
Matching pursuit : locate a wavelet whose signature seems to correlate with the data collected ; remove all traces of that signature from the data ; and repeat until we have totally “ explained ” the data collected in terms of wavelet signatures .
Basis pursuit ( or minimisation ) :
Out of all the possible combinations of wavelets which would fit the data collected , find the one which is “ sparsest ” in the sense that the total sum of the magnitudes of all the coefficients is as small as possible .
( It turns out that this particular minimisation tends to force most of the coefficients to vanish . )
This type of minimisation can be computed in reasonable time via convex optimisation methods such as the simplex method .
Note that these image recovery algorithms do require a non-trivial ( though not ridiculous ) amount of computer processing power , but this is not a problem for applications such as sensor networks since this recovery is done on the receiver end ( which has access to powerful computers ) rather than the sensor end ( which does not ) .
There are now rigorous results which show that these approaches can reconstruct the original signals perfectly or almost - perfectly with very high probability of success , given various compressibility or sparsity hypotheses on the original image .
The matching pursuit algorithm tends to be somewhat faster , but the basis pursuit algorithm seems to be more robust with respect to noise .
Exploring the exact range of applicability of these methods is still a highly active current area of research .
( Sadly , there does not seem to be an application to ; the type of sparse recovery problems which are NP - complete are the total opposite ( as far as the measurement matrix is concerned ) with the type of sparse recovery problems which can be treated by the above methods . )
As compressed sensing is still a fairly new field ( especially regarding the rigorous mathematical results ) , it is still a bit premature to expect developments here to appear in actual sensors .
However , there are proof - of - concept prototypes already , most notably the single - pixel camera developed at Rice .
Finally , I should remark that compressed sensing , being an abstract mathematical idea rather than a specific concrete recipe , can be applied to many other types of contexts than just imaging .
Some examples include :
Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) .
In medicine , MRI attempts to recover an image ( in this case , the water density distribution in a human body ) by taking a large but finite number of measurements ( basically taking a discretised Radon transform ( or x- ray transform ) of the body ) , and then reprocessing the data .
Because of the large number of measurements needed , the procedure is lengthy for the patient .
Compressed sensing techniques can reduce the number of measurements required significantly , leading to faster imaging ( possibly even to real - time imaging , i.e. MRI videos rather than static MRI ) .
Furthermore , one can trade off the number of measurements against the quality of the image , so that by using the same number of measurements as one traditionally does , one may be able to get much finer scales of resolution .
Astronomy .
Many astronomical phenomena ( e.g. pulsars ) have various frequency oscillation behaviours which make them very sparse or compressible in the frequency domain .
Compressed sensing techniques then allow one to measure these phenomena in the time domain ( i.e. by recording telescope data ) and being able to reconstruct the original signal accurately even from incomplete and noisy data ( e.g. if weather , lack of telescope time , or simply the rotation of the earth prevents a complete time - series of data ) .
Linear coding .
Compressed sensing also gives a simple way for multiple transmitters to combine their output in an error - correcting way , so that even if a significant fraction of the output is lost or corrupted , the original transmission can still be recovered .
For instance , one can transmit 1000 bits of information by encoding them using a random linear code into a stream of 3000 bits ; and then it will turn out that even if , say , 300 of the bits ( chosen adversarially ) are then corrupted , the original message can be reconstructed perfectly with essentially no chance of error .
The relationship with compressed sensing arises by viewing the corruption itself as the sparse signal ( it is only concentrated on 300 of the 3000 bits ) .
Many of these applications are still only theoretical , but nevertheless the potential of these algorithms to impact so many types of measurement and signal processing is rather exciting .
From a personal viewpoint , it is particularly satisfying to see work arising from pure mathematics ( e.g. estimates on the determinant or singular values of Fourier minors ) end up having potential application to the real world .

Oct. 27 , 2006  -- A 24 - year - old computer security student working on his doctorate at Indiana University Bloomington has created a Web site that allows anyone with an Internet connection and a printer to create and print fake boarding passes for Northwest Airlines flights .
The passes look virtually identical to the ones printed from the airline 's site , and are intended to get you past security -- but not onto an airplane .
By entering your name and plugging in information about the flight -- flight number , gate , seat number , departing city , destination , departure , and arrival times and class -- the site generates a boarding pass the program 's creator says will get you past security checkpoints , even without ID .
Christopher Soghoian , creator of " The Northwest Airlines Boarding Pass Generator , " knew he would be opening up a can of worms by writing the program and creating the site , but says it 's the only way to show people how deeply flawed airport and airline security are .
" I do n't want to help terrorists or help bad guys do bad things on airplanes , but what we have now is what we in the industry call ' security theater . '
It 's made to make you think you 're secure without actually making you secure , " Soghoian said .
" As a member of the academic research community , I consider this to be a public service . "
Soghoian admits that he has n't actually tried to use one of the boarding passes yet .
" Testing this in reality could land you in Gitmo [ Guantanamo Bay , Cuba ] , " he said , but he added that the point should n't be lost that anyone with a little know - how and the will to do it could get past security at almost any airport in the country . "
Spotlighting Security Risk or Creating One ?
The Transportation Security Administration says that what Soghoian has done is illegal and that using one of these bogus boarding passes would be illegal as well .
But , TSA officials also believe that it would do little to aid anyone looking to do harm to airline passengers .
" While you may be able to get access to the terminal 's interior through the security checkpoint , " said Ann Davis , a TSA spokeswoman , " TSA assures that every individual introduced to the sterile environment beyond the checkpoint and their accessible property have been thoroughly checked and screened . "
With airport security a hot - button issue , and Election Day drawing near , news of the site is generating some heated responses from politicians that include calls for his arrest .
" The Bush administration must immediately act to investigate , apprehend those responsible , shut down the website , and warn airlines and aviation security officials to be on the look - out for fraudsters or terrorists trying to use fake boarding passes in an attempt to cheat their way through security and onto a plane , " wrote Rep. Edward Markey , D - Mass. , a senior member of the Committee on Homeland Security , in a statement .
" There are enough loopholes at the backdoor of our passenger airplanes from not scanning cargo for bombs ; we should not tolerate any new loopholes making it easier for terrorists to get into the front door of a plane , " Markey wrote .
Aviation expert John Nance says Soghoian may have shed light on a gap in airport security , but it 's not something he should be commended for .
" My knee - jerk reaction to this is extreme concern , " he said .
" There 's a free speech issue of course , but this is under the same legal categorization as screaming fire in a crowded theater . "
While Nance agrees that there are significant problems in the airport screening process , and some policies he'd like to see changed , he says there 's no need to assume that anyone could get any further with this ability than through security and he does n't think that 's a problem .
" You or I can very easily go to an airline ticket counter , buy a refundable ticket for a particular flight , go through security , and come right out and sell it back , " Nance said .
He thinks the real problem , in part , is that we 're too concerned with who can get into the airport terminal when it's the airplanes we should be more worried about .
" The issues that are raised by this spotlight an inefficiency in our thinking about who should have access to the interior of an airport , " he said .
" Our biggest worry is not having them in the terminal -- anyone can get in the terminal and get into a big crowd of people and set off an explosive or something .
Anyone can do that on either side of the security checkpoint . "
Ironically , Soghoian agrees .
" If Osama bin Laden is sitting next to you on a plane , that should n't be a problem , " he said .
" It might make you uncomfortable .
You might not like it , but what 's really a problem is if there 's a ticking bomb or a knife or something . "
A History of Pushing the Boundaries
When you go to the airport these days , the TSA security agents manning the airport 's security checkpoint check passengers ' boarding passes and IDs to make sure the names on both match .
But if you 've ever forgotten your ID when traveling , you know that you do n't have to show ID to get through security or even to get on an airplane .
If you have a boarding pass but no identification , you 're simply subject to a more extensive search by airport security .
" They just mark your boarding pass with a bunch of S's , which means you 're a candidate for secondary screening , " Soghoian said .
Soghoian tested that out during one trip by going to the airport and refusing to show ID .
" The poor security checkers at the gate -- you know making $ 8 an hour -- did n't know what to do , " he said .
" But the supervisor at the airline was really friendly and told me to just let them know the next time I was coming . "
From there , he says , he was able to board the plane and make his trip .
That experience taught him that the ID check was basically useless and that the secondary screening designation had a pleasantly surprising side effect , he was taken to the front of the busy security line .
He says that after that , he started doing it as a matter of course when traveling , ensuring he would n't have to wait in the long , snaking line that preceded the security checkpoint .
The key problem as he sees it is that the TSA and the airlines are relying on each other to ensure our safety -- and neither are doing a very good job .
" The airline does n't know who you are , and they 're not checking IDs at the gates .
They rely on the TSA for that , " he said .
" The TSA 's job is to make sure nothing gets past them like a bomb or a gun . "
But after a recent report showed that security screeners at Newark International Airport in New Jersey had flunked 20 out of 22 tests to identify hidden bombs and guns , and with similar reports coming out all the time , it seems that system may not even work .
The Challenge :
The Something Awful Goons have mangled propaganda posters before on several occasions .
The vast amount of posters and easy exploitability means that the fruit can be squeezed many times and still remain juicy .
This is completely unlike Juicy Fruit gum , which loses its flavor after half a second .
But do n't get me started on gum , because I can go all night !
Instead , sit back and enjoy the vast amounts of dirty sexual innuendo that is Photoshop Phriday !
An example of an unedited image would be something like this :
Of course this image needs no editing .
A lot of others needed only simple modifacation to make them into razor sharp throwing stars of comedy !
The kind that can rip open your guts ...

OSNABROCK , N.D. - David C. Monson seems an improbable soul to find at the leading edge of a national movement to legalize growing hemp , a plant that shares a species name , a genus type and , in many circles , a reputation , with marijuana .
As Mr. Monson rolls past his wheat , barley and shimmering yellow fields of canola , he listens to Rush Limbaugh in his tractor .
When he is not farming , he is the high school principal in nearby Edinburg , population 252 .
When he is not teaching , he is a Republican representative in Bismarck , the state capital , where his party dominates both houses of the legislature and the governor is a Republican .
" Look at me - do I look shady ? " Mr. Monson , 56 , asked , as he stood in work boots and a ball cap in the rocky , black dirt that spans mile after mile of North Dakota 's nearly empty northern edge .
" This is not any subversive thing like trying to legalize marijuana or whatever .
This is just practical agriculture .
We 're desperate for something that can make us some money . "
The rocks , the dirt , the cool , wet climate and a devastating crop fungus known as scab are part of what has landed North Dakota , of all states , at the forefront of a political battle more likely to have emerged somewhere " a little more rebellious , " as one farmer here put it , like California or Massachusetts .
Though federal authorities ban the growing of hemp , saying it contains tetrahydrocannabinol , the psychoactive substance better known as THC in marijuana , six states this year considered legislation to allow farmers to grow industrial hemp , and Representative Ron Paul , Republican of Texas , introduced a bill in Washington that would let states allow such crops .
In state legislatures , the advocates of hemp note that it contains mere traces of THC , and that hemp ( grown in other countries ) is already found here in clothes , lotions , snack bars , car door panels , insulation and more .
But no place has challenged the government as fiercely as North Dakota .
Its legislature has passed a bill allowing farmers to grow industrial hemp and created an official licensing process to fingerprint such farmers and a global positioning system to track their fields .
This year , Mr. Monson and another North Dakota farmer , with the support of the state 's agriculture commissioner , applied to the Drug Enforcement Administration for permission to plant fields of hemp immediately .
" North Dakota is really pushing the envelope on this one , " said Doug Farquhar , the program director for agriculture and rural development at the National Conference of State Legislatures .
Legislatures in Maine , Montana , West Virginia and other states have passed bills allowing farmers to grow industrial hemp , said Alexis Baden - Mayer , the director of government relations for Vote Hemp , a group that presses for legalization , but those laws have not been carried out given federal drug law .
The Controlled Substances Act , federal authorities say , is unambiguous .
" Basically hemp is considered the same as marijuana , " said Steve Robertson , a special agent for the D.E.A. at its Washington headquarters .
" We 're an enforcement agency .
We 're sworn to uphold the law . "
In the wide - open spaces of this state , an independent streak often runs through the politics , especially when it comes to federal mandates .
But the fight over hemp is not political or philosophical , people here say .
It lacks any counterculture wink , any hint of the fear some hemp opponents express that those trying to legalize hemp secretly hope to open the door to the plant 's more potent cousin .
This battle is decidedly , and Midwesternly , pragmatic .
In 1993 , scab , a fungus also known as Fusarium head blight , tore through this region , wiping out thousands of acres of wheat , a prized crop in North Dakota , where agriculture remains the largest element of the economy .
Hard rains left water pooling in fields , giving scab an opening .
The fungus has turned up in varying degrees ever since , even as farmers searched for a cure .
On a recent afternoon , as rain pounded his 710 acres , Mr. Monson gloomily yanked the head off a stalk of his wheat , revealing for a visitor whitish , shriveled seeds - - the telltale signs of scab .
When Mr. Monson began his efforts in the late 1990s , some here balked .
He remembered John Dorso , a former Republican leader , rolling his eyes and asking Mr. Monson if he knew what he was getting mixed up in .
But hemp , Mr. Monson argued , offered an alternative for North Dakota 's crop rotation .
Its tall stalks survive similarly cool and wet conditions in Canada , just 25 miles north of here , where it is legal .
And it suits the rocky soil left behind here by glaciers , soil that threatens to tear up farm equipment for anyone who dares to plant crops like beets or potatoes beneath ground .
Years and studies and hearings later , few here have much to say against hemp - a reflection , it seems , of the state 's urgent wish to improve its economy .
Recent hemp votes have passed the legislature with ease , though some questions linger .
How big a market would there really be for hemp ?
What about the worries of drug enforcement officials , who say someone might sneak into a farmer 's field of harmless hemp and plant a batch of ( similar - looking ) marijuana ?
Such fears , Mr. Monson insisted , are silly in North Dakota , which is the third least - populous state , with fewer than 640,000 people .
This is the only state where voter registration is not required .
( Everyone would know , the logic goes , if someone who did not belong tried to vote . )
" You ca n't go down to get the mail around here without someone knowing , " Mr. Monson said .
But Blair Thoreson , a Republican state representative who has voted against hemp measures , is less sure .
" Everyone here knows everyone , " Mr. Thoreson said , " and yet we 've had a huge problem here with homegrown methamphetamine labs , too . "
Roger Johnson , the state 's agriculture commissioner , said hemp fields would be the worst places to hide marijuana .
Under state rules , Mr. Johnson said , such fields must be accessible for unannounced searches , day or night , and crops would be tested by the state .
Also , he said , a field of hemp and marijuana would cross-pollinate , leaving the drug less potent .
" We 're not wide - eyed liberals , " Mr. Johnson said .
" The D.E.A. , they 're the crazy ones on this .
This sort of illogical , indefensible position is not going to prevail forever . "
After receiving the first state licenses to grow hemp this year , Mr. Monson and Wayne Hauge , a farmer from Ray , on the opposite side of the state , filed applications with the D.E.A. in February .
Since then , the drug agency has not said yes or no .
Given North Dakota 's growing season , it is too late to plant anything new this year .
So in June , the two men- with financial help from Vote Hemp , the advocacy group - filed a lawsuit against the agency .
Mr. Robertson said in July that the agency was still reviewing the applications , but that he could not say much beyond that because of the litigation .
Like Mr. Monson , Mr. Hauge , who is 49 and farms barley , chickpeas and lentils on land his great - grandfather homesteaded in 1903 , said his efforts were about economics , not politics - or drugs .
" I do n't advocate smoking anything , " said Mr. Hauge , who , when he is not farming , is a certified public accountant .
" I guess I 'm not really known as much of a joker , " he added .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The slump in home prices was both deeper and more widespread than ever in the fourth quarter , according to a trade group report Thursday .
Prices slumped 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter a year earlier , according to the report from the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) .
That 's the biggest year - over - year drop on record and follows a 1.0 percent year - over - year decline in the third quarter .
In addition , 73 metropolitan areas reported a decline in the fourth quarter , compared to a year earlier .
That outpaced the 71 that saw a gain .
It was both a record number and percentage of markets showing a decline in the group 's quarterly report .
Five markets saw prices unchanged .
That decline was a far more widespread than the third quarter , when only 45 markets reported drops and 102 saw gains , or the second quarter when only 26 saw a year - over - year slump in prices .
The national median price was still showing a year - over - year gain in the second quarter .
The most recent median prices are down even more : 3.4 percent since hitting record highs in the second quarter .
Almost three - quarters of the markets , reported on by the group , saw declines in median prices over the past six months , with eight reporting double - digit declines .
Vacation markets , where investor - buyers had driven up prices during the building boom of 2005 , were particularly hard - hit .
The Sarasota - Bradenton - Venice , Fla. , market saw the biggest year - over - year decline in the fourth quarter , with prices plunging 18 percent .
When looking at the change between the fourth quarter and the second - quarter peak , the Palm Bay - Melbourne - Titusville , Fla. , market saw the biggest drop , with median prices plunging 19.5 percent .
But the weakness in prices was n't restricted to those kinds of markets .
Springfield , Illinois , reported a 16.2 percent drop in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter , the biggest decline during that time frame , along with a 10.4 percent decline compared to a year earlier .
Still , the trade group statement said it believed that the worst was over for the drop in prices .
" Examination of data within the quarter shows home prices stabilizing toward the end , " said a statement from David Lereah , the NAR 's chief economist .
" When we get the figures for this spring , I expect to see a discernable improvement in both sales and prices . "
Part of the decline in prices was attributable to the drop in sales pace .
Total existing home sales , including single - family and condo , were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.24 million units in the fourth quarter , down 10.1 percent from a 6.94 million - unit level in the fourth quarter of 2005 .
And the slower pace of sales , coupled with investor - buyers from 2005 trying to sell homes and condos they had bought , created a glut of homes on the market , according to other real estate readings , which also fed into the decline in home prices .
NAR President Pat Vredevoogd Combs , a Grand Rapids , Mich. , realtor , admitted the group does n't expect to see a big gain in 2007 statistics .
" Right now , buyers are responding to seller pricing and incentives , and there 's a bit of a pent - up demand as a result of buyer hesitation during the second half of 2006 , " she said in the group 's statement .
" We 're not looking for big changes , but a gradual rise in sales and home prices is projected - that will be good for the overall housing market and related industries . "
She said that since most homeowners stay in a home six years on average , a look at five - year price gains shows most homeowners are doing OK despite the recent weakness .
The median five - year price gain is 41.8 percent , according to the group 's figures .
The nation 's leading homebuilders have all reported declining prices for new homes , which are not captured in this report .
KB Home ( Charts ) reported a net loss of $ 49.6 million , or 64 cents per share , for the fiscal fourth quarter ended Nov. 30 , earlier this week .
Other leading builders reporting weakness in prices include Lennar ( Charts ) , Pulte Home ( Charts ) , Centex ( Charts ) , D.R. Horton ( Charts ) and Toll Brothers ( Charts ) .
The most expensive market in the latest report was San Jose - Sunnyvale - Santa Clara , Calif. , where the median home price $ 760,000 .
That was up $ 20,000 , or 2.7 percent , from a year earlier but down $ 19,000 , or 2.4 percent , from the third quarter and off $ 35,000 , or 4.4 percent , from the second - quarter peak .
The cheapest market was Elmira , N.Y. , where the median price was $ 78,400 .
That was off 0.5 percent from a year earlier and down 16.2 percent from the third quarter , which is when prices there peaked .
Despite the record weakness , there were some markets that showed strong price gains .
The best was Atlantic City , N.J. , where the median price was $ 339,800 , up 25.9 percent compared to a year earlier .

The latest woe for housing
One of my great frustrations with the Mac is the way the maximize button on each window fails to maximize the window .
In a comment , Alex Chamberlain explained why this is n't broken , it 's by design :
This is a textbook example of how Microsoft 's programmers got the original Mac GUI wrong when they copied it for Win 3.1 , and never bothered to fix it : there 's no zoom button on Mac OS windows because it 's unnecessary .
What you 're mistaking for a " maximize " button is actually a " snap window to size of contents " button .
Far more useful and elegant .
Once again , Microsoft has no taste and no clue when it comes to the GUI .
All that money and Gates has never been able to hire a decent human factors person .
In other words , pressing the maximize button should n't maximize the window to the size of your monitor ...
... according to Apple , pressing the maximize button should maximize the window to the size of the content .
This is oddly reminiscent of the recent font smoothing debate , where Apple sided with the designers , and Microsoft sided with the realities of current hardware .
Neither approach is wrong , per se ; it depends what you want to emphasize and which tradeoff you think is more important .
I think the maximization problem is even more ambiguous than font rendering .
With font rendering , the answers are based on objective mathematics : at low DPI you should favor the pixel grid and thus the user ; at higher DPI you have enough pixels to favor the designer and render the font more accurately .
And it 's not an either - or distinction ; the operating system could choose the font rendering strategy opportunistically depending on the capabilities of the display .
Unfortunately , there is no optimal window maximizing strategy .
As you can see in the above screenshot , we end up with a vast expanse of unwanted whitespace when suck.com is maximized to a 1600x1200 monitor .
Excessively long lines are hard to read , which is why most newspapers are formatted into columns .
It 's also why websites with any design chops at all never let text extend the full width of the browser .
I agree in principle that windows should n't be larger than their maximum usable size .
But I also think windows with a fixed layout should n't be resizable in the first place .
This is the subject of an entire sidebar in Neilsen 's latest book , Prioritizing Web Usability .
While the Maximize button tempts many users , they are often poorly served by it .
For example , a 1024 - pixel - wide window will result in overly long lines for text - heavy applications such as web browsing .
The preponderance of maximized windows also makes it difficult for users to understand the multiwindow nature of modern GUIs .
In theory people are supposed to work with overlapping windows but in practice they can't when windows take up the entire screen .
Maximized windows deceive people into thinking of the computer as a full - screen environment rather than one with multiple , simultaneously active areas .
Fortunately , maximized windows will gradually vanish as people get bigger monitors .
With a 2048 - pixel - wide screen , a maximized window is so grotesquely oversized that most users will resize it and work with two or more windows at a time .
Tiled windows may also enjoy a renaissance with huge screens , making it easy to deal with two to four windows simultaneously .
Here 's where I think this argument starts to break down in a big way .
Dealing with multiple windows is far too difficult , even for sophisticated computer users .
Adding Z-order in addition to the traditional X and Y positioning is one variable too many .
I do n't think it 's a coincidence that single window interfaces , such as the web browser , or Tivo , dominate the market .
Microsoft killed off the multiple document interface in Office -- a form of per-application windowing -- years ago .
Can you name one application with a multiple window interface that 's even popular ?
Manipulating windows is pure excise -- extra work that stands between the user and completing their task .
The more windows you have to deal with , the less work you get done , and the more time you spend sizing them , moving them , bringing them to the top , and dragging them around so they are n't overlapping .
That 's one reason I 'm such a fan of double and triple monitor setups ; more desktop space equals fewer overlapping windows , and less time spent futzing around with window layout .
That 's my problem with Apple 's non-maximizing maximize button .
Allowing users to maximize any window to a monitor has its problems , to be sure .
But Apple 's method of forcing users to deal with more windows by preventing maximization is not good user interface design .
It is fundamentally and deeply flawed .
Users do n't want to deal with the mental overhead of juggling multiple windows , and I can't blame them : neither do I .
Designers should be coming up with alternative user interfaces that minimize windowing , instead of forcing enforcing arbitrary window size limits on the user for their own good .
In comments which appear calculated to enrage the Kremlin , and which will further inflame relations between London and Moscow , the multimillionaire claimed he was already bankrolling people close to the president who are conspiring to mount a palace coup .
" We need to use force to change this regime , " he said .
" It is n't possible to change this regime through democratic means .
There can be no change without force , pressure . "
Asked if he was effectively fomenting a revolution , he said : " You are absolutely correct . "
Although Mr Berezovsky , with an estimated fortune of £ 850 m , may have the means to finance such a plot , and although he enjoyed enormous political influence in Russia before being forced into exile , he said he could not provide details to back up his claims because the information was too sensitive .
Last night the Kremlin denounced Mr Berezovsky 's comments as a criminal offence which it believed should undermine his refugee status in the UK .
Dmitry Peskov , the Kremlin 's chief spokesman , said : " In accordance with our legislation [ his remarks are ] being treated as a crime .
It will cause some questions from the British authorities to Mr Berezovsky .
We want to believe that official London will never grant asylum to someone who wants to use force to change the regime in Russia . "
It will not be the first time the British government has faced accusations from the Kremlin that it is providing a safe haven for Mr Berezovsky .
When he told a Moscow radio station last year that he wanted to see Mr Putin overthrown by force , Jack Straw , then foreign secretary , told the Commons that " advocating the violent overthrow of a sovereign state is unacceptable " and warned the tycoon he could be stripped of his refugee status .
Russian authorities subsequently sent an extradition request to London .
That failed , however , when a district judge ruled Mr Berezovsky could not be extradited as long as he has asylum status .
In an interview with the Guardian , however , Mr Berezovsky goes much further than before , claiming to be in close contact with members of Russia 's political elite who , he says , share his view that Mr Putin is damaging Russia by rolling back democratic reforms , smothering opposition , centralising power and flouting the country 's constitution .
" There is no chance of regime change through democratic elections , " he says .
" If one part of the political elite disagrees with another part of the political elite - that is the only way in Russia to change the regime .
I try to move that . "
While declining to describe these contacts - and alleging that they would be murdered if they were identified - he maintained that he was offering his " experience and ideology " to members of the country 's political elite , as well as " my understanding of how it could be done " .
He added : " There are also practical steps which I am doing now , and mostly it is financial . "
Mr Berezovsky said he was unconcerned by any threat to strip him of his refugee status .
" Straw was n't in a position to take that decision .
A judge in court said it was n't in the jurisdiction of Straw . "
He added that there was even less chance of such a decision being taken following the polonium - 210 poisoning last November of his former employee , Alexander Litvinenko .
" Today the reality is different because of the Litvinenko case . "
Mr Berezovsky , 61 , a former mathematician , turned to business during the Yeltsin years and made his fortune by capturing state assets at knockdown prices during Russia 's rush towards privatisation .
Although he played a key role in ensuring Mr Putin 's victory in the 2000 presidential elections , the two men fell out as the newly elected leader successfully wrested control of Russia back from the so - called oligarchy , the small group of tycoons who had come to dominate the country 's economy .
A few months after the election Mr Berezovsky fled Russia , and applied successfully for asylum in the UK after Mr Litvinenko , an officer with the KGB 's successor , the FSB , came forward to say he had been ordered to murder the tycoon .
Mr Berezovsky changed his name to Platon Elenin , Platon being the name of a character in a Russian film based loosely upon his life .
He was subsequently given a British passport in this name .
As well as claiming to be financing and encouraging coup plotters in Moscow , Mr Berezovsky said he had dedicated much of the last six years to " trying to destroy the positive image of Putin " that many in the west held , portraying him whenever possible as a dangerously anti-democratic figure .
He said he had also opposed the Russian president through Kommersant , the influential Russian newspaper which he controlled until last year .
Last month Mr Berezovsky was questioned by two detectives from the Russian prosecutor general 's office who were in London to investigate the death of Mr Litvinenko .
He has denied claims that he refused to answer many of their questions .
Last night the Kremlin said Russian authorities might want to question him again in the light of his interview with the Guardian .
" I now believe our prosecutor general 's office has got lots of questions for Mr Berezovsky , " said Mr Peskov .
He added : " His words are very interesting .
This is a very sensitive issue . "
The Foreign Office said it had nothing to add to Mr Straw 's comments of last year .

JOURNALISTS over the years have assumed they were writing their headlines and articles for two audiences -- fickle readers and nitpicking editors .
Today , there is a third important arbiter of their work : the software programs that scour the Web , analyzing and ranking online news articles on behalf of Internet search engines like Google , Yahoo and MSN .
The search - engine " bots " that crawl the Web are increasingly influential , delivering 30 percent or more of the traffic on some newspaper , magazine or television news Web sites .
And traffic means readers and advertisers , at a time when the mainstream media is desperately trying to make a living on the Web .
So news organizations large and small have begun experimenting with tweaking their Web sites for better search engine results .
But software bots are not your ordinary readers :
They are blazingly fast yet numbingly literal - minded .
There are no algorithms for wit , irony , humor or stylish writing .
The software is a logical , sequential , left - brain reader , while humans are often right brain .
In newspapers and magazines , for example , section titles and headlines are distilled nuggets of human brainwork , tapping context and culture .
" Part of the craft of journalism for more than a century has been to think up clever titles and headlines , and Google comes along and says , ' The heck with that , ' " observed Ed Canale , vice president for strategy and new media at The Sacramento Bee .
Islamist militias control most of southern Somalia
The Union of Islamic Courts wants Kenya 's role as mediator to end , while the government insists it stays .
Fighters from the two sides are now less than 30 km apart , leading to fears of direct clashes .
Observers further fear a regional conflict , as Ethiopia backs the government and its rival Eritrea is accused of backing the Islamists .
Before arriving in Khartoum , the Islamist delegation said they would not take part in the talks unless Ethiopian troops leave Somalia .
It is too early to say the peace conference is collapsing
Francois Fall
UN envoy to Somalia
In order to break the impasse over who chairs the talks , diplomats have suggested Sudan .
While the UIC objects to Kenya , the government accuses the other co-chair , the Arab League , of bias .
UN envoy to Somalia Francois Fall , however , says he remains optimistic .
" It is too early to say the peace conference is collapsing ...
There are a lot problems facing the conference which will gradually be resolved . "
Stand - off
Observers say both sides are preparing for battle .
UIC forces are on the outskirts of Bur Hakaba , a strategic town on the road from Islamist - controlled Mogadishu to the government base in Baidoa .
Pro-government forces , which have twice taken Bur Hakaba recently , remain 22 km outside Baidoa .
Eritrea has previously been accused of arming the Islamists but denies the claims .
The UN report also says there are between 6-8,000 Ethiopian troops , according to AP .
These are the third round of talks the Arab League has organised in Khartoum .
The two sides have previously agreed a ceasefire but the UIC has continued to gain ground .
The UIC has rapidly taken control of most of southern Somalia since seizing the capital , Mogadishu , in June .
The government only controls the territory around Baidoa .
Somalia has been in the grip of warlords and militias for years and has not had a functioning national government since 1991 .

It sounds like the stuff of science fiction , but doctors have made a remarkable medical breakthrough by using magnets outside the body to control surgical instruments inside it .
The experts say they were inspired to devise the revolutionary technique after seeing how teenagers use magnets inside their mouths to hold jewellery studs on their lips without piercings .
The method can significantly reduce the need for surgical incisions , meaning far less scarring and shorter recovery times .
Scroll down for more ...
The technique involves putting tiny instruments and a camera into the body through a single incision or natural opening and then using magnets placed on the patient 's skin to drag them to the right place .
Once in position , the instruments - which are still being developed - will be ordered by a radio signal to carry out whatever task the surgeons wants , such as cutting and cauterising .
They will , however , have to be kept at least an inch apart to avoid more than one being affected by the external magnets at any one time .
The system has been tested on animals with the removal of a kidney from a pig through a hole made in its navel .
Dr Jeffrey Cadeddu , professor of urology and radiology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Centre in Dallas , explained : " Most surgical pain comes from cutting the skin and muscle , since that 's where the nerves are .
Even key - hole surgery can involve several incisions .
If we can eliminate wounds we reduce the pain , which shortens recovery .
Then there is the cosmetic issue - the fewer holes , the prettier it looks . "
Other uses for the technique could include gall bladder surgery , appendix removal and gynaecological procedures .
Human trials are planned for later this year .
A new study has found that adolescents who use condoms the first time they have intercourse do not go on to have more sexual partners than others , and that they have lower rates of sexually transmitted diseases than those who do not use condoms the first time .
Beginning in 1994 , the researchers studied a sample of 4,018 teenagers , all of whom completed three interviews about their sexual behavior over a period of six to eight years .
All had had sexual intercourse by the second year of the study .
Participants were tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea in 2001 or 2002 .

Almost 62 percent of the teenagers used a condom the first time they had sex .
Despite concerns that encouraging condom use leads to promiscuity , those who used condoms and those who did not had an average of five partners .
But those who used a condom at their sexual debut were only half as likely to have a sexually transmitted disease seven years later .
Irwin A. Schiff ( b. 1928 ) is a prominent member of the United States group which refers to itself as the " tax honesty movement " , and which has been referred to by the Internal Revenue Service and other government agencies as the tax protester movement .
Schiff is known for writing and promoting literature that claims the United States income tax is applied incorrectly .
Schiff also has a web site named " PayNoIncomeTax.com " , which offered his various books for sale .
He has lost several civil cases against the federal government and has a record of multiple convictions for various federal tax crimes , including a conviction in 2005 for which he was sentenced in early 2006 .
Schiff is currently serving a 13 - plus year prison term at the Federal Correctional Institution at Fort Dix , New Jersey .
In 1978 Schiff was convicted of willful failure to timely file Federal income tax returns .
Because the admission of a videotape of his appearance on a television talk show in that case was ruled unduly prejudicial , that conviction was overturned , and the case remanded for a new trial .
He was convicted a second time for failure to file , and that conviction was affirmed ( see United States v. Schiff ) .
In 1985 he was convicted of tax evasion and willful failure to file a corporate tax return , and that conviction was also affirmed ( see United States v. Schiff and United States v. Schiff ) .
Despite having spent four years in prison , Schiff continued his tax protest related activities .
In June of 2004 , a Federal court ruled that Schiff was liable for over $ 2 million in taxes , penalties and interest for the years 1979 through 1985 .
In that case , Schiff 's attorney had filed a brief claiming a diminished capacity defense , contending that Schiff had been diagnosed with a chronic , severe delusional disorder relating to his beliefs about the federal income tax system .
This was characterized by some opponents of Schiff 's beliefs as a claim that those beliefs were the product of a delusion , or even insanity , and that Schiff had willingly allowed his defense counsel to raise such an argument .
Schiff himself has responded to these claims , stating that this was an attempt to prevent the Judge from giving a summary judgement and instead allow a jury trial .
Schiff also asserted that this was different from an insanity defense .
( . pdf ) Schiff , in his statement on the matter , asserts that the judge erred in not putting this question to the jury , and insists that " ( 1 ) no one is required to pay income taxes ; ( 2 ) the entire federal judiciary is involved in a monumental , criminal conspiracy to collect income taxes in violation of law . "
On October 24 , 2005 , Schiff was convicted on multiple counts of filing false tax returns , aiding and assisting in the preparation of false tax returns filed by other taxpayers , conspiring to defraud the United States and income tax evasion , and he is again serving jail time ( see below ) .
Although Schiff responded with numerous complaints about the trial process , including a claim that Judge Kent Dawson did not allow Schiff to present evidence at his trial , his appeal was dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on December 9 , 2005 .
One of Schiff 's co-defendants , Lawrence Cohen , was sentenced on February 3 , 2006 to 2 years and 9 months in prison and was ordered to pay $ 480,000 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service .
On February 23 , 2006 , Cynthia Neun ( another co-defendant ) was sentenced to 5 years and 8 months in prison and ordered to pay over $ 1.1 million in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service .
According to the prosecutor 's office , Neun sold materials encouraging people not to pay taxes , prepared false tax returns , and represented hundreds of taxpayers in dealings with the IRS where she promoted Schiff 's arguments .
She will be required to submit to three years of supervision following her release from prison , expected in September of 2010 .
In this last case Schiff 's attorneys again asked that the court consider the claim that Schiff has a mental disorder relating to his beliefs about taxes ( see .pdf link above ) .
Despite Schiff 's age ( approximately 78 years old ) , he was sentenced on February 24 , 2006 to over 13 years in prison , consisting of 12 years and 7 months in prison on the 2005 tax convictions and an additional year for contempt of court .
He was also ordered to pay more than $ 4.2 million in restitution , and to serve three years of supervised release .
According to the prosecutor 's office the evidence at trial showed that Schiff had attempted to evade the payment of over $ 2 million in taxes from 1979 through 1985 , and that he had used offshore bank accounts using multiple tax identification numbers and had attempted to hide assets in connection with his tax protester related activity .
One of the more telling results of his conviction is the state of his former bookstore , " Freedom Books " , which stood at 444 E. Sahara Avenue in Las Vegas , Nevada .
The store had a large sign which boldly read " WHY PAY INCOME TAXES WHEN NO LAW SAYS YOU HAVE TO ? "
The building ( as of May 2006 ) was vacant and for sale .
The sign 's bold message had been covered by brown paint .
Schiff is scheduled for release from prison in October of the year 2016 .

Editor 's note : Lou Dobbs ' commentary appears weekly on CNN.com .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- President Bush is building his legacy , adding another unfortunate line of hollow bravado to his rhetorical repertoire .
To " Mission accomplished , " " Bring it on , " " Wanted : Dead or alive , " and of course , " I earned ... political capital , and now I intend to spend it , " he has added " I 'll see you at the bill signing , " referring to his own ill - considered push for so - called comprehensive immigration reform legislation .
Bush emerged from a midday meeting with Republican senators on Capitol Hill to declare , " We 've got to convince the American people this bill is the best way to enforce our border . "
No , Mr. President , someone you trust and respect must convince you that kind of tortured reasoning should never be exposed before cameras and microphones .
Is n't there anyone in this administration with the guts to say , " Give it a rest , Mr. President " ?
Sen .
Jeff Sessions came close when he said , " He needs to back off . "
This president desperately needs to be reminded that he is the president of all Americans and not just of corporate interests and socio-ethnocentric special interest groups .
In what other country would citizens be treated to the spectacle of the president and the Senate focusing on the desires of 12 million to 20 million people who had crossed the nation 's borders illegally , committed document fraud , and in many cases identity theft , overstayed their visas and demanded , not asked , full forgiveness for their trespasses ?
Illegal aliens and their advocates , both liberal and conservative , possess such an overwhelming sense of entitlement that they demand not only legal status , but also that the government leave the borders wide open so that other illegals could follow as well , while offering not so much as an " I 'm sorry " or a " Thank you . "
This bill would be disastrous public policy and devastate millions of American workers and their families , taxpayers and any semblance of national security .
Yet even in defeat , Sen .
Ted Kennedy , D - Massachusetts , one of the reform bill 's chief architects , declared : " Doing nothing is totally unacceptable . "
Like the senator , Bush says the status quo is unacceptable .
The president and the senator are wrong .
It is the sham legislation they support that is totally unacceptable .
But if Bush and Kennedy sincerely desire resolution to our illegal immigration and border security crises , I 'd like to try to help .
But a word of caution , if I may , to our elected officials : Resolution of these crises will require honesty , directness and an absolute commitment to the national interest and the common good of our citizens .
Here are what I consider to be the essential guiding principles for any substantive reform :
First , fully secure our borders and ports .
Without that security , there can be no control of immigration and , therefore , no meaningful reform of immigration law .
Second , enforce existing immigration laws , and that includes the prosecution of the employers of illegal aliens .
As Sen. Claire McCaskill , D - Missouri , put it , illegal employers are the magnet that draws illegal aliens across our border .
Enforcing the law against illegal employers and illegal aliens at large in the country will mean bolstering , in all respects , the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency .
Third , the government should fund , equip and hire the people necessary to man the Citizenship and Immigration Services .
To do so will ensure that the agency is capable of fully executing and administering lawful immigration into the United States and eliminating the shameful backlog of millions of people who are seeking legal entry into this country .
Those three steps are necessary to the security of the nation and the effective administration and enforcement of existing immigration laws .
Those steps should be considered non-negotiable conditions precedent to any change or reform of existing immigration law .
At the same time , the president and Congress should order exhaustive studies of the economic , social and fiscal effects of the leading proposals to change immigration law , and foremost in their consideration should be the well - being of American workers and their families .
The president and Congress should begin the process of thoughtful reform of our immigration laws .
Public hearings should be held throughout the nation .
The American people should be heard in every region of the country , and fact - finding should be rigorous and thorough .
The process will be time - consuming and demand much of our congressmen and senators , their staffs and relevant executive agencies .
The importance of securing borders and ports and reforming our immigration laws is profound , and that security is fundamental to the future of our nation .
That future can be realized only with a complete commitment to a comprehensive legislative process of absolute transparency and open public forums in which our elected officials hear the voices of the people they represent .
American citizens deserve no less .

YOU are a fisherman off the coast of northern Kerala , a region in the south of India .
Visiting your usual fishing ground , you bring in an unusually good catch of sardines .
That means other fishermen in the area will probably have done well too , so there will be plenty of supply at the local beach market : prices will be low , and you may not even be able to sell your catch .
Should you head for the usual market anyway , or should you go down the coast in the hope that fishermen in that area will not have done so well and your fish will fetch a better price ?
If you make the wrong choice you cannot visit another market because fuel is costly and each market is open for only a couple of hours before dawn — and it takes that long for your boat to putter from one to the next .
Since fish are perishable , any that cannot be sold will have to be dumped into the sea .
This , in a nutshell , was the situation facing Kerala 's fishermen until 1997 .
The result was far from ideal for both fishermen and their customers .
In practice , fishermen chose to stick with their home markets all the time .
This was wasteful because when a particular market is oversupplied , fish are thrown away , even though there may be buyers for them a little farther along the coast .
On average , 5 - 8 % of the total catch was wasted , says Robert Jensen , a development economist at Harvard University who has surveyed the price of sardines at 15 beach markets along Kerala 's coast .
On January 14th 1997 , for example , 11 fishermen at Badagara beach ended up throwing away their catches , yet on that day there were 27 buyers at markets within 15 km ( about nine miles ) who would have bought their fish .
There were also wide variations in the price of sardines along the coast .
But starting in 1997 mobile phones were introduced in Kerala .
Since coverage spread gradually , this provided an ideal way to gauge the effect of mobile phones on the fishermen 's behaviour , the price of fish , and the amount of waste .
For many years , anecdotes have abounded about the ways in which mobile phones promote more efficient markets and encourage economic activity .
One particularly popular tale is that of the fisherman who is able to call several nearby markets from his boat to establish where his catch will fetch the highest price .
Mr Jensen 's paper * adds some numbers to the familiar stories and shows precisely how mobile phones support economic growth .
As phone coverage spread between 1997 and 2000 , fishermen started to buy phones and use them to call coastal markets while still at sea .
( The area of coverage reaches 20 - 25 km off the coast . )
Instead of selling their fish at beach auctions , the fishermen would call around to find the best price .
Dividing the coast into three regions , Mr Jensen found that the proportion of fishermen who ventured beyond their home markets to sell their catches jumped from zero to around 35 % as soon as coverage became available in each region .
At that point , no fish were wasted and the variation in prices fell dramatically .
By the end of the study coverage was available in all three regions .
Waste had been eliminated and the “ law of one price ” — the idea that in an efficient market identical goods should cost the same — had come into effect , in the form of a single rate for sardines along the coast .
This more efficient market benefited everyone .
Fishermen 's profits rose by 8 % on average and consumer prices fell by 4 % on average .
Higher profits meant the phones typically paid for themselves within two months .
And the benefits are enduring , rather than one - off .
All of this , says Mr Jensen , shows the importance of the free flow of information to ensure that markets work efficiently .
“ Information makes markets work , and markets improve welfare , ” he concludes .
Mr Jensen 's work is valuable because studies of the economic effect of mobile phones tend to be macroeconomic .
A well known example is the finding in 2005 by Leonard Waverman , of the London Business School , that an extra 10 mobile phones per 100 people in a typical developing country leads to an additional 0.59 percentage points of growth in GDP per person .
( He recently repeated this earlier study using a more elaborate model and found that an extra 10 percentage points in mobile - phone penetration led to an extra 0.44 percentage points of growth , a difference he says is not statistically significant . )
Calls and effect
One criticism levelled at such studies , says Mr Waverman , is that it is difficult to tell if mobile phones are promoting growth , or growth is promoting the adoption of mobile phones , as people become able to afford them .
It is easy to imagine ways in which mobile phones could stimulate economic activity — they make up for poor infrastructure by substituting for travel , allow price data to be distributed and enable traders to engage with wider markets , and so on .
Mr Waverman uses a variety of statistical tests to try to tease apart cause and effect .
But detailed analyses of micro-market data like Mr Jensen 's , he says , show how phones really do make people better off .
Furthermore , says Mr Jensen , phones do this without the need for government intervention .
Mobile - phone networks are built by private companies , not governments or charities , and are economically self - sustaining .
Mobile operators build and run them because they make a profit doing so , and fishermen , carpenters and porters are willing to pay for the service because it increases their profits .
The resulting welfare gains are indicated by the profitability of both the operators and their customers , he suggests .
All governments have to do is issue licences to operators , establish a clear and transparent regulatory framework and then wait for the phones to work their economic magic .

One month after tens of thousands of PCs in China were disabled by a bug in its Norton antivirus software , Symantec has offered to compensate the owners .
However , the compensation – more copies of the software that caused the problem – has sparked outrage on some online forums .
Symantec yesterday offered affected users a free year of antivirus protection from Norton AntiVirus – the same program that removed critical system files and left their PCs unable to boot up in May , local press reports say .
Furious reaction to offer
The response to the compensation offer on Chinese online forums today has mostly been one of incredulity and anger .
“ They call this compensation !
Who will compensate us for our other losses ? ” , wrote one angry poster on leading news portal , Sina.com ( all links in Chinese ) .
“ This is hard to accept .
Loads of companies have lost all their data , who is going to compensate them for this ? ” asked another
As well as the antivirus software , the compensation deal includes a backup program , Norton Save & Restore 2.0 .
Some users who lost data had been criticized for failing to keep backup copies .
The special website set up by Symantec China to handle compensation claims is currently unavailable , although reporters in China apparently were able to access it earlier .
Dead on the desktop
Reports of the number of PCs put out of action when Symantec 's Norton AntiVirus attacked the machines it was meant to protect varied from thousands to millions .
No solid evidence has been offered that supports the latter figure , which appears to be based on an estimate of the number of PCs that could be running Norton Antivirus in China - the software is often supplied free with new PCs .
The incident began on the morning of May 18 .
A routine update of Norton Antivirus identified two critical Windows files as viruses , and deleted or moved them .
The affected PCs continued operating normally until they were rebooted , whereupon they crashed with the so - called ' blue screen of death ' error message .
The PCs proved impossible to restart .
Some companies were so badly hit - with hundreds of failed PCs - that they are unable to function , local reporters said .
Windows XP mistaken for virus
The buggy update disabled all Simplified Chinese Windows XP PCs that had been patched with Microsoft 's MS06-070 security fix last year .
Symantec issued a new update late the same day that fixed PCs if they had not been rebooted , but it could do nothing to revive those already dead .
The PCs could not be used until the system files were replaced – a complicated operation beyond the knowledge of ordinary users .
Symantec was criticised for being slow to react , slow to discuss compensation , and for initially offering an ' insincere ' apology that some claimed was an attempt to shift the blame to Microsoft .
A week after the incident , Symantec began offering a free bootable CD that could restore most of the injured PCs to health by replacing the missing files .
Legal action taken
Several lawsuits have been filed over the case , with plaintifs seeking sums from hundreds of dollars up to several thousand – Symantec confirmed two of these cases to Computerworld reporter Gregg Keizer , early in June .
According to Chinese press reports , one complainant in Beijing has also tried to file a class action suit , which would demand compensation for all victims , but its not clear if this has been accepted by the court .
Under the license agreement for the AntiVirus software , Symantec is liable only for damages up to the value of the software itself , according to some local press reports .
Texyt has not been able to confirm this or locate this clause on Symantec 's Chinese website .
Incident feeds conspiracy theory
A few imaginative conspiracy theorists in China have suggested that there 's more to the case than meets the eye .
They argue that the centrally - ordered shutdown of masses of PCs was in fact the inadvertent activation of a secret US National Security Agency ( NSA ) backdoor in Microsoft 's Windows .
According to this version of events , for which no evidence has been provided , the hidden code was either a means of spying on China , or a hidden ' logic bomb ' designed to give the US the upper hand in the event of a ' cyberwar ' .
This theory has been widely repeated and reposted on blogs in China during the past few days .
Update June 19 : Symantec has claimed that the compensation claims website seen by journalists was only a test version not intended for public viewing , according to reports in some Chinese publications today .
Update June 25 : Recent reports from China confirm that news of the original compensation offer was accurate .
Symantec now estimates as many as 50,000 PCs were affected .

“ Venture capital in energy has reached a critical mass , ” said Daniel Yergin , the energy historian and consultant .
“ Enough is happening so that significant things will come out of this .
With the same intent to do in energy what they did in biotech , they bring not only money and discipline , but they are results - oriented . ”
One Seattle - based start - up , Prometheus Energy , attracted enough equity capital in the last three years to open a plant in Orange County , Calif. , in January that for the first time produces liquid natural gas commercially out of landfill methane gas that would otherwise waft greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
Another venture capital favorite , Jadoo Power of Folsom , Calif. , has already pioneered portable hydrogen fuel - cell technology for remote satellite phones , critical emergency radio communications and police surveillance , and it is now working on cells for home use to free customers entirely of their utility bills .
“ I can honestly say that for the first time in my life we are seeing the venture capital community put sizable amounts of money into energy , ” Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman said in a speech in Houston last month .
“ This is real money .
They are betting , if you will , that clean , safe , affordable energy represents the new innovation frontier . ”
To this group add LiveFuels , with its improbable company jingle that goes “ from pond to pump . ”
“ If the U.S. put 15 million acres of desert into algae production , we could produce enough volume of liquid fuels to get us off the Middle East oil addiction and give Iowa back to the songbirds , ” said B. Gregory Mitchell , an algae research biologist at the University of California , San Diego , who is a friend of Ms. Morgenthaler - Jones and Mr. Jones .
The company projects that in three years it can produce some biofuel , which theoretically could eventually be produced in quantities of as much as 20,000 gallons of fuel a year per acre of algae .
The road to algae has been far from straight for Mr. Jones , and Ms. Morgenthaler - Jones , who comes from a family of venture capitalists and started her own clean energy venture capital fund in 2004 .
It culminated more than two years of reading and research , tracking down and talking to scientists and attending energy and venture capital gatherings , where Ms. Morgenthaler - Jones has a habit of munching on chocolate - covered strawberries while doodling molecular diagrams of fatty acids during the duller lectures .
Oasis CDs were alleged to be among CD - Wow 's cheap imports
The High Court in London ruled that the site 's owners , Music Trading Online , were " in substantial breach " of a 2004 agreement to stop selling such albums .
Record companies complained that the site broke a deal not to buy cheap CDs in places like Hong Kong and re-sell them in the UK without permission .
CD - Wow said the judgement " spelled disaster for millions of music fans " .
The company will be fined in July after an inquiry into how much it owes the record labels who complained of copyright infringement .
' Warning '
With retail sales of £ 21.7 m in the UK in 2005 , CD - Wow was the third largest online music retailer in the UK after Amazon and Play .
The company denied deliberately breaking its 2004 court undertaking and put any breach of copyright down to human error .
But the High Court rejected their argument .
The music industry trade body , the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) , said the ruling sent a warning to other companies that imported CDs from outside Europe .
" The BPI will be using this judgment to ensure that no other company unfairly undermines legitimate retailers in the UK that are trading successfully and respecting the law , " BPI lawyer Roz Groome said .
' CD woe '
But CD - Wow , which offers albums by acts like Oasis and Robbie Williams for as little as £ 6.99 , condemned Tuesday 's judgement as " CD woe " .
The company said the albums in question were bought legitimitely from the record companies themselves overseas .
" At a time when the record industry is losing vast revenue to piracy , it seems ludicrous that they can set out to destroy a section of the market that is actually making them money , " said founder Henrik Wesslen .
The Hong Kong - based retailer is now calling for a full review of copyright law that it claims " serves to line the pockets of the music industry at the expense of the consumer " .
The unusual frog has been put in its own taxonomic family
Enlarge Image
Scientists have given it the name Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis , from the Sanskrit word for nose ( nasika ) ; batrachus , meaning frog ; and Sahyadri , the name for its mountain home .
Its head appears too small for its body and it looks more like a squat , grumpy blob than a living creature .
But to the scientists who describe it in the journal Nature , the frog is a beautiful find because of what it tells them about Earth history .
" It is an important discovery because it tells us something about the early evolution of advanced frogs that we would not know otherwise because there are no fossil records from this lineage , " says Franky Bossuyt , of Free University of Brussels , Belgium .
Geological pathways
Bossuyt and colleague S D Biju , of the Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute in Kerala , say N. sahyandrensis is related to a family of frogs in the Seychelles called Sooglossidae .
DNA analysis suggests the common ancestor of the animals lived 130 million years ago , when the planet 's landmasses were joined together into a giant supercontinent called Gondwana .
" A once - in - a - century find "
" People have been wondering about the closest relative of Sooglossidae , the ones that live on the Seychelles , " Bossuyt told the Reuters news agency .
" There was a theory that maybe the closest relative was in India and had become extinct .
But now we have found it , and it looks different than expected , " he added .
In a commentary on the research in Nature , Blair Hedges , of Pennsylvania State University , US , has described the discovery of N. sahyandrensis as " a once - in - a - century find " .

Dynamic Languages are coming .
I am a great beliver in the promise of dynamic languages and I am here not just thinking of Lisp but dynamic languages in general including Ruby and Python that are among the ones mentioned in the article .
In fact I am convinced that the next big thing in programming languages ( whenever that will materialise itself ) will be a dynamic language .
Continuing through various links in the article I arrived at two other interesting sites :
Obviously such things should not be overrated in importance ( as the saying goes : there are lies , damn lies and benchmarks / statistics ) but it is quite funny to look for Lisp there and compare to something like Erlang which seems to create quite a buzz , also i Lisp circles .
Erlang actually fares a lot worse ( according to the aforementioned websites ) than I had imagined .
In the Tiobe popularity index , the Lisp and scheme group is currently ranked 17 while Erlang is in the group of rank 51 - 100 .
Even if the entry named " CL " relates to a breakout of Common Lisp from the Lisp / Scheme grouping ( which I do not think judging from the explanations ) , it is still at position 37 and thus before Erlang .
In the all languages shootout SBCL is at ratio 1.9 compared to C where Erlangs best ratio is 4.2 .

It 's a shame that the SBCL program contributed for " recursive " do n't work .
It 's a shame that the SBCL programs contributed for " sumcol " do n't demonstrate built - in line - oriented I/O functions rather than custom - code .
It seems to me that enthusiasts for other programming languages do a better job of using the computer language shootout to promote their favourite language .

NBC : Cheney admits mistake in Iraq , why he ' dropped the F - bomb ' on Leahy David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday July 23 , 2007 Print This Email
This NBC reported Monday on a " revealing new book " about the powerful and secretive Vice President Dick Cheney .
According to NBC , the most striking aspect of the biography is that in it Cheney acknowledges a major error early in the occupation of Iraq , saying , " I think we should have probably gone with the provisional government of Iraqis ... I think the Coalition Provisional Authority was a mistake . "
Barton Gellman of the Washington Post commented in surprise , " He does not talk almost ever about mistakes or courses that might have been .
This is the first time I 've seen him do that on Iraq . "
Cheney also reveals a biting sense of humor in the book , saying of his well - publicized dustup with Patrick Leahy on the floor of the Senate , " Leahy came over and put his arm around me and he did n't kiss me but it was close to it .
So I flashed and I told him -- I dropped the F - bomb on him ... it was heartfelt . "
Stephen Hayes , who in 2004 published a book arguing for a direct connection between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda , appeared sympathetic to his subject and said that despite Cheney 's past errors and misstatements , " as long and he and the president have this channel ... his power is virtually unimpaired . "
Hayes said that secrecy has been a habit of Cheney 's throughout his career , citing an anecdote Cheney told him about a time when he was speaking to the King of Morocco and the king made his translator swear on a silver box holding a copy of the Quran never to reveal their conversation .
" Damn , " said Cheney .
" I need one of those . "
Cheney 's secretive attitudes have not served him well as vice president , acknowledged Hayes , and yet he still actively resists any attempts by his staff to soften his image .
The following video is from NBC's Today Show broadcast on July 23 .

Breakdown of RPG Players
A 2 - Axis Analysis of a Survey
1/26/03 Update :
The only other information released about the survey can be found here .
The exact questions used in the survey have not been released .
Sean says :
In 1999 , WotC had a market research group do an extensive survey of RPG gamers in an attempt to better understand the RPG market .
The questions were of the " rate this topic from 1 , not at all , to 5 , very strongly . "
The results of some of the questions were used to classify the respondents into categories in order to better understand what sort of experiences ( and thus , products ) these gamers were looking for .
WotC released this information publically , although it was not widely circulated outside of RPG game publishers .
Ryan has given me permission to repost his summary of these results , which he orginally posted on one of the forums of Steve Jackson Games ' Pyramid Magazine .
The original results were shared with WotC R&D before being released to the public .
It 's interesting information , and the graph did really work out as described below , with most of the dots clustered into the middle of each quadrant and a smaller cluster in the middle of the graph .
Just be aware that these results are tendencies ; someone whose answers landed them in the " Thinkers " quadrant can still enjoy aspects of the other four quadrants .
It 's a market research study , not a psionic blueprint of the gaming populations .
Much thanks to Ryan for having his team get the ball rolling on this research , and for giving me permission to post it on my site .
The version of the graph presented here is by me .
Imagine two axes .
The horizontal axis is Strategic Focused to Tactical Focused .
" Strategic " means " a perspective larger than the immediate future and surroundings " .
" Tactical " means " a perspective limited to the immediate future and the immediate surroundings . "
" Invade the Normandy beaches on D - Day " is Strategic .
" Take out that bunker before the machine gun kills us all ! " is Tactical .
The vertical axis is Combat Focused to Story Focused .
" Combat Focused " means " Conflict resolution is interesting to me . "
" Story Focused " means " The world and the interaction of the characters is intersting to me . "
" Kick this door down and kill anything that moves " is Combat focused .
" This door has the Mark of Malvena ; the space within should be safe for us to rest in " is Story focused .
This creates four quadrents .
Starting in the upper left and moving clockwise , label these quadrents Thinkers , Power Gamers , Character Actors , and Storytellers
A Thinker is a player who most enjoys the game when it delivers Strategic / Combat Focus .
This kind of person is likely to enjoy min-maxing a character , spending hours out of game to find every conceivable advantage available in the system to deliver maximum damage from behind maximum protection , even if the min-maxing produces results that are seemingly illogical / impossible .
This kind of person wants to solve puzzles and can keep track of long chains of facts and clues .

A Power Gamer is a player who most enjoys the game when it delivers a Tactical / Combat Focus .
This kind of person is likely to enjoy playing a character that has a minimum of personality ( often , this kind of person plays a character that is simply an extension of the player ) .
This kind of player enjoys short , intense gaming experiences .
The consequences of a failed action are minimized for this player , who will roll up a new character and return to the fray without much thought for the storyline implications of that action .

A Character Actor is a player who most enjoys the game when it delivers a Tactical / Story Focus .
This kind of person is likely to enjoy the act of theater ; using voice , posture , props , etc. to express a character 's actions and dialog .
This player will have a character that makes sub-optimal choices ( from an external perspective ) to ensure that the character 's actions are " correct " from the perspective of the character 's motivations , ethics , and knowledge .

A Storyteller is a player who most enjoys the game when it delivers a Strategic / Story Focus .
This kind of person finds enjoyment from the logical progression of the narrative of the scenario .
There should be a beginning , a middle and an end .
Characters should develop over time in reaction to their experiences .
This player will look for a non-rules answer to inconsistencies or anachronisms in the game experience .

This player will look for a non-rules answer to inconsistencies or anachronisms in the game experience .
There is a fifth type of player , who does not express a preference along any of the four axis .
This person is a " basic roleplayer " , who finds enjoyment from strategy , tactics , combat and story in rough equilibrium .
We generated this data by asking a series of questions during the Market Research study in 1999 to create what is called a " segmentation " of the players .
The questions were not designed to find these four quadrents ; they correleate to all kinds of player interest and behavior .
The original survey had several hundred questions , but only about two dozen have a bearing on the segmentation results .
Once the study was complete , the data was plotted in several dimensions to look for clusters of responses ; those clusters became the five player types .
Once we know the segmentation was there , we reverse - engineered the axes , by comparing the responses of the people in each segment to find similarities .
What we do n't know ( and wo n't for several years ) is if people 's play preferences change over time .
What we do know is that the age distribution across the five segements was undifferentiated ( meaning there were people of all ages in each group ) , and the number of years a person had been playing RPGs had no effect either ( meaning that people do n't seem to migrate to a segment based on their depth of experience ) .
We also found no additional segmentation based on what games people identified as their " favorite " ; in other words , there are just as many Power Gamers as there are Storytellers who like Vampire , and just as many Thinkers as Character Acters who like D&D .
All of the people who indicated a strong interest in RPGs identified eight " core values " that they look for in the RPG experience .
These 8 core values are more important than the segments ; that is , if these 8 things are n't present in the play experience it wo n't matter if the game generally supports a given segment 's interests - the players will find the experience dissatisfying .
These 8 core values are :
Strong Characters and Exciting Story
Role Playing
Complexity Increases over Time
Requires Strategic Thinking
Competitive
Add on sets / New versions available
Uses imagination
Mentally challenging
In other words , even the players who enjoy a " Tactical Focus " still want to be challenged to use Strategic Thinking ; likewise , even the Combat Focus player wants a Strong Character and Exciting Story .
A person who segments into a " Tactical Focus " segment , when compared to the population as a whole is likely to be perceived as someone who enjoys Strategy ; only when compared to the population of people who enjoy RPGs is the difference visible between the hard - core strategic players and the slightly less hard - core tactical players .
Similarly , people who play RPGs do n't want to just play DOOM .
The most hard - core fan of melee combat still wants to fight opponents that are meaningful and wants his or her character to act in a way proscribed by the archetypes of the genre or property being simulated .
I have used the analogy of fans of " the color blue " to discuss this effect .
To the general population , blue is just blue .
But to a true fan , there are many shades of blue , each with its own unique properties .
RPG gamers have more in common with each other than they do with non-RPG gamers , but within their own community , there are noticable differences that can be categorized .
We think that there is data to support the idea that people who enjoy being GM / DMs tend to cluster into the Storyteller segment .
Interestingly , based on our own internal profiling of the staff , there 's some data to support the idea that good game designers tend to cluster into the " Thinker " segment .
In other words , good DMs do n't make the best game designers , and vice versa .
As with all things though , there will be exceptions and special cases .
We also have data that suggests that most groups are made up of people who segment differently ( that is , monolithic segmentation within a gaming group is rare ) , and in fact , having different kinds of players tends to make the RPG experience work better over the long haul .
Eventually , we would like to bring some of this technology to the gaming table , to allow GM / DMs to profile their players and then customize a scenario to ensure that each player is getting support for the style of play they most enjoy , and that if a segment is missing from the table , content can be removed or changed to avoid having the adventure " bog down " when nobody has the interest / intellectual tools to cope with a problem targeting an unrepresented segment .
Unlike some of the discussions which rage from time to time about the nature of game design paradigms , the above information was extracted from general market research data that had as much bias as possible removed .
It reflects deep seated psychological aspects of the gamer mind and tells us some very interesting things about how we can make our products more interesting to our target consumers .
