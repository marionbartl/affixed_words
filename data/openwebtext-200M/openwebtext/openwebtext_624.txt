As AT&T disclosed at the Federal Communications Commission 's summer hearing on network management practices at Carnegie Mellon University , it was rewriting its broadband service terms of service .
The telco submitted them to the FCC on Thursday , and it looks like speed throttling is on the menu .
" In order to provide a consistently high - quality video service , AT&T U- verse High Speed Internet throughput speeds may be temporarily reduced when a customer is using other U - verse services in a manner that requires high bandwidth , " the new language will warn .
" This could occur more often with higher speed Internet access products .
It may be necessary , for some AT&T High Speed Internet users , for AT&T to set a maximum downstream speed on a customer line to enhance the reliability and consistency of performance . "
The disclosure concedes that these changes " will prevent some customers from obtaining the maximum downstream speed capability , " but the overall speed will not be reduced from the tier that the customer purchased , promises AT&T .
U - verse offers video , phone , and broadband services in a single package , all delivered over a phone line and powered by a fiber - to - the node system .
AT&T says these new conditions will go into effect starting October 18 .
The company 's current terms of service for U - verse broadband mentions that throughput speeds " may be limited at AT&T 's sole discretion , and such limitation will have no effect on whether the minimum speed is met . "
The telco 's present contract terms for DSL say that " AT&T reserves the right to monitor or change your current plan speed at any time .
No minimum level of speed is guaranteed . "
This new agreement language takes a stab at explaining under what circumstances a customer 's bit rate could be throttled , albeit a pretty general stab , the sort of stab that might be aimed at the heart and land instead on the big toe .
At least Comcast 's new bandwidth cap policy sets a specific ceiling , 250GB , with a set of examples of how much data a customer would have to move to run afoul of the policy — 20,000 high - res photos , 40 million e-mails , or 8,000 movie trailers .
Attack of the bloggers
Not surprisingly , blogging about this latest development has been quite brisk over the last few days .
" Get ready to have your connection squeezed to a trickle , " warns Gizmodo .
Public Knowledge 's Mehan Jayasuriya suggests that the point of this new policy may be to get consumers to focus more on U - verse 's TV services , in which AT&T has invested heavily .
" If your Internet connection is slowed to a crawl , you 're probably a lot more likely to put down the mouse and pick up the remote , which means more potential money in the bank for AT&T , " he writes .
Ars contacted AT&T and was told by company spokesperson Brad Mays that the firm has no intention of " squeezing " its U - verse customers .
" It 's more a matter of the way data comes into and travels around a home , " Mays said .
" There are things ( use of PCs , video , etc. ) that can impact the throughput speed a customer gets .
We are not doing anything to degrade the speed , it ’s just a fact of the way data travels . "
The telco will start sending out customer notices this week , AT&T says .
Customer e-mails will announce that AT&T has " added new language to the service description to more clearly describe how we provide your high speed Internet connection , and to explain what factors can affect the performance of your high speed Internet service . "
AT&T's Vice President James W. Cicconi promises in the FCC letter that the company " will provide clear information about the capabilities of our service and any meaningful limitations on the service . "
We 'll see whether the Commissioners , especially FCC Chair Kevin Martin , concur with the broadband giant 's new standard for clarity .

New Mexico Drunk Driver Runs Himself
Over
It was an unusual ending to an all too common occurrence in New Mexico .
A drunk driver was being chased by police near Cochiti , New Mexico when he got out of his vehicle thinking it was in park .
However , the driver was drunk and anaware that the vehicle was in reverse and not park .
As a result , the police chase ended when the drunk driver ran over … himself .
Remarkably , the driver sustained only minor injuries and was treated in Santa Fe .
The chase itself will no doubt be played on late nite cable television shows based on outrageous polcie chases .

I agree with Joe Biden .
Biden said : " It 's time to be patriotic ... time to jump in , time to be part of the deal , time to help get America out of the rut . "
Tax cuts in a time of war , or a time of massive financial crisis , are unpatriotic .
But not just tax cuts for the rich .
This should flow logically from rightwing positions as well as from " kitchen table " common sense that you can't spend more than you make .
As I wrote in 2005 :
" In times of war when the military needs every cent for armor , bullets and bandages , it is verging on treasonous to avoid paying taxes even if the methods used are ostensibly legal .
It certainly is n't supporting the troops or the war on terror . "
That was the point about the " Good War ' , WW2 .
Everyone shared the fiscal burden .
Either a war is worth that commitment or it is n't , and rightwingers have consistently argued that the War on Some Terror is a generational war just as vital as WW2 .
Bush in 2005 said it :
World War II generation endured great suffering and sacrifice because they understood that defeating tyranny in Europe and Asia was essential to the security and freedom of America .
Like previous wars we have waged to protect our freedom , the war on terror requires great sacrifice from Americans .
So , here 's the sacrifice .
Put your money where your mouths are and make it .
Similiarly , the financial crisis is going to add 1 to 2 trillion dollars to a national debt which , at $ 9.6 trillion , is already more by six or seven trillion than the federal government takes in every year and which has been ballooned to pay for those wars - for which few have made any kind of sacrifice .
I do n't care what 's being said on the stump - tax cuts are a pipedream of fiscal irresponsibility and there is n't enough pork in the budget to cover the coming bill , by a factor of 100 .
Thank you , the Bush administration and Republican politicians , for those woes - by pushing dumb lending decisions by mandate while at the same time encouraging an utter lack of oversight of get - rich - quick exploiters .
Thank you , flip - flopper McCain , who has always been an enemy of oversight for the financial markets ( right up until yesterday ) .
Thank you , in particular , Phil Gramm - John McCain 's adviser .
Do Republicans intend shouldering collective responsibility for the debt and making a sacrifice - paying more taxes - or do they intend to shove their responsibility for payment off onto their grandchildren ?
Apparently the latter .
Ed Morrissey today tells his readers " America ’s economic woes have nothing to do with taxes . "
Well , Ed , they do if the country wants to ever recover from those woes .
Be honest enough to say so .
The final word comes from Melissa McEwan , explaining how progressives should push back hard against the Right on this .
Oliver Wendell Holmes once said : " I like paying taxes .
With them I buy civilization . "
And I 've always thought the Democrats should use that , should connect , at every opportunity , paying taxes and buying civilization .
Every time some bloviating nitwit conservative goes on about how the government never gave him nuttin ' , the Democrats should say : " Oh , you 've never used roads ?
Never mailed anything ?
Never logged on to the internet ? "
And every time the Republicans talk about the Democrats wanting to raise taxes , the Dems should retort : " Yes , we want to raise taxes on those who can afford it , because with taxes , we buy civilization .
We build schools and bridges and freaking spaceships .
You got a problem with that ? "
Indeed .

ABOUT THAT BALANCED - BUDGET PROMISE … .
The notion that John McCain can inherit a half - trillion dollar deficit , cut taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars , respond to a massive financial crisis , keep two wars going , and eliminate the entire budget shortfall in four years is utterly ridiculous .
This week , the McCain campaign walked the senator ’s promise back a bit .
The financial crisis has “ thrown a wrench ” in the plan of U.S. Republican presidential candidate John McCain to balance the budget in his first term , his economic adviser Doug Holtz - Eakin said on Monday .
McCain has pledged to reduce government spending and balance the federal budget by 2013 and has insisted that the current financial crisis will not alter his campaign promises .
“ The events of the past few months have completely thrown a wrench into that , there ’s no way round it .
He would still like to balance it .
It ’s going to be harder , take longer , ” said Holtz - Eakin at a debate with his Democratic counterpart at Columbia University in New York .
I think the word the kids use is “ duh . ”
Of course it ’s going to be “ harder ” and will “ take longer ” to balance the biggest deficits in American history .
What bugs me , though , is the constant claims to the contrary .
McCain and aides started the campaign vowing to balance the budget in four years .
Then they changed their mind , and said McCain would n’t balance the budget in four years .
Then they changed their mind again , and said McCain would .
A week later they changed their mind again , and said McCain would n’t .
At the third presidential debate , McCain changed his mind again , and said he would .
Less than a week later , they ’ve changed their mind yet again , and said he would n’t .
So , for those keeping score at home , McCain does , does n’t , does , does n’t , does , and does n’t promise voters to eliminate the deficit by 2013 .
Remember when McCain considered his straight - talking consistency one of his selling points ?
You would n’t think that a shot of what looks like your typical Bailey ’s drink is actually called Screaming Orgasm .
You ...
The results do n’t surprise me .
At all .
I ’m not quite sure what people expect performance wise of American 3G networks , but from experience , my expectations have been and still low .
3G works well in large metro cities , since a lot of cell towers are situated closer , so losing signal is less likely .
If I lived in a rural area , there is no way I would invest in 3g — especially on AT and T .
I did a 2g vs 3g write up back in June .
98 % of the post is still relevant ( Since Android was n’t out yet and Firefox ’s new mobile browser just launched , so they ’re not included )
If you ’re interested , I pasted the blog after the jump .
If you have any questions , please feel free to ask in the comments . :)
Browsing and 2g vs 3g
1 . Do you surf like me ?
Email + FaceBook + MySpace ( sometimes ) + IMing + Twitter + FriendFeed + tumblr ..
I ’m a SNS ’er ( Social Network - er ) so a trillion katrillion nanoseconds faster * does n’t matter to me .
It ’s no secret the iPhone has the best mobile browsing experience , I mean IMO there is no other mobile browser better than Safari .
Trust me , I ’ve tried them all .
From Opera on BlackBerry to Treo , Minimo ( Firefox ’s mobile browser ) , to WinMo IE … seriously .
Mobile Safari wins HANDS DOWN .
The only downfall is no flash or JavaScript support .
… but who needs flash enabled on phones anyway since 1 .
i have no need for flash except YouTube … which is already built into the iPhone and 2 .
in this day and age everybody and their mother ’s offer free Wi-Fi .
Just hook up to the internet with your laptop or Wi -Fi enabled phone .
But not supporting Java is kind of ‘ ouch ’ for I am extremely dependent on my Gmail , and Google has a Gmail widget that ’s well … you guessed it , in Java .
Aside from Gmail , background / multiprocessing is one thing the iPhone does NOT do .
It would n’t be THAT big of a pain if the push system on the iPhone did n’t suck .
It takes forever for notifications for new emails to pop up and I find myself manually checking for email . :|
Yes , it ’s a pain …
2. 3g iPhone = 300 hours of standby battery life
See .
This probes a HUGE problem for me since I do n’t buy into rhetoric and did my research … well googling .
Even if the phone DOES have 300hours of standby , 3g drains battery life FAR more than 2g **
So unless I plan to carry my charger ( which is not a good idea since I always lose stuff ) OR invest in an extended battery ( which is an extra 100ish dollars since I ’d have to get one from Japan cuz all the ones available here are utterly useless ) the 3g iPhone ’s battery life being 300 hrs ( standby ) as a selling point is plain and simply LAME .
3. 3g and AT&T
First of all , AT&T is jacking up their pricing plan .
FAIL
Second of all , wi-fi is FAR superior than ANY mobile internet network ….
unless I ’m abroad .
The speed is SOOOO super duper ultra slow , I ’m HARDLY on EDGE unless I utterly need to be .
And even if Apple says it ’s 2.4 x faster , I still think Wi - Fi ’d beat it hands down .
With all the free hot spots available , why would I pay extra ?
Double FAIL Plus !
AT&T ’s customer service is closed on the weekends .
W T F . That makes NO sense to me .
At all .
Those bastards think they ’re all that and a bag of chips just cuz they won the iPhone contract .
ugh !!!
….btw this is getting too long so I ’m going to break it up .
I still have a lot more ranting issues I ’d like to address ;)
* in actuality it ’s 2.4 x faster .
Jobs demo ’d DL’ing a large file at WWDC 08 .
On Apple ’s site here but a difference of 48 seconds vs 20 seconds on a PHONE does n’t mean jack shit to me

As a Wall Street guy I am sort of glad that this bailout is being organized .
However , what seems unfair to me is that there are absolutely no provisions for homeowners .
Moreover , this morning on Stephanopulous I saw Hank Paulson talking about homeowners taking out mortgages that were higher than they could afford and about them needing to live up to their obligations .
I find it incredible that he would use language like that while asking taxpayers to send a trillion dollars to Wall Street because investment banks made irresponsible investments and are n’t able to live up to their obligations .
In any loan transaction there are at least two parties .
If I give my unemployed and uneducated brother - in - law a half a million dollar loan would n’t I be just as irresponsible giving it as he is taking it ?
Moreover , a large majority of borrowers did not have financial training to be able to understand complex mortgage terms and risks of the underlying investments .
Investment banks have armies of Ph Ds working for them that helps them analyze market risks and credit exposure .
They got it wrong too !
It strikes me as strange that unsophisticated borrowers are being held to much higher standard than ultra-sophisticated bankers .
A large number of Americans question what happened that day
It was n't only the Twin Towers that collapsed on September 11 .
A third World Trade Center tower that was n't hit by the planes also fell .
As a report into Tower 7 prepares to publish its findings , Mike Rudin considers how this conspiracy theory got to be so big .
9/11 is the conspiracy theory of the internet age .
Put " 9/11 conspiracy " into Google and you get 7.9 million hits .
Put in " 9/11 truth " and you get more than 22 million .
Opinion polls in the US have picked up widespread doubts among the American people .
A New York Times / CBS
News poll in 2006 found that 53 % of those questioned thought the Bush administration was hiding something .
Another US poll found a third of those questioned thought government officials either assisted in the 9/11 attacks or allowed them to happen .
In the UK a survey by the BBC's The Conspiracy Files , carried out by GfkNOP in 2006 , found that 16 % of those questioned thought there was a " wider conspiracy that included the American government " .
For very good reason a lot of people are very suspicious about what went down that day
Dylan Avery
Director of Loose Change
The BBC and the ' missing ' tape
This summer will be a key moment for those who question the official explanation of what happened on 9/11 , the self - styled " 9/11 truth movement " .
Nearly seven years after the terrible events of that September day , the US authorities are due to publish the final report on a third tower that also collapsed on 9/11 .
Unlike the Twin Towers , this 47 - storey , 610 - foot skyscraper was not hit by a plane .
And Tower 7 has become a key issue for " truthers " like Dylan Avery , the director of the internet film about 9/11 called Loose Change .
" The truth movement is heavily centred on Building 7 and for very good reason a lot of people are very suspicious about what went down that day , " he says .
See World Trade Center 7's location
Avery points out that Tower 7 housed some unusual tenants : the CIA , the Secret Service , the Pentagon and the very agency meant to deal with disasters or terrorist attacks in New York - the Office of Emergency Management .
And some people think Tower 7 was the place where a 9/11 conspiracy was hatched .

The Conspiracy Files : 9/11 - The Third Tower is on BBC Two on Sunday 6 July at 2100 BST Visit The Conspiracy Files website
The official explanation is that ordinary fires were the main reason for the collapse of Tower 7 .
That makes this the first and only tall skyscraper in the world to have collapsed because of fire .
Yet despite that all the thousands of tonnes of steel from the building were carted away and melted down .
The way official bodies have investigated Tower 7 at the World Trade Center has made some people think they 're hiding something .
Its destruction was never mentioned in the 9/11 Commission Report .
An inquiry by the Federal Emergency Management Agency said the building collapsed because intense fires had burned for hours , fed by thousands of gallons of diesel stored in the building for emergency generators .
But its report said this had " only a low probability of occurrence " and more work was needed .
That was in May 2002 .

The task has now fallen to the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) based at a sprawling campus near Washington DC .
For more than two - and - a - half years , scientists there have been studying Tower 7 .
Inevitably the officials have been criticised for being slow and even of being frightened to publish .
But the lead investigator at NIST , who heads up their World Trade Center inquiry , Dr Shyam Sunder , says that two - and - a - half years is typically how long an aeroplane crash investigation takes .
He added that only in the last few years did they begin to hear criticism from the " truth " movement .
" It 's only at the very end in 2005 that this group became more vocal and we found them coming to some of our meetings .
But for a long time they were not even present .
It was n't the delay that really caused them , they just woke up one morning and decided to take this on as an issue . "
Soul searching
In April 2005 , the first thousand DVDs of Dylan Avery 's Loose Change movie were pressed .
It cost just $ 2,000 to make .
It was a critical moment for the development of the movement .
The makers of Loose Change claim it has now been viewed by more than a hundred million people .
Steven Jones , a former physics professor at Brigham Young University , who has become the leading academic voice in the movement , first watched a video of the collapse of Tower 7 in the spring of 2005 .
But when he did , he said he was taken aback as a physicist .
Will the theories ever be laid to rest ?
The American architect Richard Gage 's conversion came in 2006 when driving along he heard an independent radio station interviewing the theologian David Ray Griffin .
" I had to do some real soul searching and some research .
And the more I discovered the more disturbed I became and realized I was looking for ... the architects and the engineers . "
Finding that they had n't really entered the fray by then , Gage decided he had to act .
" It just came to me , I had to start an organization Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth . "
The fifth anniversary of 9/11 was a huge moment for " truthers " .
Under the media spotlight protests intensified , websites were spawned and internet films proliferated .
With the publicity also came the " debunkers " , challenging the " truthers " at every stage .
After Loose Change came a website called Screw Loose Change .
And internet film 9/11 Mysteries was followed by Screw 9/11 Mysteries .
Conspiracy splits
And the " truthers " have fought back .
When the US technology magazine Popular Mechanics launched a book called Debunking 9/11 Myths , it was countered with a book by David Ray Griffin called Debunking 9/11 Debunking .
Over time the scale of the alleged conspiracy has grown and grown , encompassing not just sections of the Bush administration , intelligence , but also the fire service , the police , first responders , official investigators , experts , the building 's owner , and the media , and , oh yes , even the BBC .
George Bush is hiding something , says the 9/11 truth movement
And over time schisms have opened up in the 9/11 " truth " movement .
So - called " no- planers " believe that commercial aeroplanes did not actually crash into the Twin Towers , the Pentagon or a field in Pennsylvania .
Some have suggested lasers from outer space were used .
" Planers " believe aeroplanes were used but argue that only controlled demolitions can explain the collapses of the World Trade Center towers .
Then there are the LIHOPs and MIHOPs .
Most " truthers " are MIHOPs - they think the government Made It Happen On Purpose , planning and orchestrating the 9/11 attacks .
But LIHOPs believe the government just Let It Happen On Purpose , to allow them to justify wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and a clampdown on civil liberties .
Into this febrile atmosphere comes the final official report on 9/11 .
This summer we will find out whether NIST 's report has answered the many questions that have been raised , or whether it will suffer the same fate as the Warren Commission on the assassination of President John F Kennedy and merely add fuel to the conspiracy theories .
Return to link Below is a selection of your comments .
Once again lines are being drawn by the use of language in this article .
It seems any active questioning of events or suggestions of more feasible explanations are lumped into the category of ' conspiracy theory . '
This language unjustly places people into separate camps - those who accept the official story and those who do not .
If there are incongruous facts presented to explain these important historical events then we all must question them surely ?
Does that make us conspiracy theorists ?
In my opinion this label is too convenient and distracts from any real discourse .
I do on the other hand appreciate the presentation of some of the aforementioned incongruous facts relating to Tower 7 .

You wrote : " The official explanation is that ordinary fires were the main reason for the collapse of Tower 7 .

What you wrote is blatantly untrue , and symptomatic of the problem .
The building , while not hit by a plane , was severely damaged by the collapse of the twin towers .
There is plenty of photographic evidence of this , but then most conspiracy theorists , like yourselves , obviously have n't looked .
Greg Heywood , Wellingborough I do n't think the US govt .
is any cleverer than the British one , which can't manage to put in place simple workable systems for taxes , student loans , child support agency , NHS , National Insurance , etc .
What makes anyone think they could actually manage a big , unwieldy , secret conspiracy like the one there 'd have needed to be for 9/11 ?
Come on , folks - what happened , happened .
Simple as that .
Joan Bee , England
Your article does n't mention the context in which the BBC is accused of being part of the cover - up .
Is this the issue of the BBC reporting that building 7 had been destroyed due to fire damage before the building had actually collapsed ?
Then claiming that the tapes from this time ' were missing ' , refusing to reveal the source of this information or explain how they knew the building was going to collapse before it did ?
I 'm not a conspiracy theorist , I have n't written my own solution to unanswered questions .
I ( like many others ) just want to know the truth .
Richard , Birmingham
One has to consider the chain of command were this a government - sponsored act .
The sheer number of complicit parties needed would make this impossible without someone having been taken over by the enormity of it and blown the whistle .
Conspiracies of silence and lone voices being polished off by the secret services only happpen in Hollywood movies , folks .
I guess some people must really struggle to tell the difference between films and real life .
I 'm utterly convinced that 9/11 was a tragic day for mankind in which thousands of peple lost their lives because of an audacious and fortuitous terrorist attack , perpetrated by a well - prepared a committed small group .

A woman wearing a T - shirt promoting lesbianism said she was forced the leave a federal building Monday by a security guard who did n’t approve of her attire .
Lapriss Gilbert said she was picking up a Social Security card for her son when the guard was offended by her “ lesbian.com ” shirt and threatened her with arrest .
She was eventually allowed inside after her mother called police , according to a Los Angeles Daily News story .
The guard , whose name was not immediately available , works for Paragon Security , which contracts with the Department of Homeland Security .
Lori Haley , a spokeswoman within the Homeland Security Department , said the guard ’s actions were inappropriate and unacceptable .
“ We have notified his company , Paragon , of our position in the matter , ” Haley said .
A message left with Paragon Security was not immediately returned Monday night .
Gilbert said the guard cited a document , the Rules and Regulations Governing Conduct on Federal Property , as proof he had jurisdiction over her clothing .
The document does not address what type of clothing is allowed in federal buildings .
Gilbert called the guard ’s actions “ shocking . ”
“ As an African - American and a lesbian , I have n’t been through one day without facing some sort of discrimination , ” Gilbert said .
Her mother called police after Gilbert was kicked out , but another security guard escorted her to the front of the Social Security line before officers arrived , the Daily News reported .
According to a police report , a witness described Gilbert as “ peaceful and quiet ” before the guard told her to leave .
A recent Nielsen report listed tobacco , carbonated drinks and eggs as especially vulnerable to recession , and candy , beer and pasta sauce as recession - proof .
On Thursday , Hershey ’s announced third - quarter sales and income higher than last year’s .
( “ We offer a tremendous variety of affordable indulgences , and people love chocolate , even in hard times , ” said Kirk Saville , a company spokesman . )
Almost anything can be an economic indicator .
Back in the 1920s , the economist George Taylor conceived the hemline index , finding that skirts got longer as the economy slowed .
These days , there ’s been talk of a haircut index , with short locks signaling a market drop .
The economic downturn could signal significant changes in American life .
“ A stunning statistic is that unlike in past epochs , the higher up the income ladder you go , the more hours you work , ” said Dalton Conley , a sociology professor at New York University .
“ More and more , things that used to be outside the marketplace are in the economy .
Instead of mom or dad coming home with groceries , they go out , or order in . ”
A downturn , then , could result in benefits unmeasured by the market .
“ If people eat out less , the G.D.P. goes down , ” Mr. Conley said , “ but nothing in the G.D.P. captures what you gain if you cook and eat in a leisurely way with your kids . ”
In a study of coffee growers in Colombia , Grant Miller , who teaches health policy at Stanford ’s medical school , found that infant and child mortality rates fell as coffee prices slumped , and concluded that it was because parents had more time to take care of their children .
By most accounts , bad times herald an upturn in at least some crime .
“ I ’ve never been able to find any relationship between violent crime and the economy , ” said Stephen Raphael , an economics professor in the School of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in urban and labor economics .
“ But there is a relationship with property crime .
Whether it ’s burglary , larceny or motor vehicle theft , they all go up with unemployment . ”
And already , the market drop has created many personal crises .
“ We ’ve never had this level of call volume ” said Dr. Richard A. Chaifetz , chief executive of ComPsych , the largest provider of employee assistance programs , covering 27 million people .
“ It ’s been going up gradually all year , but then it spiked and we ’re up 20 , 30 percent since late July .
And where relationships and personal psychology issues used to the be the No. 1 reason people called , it ’s now financial and legal issues that are No. 1 . ”

A week or two ago , AlterNet ran my recent detailed Q&A with Ohio Sec. of State Jennifer Brunner , on a wide variety of issues related to the upcoming election .
There were a few more technical / geek - ish items that I did n't include in the version that ran over there , thinking they were more appropriate for the real tech and election integrity geeks ( like me ) out there .
Those issues are now published in a much shorter Q&A running today at ComputerWorld .
In these previously unpublished exchanges , posted to CW this morning , Brunner offers some insider detail about her recent lawsuit against Diebold / Premier , concerning the revelation that their tabulators simply drop thousands of votes without notice ; the depth of her surprise at the results of her landmark " EVEREST " security tests of Ohio 's e-voting machines ; and what may lie beyond e-voting , such as the possibility of hand - counting in Ohio .
Please read the new interview at ComputerWorld ( and do n't forget to check out some of the interesting comments that have been posted to it already today . )
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks staged a huge turnaround Friday morning , with the Dow erasing most of a 700 - point slide as fears of a global recession were countered by a willingness of some traders to step in at five - year lows .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) was down 40 points in the early going after having fallen nearly 700 points .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index was down modestly and the Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) rose .
U.S. markets took a beating Thursday , with the Dow industrials plunging nearly 700 points to a five - year low , as panicked investors dumped stocks .
On Friday , General Electric ( GE , Fortune 500 ) reported third - quarter financial results that were in line with estimates .
The company posted a 10 % drop in earnings from continuing operations and an 11 % gain in revenue , meeting analyst expectations .
The company is considered a stock market bellwether , so its financial results are closely watched .
The company had previously lowered its guidance , citing the financial crisis .
GE reaffirmed that outlook and also said its financial services arm , which has been hard hit by the crisis , reported a 30 % drop in profit that met forecasts .
GE shares rose 1 % Friday morning .
Investors have been pulling money out of stock mutual funds as the crisis has deepened .
A full $ 43.3 billion was taken out during the week ended Oct.
8 . That 's on top of the $ 7.2 billion investors hoarded during the previous week .
President Bush is slated to speak about the economy shortly after 10 a.m. ET , hoping to calm panicked investors .
Also , finance officials from the Group of Seven industrialized nations are meeting in Washington Friday to address the financial meltdown .
Economic news :
Two government economic reports came out Friday morning .
The Commerce Department reported that the U.S. trade deficit , which measures the difference between the nation 's output and demand , declined in August to $ 59.1 billion .
The trade gap was smaller than in July , when the deficit was revised to $ 61.3 billion .
The deficit in August was slightly larger than the $ 59 billion that economists polled by Briefing.com had forecast .
The Labor Department reported that its Import Price Index decreased 3 % in September , led by a decrease in petroleum prices .
In addition , prices for overall exports decreased 1.0 % for the month .
Oil and the dollar : Crude prices , which have been under pressure amid fears over weakening demand , was down $ 3.66 to $ 82.93 and had tumbled as much as $ 7.98 a barrel to $ 78.61 .
Worries that the global crisis will undercut world demand prompted OPEC to announce plans for an emergency meeting Nov. 18 to address the issue .
Prices have plunged some 80 % from the record $ 147.27 a barrel set on July 11 .
Meanwhile , the U.S. dollar has whipsawed as nervous investors jump in and out of the greenback .
The dollar dipped lower versus the British pound and the euro but edged higher versus the Japanese yen .
WASHINGTON , Nov 4 ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama won a big victory over Republican rival John McCain on Wednesday in Pennsylvania , one of three critical swing states that have played a decisive role in presidential elections for the past 50 years , U.S. television networks projected .
Obama had been expected to win Pennsylvania , with several opinion polls before the vote giving him a double - digit lead .
Along with Ohio and Florida , Pennsylvania has had a major role in presidential elections for the past half century .
No candidate has won the White House without capturing two of the three states since 1960 .
The victory in the sixth most populous U.S. state gave Obama Pennsylvania ’s 21 electoral votes , a big step toward the 270 needed to take the presidency in the United States ’ indirect system of choosing a leader .
Builders have known for decades that white roofs reflect the sun ’s rays and lower the cost of air conditioning .
But now scientists say they have quantified a new benefit : slowing global warming .
If the 100 biggest cities in the world installed white roofs and changed their pavement to more reflective materials -- say , concrete instead of asphalt - based material -- the global cooling effect would be massive , according to data released Tuesday at California ’s annual Climate Change Research Conference in Sacramento .
Since 2005 , the Golden State has required that flat commercial structures have white roofs .
Next year , new and retrofitted residential and commercial buildings , with both flat and sloped roofs , will have to install heat - reflecting roofing , as part of an energy - efficient building code .
But the state has yet to pass any rules to encourage cooler pavement on its roads , which are largely coated with heat - absorbing asphalt , a cheap byproduct of oil refining .

According to Hashem Akbari , a physicist with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , a 1,000 - square - foot roof -- the average size on an American home -- offsets 10 metric tons of planet - heating carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere if dark - colored shingles or coatings are replaced with white material .
Globally , roofs account for 25 % of the surface of most cities , and pavement accounts for about 35 % .
If all were switched to reflective material in 100 major urban areas , it would offset 44 metric gigatons of greenhouse gases , which have been trapping heat in the atmosphere and altering the climate on a potentially dangerous scale .
That is more than all the countries on Earth emit in a single year .
And , with global climate negotiators focused on limiting a rapid increase in emissions , installing cool roofs and pavements would offset more than 10 years of emissions growth , even without slashing industrial pollution .
Akbari ’s paper , “ Global Cooling : Increasing Worldwide Urban Albedos to Offset CO2 , ” to be published in the journal Climatic Change , was written with his colleague Surabi Menon and UC Berkeley physicist Arthur Rosenfeld , a member of the California Energy Commission .
All three have been associated with the laboratory ’s Heat Island Group , which has published extensive research on how roofs and pavement raise urban temperatures .

Akbari and Rosenfeld said they will mount an effort to persuade the United Nations to organize major cities to alter their roofing and pavement .
“ I call it win - win - win , ” Akbari said .
“ First , a cooler environment not only saves energy but improves comfort .
Second , cooling a city by a few degrees dramatically reduces smog .
And the third win is offsetting global warming . ”

We 've all suspected it for awhile , but kudos to David Tennant for finally coming out and admitting that , as good as the Bard may be , he still comes second to a good episode of Doctor Who .
Talking to the admittedly - biased Doctor Who Magazine , Tennant ( currently starring in the Royal Shakespeare Company 's latest production of Hamlet ) said , " I 'm excited to be doing Hamlet , but I have got very at home in Cardiff .
I love that crew .
I love that set - up .
I love the show , so I 'm missing that .
I miss Russell 's writing ...
Shakespeare 's all right , but he 's lacking in spaceships . "
We knew there was a reason we loved that man .

Now that the McCain campaign has made abundantly clear that their only shot at salvaging this election is by going full - bore negative against Barack Obama with despicable , disgraceful and dishonorable smears , Keith responds with another great Special Comment .
" The Governor of Alaska wants to start calling people terrorists -- and insisting of Senator Obama that quote " this is not a man who sees America like you and I see America " -- and whose rhetoric like that and the " pallin ' around with terrorists " line were rightly described by the Associated Press yesterday as a wolf - in - sheep 's - clothing kind of way of slipping racism into the equation because it's a nifty trick to remind the white folk that ( psst ) Obama is black .
But overriding this sleaziness -- and dog - gone it , the Governor of Alaska has got to be the sleaziest politician working the stage at the moment -- there is the sheer blessed stupidity of letting herself become the bomb - thrower when her own life is full of domestic terrorists .
Governor -- Bill Ayres ?
Your hubby was in this secessionist hate group for which you recorded a video .
Governor -- Jeremiah Wright ?
That pastor you credit with helping you become Governor , is either a con man or a psycho who believes he can tell which woman in the village is the witch and which is the governor . "
Full transcript below the fold :
And finally tonight as promised a Special Comment about the campaign remarks made this weekend and today by the Governor of Alaska .
Last Wednesday , Sheriff 's deputies arrived at the home of a woman in Akron , Ohio named Addie Polk , in order to evict her .
After 38 years in that house , Ms. Polk had fallen behind on paying the mortgage .
It was so bad that the company that held that mortgage , Fannie Mae , had foreclosed .
In fact , it was far worse than anybody knew .
Addie Polk could n't bear it any more .
So , rather than be evicted , she ... shot herself in the chest .
Evidently she will survive .
And , after Congressman Dennis Kucinich brought her plight to the floor of the House , Fannie Mae -- the mortgage giant you and I and all the rest of us pretty much own now - agreed it would forgive Addie Polk 's debt and , when she gets out of the hospital , let her go back and live in her home again .
That this is already a gothic horror story , you 'll agree .
But I left out one detail .
Addie Polk ... is 90 years old .
In the self - pronounced area of expertise of the Governor of Alaska -- energy -- the real experts of both parties are at a loss to figure out any way , even ' drill , baby , drill ' , that might lower gas prices before 2018 .
We are at war in two countries -- and a lame duck President with no reason to check his own imbalance ... still has dreams of one more .
And a 90 - year old woman , trapped in the middle of a financial meltdown , shoots herself -- and she 's still in better shape than the economy .
Yet the Governor of Alaska wants to talk about somebody Barack Obama does n't know very well , and what this somebody Barack Obama does n't know very well , did … during the year Obama was eight ... and the Governor of Alaska was in pre-Kindergarten .
And she wants to talk about Reverend Jeremiah Wright ...
And she does n't object to being introduced with a reference to Barack Obama 's middle name .
Well , this is my suggestion .
In much the same way we , America -- in the corporate persona of Fannie Mae -- have forgiven poor Addie Polk of Akron , Ohio ...
We , America , also need to forgive … poor Sarah Palin of Wasilla , Alaska .
They are both in situations that are beyond their ability to cope .
They are both stuck in a crucible caused by forces they cannot comprehend .
They are both unable to understand ... what they are doing .
After stumbling through a clumsier version of it at Englewood , Colorado ...
The Governor of Alaska said Saturday at Carson , California ... quote :
" Our opponent is someone who sees America as imperfect enough to pal around with terrorists who targeted their own country . "
She later defended the remark by adding this was an " association that has been known but has n't been talked about . "
Governor , Conservative groups have thus far spent ten million dollars this year trying to make something -- anything -- out of the brief interaction on a charity board between Senator Obama , and a rehabilitated former domestic radical from the ' 60s - and not even Conservatives have been stupid enough to buy the snake oil , that this was either a close relationship or a nefarious one .
But of course , you know better , Governor .
You 're smarter than the rest of us .
A reporter asks you a horrible gotcha question like ' which newspapers do you read ' and it takes you four days to come up with an answer , and somehow -- it 's the reporter 's fault .
The reporter asks you to name one Supreme Court ruling with which you disagree other than Roe-v- Wade and even though you 'd commented on just such a case -- from Alaska no less -- not three months ago -- your eyes turn into a big neon sign reading " Vacancy " -- and you insist it 's because that evil media asked the wrong question .
So you 're the genius Governor , and it's your supporters and the undecided voters who are the dopes who are now going to believe the same mickey - mouse crap that Senator Clinton could n't get to stick , and Sean Hannity could n't get to stick , just because it 's you adding that word " terrorist " and that phrase " palling around " and dropping the " g " in pal - ling .
And of course , Governor , those same dopes , and we media morons , we are not smart enough to ask about that pesky Alaskan Independence Party , and why you recorded a speech for its convention last March , and why your husband remained a registered member of it until 2002 , even though it was founded by a man named Joe Vogler who wanted Alaska to secede from the United States ..
The way the South seceded , precipitating the Civil War .
The same Joe Vogler who once said :
" The fires of hell are frozen glaciers compared to my hatred for the American government , and I wo n't be buried under their damn flag . "
And who also said :
" I 'm an Alaskan , not an American .
I 've got no use for America or her damned institutions . "
Shoot , Governor , them 's strong words , hah ?
Did he wink as he said 'em ?
You betcha !
So … where does Joe Vogler rank on the scales of " terrorists who would target their own country " ?
Your opponent 's guy Ayers wound up on a volunteer anti-poverty committee in Chicago .
But your guy Vogler wound up founding a group that wanted to rip one of the stars off the American flag !
Well , ok , Governor -- Vogler 's more your husband 's guy .
So it 's your husband who 's been " palling around with terrorists who would target their own country .
" But I 'm assuming you 've been " palling around " with your husband .
But , gee willikers , Governor , you know what 's best .
You 're not one of these Washington insiders who would notice that though that 's a straight line connecting you , your husband , and this Alaskan secessionist , you 're standing under a banner with the campaign slogan " Country First " and if somebody out there puts two and two together they might just ask , " which Country didja mean ?
The Country of Alaska ? "
" The heels are on , " you said with another smile .
" The gloves are off . "
Well , if you 're telling William Kristol you want to talk about Jeremiah Wright ... fer sure !
So , Governor ... you do n't mind addressing whether this Pastor Muthee is a terrorist ?
Do you ?
We 've told you before about Pastor Thomas Muthee .
He 's the preacher who visited the Wasilla Assembly of God church a couple of times while the Governor was there -- ironically enough , just about as many times as Bill Ayres has met Barack Obama -- and , see , there was this one time where Pastor Muthee actually laid hands on the Governor .
And I 'm sure that sounds like just some crazy anecdote , except there 's videotape .
And of course the Governor talked about this moment -- the laying on of hands -- just last summer .
It was in October , 2005 , as the video indicates , when Muthee put his hands on Sarah Palin 's back and said , " make a way for Sarah , even in the political arena .
Make a way , my God .
Bring finances her way , even if for the campaign in the name of Jesus ...
" Every form of witchcraft , it will be rebuked in the name of Jesus .
Father , make her way now .
" And the Governor said that " bold " approach of Pastor Muthee was one of the reasons she became Governor … and she gives him just oodles of credit for puttin ' her on the path .
The problem for the governor is ... that in 1999 The Christian Science Monitor reported that Pastor Muthee had gotten his start a decade earlier in Kenya , in the Nairobi suburb of Kiambu …
Kimabu was crime - ridden ...
So this character Muthee showed up , and announced it was the fault of this woman in town who he had decided was a witch .
And Muthee gave the witch a choice : either be saved , or get out of town .
And the woman initially chose none of the above , but this became less than a viable option when Muthee got 200 of the townspeople together and they decided , heck , you know , Muthee 's right , she probably is a witch , and the next thing you know the police are raiding her house and reportedly shooting her snake because if she was a witch , the snake had to be a demon , and then the woman left town and everybody said crime went down and most of the bars closed and this is not only how Pastor Muthee got started -- but he 's proud of it and he tells the story in his testimonial videotapes and people in that church in Wasilla where he laid hands on the Governor knew all about it .
And they think it was just a ...
Joe -Six - Pack , Hockey
Mom kinda thing to do , to let a guy who branded some woman in Kenya a witch , demand that God make some different woman ... the Governor ... of ...
Alaska !!!
Governor , what would you call someone who arrives in a suburb , blames a resident for the local crime , organizes a mob to threaten the woman , convinces the authorities to go and raid her home , and then chases her out of the suburb ?
C'mon Governor , just give us one answer that has something to do with the question you were just asked .
That 's right ... you 'd call him ... a terrorist .
And since it was in his own country , that would make him , Hamm ?….
Yes , very good … a domestic terrorist .
So , you , Governor , you 've been " palling around with terrorists who would target their own country .
" Say it ai n't so , Gov !
Say it ai n't so !
Of course ... it is .
The Governor of Alaska ignores Addie Polk and the American tragedy that is a 90 - year old woman shooting herself out of shame and panic and who knows what else .
Over the mortgage !
Instead the Governor of Alaska wants to start calling people terrorists ... -- and insisting of Senator Obama that quote " this is not a man who sees America like you and I see America " -- and whose rhetoric like that , and the " pallin ' around with terrorists " line were rightly described by the Associated Press yesterday as a wolf - in - sheep 's - clothing kind of way of slipping racism into the equation , because it 's a nifty trick to remind the white folk that ( psst ) Obama is black .
But overriding this sleaziness -- and dog - gone it , the Governor of Alaska has got to be the sleaziest politician working the stage at the moment -- there is the sheer blessed stupidity of letting herself become the bomb - thrower when her own life is full of domestic terrorists .
- Bill Ayres ?
Your hubby was in this secessionist hate group for which you recorded a video .
Governor ? -- Jeremiah Wright ?
That pastor you credit with helping you become Governor , is either a con man or a psycho who believes he can tell which woman in the village is the witch , and which woman is the governor .
And Governor , there 's also " The U.S. Council On World Freedom . "
You should ask Senator McCain about that outfit and why he had to scat away from it 22 years ago .
Or , ask him why yesterday his own brother Joe referred to Northern Virginia as quote , " communist country . "
Or you could ask him about Pastors John Hagee and Rod Parsley .
Or about why Senator McCain said about introducing Jeremiah Wright into this campaign , quote , " there 's no place for that kind of campaigning , the American people do n't want it , period . "
Or -- do n't ask .
You know best .
You 're the one selling the patent medicine .
Those of us out here , we 're just the suckers pulling out our greenbacks .
Go on talking about this man Ayers and trying to link Obama to that word " terrorist . "
But be prepared for others to ask you about your pastor ... and terrorism .
And for still others to ask you about the First Dude .... and terrorism .
But -- not me , Governor .
I forgive you .
You are about as guilty here as poor Ms. Addie Polk in Akron .
And I hope that after what you 've done to yourself , you recover as well as she seems to be doing , and that you too get to go back and live in your own home again .
Because if you think the terrorism con , and the racism sting are going to do anything but bury you and Senator McCain , you need to pick up one of those how - many - ever newspapers you reed and check the headlines to find out what people are really worried about right now .
Otherwise , when you said " the heels are on , the gloves are off , " you got as close to telling the truth as you 've ever gotten , and without really knowing it .
Because , for you and Senator McCain , Governor , it 's not the gloves that just came off .
Obviously -- it 's the wheels .
That 's Countdown for this , the One Thousand , 986th day since the declaration of " Mission Accomplished " in Iraq .
It ’s a good thing you only bet a penny , Mr. Laffer .
You ’d better believe it now , Laffer .
Welcome to the technology age when anything you say or do can come back to bite your behind .
I ca n’t help but wonder , looking back on how sure Laffer was that we were doing well , if he was hired just to be the guy to convince everyone that things are okay .
Because he could n’t have truly been that confident , could he ?
Peter Schiff makes a very interesting statement that we should actually embrace this recession , and he was saying this 2 years before the recession actually started .
“ Rather than the recession being resisted , It should be embraced – the disease is all this debt financed consumption . ”
He also states that the recession will likely last years rather than months .
I think it says something that Peter Schiff keeps his cool very well despite being attacked on both sides .
I love that last comment Peter makes .
Listen for it .
An Italian priest has been ordered to pay € 60,000 ( £ 49,000 ) in damages because the bells of his church were too loud , and were rung for too long at " unsocial hours " .
The judgement , handed down by a court in the town of Chiavari , has widespread implications for what is often seen as Europe 's most Catholic nation , and perhaps the country with the highest density of churches .
The case brought by a retired university teacher , Flora Leuzzi , is one of several alleging that over - enthusiastic tolling constitutes noise pollution .
Professor Leuzzi , who lives close to the Carmine church in Lavagna , near Genoa , began her campaign against its belfry 13 years ago .
The judge found that the sound it emitted was louder than average .
He also agreed that Leuzzi 's hearing had been marginally impaired .
However , in perhaps an interesting comment on Italian values , he awarded only € 9,000 for " biological damage " - and € 46,000 for the disruption to Leuzzi 's social life .
The remaining compensation was for " moral damage " .
Witnesses testified that they had given up visiting Leuzzi at home in the old quarter of Lavagna .
Father Stefano Queirolo will only be permitted to ring them for Sunday Mass , and at Christmas and Easter .
The bells will be allowed to peal for at most 20 seconds .
Queirolo told the daily La Stampa he expected the diocese to appeal .
He said the belfry had recently been soundproofed .
In any case , he added : " We have n't been ringing the bells for at least four years now . "
There was another church only 100 metres away , he said .
" And there 's no sense in overdoing things . "

The denizens of Linden Lab ’s virtual world Second Life are a passionate lot , so when the San Francisco company recently announced a steep purchase and maintenance fee increase on popular regions of their virtual land , sign - waving avatars were soon gathered outside Linden ’s SL office , in protest .
Some even set themselves on fire .
There have been protests like this throughout the world ’s five - year history , but without a competing virtual world offering all the unique features of Second Life , angry customers have largely stayed put , despite their grumblings .
Now , however , there is an increasingly viable alternative : OpenSim , an open - source platform for developing virtual worlds , that was , ironically , made possible after Linden Lab released its viewer code .
Though still in beta mode , OpenSim has attracted developers with IBM ( s IBM ) , Microsoft ( s MSFT ) , and numerous startups , so it ’s bound to rapidly improve .
Within 24 hours of the price hike announcement , more than 800 frustrated SL users , including influential members of the community , had registered with an attractive OpenSim variation .
That might not seem like much , but Linden Lab is profitable primarily through virtual land sales , and less than 17 percent of its 507,000 active users are premium subscribers who can own SL real estate .
( Economic stats here , SL reg. req . )
That number has been slowly but steadily decreasing — there were 93,000 premium subscribers in December 2007 , but in August 2008 , the last published figure , less than 85,000 .
So if a few thousand of its land - owning users quit SL for OpenSim , accelerating this slide , the company will likely feel the pressure .
I contacted freshly minted Linden CEO Mark Kingdon for his comments about the protest .
In a statement provided by his publicist , Kingdon told me , “ We understand that this price adjustment will affect businesses and other projects of some our Second Life Residents , ” and emphasized the cost increases were only directed at select landowners , who have until January 2009 to adjust themselves to the new rates .
“ To be clear , ” Kingdon continued , “ this price adjustment affects only a portion of land in Second Life ; it does not apply to private islands or regular mainland property .
We made this change to ensure an optimal Second Life experience for all Residents . ”
That may be , but anger over this increase ( which many consider unfair ) and concern over future price hikes have become added incentives for users to consider OpenSim grids that charge less for virtual land .
Second Life does retain a lot of goodwill among its supporters ( including me ) , which will dampen any calls for a general exodus .
Still , one thing remains clear : “ I ’m moving to OpenSim ! ” has already become the metaverse version of the “ I ’m moving to Canada ! ” threat we hear every U.S. Presidential election .
One of Britain 's leading moral philosophers has called for a change in the law to allow assisted suicide in Britain following the death of paralysed rugby player Daniel James .
Baroness Warnock , writing in today 's Observer , calls for liberalisation of euthanasia laws on the grounds that 'we have a moral obligation to other people to take their seriously reached decisions with regard to their own lives equally seriously ' .
Her comments come after Mark and Julie James were quizzed this weekend by officers .
They had taken their 23 - year - old son , Daniel , to a clinic in Switzerland last month where he became the youngest known Briton to have requested an assisted suicide .
He had already attempted to kill himself three times after being paralysed from the chest down in a rugby accident .
Mary Warnock writes : ' The case of Mr and Mrs James ... presents a legal dilemma .
Whether or not they are prosecuted , the law will be challenged .
There are many , of whom I am one , who believe that we must try yet again to change the law , not by excluding from criminality those who assist death by taking the suicide abroad , but by liberalising the laws of our own country . '
Daniel James , who was described by friends as ' vivacious and warm ' before his accident , was injured in March last year while training with Nuneaton Rugby Club .
Despite numerous operations to fuse his vertabrae during eight months in hospital , he only regained limited use in his fingers .
Last night , his parents were not responding to telephone calls at their farm near Sinton Green , Worcestershire where they live with daughters Georgina , 21 , and Olivia , 18 .
In emails sent in response to a euthanasia debate on a newspaper website , Mrs James criticised the well - meaning person who had alerted the police to Daniel 's case .
She wrote : ' This person had never met Dan before or after his accident and obviously gave no consideration for our younger daughters who had seen their big brother suffer so much and the day before had to say goodbye to him .
' I hope that one day I will get the chance to speak to this lady and ask if she had a son , daughter , father , mother , who could not walk , had no hand function , was incontinent , and relied upon 24 - hour care for every basic need and they had asked her for support , what would she have done ?!
' Our son could not have been more loved and had he felt he could have lived his life this way he would have been loved just the same , but this was his right , as a human being . '
In another email , she wrote : ' Whilst not everyone in Dan 's situation would find it as unbearable as Dan , what right does any human being have to tell any other that they have to live such a life , filled with terror , discomfort and indignity ?
What right does one person who chooses to live with a particular illness or disability have to tell another that they should have to ?'
Police yesterday were preparing a file for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether Mr or Mrs James should be charged .

If you want to start an argument , ask the person who just said ' paradigm shift ' what it really means .
Or ' epigenetic ' .
Nature goes in search of the terms that get scientists most worked up .

To a great extent , science is about arriving at definitions .
What is a man ?
What is a number ?
Questions such as these require substantial inquiry .
But where science is supposed to be precise and measured , definitions can be frustratingly vague and variable .
Here , Nature looks at some of the most difficult definitions in science .
Some are stipulative definitions , created by scientists for their convenience , but on which the community has not found consensus .
Popular though they are , not everyone agrees on what is meant by ' paradigm shift ' or ' tipping point ' .
Essential definitions — those that get at the question of what makes a thing a thing — can be just as troublesome .
What is race , or consciousness ?
And does it even matter if there is no agreed - on meaning ?
The good news is that for every troublesome term there are thousands used every day with no problems .
Scientists are competent , if unconscious wielders of definition , says Anil Gupta , a philosopher of science at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania , " just as one can walk quite happily without having a complete account of walking " .
Paradigm shift ( noun . )
Emma Marris
Paradigm shift has a definite origin and originator : Thomas Kuhn , writing in his 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions , argued against the then prevalent view of science as an incremental endeavour marching ever truthwards .
Instead , said Kuhn , most science is " normal science " , which fills in the details of a generally accepted , shared conceptual framework .
Troublesome anomalies build up , however , and eventually some new science comes along and overturns the previous consensus .
Voilà , a paradigm shift .
The classic example , Kuhn said , is the Copernican revolution , in which Ptolemaic theory was swept away by putting the Sun at the centre of the Solar System .
Post - shift , all previous observations had to be reinterpreted .
Kuhn 's theory about how science works was arguably a paradigm shift of its own , by changing the way that academics think about science .
And scientists have been using the phrase ever since .
In a postscript to the second edition of his book , Kuhn explained that he used the word ' paradigm ' in at least two ways ( noting that one " sympathetic reader " had found 22 uses of the term ) .
In its broad form , it encompasses the " entire constellation of beliefs , values , techniques and so on shared by the members of a given community " .
More specifically it refers to " the concrete puzzle - solutions " that are used as models for normal science post - shift .
Scientists who use the term today do n't usually mean that their field has undergone a Copernican - scale revolution , to the undying annoyance of many who hew to Kuhn 's narrower definition .
But their usage might qualify under his broader one .
And so usage becomes a matter of opinion and , perhaps , vanity .
The use of the term in titles and abstracts of leading journals jumped from 30 papers in 1991 to 124 in 1998 , yet very few of these papers garnered more than 10 citations apiece1 .
Several scientists contacted for this article who had used paradigm shift said that , in retrospect , they were having second thoughts .
In 2002 , Stuart Calderwood , an oncologist at Harvard Medical School in Boston , Massachusetts , used it to describe the discovery that ' heat shock proteins ' , crucial to cell survival , could work outside the cell as well as in2 .
" If you work in a field for a long time and everything changes , it does seem like a revolution , " he says .
But now he says he may have misused the phrase because the discovery was adding to , rather than overturning , previous knowledge in the field .
Arvid Carlsson , of the University of Gothenburg in Sweden stands by his use of the phrase .
" Until a certain time , the paradigm was that cells communicate almost entirely by electrical signals , " says Carlsson .
" In the 1960s and '70s , this changed .
They do so predominantly by chemical signals .
In my opinion , this is dramatic enough to deserve the term paradigm shift . "
Few would disagree : base assumptions were overturned in this case , and Carlsson 's own work on the chemical neurotransmitter dopamine ( which was instrumental in this particular shift ) earned him the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
Unless a Nobel prize is in the offing , it might be wise for scientists to adopt the caution of contemporary historians of science and think twice before using a phrase with a complex meaning and a whiff of self promotion .
" Scientists all want to be the scientists that generate a new revolution , " says Kuhn 's biographer , Alexander Bird , a philosopher at the University of Bristol , UK .
" But if Kuhn is right , most science is normal science and most people can't perform that role . "

Epigenetic ( adjective . )
Helen Pearson
No one denies that epigenetics is fashionable : its usage in PubMed papers increased by more than tenfold between 1997 and 2007 .
And few deny that epigenetics is important .
What they do disagree on is what it is .
" The idea is that there is a clear meaning and that it 's being violated by people like me who use it more loosely , " says Adrian Bird at the University of Edinburgh , UK .
Last year he suggested this as a definition : " the structural adaptation of chromosomal regions so as to register , signal or perpetuate altered activity states " 3 .
But this wide - ranging proposal , which takes on - board pretty much every physical indicator of a gene 's activity is " preposterously dumb " , says Mark Ptashne of Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center in New York , who has published his own take on the word 's usage4 .
" I 've grown to be very careful about using the term , " says Bing Ren , who studies gene regulation at the University of California , San Diego .
According to the ' traditional ' definition that Ptashne favours , epigenetics describes " a change in the state of expression of a gene that does not involve a mutation , but that is nevertheless inherited in the absence of the signal or event that initiated the change " .
The classic example is found in a bacteriophage called Lambda , which stays dormant in the genome of generations of cells through inheritance of a regulatory protein .
These sort of processes are basic to some of the most pressing questions in biology today : such mechanisms are needed to explain how a single - celled embryo can generate cells that are genetically identical , but express a different array of genes and hence take on different jobs in blood , brain or muscle for generation after generation .
Over the past few years , however , all kinds of processes associated with gene control have been subsumed under the moniker .
For example , ' epigenetic ' is often used to refer to the chemical modification of histones — proteins that DNA winds around — which is involved in gene regulation .
This infuriates those who learned the classical definition ; they say it puts these modifications at the heart of development and disease despite scant evidence that they are inherited .
" Why did histone marks become epigenetic ? " says Kevin Struhl at Harvard Medical School in Boston .
" People decided that if they call them that it makes them interesting . "
Others say that it is not about making things sound important , it is more the lack of any other phrase with which to collectively refer to this type of work .
The word had dual meanings long before the current debate .
In the 1940s , Conrad Waddington used it to describe how the genetic information in a ' genotype ' manifests itself as a set of characteristics , or ' phenotype ' .
In 1958 , David Nanney at the University of Michigan , Ann Arbor , borrowed the term to describe " messy " inherited phenomena that could not be explained by conventional genetics5 .
" It was controversial in 1958 and everything died down and it has come alive again , " says Nanney .
" It took 40 years for epigenetics to become a major word in the vocabulary of modern biology . "
“ Epigenetics is a useful word if you do n't know what 's going on â€ ” if you do , you use something else . ”
Adrian Bird
A lot of money can ride on whether a researcher is , or is not , studying epigenetics : the US National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) this month started handing out US $ 190 million as part of its epigenomics initiative and other countries are pouring funding into the area .
( The NIH is careful to define the epigenetics it is paying for as including both heritable and non-heritable changes in gene activity , something that Ptashne describes as " a complete joke " . )
Bird says he remains in favour of a relaxed usage .
" Epigenetics is a useful word if you do n't know what 's going on — if you do , you use something else , " he says .
Complexity ( noun . )
M. Mitchell Waldrop
In his book Programming the Universe , engineer Seth Lloyd of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge describes how he once compiled 42 definitions of complexity — none of which encompasses everything people mean by that word .
Researchers in the many institutes and programmes formed to study ' complexity ' are still searching for the right way to describe their discipline .
" If we 're a university centre , we should be able to say what we care about , " says Carl Simon , director of the Center for the Study of Complex Systems at the University of Michigan .
The quest for a rigorous definition reached a particularly intense pitch in the early 1990s , when some of the more visionary researchers at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico held out the hope of a universal theory of complexity — a mathematically precise set of equations that would hold for all complex systems in much the same way that the second law of thermodynamics holds for all physical systems .
James Crutchfield , head of the Complexity Sciences Center at the University of California , Davis , says that this created a problem .
" New people would come into the field and start using the word ' complexity ' as if it was a unitary thing " — which , as became increasingly clear , it was not .
No all - encompassing theory emerged .
Even within the precise world of binary code and bit strings , there was computational complexity , which describes how much memory and processing is required to carry out a calculation ; algorithmic complexity , which is related to how much a digital description of something can be compressed ; and any number of combinations and variations .
" So my bottom line is , add an adjective to ' complexity ' , " Crutchfield says .
Researchers have found plenty of undeniably complex systems to study , such as economies , ecosystems , urban traffic and brains ( see ' Consciousness ' ) .
And in a qualitative sense , at least , these systems do have certain features in common that might serve as a definition .
They are , for instance , all composed of many independent ' agents ' ( consumers , species , vehicles , neurons ) that are constantly interacting with , and adapting to , one another .
They all display a rich array of nonlinear feedback loops among the agents , which means that small changes can have a big effect .
And they never quite settle down into static equilibrium .
The effort to understand complex systems has led researchers to develop new analytical tools such as network theory , agent - based modelling and genetic algorithms .
These tools , combined with the exponential growth in computational power , have allowed researchers to build ever more complex models of complex systems — and study the subtle but powerful phenomenon of ' emergence , ' in which multiple agents exhibit collective behaviour that is a great deal more than the sum of its parts .
So even though the field seems little closer to defining its subject , says Lloyd , " in places where people can apply these conceptual and computational tools , we 've made huge progress in understanding complex systems " .
But in a world where we are constructing ever more complex artefacts — technologies , economies , organizations and societies — even better tools are needed to keep pace .
Race ( noun . )
Erika Check Hayden
If biologists had a list of four - letter words to avoid , then ' race ' would be higher up than anything more conventionally vulgar .
It is controversial , it lacks a clear definition and the more that genetics reveals about race , the more biologically meaningless the term seems .
Race was long used to imply a shared , distinct ancestry , as in a 1936 definition of the term in Nature : " It has two main connotations , one being community of descent , the other distinctness from other races . "
But in 1972 , Harvard geneticist Richard Lewontin showed that the concept of race starts to dissolve under genetic scrutiny .
He found that the vast majority of human genetic variation , which he measured in 16 genes , is found within , not between , what he called the ' classical racial groupings ' 6 .
Since then , studies examining hundreds or even thousands of genetic markers have confirmed Lewontin 's findings7 , 8 .
A consensus now exists across the social and biological sciences : regardless of appearance or heritage , groups of human beings are overwhelmingly more genetically similar to each other than different .
This does n't mean race does not exist or is meaningless in society — far from it .
But it does mean that an individual 's race is not a particularly useful or predictive indicator of biological traits or medical vulnerabilities .
Race is " the social interpretation of how we look , in a race - conscious society " , says Camara Phyllis Jones , the research director on the Social Determinants of Health and Equity programme at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta , Georgia .
Lewontin says that assigned races are essentially arbitrary .
" It means essentially a group of related people , and where you draw the line depends on where you are in history . "
Some argue that severing biology from the definition of race risks jettisoning medically meaningful information .
Patterns of genetic variation can be used to classify people from different geographical regions into clusters that sometimes mimic the classical racial groupings , and geneticists say that members of these groups seem to have distinctive disease prevalences and drug metabolism .
So race could serve as a cheap , albeit imperfect , surrogate for defining groups for clinical trials or medical interventions .
But genetics is turning up ever more examples of how race obscures relevant information .
A study published in April showed that a mutation found in 40 % of African Americans acts like an endogenous beta blocker to protect patients with heart failure from death9 .
It also suggested why previous research had found conflicting evidence about the response of African Americans to beta blockers : those studies had lumped all African Americans into one group , obscuring the effects of mutations that confer protection or vulnerability .
A person 's perception of his or her race can still serve to capture life experiences relevant to behavioural and clinical research , such as the stress of lifelong discrimination that may contribute to health disparities .
But in other contexts researchers are abandoning the term in favour of other ways to group humans , by ' population , ' genetic ancestry ' or ' geographic ancestry ' .
Tipping point ( noun . )
Quirin Schiermeier
In July 2006 , scientists running the RealClimate blog ironically headlined one of their posts ' Runaway tipping points of no return ' .
The post laments that usage of the phrase ' tipping point ' in climate - change and ecosystem discussions had reached , well — a tipping point .
It 's not the frequency of the word that bothers researchers .
It 's the lack of one clear definition and the confusing way in which the concept is being used , among scientists and in the public discourse , often to imply that global warming - induced changes will propel Earth into irreversible and catastrophic climate change .
" There is no convincing theoretical argument or model that at some point the planet as a whole will snap into a second state of system , " says Timothy Lenton , an Earth scientist at the University of East Anglia , UK .
The term was originally coined in 1958 by sociologist Morton Grodzins in the context of studies on the racial makeup of US neighbourhoods .
He found that when the migration of African - Americans into traditionally white neighbourhoods had reached a certain level , whites began to move out .
In the 1970s , epidemiologists adopted tipping point to describe the threshold at which , mathematically , an infectious disease 's ' reproductive rate ' goes above one .
This means that each infected person infects more than one other and the disease starts growing into an epidemic .
The phrase reached its own tipping point in 2000 when Malcolm Gladwell , a staff writer at The New Yorker , published his successful book The Tipping Point : How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference .
It also acquired a worrisome — some say alarmist — flavour courtesy of its frequent usage in the context of climate change .
Regarding climate , the term is commonly defined as the critical threshold at which a slow gradual change qualitatively alters the state of an entire system .
This is different to a ' point of no return ' which is , by definition , irreversible .
Only if internal forcing will cause a runaway effect is a tipping point also a point of no return .
The idea that positive feedbacks — such as the melting of polar ice reducing surface reflectivity , thereby causing yet more solar absorption , warming and melting — could amplify climate change to a point of fundamentally altering the global system has been around for decades .
The debate now is about where those tipping points lie , and what will happen when they are crossed .
In a paper published in February , a team led by Lenton looked at 15 potential tipping ' elements ' ( things that could reach tipping points ) in Earth 's climate system10 .
Arctic sea-ice and the Greenland ice sheet were those most at risk from ' tipping ' within the twenty - first century , the authors concluded .
But researchers accept that most known tipping points seem to be reversible on human timescales .
Melting of the complete Arctic summer ice sheet , for example , could probably be reversed within a few years or so in a cooler world .
Melting of the extremely thick Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are a possible exception because , once melted , new ice would have to form at lower , warmer altitudes with less snowfall .
Claims that global warming could reach an irreversible tipping point by 2016 , as made last year by James Hansen , director of NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York , refer to the trajectory of greenhouse - gas emissions , not to changes in the climate system .
Even if greenhouse - gas concentrations reach a point at which they cannot be restored to pre-industrial levels , it will not inevitably push the world 's climate over a catastrophic tipping point .
Stem cell ( noun . )
Monya Baker
Ask a group of stem - cell biologists to define stem cell , and they 'll say roughly the same thing : a cell that can , long term , divide to make more copies of itself as well as cells with more specialized identities .
Ask the same scientists to list the most disputed terms in the field , however , and ' stem cell ' will be top of that list .
The problem here is an operational one : reasonable people disagree on which cells qualify under the definition .
" It 's not unusual to pick up a paper and see someone call something a stem cell and the evidence that it is , is just not there , " says Lawrence Goldstein , who directs the stem - cell research programme at the University of California , San Diego .
Alleged ' stem cells ' can fail to meet the definition on many counts .
Stem cells should persist long term , yet many ' stem cells ' exist only in the fetus .
Multipotency — the ability to generate multiple cell types — is a criterion for a haematopoietic , or blood - forming , stem cell , but spermatagonial stem cells only produce sperm .
Stem cells specific to tissue such as cartilage , the kidney and the cornea have been reported , with varying degrees of acceptance .
The quest for a ' stemness signature ' , a collection of markers common to all stem cells , has been met with frustration .
Debate erupts most commonly over whether a particular cell should be considered a stem cell , which can divide indefinitely , or a progenitor cell , which can differentiate into fewer cell types and is thought to burn itself out after a certain number of divisions .
“ Some of this just breaks down .
That 's biology .
It was n't designed to fit the language . ”
Lawrence Goldstein
The only way to be really sure of what a cell can , and cannot do , is to observe it , but it is difficult to study cells in vivo , and putting them in a dish might change their behaviour .
Haematopoietic stem cells were the first to be identified and have , to some extent , set default standards .
Putative stem cells are isolated , then placed into animals whose own haematopoietic stem cells have been destroyed by radiation .
If the blood - forming system is restored , the transplant is assumed to have contained stem cells .
But such an assay is impossible when working with other cell types , such as neural stem cells , which are harder to transplant and assess in disease models .
And it is difficult to pin the label to one cell type , when studies commonly involve a mixed population .
" It is perhaps not realistic to come up with a generally applicable definition of an adult stem cell , " says Thomas Graf of the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona .
Some researchers are side - stepping the debate by referring in their papers to ' stem / progenitor cells ' .
Fully understanding what each cell can do is more important than knowing what to call them all , says Goldstein .
" Some of this just breaks down , " he says .
" That 's biology .
It was n't designed to fit the language . "
Significant ( adjective . )
Geoff Brumfiel
Few words in the scientific lexicon are as confusing , or as loaded , as ' significant ' .
Statisticians wring their hands over its cavalier use to describe scientific validity .
And backed by statistics or not , researchers commonly employ the word to illustrate the importance of their latest finding .
The very definition of statistical significance is misunderstood by most scientists , says Steven Goodman , a biostatistician at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore , Maryland , and associate editor on Annals of Internal Medicine .
Typically , researchers take a result to be statistically significant based on ' p - values ' .
This parameter is used , for example , to reveal whether a drug lowers cholesterol based on promising data collected in a clinical trial .
According to the common interpretation , a ' significant ' result with a p-value of 0.05 or less means that there is a 5 % or less chance that the drug is ineffective .
According to the statistically accurate definition , there is a 5 % or less chance of seeing the observed data even though the drug is , indeed , ineffective .
Rhetorically , the difference may seem imperceptible ; mathematically , say statisticians , it is crucial .
In situations in which the data is somewhat ambiguous , there is a chance that results can be misinterpreted .
" It 's diabolically tricky , " Goodman says .
Most statisticians resign themselves to abuse of the term 's strict definition .
But more grievous trespasses abound .
" Statistical significance is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for proving a scientific result , " says Stephen Ziliak , an economist at Roosevelt University in Chicago , Illinois , and co-author of The Cult of Statistical Significance .
P-values are often used to emphasize the certainty of data , but they are only a passive read - out of a statistical test and do not take into account how well an experiment was designed .
A p-value would not reveal , for example , that everyone was taking different doses of that cholesterol drug .
In many experiments , Ziliak says , " there are so many different errors that they tend to swamp the p-value errors " .
Even if a result is a genuinely statistically significant one , it can be virtually meaningless in the real world .
A new cancer treatment may ' significantly ' extend life by a month , but many terminally ill patients would not consider that outcome significant .
A scientific finding may be ' significant ' without having any major impact on a field ; conversely , the significance of a discovery might not become apparent until years after it is made .
" One has to reserve for history the judgement of whether something is significant with a capital S , " says Steven Block , a biophysicist at Stanford University in California .
In some situations other statistical methods can substitute , but Goodman believes that trying to use them in the scientific literature would be like " talking Swahili in Louisiana " .
He says he and other editors do their best to keep the term out of Annals though .
" We ask them to use words like ' statistically detectable ' or ' statistically discernable , ' " he says .
Consciousness ( noun . )
Heidi Ledford
Psychologists , philosophers , neurobiologists and doctors all grapple with the term consciousness .
For clinicians , the definition is of life or death importance ; for some others , it is a matter of determining how the brain 's interconnecting tissues collectively create a sense of self .
" How can this three - pound piece of meat inside my head give rise to something like being me ? " sums up Gerald Edelman , director of the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla , California .
In 2006 , neuroscientist Adrian Owen , at the Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge , UK , reported that a woman who had been diagnosed as being in a vegetative state had shown signs of brain activity associated with consciousness11 .
The activity was picked up with functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , which can reveal changes in brain blood flow .
The finding rattled the clinical definition of consciousness , which is determined by using a series of behavioural tests to see if the patient can make voluntary movements in response to commands .
The outcome can determine whether a patient needs pain medication , or whether it is time to switch off life support , but clinicians readily acknowledge that the tests break down when patients are unable to move .
Doctors now find themselves in an uncomfortable limbo , because it is not clear whether cortical activity measured on fMRI is enough to redefine those decision points .
" What do we do as a community as long as this method is not yet validated ? " asks Steven Laureys , a neurologist with the Coma Science Group at the University of Liége in Belgium .
“ You do n't waste your time defining the thing .
You just go out there and study it . ”
Michael Gazzaniga
The French philosopher René Descartes declared that consciousness was a fundamental property that fell beyond the rules of the physical world .
Most scientists , says Edelman , are not satisfied with that answer .
" There must be some physical basis for consciousness , " he says .
" The difficulty is , how does that arise ?
Philosophers David Chalmers of the Australian National University in Canberra , explored what he called the " hard problem " of consciousness by pondering ' qualia ' , the subjective properties of experiences .
Scientists and philosophers alike have struggled to explain how the physical properties of the world around us — such as colour and temperature — give rise to the experiences of ' red ' , or ' warm ' .
Chalmers has argued that the functional organization of the brain rather than its chemical or molecular properties makes these experiences possible .

Many definitions of consciousness include the ability to sort through the relentless onslaught of incoming data to create and respond to an internal model of the external world .
And some believe that simply gathering data about neurons and behaviours will not be enough .
" What we need is a ' theory of consciousness ' .
Then we 'll be in a better position to define it , " says professor of biology and engineering Christof Koch of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .
Koch thinks that information theory could provide the solution by determining whether consciousness might be an inherent by - product of a system as enormously complex as the brain ( see ' Complexity ' ) .
Michael Gazzaniga , a neuroscientist at the University of California , Santa Barbara , argues that researchers need only develop a working definition to explore consciousness , not a precise one .
" You do n't waste your time defining the thing , " he says .
" You just go out there and study it . "

Recognizing the financial calamity faced by the United States , John McCain has decided to “ suspend ” his job as a presidential candidate until a solution can be worked out .
He ’s called on Barack Obama to do the same , and wants to cancel the presidential candidates debate scheduled for this Friday .
While we ’re tempted to breathe a sigh of relief that we ’ll no longer have to go through another day of this crisis without the economic leadership of McCain , we realize we should be following his example .
There are dozens of things that need to be suspended in light of this calamity .
Here ’s five .
First off , we all need to suspend working .
McCain is taking time off from the presidential campaign to concentrate on talking with his senate buddies about our economic problems .
Let ’s all do this !
Think of how much strain all our collective economic activity is placing on the system .
Suspend work .
Second , we need to suspend the Red Sox .
Years ago , long before headlines like “ Red Sox clinch playoff spot , Yankees eliminated ” were even imaginable , we never had this kind of problem .
We should suspend Tampa Bay as well .
We ’re not sure why but it just seems like the thing to do .
Something about Florida real estate .
Third , and we ’re serious about this one , we need to suspend the use of money .
The easiest way to do this is to stop paying for things .
We ’ve got a head start on this since so many of us have already stopped paying our mortgages .
But we ’ve got a long way to go .
Just this afternoon we paid for our lunch .
Tomorrow it ’s time to ditch the check .
Fourth , let ’s suspend the smoking ban .
This one does n’t really fit in with the rest of our plans .
But it ’s like the executive salary cap getting attached to the Hanky - Panky bailout : it ’s something we ’d like to see anyway , so why not now ?
Fifth , let ’s suspend business casual .
Look how snappy Hank Paulson looked at his meeting with those Senators .
That crisp shirt .
That blazing orange tie .
If only we went ahead and suspended business casual , we could all look as sharp as Hank .
And looking sharp is half the battle .
Other possible examples of things to suspend -- such as marriage , divorce , pregnancy , education , dating , staying at home and making fun of politicians -- spring to mind .
What would you suspend ?

The TV - sized Moon Impact Probe was released from a height of 100 km towards the Moon ( Image : ISRO )
A probe from India ’s Chandrayaan - 1 lunar mission has landed on the Moon , officials at the Indian Space Research Organisation said on Friday .
The Moon Impact Probe detached itself from Chandrayaan - 1 about 100 km from the Moon ’s surface and crash - landed on the south pole of the Moon at 1501 GMT , officials said in Bangalore .
“ It was a flawless operation , ” said SK Shivakumar , director of ISRO Telemetry ’s tracking and command network .

The probe aimed to kick up some dust , which instruments in the mother craft would analyse .
It had already sent images from its descent to the mother ship , Shivakumar said .
At the time of this posting , the images had not yet been published on ISRO ’s website .
A principal objective is to look for helium - 3 , an isotope that could power nuclear fusion reactors and that some say could be a valuable source of energy in the future .
It is thought to be more plentiful on the Moon than on Earth , but still rare and very difficult to extract .
India launched Chandrayaan - 1 on 22 October , joining the Asian space race in the footsteps of rival China and reinforcing its claim to be considered a global power .
Chandrayaan - 1 , a cuboid spacecraft built by ISRO , is also seen as a boost for the country ’s ambitions to gain more global space business .
In April , India sent 10 satellites into orbit from a single rocket , and ISRO says it plans more launches before a proposed crewed mission to space and then on to Mars .
On Thursday , Charlotte based utility company Duke Energy unveiled plans for a pilot program that will test whether or not 850 North Carolina homes can collectively produce the energy of a small solar power plant .
While the panels will only be placed on 850 roofs , it is estimated that they will actually produce 16 megawatts of electricity , enough energy to power 2600 homes .
Duke Energy has a few small obstacles to get past before it can move forward with its plan .
The company is offering 100 million dollars to any company that can supply the necessary materials , panels , and labor for the project .
They hope to get started in early 2009 .
In addition to finding a supplier , they must also gain the approval of the North Carolina Utilities Commission .
It seems likely though that they will obtain approval in the next few months , given the considerable amount of public interest in clean energy projects .
While $ 100 million is expensive , Duke Energy hopes that this pilot program will demonstrate that a grid of homes generating solar power might be a cheaper long - term strategy for providing energy than would be buying land and constructing new coal - based power plants .
In addition to this project , Duke Energy has been actively seeking other ways to enter the renewable energy market .
The company recently purchased several large wind power companies and also bought 100 wind turbines from General Electric .
One of the more interesting aspects of the program is that the houses that place solar panels on their roofs will not be using the energy generated by their systems .
Instead , Duke Energy will pay the homeowners a rental fee for the roof space , and distribute the energy from a centralized system as they see fit .
A California company has also come up with a similar scheme to that of Duke Energy , but will instead use the roofs of commercial buildings for installation of solar panels rather than residential homes .
They will also sell the energy that is produced to the businesses who agree to put up the panels .
The plan and company have the support of a heavy hitter , California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The only potential problem that I can think of with Duke Energy ’s strategy is that perhaps people who rent their roofs will be dissatisfied by the fact that they are n’t getting to use the solar energy themselves .
The pride that comes from producing and using solar energy might be part of alternative energy ’s appeal .
On the other hand , whenever people get paid for something that they do n’t use much anyway ( a roof ) , they typically are pretty happy .
So will your roof soon be part of a solar power plant ?
If its profitable and efficient , then probably so .

The Physics of Extraterrestrial Civilizations
How advanced could they possibly be ?
The late Carl Sagan once asked this question , “ What does it mean for a civilization to be a million years old ?
We have had radio telescopes and spaceships for a few decades ; our technical civilization is a few hundred years old … an advanced civilization millions of years old is as much beyond us as we are beyond a bush baby or a macaque . ”
Although any conjecture about such advanced civilizations is a matter of sheer speculation , one can still use the laws of physics to place upper and lower limits on these civilizations .
In particular , now that the laws of quantum field theory , general relativity , thermodynamics , etc. are fairly well - established , physics can impose broad physical bounds which constrain the parameters of these civilizations .
This question is no longer a matter of idle speculation .
Soon , humanity may face an existential shock as the current list of a dozen Jupiter - sized extra - solar planets swells to hundreds of earth - sized planets , almost identical twins of our celestial homeland .
This may usher in a new era in our relationship with the universe : we will never see the night sky in the same way ever again , realizing that scientists may eventually compile an encyclopedia identifying the precise co-ordinates of perhaps hundreds of earth - like planets .
Today , every few weeks brings news of a new Jupiter - sized extra - solar planet being discovered , the latest being about 15 light years away orbiting around the star Gliese 876 .
The most spectacular of these findings was photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope , which captured breathtaking photos of a planet 450 light years away being sling - shot into space by a double - star system .
But the best is yet to come .
Early in the next decade , scientists will launch a new kind of telescope , the interferome try space telescope , which uses the interference of light beams to enhance the resolving power of telescopes .
For example , the Space Interferometry Mission ( SIM ) , to be launched early in the next decade , consists of multiple telescopes placed along a 30 foot structure .
With an unprecedented resolution approaching the physical limits of optics , the SIM is so sensitive that it almost defies belief : orbiting the earth , it can detect the motion of a lantern being waved by an astronaut on Mars !
The SIM , in turn , will pave the way for the Terrestrial Planet Finder , to be launched late in the next decade , which should identify even more earth - like planets .
It will scan the brightest 1,000 stars within 50 light years of the earth and will focus on the 50 to 100 brightest planetary systems .
All this , in turn , will stimulate an active effort to determine if any of them harbor life , perhaps some with civilizations more advanced than ours .
Although it is impossible to predict the precise features of such advanced civilizations , their broad outlines can be analyzed using the laws of physics .
No matter how many millions of years separate us from them , they still must obey the iron laws of physics , which are now advanced enough to explain everything from sub-atomic particles to the large - scale structure of the universe , through a staggering 43 orders of magnitude .
Physics of Type I , II , and III Civilizations
Specifically , we can rank civilizations by their energy consumption , using the following principles :
1 ) The laws of thermodynamics .
Even an advanced civilization is bound by the laws of thermodynamics , especially the Second Law , and can hence be ranked by the energy at their disposal .
2 ) The laws of stable matter .
Baryonic matter ( e.g. based on protons and neutrons ) tends to clump into three large groupings : planets , stars and galaxies .
( This is a well - defined by product of stellar and galactic evolution , thermonuclear fusion , etc. )
Thus , their energy will also be based on three distinct types , and this places upper limits on their rate of energy consumption .
3 ) The laws of planetary evolution .
Any advanced civilization must grow in energy consumption faster than the frequency of life - threatening catastrophes ( e.g. meteor impacts , ice ages , supernovas , etc. ) .
If they grow any slower , they are doomed to extinction .
This places mathematical lower limits on the rate of growth of these civilizations .
In a seminal paper published in 1964 in the Journal of Soviet Astronomy , Russian astrophysicist Nicolai Kardashev theorized that advanced civilizations must therefore be grouped according to three types :
Type I , II , and III , which have mastered planetary , stellar and galactic forms of energy , respectively .
He calculated that the energy consumption of these three types of civilization would be separated by a factor of many billions .
But how long will it take to reach Type II and III status ?
Shorter than most realize .
Berkeley astronomer Don Goldsmith reminds us that the earth receives about one billionth of the suns energy , and that humans utilize about one millionth of that .
So we consume about one million billionth of the suns total energy .
At present , our entire planetary energy production is about 10 billion billion ergs per second .
But our energy growth is rising exponentially , and hence we can calculate how long it will take to rise to Type II or III status .
Goldsmith says , “ Look how far we have come in energy uses once we figured out how to manipulate energy , how to get fossil fuels really going , and how to create electrical power from hydropower , and so forth ; we ’ve come up in energy uses in a remarkable amount in just a couple of centuries compared to billions of years our planet has been here … and this same sort of thing may apply to other civilizations . ”
Physicist Freeman Dyson of the Institute for Advanced Study estimates that , within 200 years or so , we should attain Type I status .
In fact , growing at a modest rate of 1 % per year , Kardashev estimated that it would take only 3,200 years to reach Type II status , and 5,800 years to reach Type III status .
Living in a Type I , II , or III civilization
For example , a Type I civilization is a truly planetary one , which has mastered most forms of planetary energy .
Their energy output may be on the order of thousands to millions of times our current planetary output .
Mark
Twain once said , ” Everyone complains about the weather , but no one does anything about it . “
This may change with a Type I civilization , which has enough energy to modify the weather .
They also have enough energy to alter the course of earthquakes , volcanoes , and build cities on their oceans .
Currently , our energy output qualifies us for Type 0 status .
We derive our energy not from harnessing global forces , but by burning dead plants ( e.g. oil and coal ) .
But already , we can see the seeds of a Type I civilization .
We see the beginning of a planetary language ( English ) , a planetary communication system ( the Internet ) , a planetary economy ( the forging of the European Union ) , and even the beginnings of a planetary culture ( via mass media , TV , rock music , and Hollywood films ) .
By definition , an advanced civilization must grow faster than the frequency of life - threatening catastrophes .
Since large meteor and comet impacts take place once every few thousand years , a Type I civilization must master space travel to deflect space debris within that time frame , which should not be much of a problem .
Ice ages may take place on a time scale of tens of thousands of years , so a Type I civilization must learn to modify the weather within that time frame .
Artificial and internal catastrophes must also be negotiated .
But the problem of global pollution is only a mortal threat for a Type 0 civilization ; a Type I civilization has lived for several millennia as a planetary civilization , necessarily achieving ecological planetary balance .
Internal problems like wars do pose a serious recurring threat , but they have thousands of years in which to solve racial , national , and sectarian conflicts .
Eventually , after several thousand years , a Type I civilization will exhaust the power of a planet , and will derive their energy by consuming the entire output of their suns energy , or roughly a billion trillion trillion ergs per second .
With their energy output comparable to that of a small star , they should be visible from space .
Dyson has proposed that a Type II civilization may even build a gigantic sphere around their star to more efficiently utilize its total energy output .
Even if they try to conceal their existence , they must , by the Second Law of Thermodynamics , emit waste heat .
From outer space , their planet may glow like a Christmas tree ornament .
Dyson has even proposed looking specifically for infrared emissions ( rather than radio and TV ) to identify these Type II civilizations .
Perhaps the only serious threat to a Type II civilization would be a nearby supernova explosion , whose sudden eruption could scorch their planet in a withering blast of X - rays , killing all life forms .
Thus , perhaps the most interesting civilization is a Type III civilization , for it is truly immortal .
They have exhausted the power of a single star , and have reached for other star systems .
No natural catastrophe known to science is capable of destroying a Type III civilization .
Faced with a neighboring supernova , it would have several alternatives , such as altering the evolution of dying red giant star which is about to explode , or leaving this particular star system and terraforming a nearby planetary system .
However , there are roadblocks to an emerging Type III civilization .
Eventually , it bumps up against another iron law of physics , the theory of relativity .
Dyson estimates that this may delay the transition to a Type III civilization by perhaps millions of years .
But even with the light barrier , there are a number of ways of expanding at near - light velocities .
For example , the ultimate measure of a rockets capability is measured by something called “ specific impulse ” ( defined as the product of the thrust and the duration , measured in units of seconds ) .
Chemical rockets can attain specific impulses of several hundred to several thousand seconds .
Ion engines can attain specific impulses of tens of thousands of seconds .
But to attain near - light speed velocity , one has to achieve specific impulse of about 30 million seconds , which is far beyond our current capability , but not that of a Type III civilization .
A variety of propulsion systems would be available for sub - light speed probes ( such as ram - jet fusion engines , photonic engines , etc . )
How to Explore the Galaxy
Because distances between stars are so vast , and the number of unsuitable , lifeless solar systems so large , a Type III civilization would be faced with the next question : what is the mathematically most efficient way of exploring the hundreds of billions of stars in the galaxy ?
In science fiction , the search for inhabitable worlds has been immortalized on TV by heroic captains boldly commanding a lone star ship , or as the murderous Borg , a Type III civilization which absorbs lower Type II civilization ( such as the Federation ) .
However , the most mathematically efficient method to explore space is far less glamorous : to send fleets of “ Von Neumann probes ” throughout the galaxy ( named after John Von Neumann , who established the mathematical laws of self - replicating systems ) .
A Von Neumann probe is a robot designed to reach distant star systems and create factories which will reproduce copies themselves by the thousands .
A dead moon rather than a planet makes the ideal destination for Von Neumann probes , since they can easily land and take off from these moons , and also because these moons have no erosion .
These probes would live off the land , using naturally occurring deposits of iron , nickel , etc. to create the raw ingredients to build a robot factory .
They would create thousands of copies of themselves , which would then scatter and search for other star systems .
Similar to a virus colonizing a body many times its size , eventually there would be a sphere of trillions of Von Neumann probes expanding in all directions , increasing at a fraction of the speed of light .
In this fashion , even a galaxy 100,000 light years across may be completely analyzed within , say , a half million years .
If a Von Neumann probe only finds evidence of primitive life ( such as an unstable , savage Type 0 civilization ) they might simply lie dormant on the moon , silently waiting for the Type 0 civilization to evolve into a stable Type I civilization .
After waiting quietly for several millennia , they may be activated when the emerging Type I civilization is advanced enough to set up a lunar colony .
Physicist Paul Davies of the University of Adelaide has even raised the possibility of a Von Neumann probe resting on our own moon , left over from a previous visitation in our system aeons ago .
( If this sounds a bit familiar , that ’s because it was the basis of the film , 2001 .
Originally , Stanley Kubrick began the film with a series of scientists explaining how probes like these would be the most efficient method of exploring outer space .
Unfortunately , at the last minute , Kubrick cut the opening segment from his film , and these monoliths became almost mystical entities )
New Developments
Since Kardashev gave the original ranking of civilizations , there have been many scientific developments which refine and extend his original analysis , such as recent developments in nanotechnology , biotechnology , quantum physics , etc .
For example , nanotechnology may facilitate the development of Von Neumann probes .
As physicist Richard Feynman observed in his seminal essay , “ There ’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom , ” there is nothing in the laws of physics which prevents building armies of molecular - sized machines .
At present , scientists have already built atomic - sized curiosities , such as an atomic abacus with Buckyballs and an atomic guitar with strings about 100 atoms across .
Paul Davies speculates that a space - faring civilization could use nanotechnology to build miniature probes to explore the galaxy , perhaps no bigger than your palm .
Davies says , “ The tiny probes I ’m talking about will be so inconspicuous that it ’s no surprise that we have n’t come across one .
It ’s not the sort of thing that you ’re going to trip over in your back yard .
So if that is the way technology develops , namely , smaller , faster , cheaper and if other civilizations have gone this route , then we could be surrounded by surveillance devices . ”
Furthermore , the development of biotechnology has opened entirely new possibilities .
These probes may act as life - forms , reproducing their genetic information , mutating and evolving at each stage of reproduction to enhance their capabilities , and may have artificial intelligence to accelerate their search .
Also , information theory modifies the original Kardashev analysis .
The current SETI project only scans a few frequencies of radio and TV emissions sent by a Type 0 civilization , but perhaps not an advanced civilization .
Because of the enormous static found in deep space , broadcasting on a single frequency presents a serious source of error .
Instead of putting all your eggs in one basket , a more efficient system is to break up the message and smear it out over all frequencies ( e.g. via Fourier like transform ) and then reassemble the signal only at the other end .
In this way , even if certain frequencies are disrupted by static , enough of the message will survive to accurately reassemble the message via error correction routines .
However , any Type 0 civilization listening in on the message on one frequency band would only hear nonsense .
In other words , our galaxy could be teeming with messages from various Type II and III civilizations , but our Type 0 radio telescopes would only hear gibberish .
Lastly , there is also the possibility that a Type II or Type III civilization might be able to reach the fabled Planck energy with their machines ( 10^19 billion electron volts ) .
This is energy is a quadrillion times larger than our most powerful atom smasher .
This energy , as fantastic as it may seem , is ( by definition ) within the range of a Type II or III civilization .
The Planck energy only occurs at the center of black holes and the instant of the Big Bang .
But with recent advances in quantum gravity and superstring theory , there is renewed interest among physicists about energies so vast that quantum effects rip apart the fabric of space and time .
Although it is by no means certain that quantum physics allows for stable wormholes , this raises the remote possibility that a sufficiently advanced civilizations may be able to move via holes in space , like Alice ’s Looking Glass .
And if these civilizations can successfully navigate through stable wormholes , then attaining a specific impulse of a million seconds is no longer a problem .
They merely take a short - cut through the galaxy .
This would greatly cut down the transition between a Type II and Type III civilization .
Second , the ability to tear holes in space and time may come in handy one day .
Astronomers , analyzing light from distant supernovas , have concluded recently that the universe may be accelerating , rather than slowing down .
If this is true , there may be an anti-gravity force ( perhaps Einstein ’s cosmological constant ) which is counteracting the gravitational attraction of distant galaxies .
But this also means that the universe might expand forever in a Big Chill , until temperatures approach near - absolute zero .
Several papers have recently laid out what such a dismal universe may look like .
It will be a pitiful sight : any civilization which survives will be desperately huddled next to the dying embers of fading neutron stars and black holes .
All intelligent life must die when the universe dies .
Contemplating the death of the sun , the philosopher Bertrand Russel once wrote perhaps the most depressing paragraph in the English language : “ … All the labors of the ages , all the devotion , all the inspiration , all the noonday brightness of human genius , are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system , and the whole temple of Mans achievement must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of a universe in ruins … ”
Today , we realize that sufficiently powerful rockets may spare us from the death of our sun 5 billion years from now , when the oceans will boil and the mountains will melt .
But how do we escape the death of the universe itself ?
Astronomer John Barrows of the University of Sussex writes , “ Suppose that we extend the classification upwards .
Members of these hypothetical civilizations of Type IV , V , VI , … and so on , would be able to manipulate the structures in the universe on larger and larger scales , encompassing groups of galaxies , clusters , and superclusters of galaxies . ”
Civilizations beyond
Type III may have enough energy to escape our dying universe via holes in space .
Lastly , physicist Alan Guth of MIT , one of the originators of the inflationary universe theory , has even computed the energy necessary to create a baby universe in the laboratory ( the temperature is 1,000 trillion degrees , which is within the range of these hypothetical civilizations ) .
Of course , until someone actually makes contact with an advanced civilization , all of this amounts to speculation tempered with the laws of physics , no more than a useful guide in our search for extra-terrestrial intelligence .
But one day , many of us will gaze at the encyclopedia containing the coordinates of perhaps hundreds of earth - like planets in our sector of the galaxy .
Then we will wonder , as Sagan did , what a civilization a millions years ahead of ours will look like …

Background
I ’m a long - time Emacs user who is new to the under - the - hood side of things .
I recently started learning EmacsLisp and writing my own Emacs extensions .
I like sitting in IRC channels devoted to technical subjects I ’m interested in , so I found #emacs and started hanging out there .
It was not long before I discovered the Terrible Secrets of the Emacs community : EmacsLisp Sucks and Emacs Is Dying .
This caused me a great deal of consternation and confusion , because I love Emacs and had recently become quite fond of EmacsLisp , so much so that I was toying with learning LISP as a standalone language .
I tried to get more information , but “ What do you mean , ‘ EmacsLisp sucks ’ ? ” was more often than not met with a reply which seemed either elliptical , tautological , or a non sequiteur , at least to someone with my level of understanding of the issues ( none ) [ 1 ] .
Common replies :
EmacsLisp is n’t Scheme
EmacsLisp does n’t have lexical scoping ( it does since 2011 )
EmacsLisp is n’t CommonLisp
EmacsLisp is n’t Haskell
The Emacs APIs suck
EmacsLisp is n’t multithreaded / lacks coroutines ( programs like Gnus can make everything stall )
Do you mean EmacsLisp - the - language or EmacsLisp - the - library ?
Steve Yegge wrote a blog post contrasting JavaScript and Elisp : http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/11/ejacs-javascript-interpreter-for-emacs.html
In it , he idenitifies problems with Elisp :
Problem # 1 : Momentum
Problem # 2 : No encapsulation
Problem # 3 : No delegation
Problem # 4 : Properties
Problem # 5 : No polymorphic toString
EmacsLisp Is n't Scheme
This , from my highly unscientific sample , is far and away the most popular reason EmacsLisp sucks .
Well , that ’s good to know .
EmacsLisp is also not Perl , or COBOL , or IBM 1130 assembler , or a bicycle , or an orange .
Thanks for the help !
I did n’t know Scheme – and in fact do not now claim to know Scheme , though I have begun working through SICP – and to my untrained eye , the main difference between EmacsLisp and Scheme was that Scheme required hitting the shift key a lot more ( #t , # f , set ! , predicate ? , etc ) .
Further inquiry eventually yielded the conclusion that this reason is really just a restatement of “ EmacsLisp does n’t have lexical scoping ” [ 2 ] .
That conclusion is not justified .
There ’s a great deal of difference between Scheme and EmacsLisp beyond just the question of lexical scoping .
As the OP mentions in passing , but then ignores , there ’s the fact that nil is n’t false in Scheme , but is in CommonLisp and EmacsLisp .
Scheme has a stylistic convention of marking destructive operations with an exclamation point and predicates ( boolean functions ) with a question mark ; again noted in the OP .
I ’m not sure the latter is so significant , but the former indicates a stigmatization of side - effecting in the Scheme community , more closely wedded to function programming concepts , that we certainly do n’t see in EmacsLisp .
Scheme is a Lisp - 1 , sharing the same namespace for variable and function definitions , so that the name list must be bound ( at least locally ) either to a function , or a variable , but not both .
In a Lisp - 2 , you can use the same name for both a function and a variable .
EmacsLisp Is n't CommonLisp / Haskell / Other
I do n’t know enough about any of these to offer any informed commentary , except to note that aside from Common Lisp , they all seems to be edge cases that either no one supports seriously , or only one or two people in the universe actually want .
Comment :
That ’s blowing Haskell ’s uncommonness way out of proportion .
It may not be very widespread in industry yet , but you could just have a look at the IRC channel , the mailing lists or hackage to debunk “ one or two people in the universe ” , even taking hyperbole into account 😊
The Emacs APIs Suck
I heard this a lot as well , but I have no idea what exactly is being referred to .
Elucidation greatly appreciated .
My wild guess would be “ because they ’re not OO ” , which does n’t really bother me , but can be seen as a problem given the typical Java - centric way people are taught CS in the US .
The APIs related to match data are an example .
Instead of returning a data structure of the match results ( eg from a call to match - string ) , the match results are mutated in global memory and accessed in separate function calls .
This is both less functional in style and more error prone .
For example , if save - match - data is not used appropriately , then library functions can trample on the match data which a higher level function is in the middle of using .
Do You Mean EmacsLisp ( Language ) Or EmacsLisp ( Library ) ?
I do n’t know .
Which do you , the EmacsLisp detractor , mean ?
Most people seem to hate EmacsLisp - the - language , but the primary obstacle to replacing EmacsLisp is , of course , EmacsLisp - the - library .
30 + years and 80 + megabytes of Emacs functionality , all in EmacsLisp .
Redoing even the core editing functions is a terrifying thought to me [ 4 ] .
Who Is EmacsLisp For ? Who Wants EmacsLisp Dead ?
This is the larger question I referred to in the Scheme section .
I ca n’t say for sure , but my gut feeling is that most of the people who are unhappy with EmacsLisp are the people who are using Emacs as an application development platform rather than as an extensible editor .
I am , of course , aware of the kitchen - sink nature of Emacs , and revel in it .
I know that the design of Emacs evolved in the time when a programmer only had access to a single terminal session to a computer , thus becoming in effect the world ’s first Integrated Development Environment so a user could meet all their needs without dropping in and out of their primary application : the editor .
But I believe there is a difference between making Emacs read mail or news or have a shell because you needed to in the 1970s and making Emacs browse web sites or act as an httpd because you can in the 2000s .
I wonder if perhaps the people who want to fix all of EmacsLisp ’s problems want to do so more for their own benefit – so it will be a better general - purpose development base and toolkit – than to make Emacs better for everyone .
I wonder if they have lost sight of the primary application : the editor [ 5 ] .
Conclusion
This is meant to be polemic but not dogmatic [ 6 ] .
I have stated my observations , opinions , and conclusions , but I have done this to show my point of view and lack of full understanding rather than to try and convince others that I am correct .
I am not against fixing or replacing EmacsLisp , but I have yet to see any logical , thorough , and cogent arguments for it .
Therefore : get to arguing !
-- ShawnBoyette
Other commonly - named problems
No namespaces / modules / packages .
This leads to dozens of functions that all start with e.g. “ dired - ” , even inside the library itself .
No object system ( CLOS ) .
This remark is n’t really true - there ’s eieio - but the basic point is that the whole design is n’t object oriented ( it ’s debateable wether that ’s a worthwhile goal )
Related to this , there ’s no way to create a new abstract type that ’s disjoint from other types ( e.g. vectorp does n’t return t on those , for example ) .
Other than for “ conceptual purity ” or something , why is this relevant ?
i.e. why would you pass an object to code that expects an ordinary vector , and expect that code to distinguish this case and treat it correctly ?
No concurrency .
Dynamic scoping really bites here , btw .
The regular expressions are clumsy , especially when stored as strings ( call this “ EmacsLisp is not perl ” , if you like ) : http://obsidianrook.com/devnotes/whinery/elisp-regexps.html
Pipeline 's Commentary
[ 1 ]
The last sentence of this paragraph is especially telling .
The author has :
A special love for Emacs
Never experimented with any lisp besides EmacsLisp .
Only “ toyed with ” the idea of learning lisp .
[ 2 ]
Scheme is a standard lisp dialect , easier to implement than CL , partly because it ’s smaller , partly because the standard was written with optimization in mind .
In contrast , CL was written with commonality in mind .
Important differences include a focus on tail recursion and CPS optimization .
I think Scheme used to not have keyword arguments , but I ’m no longer sure about that one .
Some Scheme implementations , notably my favorite Gambit - C , have keywords .
It ’s not specified in R5RS or IEEE .
- JoelAdamson
I think one may sum up the “ EmacsLisp is n’t < foo > ” problems pretty simply .
EmacsLisp appears quite similar to other lisp dialects , but it has enough “ gotchas ” and differences to frustrate the beginning EmacsLisp programmer very badly .
There ’s tons of people with some understanding of scheme or lisp , but relatively few who really get into EmacsLisp .
I expect that many EmacsLisp programmers are like me , desperately trying to apply knowledge of another language .
Part of this problem is that twenty years ago , lisp programmers were accustomed to widely varying dialects .
Today , most Lisp dialects are quite similar .
EmacsLisp looks like an aberration if one does not consider its history .
[ 3 ]
A tremendous number of emacs extensions are both large and complex , even untenably so .
[ 4 ]
This is partly because , as you pointed out , dynamic scoping makes large projects “ interesting . ”
Is it not a sign of EmacsLisp ’s flaws that we ’re all desperately afraid of an attempt to rewrite EmacsLisp libraries ?
[ 5 ]
As you pointed out , Emacs is not primarily an editor , it ’s known first and foremost as a “ kitchen sink . ”
There ’s a reason that the first word in its name is “ Extensible . ”
I feel I should also mention a popular Microsoft anecdote .
Microsoft , at some point in its office research , discovered that any given feature is really only used by a insignificant fraction of users – but if it ’s taken out , that individually insignificant fraction becomes irate .
By the time you trim Word down to its “ primary application , ” you ’ve lost 99 % of its users .
I just wish to clarify that I was not pointing out that Emacs is not primarily an editor when mentioning the kitchen sink .
My point is that Emacs should be regarded as an editor first and foremost .

Isnt the first word in the name actually “ Editor ? ”

Utis ' Commentary
ad Pipeline 's Commentary [ 2 ]
Scheme is probably easier to implement than CL , because it is much , much smaller .
But I definitely would n’t say that its standard has been written with optimization in mind .
Following the book “ Lisp in Small Pieces ” , the existence of continuations as first class objects alone implies a performance penalty ; likewise the fact that the first element of a form has to be evaluated , possibly at runtime ; likewise the fact that scheme programs may overwrite built in functions .
I guess that modern compiler techniques may be able to deal with that , I do n’t know .
But it is definitely not easy .
ad the OP 's topic " EmacsLisp Does n't Have Lexical Scoping "
EmacsLisp ’s lack of lexical scoping is n’t so much a matter of writing and maintaining large and complex programs .
The byte compiler does warn you , if you access a dynamically bound variable outside of its let - form .
You have to add a variable declaration in order to get rid of that warning .
There are two other reasons why I , at least , want lexical scoping : 1 ) it allows faster variable bindings and better optimization techniques .
Introducing lexical scoping could vastly improve EmacsLisp ’s speed .
In fact the slowness of creating a dynamical environment urges people ( myself included ) to use such ugly constructs as ( let ( var ) ( while < condition > ( setq var … ) ) ) .
This wo n’t be necessary with lexical scoping .
2 ) Lexical scoping is a requirement for closures .
Closures would allow for a lot of very useful programming techniques .
In that context : ad Pipeline ’s comment [ 4 ] :
I explained above , why I fail to see that EmacsLisp ’s dynamical scoping “ makes large projects ‘ interesting ’ ” .
I hardly recall any problem comming up in emacs - devel or gnu.emacs.help that could have been attributed to dynamical scoping .
So this point would require some extra arguments .
After all , Emacs is a very large project .
Moreover , I do n’t understand why that would anybody make afraid of rewriting an EmacsLisp library in a different language – presumably one that does provide lexical scoping .
ad the OP 's topic " Who Is EmacsLisp For ? Who Wants EmacsLisp Dead ? "
I strongly agree with Pipeline here .
What does “ editor ” mean for the OP ?
Just writing ASCII text ?
Just writing text / plain in general ?
Just writing text / plain and offering special support for programming source code ?
Does “ just an editor ” include functionality like Tramp ( for remotely accessing files ) ?
If yes , why does n’t it include a newsreader ?
For me most of the so - called “ kitchen - sink ” stuff is simply part of an editor .
There is a big benefit in having everything in a unified environment with a common user interfacec .
If my editor would not provide functionality to read mail and news , then I ’d drop it and look for a mail reader that let ’s me edit programming text .
In fact what the OP is attacking here is that Emacs is an Emacs , and not just an Emacs - like editor .
ad EmacsLisp in general
I did n’t know that “ Emacs is dying ” is a Terrible Secret of the Emacs community .
If so then they have n’t told me in all those years .
Well , yes , EmacsLisp sucks .
And at the same time : EmacsLisp is a very nice language .
A contradiction ?
Well , EmacsLisp is just lacking a few features and I ’d wish by heart that they were introduced to that language : a few problems are mentioned above .
But the most important problem is : speed .
EmacsLisp ( or rather its implementation , but that amounts to the same here ) is too slow .
Closures are lacking , too .
Yes , a deeply integrated , efficient object - system would be necessary , too .
Oh , and modules or a package system .
And , as a personal wish of mine : tail call reduction .
So , I agree : EmacsLisp could and should be improved .
But that does n’t mean that we need to replace it with something else .

Why Emacs Should Die ( a.k.a Death Rebirth Revolution [ 1 ] )
Second of Terrible Secrets is discussed so often I doubt it ’s a secret any longer ( maybe it ’s fact it ’s secret that ’s Terrible Secret 😊 ) .
So here are my reasons why I want to see current Emacs code thrown out the window and rewritten ( and most importantly , redesigned ) from scratch .
What we want to retain is Emacs - the - project , Emacs - the - team , Emacs - the - community , Emacs - the - spirit , and also , Emacs - the - name 😊.
But actual source code should be redone , because :
Emacs is extensible , yet its core is horrible example of one of most inflexible designs I have ever seen in use .
Let just one word suffice : fringes .
Options allowing to influence them in any way were introduced only in CVS , and still all you can do is use them for predefined you ’re - debugging - this - line indicator .
Another example is that you ca n’t advice built - in function ( you partly can , but only in EmacsLisp invocations , core will continue to use unadviced one ) .
In general , your ability to do anything with builtins is most often void or negligible .
After all these years , you still have to do full edit .c file – save – recompile – try cycle to change core even in slightest detail .
You cannot change it , you can not extend it .
No dynamic modules , no FFI , and ( AFAICU ) if you dump image with particular set of EmacsLisp preloaded , you ’re stuck with that EmacsLisp in effect forever
You ca n’t use anything besides C for core .
This , in advent of .
NET - like runtimes , and era of omnipresent bindings , is Not Nice ( TM ) .
I ’d really like to be able to use python for that , and maybe one day seamlessly interface Emacs with .NET runtime ( if nothing else , just for introspection data you can get for free in .NET / Java , it ’s really kinda necessary when writing in environment that consist almost 100 % of library functions and classes ) EmacsLisp ( as it is today ) really sucks .
It has loads of small annoyances , my personal pet peeve is lack of anything near concurrency .
And I do n’t even use Gnus ( if I did , I suppose I ’d kill for any threads in EmacsLisp ; ) .
I do n’t know how that ’s usually done in “ big ” Lisps , but I presume CL has to have threads or equivalent primitive .
What I envision is ultra small and lean core , that does only one thing - allows extensions to interface each other , binary objects and Lisp - written alike .
Ideally , there should n’t be any difference between C and Lisp code , each should be overridable and changable by outside .
This way , you could plug in different display engines on console and X , making it possible to introduce for example structured graphics manipulation primitives ( another long - time wish of mine ) .
That means to see and manipulate pretty UML figures , I do n’t need to leave Emacs , and I can still use all the graphics capabilities offered by X I use , without making life hard for console users .
And plugging Emacs into .NET would be matter of one extension that bridges between Emacs binary and runtime .
Incidentally , that seems to be design employed by MonoDevelop / SharpDevelop IDE running on .NET , where core has astonishing size of 23KB , and everything else ( including GUI ) is a plugin .
Yes , I know it ’s not small undertaking .
But I ca n’t see how could Emacs survive and grow in its current incarnation ( unless we are content with I ’m - too - hardcore - to - move - from - console users only and no new souls coming )
That ’s my 3 cents , hope I was clear enough and managed not to offend anyone 😊.
Oh , and I do n’t say everyone and their dog have to use .NET for everything , I just say that modern programmer ’s editor needs to be able to do that , or will get forgotten in world of runtimes everywhere .

Spirit's comment
Mathrick , you will want Eclipse . 😊
Seriously , I tried that a few months ago .
Still have the core but not much functionality .
I ’m not sure where such elementary things , like buffers , are supposed to be in that design .
There ’s one single static plugin , which can hold scripting engines , which in turn use the core library to communicate with each other .
Different window systems are no problem at all , since you can just plug them in ( need a streamlined interface though ) .
But then … there ’s Eclipse and I think it does all of the above minus console modes ( and it ’s slow ) .

blandest 's comment
I ’v been using Gnus for a short period of time ( less than 2 months ) and found the lack of threads quite annoying .
The only hack that I could come up with was to make an idle timer that will scan for new mail once every 30 seconds or so .
There is also a 3 minutes delay between consecutive scans to avoid useless request to the mail server .
How hard would it be to add only one background thread that runs these idle tasks ?
( We do n’t need Emacs to be a scalable , multi - threaded web server 😊)
I guess it ’s the same thing as adding support for any number of threads …

pro-emacs comment
I think it ’s quite funny that people never take into account the empirically observable reality .
It ’s like falling and staying in love with comunism besides real history .
Almost any kind of application I can think of , when there is an emacs mode for it , its always best in class .
Going back from Emacs to other editors / IDE ’s is like going back to the stoneage .
If Scheme is so great - why is there no proof of it ?
Why is it possible to realize really complex extensions like org- mode and gnus in EmacsLisp , if it sucks so much ?
Where are better extensible programs in Java , Phyton , whatever ?
I think it ’s fun to program in Emacs Lisp , a huge project with a long history in this language yielded an unsurpassed piece of software ( Emacs ) - it ca n’t be bad , it must be very suitable for the task at hand .

someone in the future comments
I am in the future , and here we first have Sublime Text become the absolute most popular editor with a Python interface , and then came Atom by Github in CoffeeScript / JavaScript , and VS Code by Microsoft in TypeScript .
This is a future where JavaScript dominates .
Lispy people can still extend Atom by ClojureScript , and some proclaim it be the Emacs of the new generation .
The new trend is to do all UI stuff in Web terms , so that Atom ’s CSV extension comes with a full fledged table editor .
-- One from the future
EmacsLisp is not a general purpose language
Get over it .
Emacs lisp is designed to be an extension language for Emacs editor .
It is ridiculous to compare EmacsLisp to Haskel , Scheme and Common Lisp .
-- unlocksmith
What about Emacs Lisp 2 ?
There are several common misconceptions voiced here
“ Better ” Lisps have concurrency .
Nope , not really .
They do in practice ( because you ca n’t really not have it in 21 ’st century ) , but the standard has nothing to say about it .
This is really up to the implementation to provide this feature ( for now at least ) .
Scheme is a lot simpler than Common Lisp .
Even if true , not by much .
In the end of the day , you will still find yourself needing the same tools .
In one instance those will come from the standard library , in another instance those will come from a library developed by community .
There are more developers in Scheme or Common Lisp than there are people writing Emacs Lisp .
Not according to Github statistics at least .
If anything , of all Lisps ( unless you count JavaScript ) , Emacs Lisp seems to be the most popular one .
Ahem .
It ’s not popular due to its features , but because it serves a purpose no other language can ( being the scripting language of Emacs ) .
I think I read somewhere about the history of Emacs Lisp , and I think that Stallman said so himself that many of the language - related decisions were motivated by the simplicity and the implementation and the time it would take to come up with one as well as the presence of the practical problems the language had to address .
In other words , in a sense , Emacs Lisp was ( and still is ) a prototype language , and as such it did an unthinkably good job .
But there are some roadblocks , where the development of the language seems to have come to a stand - still because the change / update will require things to be thrown away .
In my view , these problems are
Performance .
There ’s really so much you can do with an interpreted language .
In order to manage large projects on par with other modern editors the language needs to do better .
Emacs Lisp needs an optimizing compiler .
I think that LLVM might be a good target to compile to .
Concurrency model .
Not just threads and other low - level tools needed for synchronization or mutual exclusion ( I ’d even prefer that those be hidden from sight ) , but a thought - through system based on either Actors model , or Concurrent C / Ada , or maybe something else , genuinely new ?
Collections .
Good programs must have good tools to work with data .
This , again , means that there needs to be a system , a good design : perhaps , like iterators in C++ , or perhaps such as Java collections , or maybe look into functional data types ?
Whichever way it will be , it ’ll be still better than the current state , where one ca n’t even iterate over two hash - tables at once .
Interface with the outside world .
If CFFI seems like a threat , than , perhaps , a different mechanism ?
Security ?
It ’s not always appropriate to trust the code written by other people blindly .
Some concept of sandboxes would be nice for loading semi/ untrusted code .
Modules ( information hiding in general ) .
Types ?
On one hand these make programs more difficult to write , on the other hand , these make them compile better .

The tech industry is reducing its environmental impact with everything from cleaner manufacturing processes to reducing package sizes on retail shelves .
While Apple 's scores from organizations like Greenpeace are improving , the company is still lagging a bit behind other brands like Dell and Panasonic .
Still , that is n't stopping consumers from perceiving Apple as the most eco-friendly tech brand .
In a new study from The Diffusion Group and recounted by redOrbit , nearly one - third of the adult Internet users picked Apple as the champion of economically friendly technology .
In this survey 's second and third place were Dell and HP at 21 and 15 percent , respectively .
These perceptions vary significantly from the actual environmental scores in Greenpeace 's September " Guide to Green Electronics . "
This was the ninth edition of Greenpeace 's evaluation of market leaders ' policies and practices on toxic chemicals , recycling , and energy .
Apple 's current score is a 4.1 out of 10 , which places the company behind Sony , Toshiba , Dell , Acer , HP , and Panasonic .
It should come as no surprise that Apple 's Jekyll & Hyde - like image of being a famously quiet but friendly company is cited for this misconception .
In addition to highly - publicized statements like Steve Jobs ' " A Greener Apple , " things like Apple 's slick marketing and cardboard - slimming package design probably contribute to Apple 's image of being the most eco-friendly tech company when it clearly is not .

It ’s a pretty common requirement these days to send a nicely formatted email , yet I ’ve come across very few “ nice ” solutions .
The solution I ’ve come to use is simple , and documented across the web , but rarely used in the real world .
The most common code I see ( and what I used to write back in the days of . NET1.0 powered dinosaurs roaming the earth ) revolves around ugly use of the StringBuilder :
MailBody .
Append ( " < html >< head ></ head >< body >
" ) ; MailBody .
Append ( " < span style= \ " font - size : 11 px ; font - family : Verdana , Helvetica , sans - serif\ " >
Hi , < br >< br > Your account information as it has been retrieved from the database :</ span><br>< br >
" ) ; MailBody .
Append ( " < div style= \ " font - size : 11 px ; font - family : Verdana , Helvetica , sans - serif\ " > Username : " + UserData .
Username + " < br >< br > " + " Password : " + UserData .
Password + " </div >
" ) ; MailBody .
Append ( " </ body ></html > " ) ;
Ugly .
Unmaintainable .
Instead , create a user control for your email template using standard ASP .
NET controls :
< %@ Control Language= " C# " AutoEventWireup=" true " CodeBehind= " PasswordRecovery.ascx.cs "
Inherits = " SampleApp.WebUI.EmailTemplates.PasswordRecovery " %> < h1 > Password Recovery </ h1 > < p >
Your new password is < asp : Literal ID = " NewPassword " runat = " server " /> . </ p >
Expose a property for each value that you need to include in the email :
public string Password { get { return NewPassword .
Text ; } set { NewPassword .
Text = value ; } }
Now just render the control on demand :
private string RenderControl ( Control control ) { StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder ( ) ; StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter ( stringBuilder ) ; HtmlTextWriter htmlTextWriter = new HtmlTextWriter ( stringWriter ) ; control.RenderControl(htmlTextWriter ) ; return stringBuilder .
ToString ( ) ; }
How simple is that . 🙂
UPDATE : I should mention how to instantiate the control – just calling the default constructor is n’t good enough as you ’ll find that all of your controls are null .
This is the magic line you ’ll need :
EmailTemplates.MembershipApplication emailTemplate = ( EmailTemplates.MembershipApplication ) LoadControl( " ~/EmailTemplates/MembershipApplication.ascx " ) ;

Fiddler crab chimneys keep intruders out
Australian researchers have found that fiddler crabs build chimneys around their burrows to keep intruders out .
A team at the Australian National University in Canberra reports its findings on Uca capricornis in the journal Biology Letters .
Fiddler crabs live on tidal mudflats and lock themselves away in air - filled sealed burrows when the tide comes in , says team member Rachel Slatyer , a behavioural ecology student , who carried out the research under the supervision of Dr Patricia Blackwell .
She says a small percentage of these burrows are surrounded by mud mounds , or chimneys , and biologists have long wondered why this is so .
Slatyer and colleagues studied 70 crabs at a site in Darwin and tried to detect differences between those that build chimneys and those that do n't , hoping the difference might shed light on the role of the chimneys .
They studied how much time crabs spent in and out of their burrows , how far they travelled from their burrows , and how much time they spent feeding or having aggressive interactions .
The only difference the researchers noticed was that those with chimneys did n't feed as much as those who did n't have chimneys .
The team hypothesised crabs that built chimneys did n't need to eat as much because they already had enough food - and thus enough energy to build chimneys .
Other crabs appeared to not have enough food , and had to spend their time and energy looking for more food rather than building chimneys , says Slatyer .
Intruders
Slatyer and colleagues then conducted an experiment to see what impact chimneys had on keeping intruders out of burrows .
Crabs generally try to defend their burrows , says Slatyer , and if they find themselves taken away from their own burrows they will attempt to hide in someone elses .
So the researchers set up plastic arenas around burrows , some of which had chimneys and some of which did n't .
They put a foreign crab into the arena and then measured the time it took them to find the burrow .
" Most of the time they did n't find the burrows with a chimney at all , " says Slatyer .
" It was quite surprising . "
The researchers conclude that it is possible that some crabs build chimneys to conceal the entrance of their burrows and reduce the risk of losing it to an intruder .
Slatyer says it is possibile that only some " classes " of fiddler crabs build and therefore understand the significance of chimneys , but further research would be required to investigate this .
Gender preference
Previous research on different species of fiddler crabs , have found that chimneys are built by reproductive males , who use chimneys to attract females and hide females they have mated with .
But Slatyer says , young U. capricornis crabs , as well as reproductive crabs built burrows , and female fiddler crabs were more likely to build chimneys than males .
Importantly , rather than being used to attract other crabs , the chimneys built by U. capricornis seem to hide the burrow , she says .
" It appears these structures can have a lot of functions even though they look similar to us , " says Slatyer .

The first analysis of genetic diversity in a modern agricultural commodity has returned some disturbing news : Market - driven chicken farming has produced a race of genetically homogeneous fowl in dire need of new blood .
Industrial chickens , bred to grow big and fast , have lost about half of the genetic variation found in their wild counterparts .
The precise role of each lost variant is n't known , but many likely affect resistance to disease .
Until now , the system has worked — but the evolutionary clock could be ticking .
" New diseases , or mutations of old ones , occur all the time .
Nature overcomes those new challenges by creating new defenses from existing genetic variability , " said Purdue University animal geneticist Bill Muir , lead author of a study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
If commercial breeders do n't introduce new stock , said Muir , " genetic variability will be exhausted . "
Commercial chicken farming relies primarily on just three breeds — the
White Leghorn , Rhode Island Red and Indian Game .
A single bird can produce 200 offspring ; breeding populations are kept small and isolated , and a few chickens ' genes can soon spread through millions of birds .
This never - ending cycle of inbreeding has made possible a $ 26 - billion industry capable of producing one million birds an hour and 75 billion eggs each year in the United States alone , accounting for nearly half of all consumed meat .
In financial terms the industry is healthy , but there are warning signs .
The avian lucosis virus , a fast - spreading and highly lethal hybrid of old and new chicken viruses first identified in 1988 , has already put several poultry breeding companies out of business .
Avian influenza has wreaked havoc on poultry in many parts of the world , and security experts see domestic food production as a prime target for bioterrorists .
What 's needed , argue Muir and Hans Cheng , United States Department of Agriculture avian disease specialist and co-author of the study , is an infusion of genetic material from chickens outside the industry , especially those bred by small farmers in the developing world .
The standards of commercial farming wo n't be easy to crack , but it 's necessary .
" This will take much time and effort , " said Muir , " but it 's an insurance policy on the future . "
The hardest part may be selling companies on a new approach to breeding .
Even if fresh breeds are n't introduced directly but rather bred separately until ready to go commercial , they will almost certainly grow more slowly than standard chickens , whose lives have been compressed into a fraction of their natural span , and have physiques dictated by consumer preference .
" Using the same production systems , the food conversion and growth rate would be slower , " said University of Bristol veterinary scientist Toby
Knowles , who was not involved in the study .
If demand for high - growth , high - speed chickens is n't tempered , the problem of genetic homogeneity might also be delayed rather than solved , with the latest birds entering the cycle of intensive inbreeding .
But Knowles noted that growing numbers of consumers now want meat grown and produced in healthier ways .
" Highly intensive systems are likely to become less sustainable when there is consumer resistance , " he said .
Once the chicken problem is fixed , scientists might move on to other menu items .
" The same concern exists for other commercially developed livestock species , such as dairy cattle and swine , " said Muir .
" They have had a similar domestication history but with perhaps even smaller breeding sizes . "

Obama discusses the future of the economy and corrects McCain on which campaign is tied to the fiscal crisis .
OBAMA : Now I ’ve got to correct a little bit of Senator McCain ’s history , not surprisingly , but let ’s first of all understand that the biggest problem in this whole process was the deregulation of the financial system .
Senator McCain as recently as March bragged about the fact that he is a deregulator .
On the other hand two years ago I said we ’ve got a subprime lending crisis that has to be dealt with , I wrote to Secretary Paulson , I wrote to Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and told them this is something we have to deal with and nobody did anything about it .
A year ago I went to Wall Street and told them we have to re-regulate .
The interruption in American - controlled access to space rankles some in Washington , including Senator Bill Nelson of Florida , a leading proponent of the space program .
In an interview , Mr. Nelson said it was “ inexcusable ” for the country ’s space program to be put in a position of dependence on such a politically volatile partner .
“ We ’ve got a Russian prime minister who believes he ’s czar , ” he said of Vladimir Putin , referring to Russia ’s military action in Georgia .
The United States has had periods in which its astronauts could not reach space : from the end of the Apollo program in 1975 to the beginning of shuttle flights in 1981 , and for more than two years after the loss of the shuttles Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003 .
But the coming interval could be the longest if the rollout of NASA ’s new rockets is significantly delayed .
Even though the outlines of the gap have been known since soon after Dr. Griffin began running the agency in 2005 , Cmdr. Scott J. Kelly of the Navy , an astronaut who has made two trips to orbit , warned in April that the prospect of a United States that could not send humans into space on its own rockets would come as a shock .
“ A large part of the American public is going to be surprised , ” he said , adding that people would cry , “ Who let that happen ? ”

The Politics
The Bush administration chose to give up the nation ’s own access to space for five years and move to the next phase of space travel .
The administration decided to retire the shuttles and in January 2004 announced a sweeping “ vision for space exploration . ”
Under the plan , NASA would stop using the aging and risky shuttle fleet and move to a new launching program , Constellation , built around Ares rockets and Orion capsules that are designed to return astronauts to the Moon and even to explore near - Earth asteroids and Mars .
To get from one program to the other without inflating NASA ’s $ 17 billion annual budget , the administration decided to wind down the shuttle program and ramp up Constellation .
The decision has always been portrayed as difficult , but in recent months , criticism has flared .
The Republican and Democratic presidential candidates , for example , have pledged to keep America flying .
Dominic Grieve , Shadow home secretary , said : " These proposals would mark a substantial shift in the powers of the state to obtain personal information on individuals .
The Government must present convincing justification for such an exponential increase in the powers of the state . "
Hello !
Today I ’m here to talk about a new revolutionary product which has totally changed the way I sleep .
So , let me first tell you a bit about my story .
A while ago , I was desperate .
I was snoring like crazy .
In fact , I snored so loud that I even woke myself up at night .
It was terrible , my wife could n’t sleep so she started using the couch .
It was when my wife started sleeping out of our bed that I decided to do something about it .
That ’s when my crusade began .
I started trying every single product out there .
Nothing worked .
Some were definitely a scam and others were too uncomfortable and I just could n’t use them .
Things changed when I tried Zyppah RX .
The first thing that caught my mind about this product was that it came in vibrant colors .
The product seemed too good to be true so I asked myself :
What if Zyppah RX is a scam ?
However , I had nothing to lose .
I went on and try it and let me tell you that it is the best product out there since it focuses on treating the two main issues related to snoring .
Now that you ’ve read the Zyppah RX review , you can make a conscious decision .
I encourage you to go on and try it .
Trust me , it will change your life .
A loved - up man proposed to his girlfriend using an a capella choir in the middle of Sainsbury ’s Clapham yesterday .
Neil Chandler , 36 , surprised Kaajal Barot , 28 , in the fruit and veg section by bursting into It Must Be Love by Madness .
Miss Barot watched in astonishment as choir members posing as shoppers joined in while Mr Chandler popped the question .
He said : “ Kaajal said to me that she wanted me to surprise her and I thought if I flew her to somewhere dramatic or if I took her to a fancy restaurant she would know and it would be heavy on the pocket book .
“ So I decided instead to spring it on her in Sainsbury ’s , where we come every Sunday . ”
“ I had wanted to be completely surprised , and I was , ” Miss Barot added .
“ We are going to have a big red and gold Indian wedding . ”
Mr Chandler , of Sandmere Road , Clapham has been secretly practising for weeks with Kitsch In Sync , a volunteer choir based in London Bridge .
He said he had been nervous on his way to the Clapham High Street store , but but luckily she said “ yes ” and accepted the diamond ring .
The couple met when Miss Barot , from Penwortham Road in Streatham , was a student temping at the Daily Star Sunday , where Mr Chandler is a journalist .
After five - and - a- half years he decided to propose in style , but Miss Barot , who is now a doctor , was too busy at Northwick Park Hospital in Middlesex to notice him sneaking off to rehersals .
Watch the proposal
Mr Chandler added : “ I started off confident about the proposal , but when I told people about it , they said ‘ you must be confident ’ , which made me start worrying .
“ I thought if I put enough peer pressure on her she would have to say yes . ”
Choir member Kate Kimber , 25 , from St Albans said afterwards : “ It was brilliant , I burst into tears .
It was just really beautiful .
I did n’t think it would go as well as it did .
He had been to a few rehearsals with us and we were n’t entirely sure how it was going to work .
But it went perfectly . ”

Author of Obama Muslim rumor replaces it with Communist rumor David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday October 27 , 2008
Print This Email This
The man who originated the rumor that Barack Obama was born a Muslim is now promoting an entirely different story , claiming that Obama is actually the son of a black activist who was suspected in the 1950s of Communist ties .
Andy Martin first launched the " Muslim " rumor in 2004 , just two weeks after Obama gained national attention at that year 's Democratic convention .
His initial press release was picked up by the conservative website FreeRepublic , and from there the story snowballed on the Internet .
However , Martin now tells CNN that , as the result of a recent visit to Honolulu to investigate Obama 's background , he concluded that " his father was Frank Marshall Davis . "
Martin offered no proof for this assertion and implied it was just a gut feeling .
Davis was a black poet and political activist in the 1920s and 30s who moved to Hawaii in 1948 and wrote for a newspaper which the House Un- American Activities Committee accused of being a Communist front .
Right - wing websites have been claiming since last winter that Davis was not only a Communist Party member but also the mentor to Obama in his teen years who he refers to in his autobiography as " Frank . "
Martin himself is known for his history of frivolous lawsuits and anti-Semitic remarks .
He was thrust into prominence earlier this month by an appearance on the Fox News program of Sean Hannity , where he asserted that " Obama 's role as a community organizer [ in Chicago ] was a political staging ground perpetuated by the unrepentant terrorist William Ayers . "
Martin further told Hannity that Obama " probably had met William Ayers in New York , and was coming here to lay the foundations for what he thought would be some sort of political movement " and that an Obama presidency would lead to " a socialist revolution , which attempts to essentially freeze out anybody who 's not part of this radical ideology . "
When asked by CNN whether this new story does n't refute his original claim that Obama was a Muslim , Martin replied , " Absolutely .
... I 'm an honest writer and an honest researcher .
... I 'm known as a person who strives for the truth . "
However , he continues to insist that any confusion is Obama 's fault because he " has n't told the truth to the American people . "
Although the revised story may fit better with recent Republican suggestions that Obama is promoting " socialism , " Martin himself insists that " I 've gotten a lot of flack for this latest rumor , simply because people want to believe he 's a Muslim . "

The below text is copyright , “ Broken Bodies – Broken Dreams : Violence against Women Exposed . ” :
“ The Legal Context
Despite national and international law pertaining to minimum age and consent in marriage , many young girls around the world are still at risk .
In 15 countries , the legal age of marriage is 16 .
Even when legal protections against child marriage do exist , they may be ambiguous , allow for dual existence of customary and civil law and have limited enforcement mechanisms .
Some legal provisions , for example , may allow traditional law to override statutory law , and therefore restrictions against early marriage in state law may not apply to customary marriages .
Moreover , in countries “ where there is a discrepancy between the minimum age of marriage for boys and girls , it is consistently lower for girls . ”
According to CEDAW , these discrepancies “ assume incorrectly that women have a different rate of intellectual development from men , or that their stage of physical and intellectual development at marriage is immaterial . ”
The national laws of Cameroon , Jordan , Morocco , Uganda and Yemen do not specifically accord women the right to consent before marriage .
Among the “ vast majority ” of countries around the world that have codified a women ’s equal right to choose a marriage partner , legal provisions are often “ merely symbolic ” – and as a result unenforced or subject to wide exceptions .
Legislative provisions in many countries allow for child marriage with parental consent , which in the context of traditional societies does little to preserve the rights of girl children .
In Algeria , Chad , Costa Rica , Lebanon , Libya , Romania and Uruguay , the law allows a perpetrator of rape – including rape of a minor – to be pardoned of his crime if he marries his victim .
In the case of a young victim , stigma , shame , coercion and ignorance of the law , along with a multitude of other factors , may prevent her from exercising her legal right to refuse such a marriage .
In Ethiopia , illegal “ abduction marriages ” , where men kidnap young girls and consummate the marriage with rape , remain prevalent in some rural settings .
In a study conducted among 227 Ethiopian wives , 60 percent said they had been abducted before age 15 , and 93 percent before age 20 .
The failure to prioritize women ’s and girl ’s rights
Child marriage predominates in traditional societies around the world , where the desires and needs of parents and community may override considerations for the individual development and wellbeing of a girl child .
The patriarchal values buttressing these cultures further erode any rights that might otherwise be afforded a young girl .
The fact that marrying young maximizes a female ’s reproductive lifespan and thus ensures large families justifies the custom of child marriage and ignores the health impact of such a tradition on young wives .
The prevalence of child marriage also may be linked to the economics of poverty .
Young girls in certain communities in Africa will generate more bride price because as virgins they are less likely to have HIV and other sexually transmitted infections .
Conversely , African parents in resource - poor settings who are worried about not being able to find men who can afford a high bride price may prevent a daughter from completing schooling for fear that an education will increase her cost .
Once a girl has left school , she is much more likely to get married .
In the Asian societies where dowry customs dominate , girls may be married off early because dowry doubles once a girl matures .
In Bangladesh , for example , dowry doubles once a girl reaches the age of 15 , because she is considered less “ marriageable ” .
Other motives for child marriage include controlling a young girl ’s sexuality and curbing any manifestations of independence .
Committing a pubescent or even prepubescent girl to marriage reduces the likelihood of premarital liaisons , which is important when the sexual purity of girls and women is seen as a community prerogative and the basis of family and tribal honour .
In societies where subservience to husbands is requisite in marriage , young brides offer the additional benefit of being easier to mould into deferential wives .
Child marriage and gender - based violence
Child marriage is a form of gender - based violence that leads to a range of other forms of violence .
Research suggests , for example , that sexual assault may be more common among wives who marry young , due at least in part to the power inequities between older husbands and younger wives .
Indian girls from Calcutta who married early reported that their husbands had forced them to have intercourse before they had started menstruating .
Despite protestations of pain and lack of desire , 80 percent of these girls said that their husbands continue to force them to have sexual relations .
Girls who marry early may also be at greater risk of physical violence at the hands of their husbands and in - laws .
In Jordan , 26 percent of domestic incidents reported in 2000 were committed against wives who were under age 18 .
As with sexual violence , this increased risk may be associated with age and power differentials .
Lack of social networks and economic assets , as well as low self - esteem , make child brides less likely to leave abusive husbands and more likely to tolerate the abuse .
In studies in Benin , India and Turkey , for example , 62 percent to 67 percent of young wives – as opposed to 36 percent and 42 percent of older wives – believed that their husbands were justified in using physical violence against them .
Girls who try to escape early or abusive marriages risk retribution from their husbands as well as their natal families , including further abuse , imprisonment or even death .
The Commission on the Status of Women in Pakistan , where the honour killings are often linked to domestic violence , reported in 1989 that “ men are constantly fighting to retrieve their women because they have run away . ”
Data from prisons in Afghanistan ’s capital city in Kabul in 2004 indicated that the majority of female inmates had been married before age 16 , and that incarceration was highly correlated to child marriage .
“ Zabia ” is one such case :
“ When [ Zabia ] was 10 years old her parents sold her in marriage to a 50 - year - old man who was deaf and dumb .
She was raped on her wedding night .
In the years that followed , [ Zabia ] ran away to her father ’s house some seven or eight times .
Every time she returned , her father beat her and held her in chains until her husband came to retrieve her .
She finally escaped to the city , where she met a kind woman who took her in .
After some time , [ Zabia ] met a young male relative of the woman , became engaged and married him .
She had been happily married for six months and was pregnant when she told her second husband her true history .
The second husband , who accepted her past , went to meet [ Zabia ’s ] parents to tell them of her whereabouts and happy marriage and invited them to visit their daughter .
Instead , [ Zabia’s} parents reported the couple to the police , who imprisoned them for illegal marriage . ”
Husbands of young wives are often significantly older , and therefore more likely to die before their wives .
While it may seem a reprieve in cases of violent marriages , lack of property or inheritance rights , as well as high rates of illiteracy among young brides , puts those widows at great risk for multiple forms of exploitation .
In certain parts of India , a girl whose husband has died may be given in nata to a widower in the family .
Although officially designated his wife , she may become “ the common property of all the men in the family . ”
In parts of Africa , a widow is remarried , according to the practice of levirate , to a brother of her deceased husband .
Any resulting children are given the name of the deceased husband , thus ensuring the continuation of his lineage .
If a widow refuses to marry her brother - in - law , she not only risks being cast out of his family , but also losing custody of her children and any rights to her husband ’s property .
Widowed women also can be traded as commodities in dispute negotiations between families or communities – given as a wife , for example , from one family to another to reinstate the honour of an aggrieved man and his clan .
The multiple health risks of child marriage
In addition to the physical dangers associated with domestic violence , child marriage poses many other health risks .
Because of the greater permeability of their vaginal tissue and other biological factors like hormone fluctuations , girls are more vulnerable than mature women to sexually transmitted infections , including HIV .
Their age , limited life experience and inferior status also make it more difficult for young wives to negotiate safer sex .
While marriage to girls is considered a protective measure for husbands , it may have the opposite effect on their wives , especially in polygynous societies .
In a recent study undertaken in Rwanda and cited in a United Nations Children ’s Fund ( UNICEF ) report on child marriages , 25 percent of girls who became pregnant at 17 or younger were infected with HIV , even though many reported only having sex with their husbands .
The study found that a higher incidence of HIV infection was directly correlated to a younger age of sexual intercourse and first pregnancy .
In findings from rural Uganda , girls aged 13 to 19 who were HIV - positive were twice as likely to be married as girls who were HIV - negative .
For young wives , “ abstinence is not an option – those who try to negotiate condom use commonly face violence and rejection . ”
The leading cause of death for 15 - to 19 - year - old girls worldwide is complications from pregnancy and child - bearing .
According to public - health experts , for every girl that dies during pregnancy or childbirth , 30 more will suffer injuries , infections and disabilities .
And the risks are not limited to the mother :
If a girl is under the age of 18 when she gives birth , her baby ’s chance of dying in its first year of life is 60 percent higher than that of a baby born to an older mother .
Moreover , the extended reproductive span of a girl who is married early puts her and her children at risk due to a greater number of pregnancies and deliveries .
According to one study , women who marry before age 19 will have two to four times more children than those who marry after age 25 .
The additional burden of obstetric fistula
One of the most physically and psychologically debilitating effects of early child - bearing is fistula , a rupture of tissue that results in an opening between the vagina and the bladder or the rectum , or both , which is reparable only with surgery .
Primarily caused by obstructed labour , fistula is closely linked to marriage and child - bearing among girls between 10 and 15 years of age .
In one 1995 study in Niger , for example , 88 percent of women with fistula were in this age group when they were married .
As will all pregnancy - related injuries , young married girls in resource - poor settings are least likely to get treatment for fistula .
With leaking urine and feces , a malodorous girl suffering an untreated fistula is likely to be ostracized by her community and divorced by her husband .
Child marriage is so common in Ethiopia that doctors at the Fistula Hospital , based in the capital city of Addis Ababa , operate on approximately 1,200 girls a year .
Those who are of and manage to find transport to the hospital are probably only a small proportion of the young women needing treatment .
An urgent human rights concern
The Forum on Marriage and the Rights of Women and Girls , from which much of the information included in this chapter has been drawn , is a network of nongovernmental organizations with international affiliates that shares “ a vision of marriage as a sphere in which women and girls have inalienable rights . ”
The early work of the Forum highlighted the fact that very little is being achieved at either the international or national level to address the global problem of child marriage .
The Forum ’s most recent report in 2003 emphasized that there is considerable work to be done to end the practice of child marriage .
Much of this effort involves lobbying governments to adopt and enforce laws that both prohibit child marriage and ensure that girls have equal access to education .
Just as important , however , is changing the attitude and behavior of community and religious leaders , whose complicity allows child marriage to continue .
Finally , the Forum asked for increased support to programs that empower young girls , to help them realize that their futures need not be preordained by customs that deprive them of their rights to mental , social and physical wellbeing .
Agencies such as the United Nations Fund for Population Assistance and UNICEF have started to demand action to end child marriage , while international nongovernmental organizations , including Population Council and the International Center for Research on Women , have pioneered initiatives to research child marriage , raise awareness and inform policy discussion .
Despite some of these gains , the magnitude of the problem requires greater effort , not only through prevention , but also through prevention , but also through supporting girls who are already in child marriages .
Policy makers , elected officials and community and religious leaders , as well as individuals , all have a critical role in making a difference in the lives of girls and young women . ”

Questions raised over McCain's NRA endorsement John Byrne
Published : Monday October 13 , 2008
Print This Email This The National Rifle Association 's endorsement of Sen. John McCain over former Georgia congressman and NRA board member Bob Barr has raised questions over whether the gun rights organization has betrayed traditional allegiances in endorsing a Republican over the principles of its members .
Barr , the libertarian candidate , is admittedly a long shot for president , and political organizations have been known to hold their nose and back candidates who are less supportive because they are more viable in an election .
But the NRA has a history of sitting out elections where they do n't think either candidate is supportive enough on guns .
In 1996 and 1992 , the organization declined to endorse either Bill Clinton , George H. W. Bush or Bob Dole .
As such , the group 's decision to endorse McCain has left some supporters puzzled .
McCain is n't an NRA member .
Barr received an A + rating for every term of Congress he served , and once served on the organization 's board .
" Previously , the NRA backed pro-gun Democratic incumbents to show their appreciation and I suppose to hedge their bets , " Barr supporter and elector Richard Cooper wrote Saturday .
" But in the Bush years with Karl Roves strategies for making Republican majorities permanent , this policy seems to have been largely abandoned . "
" What do these actions show ? " he added .
" The NRA is officially the National Rifle Association .
However , it has become the National Republican Association . "
NRA chief Wayne LaPierre has brushed off criticism of the group 's support for McCain .
" He 's cast more than 60 votes in the Senate in support of the Second Amendment , " LaPierre told the Washington Times .
Praising McCain VP pick Sarah Palin , he said , " She 's a hunter , she 's a Second Amendment supporter and she 's a tremendous asset to the ticket . "
Palin received an A+ rating with the group when she ran for governor in 2006 .
As mayor , she spent $ 750 from her campaign fund to upgrade her NRA membership .
" It is understandable given the two party stranglehold on American politics dubbed by some a ' duopoly , ' " Cooper added .
" But is it justifiable ? "
" Does anyone still think that John McCain has any chance to defeat Barack Obama ? " he continued .
" A vote for John McCain is a wasted vote .
John McCain is spoiling Bob Barr 's chances to defend the entire Bill of Rights , which is under threat from both Obama and McCain . "
The NRA withheld its endorsement throughout the primaries , even after Sen. John McCain had become the presumptive nominee .
If anything , it seems that Palin tipped the balance .
An NRA endorsement , notes Hotline , is seen as a " vital seal of approval for the party 's conservative base and a nod that matters to voters in rural swing states , such as New Hampshire and Virginia . "
The Democrat brings a new hope to a country that badly needs it
In the century and a half that Oregon and The Oregonian have been making presidential choices , there has rarely been a time when the nation so desperately needed a sharp change in direction .
To provide that change , The Oregonian strongly urges voters to support Barack Obama .
Obama has the best chance , and the best abilities , to rebuild an American economy that has grown dangerously unstable , with government , consumers and the nation itself spiraling deeply into debt and selling off the national future to pay for daily expenses .
He is the best choice to rebuild the American position in the world , to restore our ties with traditional allies , to re-make the American argument to the rest of the world .
Crucially , Barack Obama can recall the United States to its own highest principles and priorities .
He can change course after an administration that has often cut constitutional and legal corners , and frequently stumbled into policy and philosophical embarassment .
Over his career , and over his candidacy , Obama has shown a powerful ability to reach people , especially the young , who have become indifferent or despairing about the American future .
He has also conducted a long , massive , impressively orchestrated campaign that displayed his ability to remain poised , focused and organized under pressure .
That ability brought him from a longshot with a relatively slim resume to the Democratic nomination , and now the brink of the presidency .
Obama 's historic role in this campaign -- the first African - American major party nominee for president -- may well strengthen his ability to make those connections .
His identity and his attitude will clearly change the image that the United States presents to the rest of the world , at a time when that change is desperately needed .
The conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer , of all people , recently concluded that Barack Obama had both a first - class intellect and a first - class temperament .
The next president will badly need both .
By contrast , John McCain has had considerable difficulty finding a voice and a direction for his campaign .
The Oregonian supported McCain for the Republican nomination , and has admired many of his positions over his career , including his opposition to torture , his commitment to a realistic immigration policy and his insistence on the reality of man-made global warming .
We continue to admire his record , and his contributions to this country .
But in this campaign , the historic John McCain has often been hard to see .
Some of his bolder independent positions have been dropped by the wayside in his pursuit of the Republican nomination , and McCain has shown little ability to adapt to new circumstances .
With little economic expertise or interest throughout his career , McCain has cast about for a response to the market meltdown , tossing out different approaches while showing little insight into the problem .
He has been quick to cite the relatively minor issue of congressional earmarks , and has denounced " Wall Street greed , " although in Congress he has urged ever deeper deregulation of the financial markets .
As McCain 's prospects have declined , he has relied ever more on dark hints about Obama 's connections , or suggestions that only one party was truly patriotic .
This has been both distasteful and unlike the earlier John McCain .
Two particular issues , on presidential - level appointments , reinforce our endorsement .
In the first major choice made by any nominee , Obama showed considerably better judgment .
His pick for running mate , Joe Biden , has an extensive background , especially in foreign policy , and the clear capacity to be a significant asset to an Obama administration , much as Al Gore was to Bill Clinton .
McCain 's choice , in stunning contrast , has a background of a year and a half as governor of Alaska , and has claimed , with a straight face , that she has national security credentials because from Alaska you can see Russia .
Supporting her , McCain has offered the equally jaw - dropping claim that Sarah Palin knows more about energy than anyone else in the United States .
Having Palin a heartbeat from the presidency makes our own heart miss a beat .
The next president will make crucial appointments to a sharply divided Supreme Court .
This issue is generally raised in terms of the abortion issue , but it goes far deeper than that .
At a time when the Bush administration has repeatedly assaulted American traditions protecting privacy , banning torture and guaranteeing the right of habeas corpus , even a generally conservative Supreme Court has stood against his incursions .
But the addition of more justices embracing a doctrine of an all - powerful executive could change American law and rights beyond recognition .
This has been a very long campaign , and since its beginning the favorites -- and the themes -- have changed repeatedly .
Way back in the winter of 2007 , the key issue seemed to be Iraq , a theme that has been steadily replaced by the economy , until this month 's market meltdown seemed to blot out everything else .
But even more unnervingly , the time has also seen the American people 's confidence in their system and their society erode rapidly , until the most recent CBS poll found only 7 percent thought the country was moving in the right direction , while 89 percent thought " things have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track . "
It 's a situation that requires not only a policy change , but a powerful call for Americans to remember the things that hold us together , and to believe in them again .
In Barack Obama 's book , " The Audacity of Hope , " he explains what he means by that phrase : " the audacity to believe that despite all the evidence to the contrary that we could restore a sense of community to a nation torn by conflict . "
That audacity , and his ability to make others believe in it , is one of the strongest reasons to make Barack Obama the next president of the United States .
China 's dairy industry is on the verge of collapse Chinese police have arrested 22 people suspected of producing melamine - the chemical found in milk products which have made thousands of babies ill .
The arrests took place on 17 September , but were only reported widely on Monday evening .
Police are said to have raided dairy farms and milk purchasing stations in northern Hebei province , and seized more than 220 kg ( 485 lb ) of melamine .
Meanwhile more Chinese milk products have been recalled .
In the latest recalls : Anglo - Dutch giant Unilever announced it was withdrawing Lipton - brand milk tea powder in Hong Kong and Macau , after internal tests found traces of the chemical in four batches of the product
Hong Kong authorities said they found melamine in three other products : Pocky Men's Coffee Cream Coated Biscuit Sticks ( made by Japan 's Ezaki Glico Co ) and Walnut Cakes and Coconut Cakes ( made by China 's Tian Le Yuan Foods )
Click here to see a map of countries affected As well as making about 50,000 babies ill , the tainted milk products have also been blamed for the deaths of four babies .
The Chinese news agency Xinhua said that of the 22 people detained , 19 were managers of 17 pastures , breeding farms and milk purchasing stations .
Later reports suggested another five arrests had been made , though where and when they took place was unclear .
China has tightened its grip on media freedom to contain rising nationwide outrage at tainted milk products
China Human Rights Defenders
More than 800 police were involved in the raids on 41 locations in Shijiazhuang , the capital of Hebei , Xinhua said .
Police said the melamine had been produced in underground plants and then sold to breeding farms and purchasing stations .
Xinhua quoted one of those arrested as saying he had been producing " protein powder " containing melamine since last year .
Another suspect was quoted as saying his milk had always been rejected by Sanlu , the company where the toxic milk was first discovered last month which is headquartered in Shijiazhuang .
He said he was told that lacing his milk with melamine could increase the proportion of protein and would help his milk pass the Sanlu test .
So he began tainting the milk , Xinhua reported .
Chinese President Hu Jintao was shown on state TV news on Tuesday night touring a dairy farm in the eastern province of Anhui .
In some of his most public comments on the scandal so far , he was shown telling an official at the farm : " Food safety concerns the health of the public .
" We need to ensure that all products on the market are up to standard , so that consumers do n't have to worry . "
Growing toll Thousands of children have been hospitalised with kidney illnesses and four have died after drinking milk formula tainted with the chemical .
SCANDAL TIMELINE 10 Sept : 14 babies reported ill in Gansu province .
Cases reported around China 13 Sept : Sanlu Group identified as source of contaminated powder milk .
Production halted , 19 arrests 15 Sept : Beijing confirms two babies have died .
Taiwan bans baby milk products
19 Sept : Death toll rises to four .
Melamine found in ordinary milk from three well - known dairies .
22 Sept : Toll of ill babies rises to 53,000 .
Head of China 's quality watchdog resigns .
Twenty - two firms implicated in scandal .
23 Sept : Countries across Asia start to either test Chinese dairy products or pull them from shops 26 Sept : EU bans Chinese baby food with milk traces .
Sales of popular sweet White Rabbit halted after tests detect melamine 29 Sept : Cadbury recalls products in Asia after tests find traces of melamine .
Reports say 22 people arrested in Hebei province , suspected of introducing melamine into supply chain China 's dairy industry is on the brink of collapse , and importers of food products containing any Chinese milk products are being recalled from shops around the world .
More than a dozen Asian and African countries , plus the 27 - member European Union , have taken steps to ban or otherwise limit consumption of Chinese milk - product imports .
Laos , Mali and Niger on Monday became the latest to order such measures .
Besides the toll in mainland China , five children in Hong Kong , one in Macau , and four people in Taiwan have reportedly developed kidney stones after drinking tainted Chinese products .
The Chinese government says it is facing the spreading problem candidly , but rights organisations say that coverage of the scandal is controlled , and those trying to help victims are being harassed .
" China has tightened its grip on media freedom to contain rising nationwide outrage at tainted milk products , " China Human Rights Defenders , a network of domestic and foreign human rights activists , said in an emailed report .
The rights group said the central government had ordered all Chinese media to toe the official line on the issue , thereby preventing exposure of " deep - seated problems in the system " .
Melamine is used in making plastics and is high in nitrogen , which makes products appear to have a higher protein content .
Health experts say that ingesting small amounts does no harm but sustained use can cause kidney stones and renal failure , especially among the young .

OSLO ( Reuters ) - Climate change is likely to disrupt food chains by favoring animals with short lifespans over often bigger rivals that are worse at tolerating temperature swings , scientists said on Thursday .
Fish swim near Borneo on January 9 , 2004 .
REUTERS / Bazuki Muhammad
The researchers in Germany and Canada said that studies of the physical characteristics of animals showed that all have widely differing “ thermal windows ” -- a range of temperatures in which they best feed , grow and reproduce .
That meant that climate change would not affect all equally .
“ Climate change will favor species with wide thermal windows , short life spans , and a large gene pool amongst its population , ” the journal Science said of the findings .
Big fish such as cod , which have narrow thermal windows , were moving north in the Atlantic , for instance , partly because the food chain was disrupted by a shift to smaller plankton , reducing the amount of prey on which large fish can feed .
A shift to smaller plankton meant that juvenile cod in the Atlantic had to use more energy to feed , slowing their growth .
Female cod tolerate only a narrow “ thermal window ” when they produce eggs , part of a strategy evolved to cut energy use .
The study focused on the oceans but the scientists said the findings may also apply to land creatures .
“ Each species covers a certain range .
The ranges overlap , but their ( thermal ) windows are not the same , ” Hans Poertner , of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research , who was one of the authors , told Reuters .
Knowledge of the differences could help predict the reactions to climate change , widely blamed on human emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels .
In the German Wadden Sea , larger eelpout fish , a long and thin species that grows up to about 500 grammes ( 1 lb ) , suffered more quickly than smaller specimens when summer temperatures rose above normal .
“ In the Japan Sea , different thermal windows between sardines and anchovies ... caused a regime shift to anchovies in the late 1990s , ” they wrote .
Let me start by saying that Vegas Rules !!!
And , I am currently up about $ 10,000 .
And I have this nice piece of land to sell you .
Anyway , the first day of Black Hat was superb , as usual .
It retains its title of the best security conference available , if you have to pick just one a year this should be it .
I plan on writing at least two more articles on the topics covered but wanted to get out quick summary today for you all .
Here was my agenda for today
Bad Sushi : Beating Phishers at their own game - Excellent session that went into detail on how phishers think , act , and make a profit .
Nitesh Dhanjani and Billy Rios ( the speakers ) showed us how phishers create sites , share info and code , and basically are lazy .
I will definitely be blogging on this subject in more detail in the coming days but the highlights were that Phishers are storing their stolen data ( credit card numbers , SSNs , ATM cards with Pins , etc ) on websites that they have hacked into or on sites like guestbooks .
And even worse they are not protecting their stolen data at all from access .
No passwords , no encryption , no hardening of the compromised server they are using to store this on , Nothing !
This means that all one need do to find this info for themselves is reverse engineer a real phisher ’s website , look at their php script , and find out where they are storing the data .
Then simply go there and grab the stolen data .
Anyone can find an active phishing site by visiting http://www.phishtank.com, a well known site that hosts info on known bad phishing sites , similar to a URL blacklist site .
To sell things like credit cards , they showed a site called vipdump where you can buy a stolen US credit card number for $ 20 each .
Vipdump is just one of hundreds of such sites , all of which use some form of anonymous payment system like egold or WU .
And in case you did n’t know phishers call their stolen account numbers “ dumps ” .
So one card number is one dump .
They went on to talk about skimmers , the phishing community network , code sharing , etc .
But I ’ll leave that for another blog .

Leveraging the edge : Abusing SSLVPNs ( Michael Zusman ) – Michael started his talk by detailing how he was able to purchase a certificate from a major CA with a FQDN of an existing fortune 500 company ’s website !
How you ask is this possible , well when filling out the request form he simply checked the box that stated that the certificate was not going to be used on the internet and was for internal testing only .
Luckily , Michael also stated that most CA ’s rejected his requests .
But it only takes one CA to spoil the party .
What does this mean to you , well picture this : A user has their DNS cache poisoned on their client so that the website ( that correlates to the new shiny cert you have ) points to a http proxy .
During the live demo the proxy used was TSeep Proxy .
Not the attacker is in the middle .
User goes to the website in question , is proxied through TSeep who hands the user the shiny new cert you have .
The users browser looks at the cert and because the FQDN and other fields are perfect and the CA is trusted it never pops up anything , proudly presents the lock icon on the bottom of the page , and is fat , dumb , and happy .
So now the MITM proxy forwards all the requests to the real website and back again to the user .
Walla !!!
The attacker sees everything the user sends or receives from the real website in the clear and neither the client nor the real server have any idea .
Scary !
The rest of the talk was about ActiveX vulnerabilities that can be exploited on the sslvpn client side of the house .
An live exploit was demoed using a non-cisco sslvpn vendor during the session .
The Vendor in question has recently posted a patch for it .
So more to come on that topic too , mostly because I have to figure out how Cisco ’s SSLVPN protects against these attack vectors and get back to you on it .
Well , I am short on time and will have to post later about the other sessions I attended .
But real quick here are their titles :
The four horsemen of the virtualization security apocalypse , and Malware detection through network flow analysis .

McCain 's bet on Palin sets up a ' wild ride ' in fall campaign ST .
PAUL  Call it McCain 's Gamble .
The Republican presidential candidate is pulling bigger crowds and a gusher of cash to his campaign since his unexpected pick Friday of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate .
But questions about how rigorously John McCain vetted Palin and fresh scrutiny of the governor 's record are fueling a larger debate about McCain 's shoot - from - the - hip style and Palin 's qualifications , in a crisis , to be president .
ANALYSIS : Palin could grab blue - collar vote
Can the first - term governor of a state with more caribou than people rescue the GOP in a tough election year ?
Palin has the potential to shake up a race in which the field is tilted in the Democrats ' favor by economic angst and a desire for change — or to be a disastrous distraction that makes McCain 's course even steeper .
The nine weeks from now until Election Day will determine whether she is " an enormous asset and a game - changer or she turns out to be a liability , " says former House speaker Newt Gingrich .
" It 's going to be a wild ride , " he says .
For many Americans , Palin 's speech tonight will be their first look at her .
Written by former White House speechwriter Matt Scully , it will combine autobiography and policy .
" She 's going to talk to the delegates about the future of this country , about how to reform broken institutions of government , " says McCain strategist Steve Schmidt .
" People will hear about her reform - and - change message " and about energy and its links to national security .
" She 'll also communicate directly to the American people who she is , " Schmidt says .
Her reception in the convention hall is sure to be positive , given the enthusiastic reaction she 's received from delegates and other Republican activists so far .
The McCain campaign raised $ 7 million on Friday , the day Palin made her debut as running mate — its largest daily haul of the campaign .
In rallies since in Ohio and Pennsylvania , McCain and Palin drew larger and more enthusiastic crowds than McCain usually draws alone .
However , it 's clear that the GOP has a long way to go in selling Palin as a candidate to everyone else .
At a discussion Sunday with undecided voters from Minnesota , hosted by Republican pollster Frank Luntz , not one of the 25 participants thought Palin is currently qualified to be president .
In a USA TODAY / Gallup Poll taken Friday , 51 % said they had never heard of her .
Six of 10 said either she was n't qualified to be president or they did n't know enough about her to have an opinion .
The first four days of her candidacy have brought a series of unwelcome disclosures , personal and political :
Her unmarried teenaged daughter 's pregnancy , a two - decade - old arrest of her husband on a drunken - driving charge and the hiring of an attorney to represent her in an investigation into the firing of Alaska 's public safety commissioner .
She has a reputation for attacking wasteful spending , but as mayor of Wasilla , Alaska , she retained a Washington lobbyist to seek $ 25 million in federal earmarks .
She also initially supported $ 400 million in federal funding for Alaska 's infamous " bridge to nowhere . "
When he announced his pick , she and McCain cited her opposition to the bridge project as evidence of her credentials as a reformer .
McCain told reporters Tuesday as he toured a Philadelphia fire station that the vetting process had been " completely thorough . "
Even so , some Republicans are nervous .
" I hope that there are no more surprises , that all the homework is done and that she is impressive , " says David Frum , a former White House speechwriter for President Bush .
" But the fear is , there 's a lot of evidence that the homework was not done . "
Reinforcing McCain's ' brand ' McCain is betting that Palin reinforces his " brand " as a reformer willing to take on established interests , including those in their own party .
Palin was the mayor of Wasilla ( population 9,780 in 2007 ) when she came to statewide attention because of her whistle - blowing on ethics violations by Republican officials .
In 2006 , she beat Gov. Frank Murkowski in the Republican primary — " a giant - killer , " Democratic pollster Celinda Lake recalls — then won the general election .
" People really thought she was a reformer and that was a big plus , " says Lake , who was working against her election .
" She is a very formidable campaigner , a very formidable debater , very appealing . "
Palin , 44 and the mother of five , has energy , poise , a down - to - earth manner and a compelling personal story : from the PTA to the statehouse .
She hunts , fishes and rides snowmobiles , pursuits Gingrich says should appeal to blue - collar workers in key states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio .
Her opposition to abortion rights — and her decision to carry to term her now 4½ - month - old son , Trig , who has Down syndrome — has reassured some evangelicals who have been wary of McCain .
" I have seen a complete turnaround of social conservatives toward the McCain campaign , " says Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council .
The campaign also figures Palin 's status as the second woman to be on a major party 's national ticket could draw female voters , including some who backed Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton .
" I am delighted to see the historic nature of this , " says Geraldine Ferraro , the former New York congresswoman who in 1984 was the first woman on a national ticket .
" Barack Obama 's candidacy is history .
( Palin's ) now is history .
One of them is going to get to the door of the White House and pull down a sign that … says , ' Whites only ' or ' Men only . ' " But Ferraro doubts that will be enough to draw the votes of many women — including her own .
" I'm a Democrat , " she says .
" I think women , like men , will vote for the top of the ticket . "
In USA TODAY polls , McCain 's standing among women did n't budge with the pick of Palin .
He was backed by 42 % of women in a poll taken before the convention , another on the day of her announcement and a third taken Saturday and Sunday .
Ferraro 's example also underscores a potential downside of Palin 's pick .
At the 1984 Democratic convention , her nomination prompted an emotional celebration .
Within weeks , she was enmeshed in a controversy over her husband 's financial dealings that lasted through Election Day .
Palin has not been a familiar figure on the national stage — or even to McCain .
McCain met her for the first time in February at a National Governors Association meeting , where they chatted privately for perhaps 15 minutes .
They met in person for a second time last week , when he invited her to his ranch in Sedona , Ariz .
There , McCain offered her a spot on his ticket .
Just how deeply the campaign probed her background and finances is n't clear .
The campaign dispatched staffers to Alaska this week , but spokesman Brian Rogers says they are n't investigating Palin .
They are there " to coordinate and facilitate communications " with Palin 's family and friends .
The scrutiny of a national campaign has sometimes been embarrassing , even disastrous .
For Dan Quayle , picked by the elder George Bush as his running mate in 1988 , questions about his service in the National Guard and admission to law school created the impression Quayle was a political lightweight .
In 1972 , the revelation that Missouri Sen . Thomas Eagleton had undergone shock therapy forced him off the Democratic ticket .
That did n't help the beleaguered nominee , George McGovern .
He lost 49 states .
' He 's catering , or he 's folding '
Palin may do more for McCain 's base than for the swing voters he needs to attract .
Teresa Ludwig , 56 , a health and safety officer at the University of Minnesota , participated in the roundtable with undecided voters Sunday , sponsored by AARP .
She voted for Ralph Nader in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004 .
This year , she attended the state 's Democratic caucuses for Clinton but was weighing a vote for McCain because of his maverick image and history of bipartisanship .
Now McCain 's choice of Palin has made her lean toward the Democrats again .
" When he picked Palin , I was just , ' Oh , gee , I know who won on this one . '
It was just placating to the religious - right base , " Ludwig says .
" He 's catering , or he 's folding . "
The opportunity to elect a woman does n't sway this former Clinton supporter .
" We can't be bought that easy , " she says .
" If something does happen to McCain , and she ends up being president , we 're in big trouble , " says Wendy Brumm , 53 , of Ham Lake , who works in an after - school program and joined the roundtable .
Still , Brumm admires Palin 's opposition to abortion and finds her intriguing .
" She 's got potential , " Brumm says .
" I think she 's got a lot of guts . "
Palin 's biggest test could come Oct. 2 in St. Louis , at the debate between the vice presidential candidates .
That will be a prime opportunity to settle questions about her qualifications .
" It 's like bringing somebody up from Triple A to the majors during the World Series , " says David Keene , president of the American Conservative Union and a Palin supporter .
" It 's not the same game and nobody knows if they 're going to be able to hit the pitches or not . "
The McCain campaign 's dominant argument against Obama has been that he 's not ready to be president .
Palin's short résumé — she has been governor for less than 20 months — does n't undercut that , McCain strategist Schmidt says .
" She is , by any objective measurement , more experienced and more accomplished than Sen. Obama , " Schmidt says .
" She 's the governor of a state , she deals with multibillion - dollar budgets , she has a record of accomplishment . "
McCain 's wife , Cindy , has joined the defense .
" Alaska is the closest part of our continent to Russia .
So it 's not as if she does n't understand what 's at stake here , " Cindy McCain said Sunday on ABC's This Week .
Obama 's running mate , Delaware Sen. Joe Biden , is everything Palin is not .
At 65 , he is a six - term senator and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , on a first - name basis with foreign leaders worldwide .
But Palin 's candidacy and the vice presidential debate presents risks for Biden , too .
She is a matter - of - fact Alaskan ; he is a Washington fixture with a reputation for verbosity .
In referring to women , he has tended to mention style as well as substance .
Last week , he introduced wife Jill as " drop - dead gorgeous " before he mentioned her doctorate in education .
On Sunday , he described Palin to an Ohio crowd as " good looking . "
In a debate , Biden 's self - confidence could come across as condescending or even bullying .
That 's a lesson then - congressman Rick Lazio learned when he debated Clinton during the 2000 New York Senate race .
He crossed the stage to her lectern , waving a written pledge on campaign finance and urging her to sign it .
Some female voters recoiled , and Lazio 's poll standing slumped .
" There 's no way she was intimidated , but that was n't the point .
I should have been smarter about how the audience was going to view that , " Lazio says .
" If I was Biden , I 'd be thinking about that . "

The international financial crisis has given world leaders a unique opportunity to create a truly global society , Britain 's Prime Minister Gordon Brown will say in a keynote foreign policy speech today .
In his annual speech at the Lord Mayor 's Banquet , Brown - who has spearheaded calls for the reform of international financial institutions - will say Britain , the United States and Europe are key to forging a new world order .
" The alliance between Britain and the US - and more broadly between Europe and the US - can and must provide leadership , not in order to make the rules ourselves , but to lead the global effort to build a stronger and more just international order , " an excerpt from the speech says .
Shake your head at Microsoft 's Internet futility all you want , but Steve Ballmer & Co. have won the latest round hands down .
True , this victory has come not through brilliant action , but brilliant -- or at least fortunate -- inaction .
But as Warren Buffett is fond of noting , sometimes doing nothing is the smartest move you can make .
Ten months ago , Steve Ballmer was on the verge of handing over $ 50 billion of stock and cash for Yahoo , a deal that would have diluted the hell out of Microsoft shareholders , bought Microsoft a dying elephant , and ultimately have been a disaster .
Fortunately , Yahoo sniffed at the offer .
Six months or so ago , Ballmer tried twice to buy Yahoo's search business , after Yahoo rushed to Google to negotiate a lucrative search partnership to stave off the Microsoft acquisition bid .
The second offer , which still was n't quite as good for Yahoo as the Google deal , would have paid Yahoo to permanently exit a business it has already lost ( search engineering ) .
Again , fortunately , Yahoo sniffed at the offer .
And now Yahoo's stock has fallen to $ 12 , ad spending is heading into the tank , the Google - Yahoo search partnership is all but dead , and Yahoo board members are trying to rekindle search talks with Microsoft .
Yahoo is also firing 1500 + employees , restructuring its business , and mired in endless negotiations with Time Warner over the fate of AOL .
So , what is likely to happen ?
We would not be surprised if the following plan was being bandied about the executive suites in Redmond :
Let the Yahoo - Google deal fail .
This will destroy any last bit of leverage that Yahoo has in a search negotiation .
A new Microsoft - Yahoo search deal would already have far better terms ( for Microsoft ) than Microsoft 's second offer last summer .
The abandonment of the Yahoo - Google deal will remove any pretense of another Yahoo option .
Let Yahoo buy AOL and try to integrate it .
Given that Jerry appears to be choosing a death - by - a - thousand cuts restructuring strategy for Yahoo , it seems unlikely that he 'll have the resolve to do what has to be done if Yahoo buys AOL , which is fire at least 4000 people from the combined company .
As a result , the deal will probably be a disaster .
Buy the wreckage for $ 15 - $ 20 a share ( or less , depending on what happens to the business over the next six months ) .
Six months down the road , Google 's position will be even more dominant , so regulators would probably wave a deal like this through .
Microsoft would still have major challenges running the business ( we would recommend a spinoff of all the Internet operations as a separate company ) , but global advertisers would be screaming for a viable Google alternative , and combining the operations of Microsoft , AOL , and Yahoo would give them one .

More than 1,100 people have been slaughtered in a bloodbath of drug - related violence in one city just south of the U.S. - Mexico border this year – that ’s nearly four victims each day – and some say it is just part of a large crisis that is will soon spill over the border .
The U.S. State Department issued a travel advisory for Americans who visit Mexico , citing Ciudad Juarez as a hotbed of criminal activity .
A large Mexican metropolis in Chihuahua State bordering El Paso , Texas , Juarez is Mexico ’s deadliest narcotics - war zone with two criminal gangs fighting for power – over city streets and drug - smuggling routes into the United States .
The State Department is warning U.S. citizens of escalating crime along the border , stating that 1,600 cars were stolen in Juarez in July alone .
Public shootouts , muggings , murders and bank robberies are rampant , and Mexican criminals harass U.S. travelers along border regions .
“ Some recent Mexican army and police confrontations with drug cartels have taken on the characteristics of small - unit combat , with cartels employing automatic weapons and , on occasion , grenades , ” according to the State Department .
“ Firefights have taken place in many towns and cities across Mexico but particularly in northern Mexico , including Tijuana , Chihuahua City and Ciudad Juarez .
The situation in northern Mexico remains fluid ; the location and timing of future armed engagements cannot be predicted . ”

For years , credit rating agencies — the referees of Wall Street — insisted they were an impartial source of information , despite their financial reliance on the companies they rated .
Then came the market meltdown — and a chorus of accusations that firms had artificially inflated their risk ratings to please their clients and gain a competitive edge .
And now there ’s plenty of evidence to suggest the “ referees ” were unduly influenced by the players .
According to internal documents released at a congressional hearing Tuesday , while rating agencies strenuously defended their independence publicly , some of their top executives acknowledged privately that they faced fundamental conflicts .
As one executive at Moody ’s , a major credit rating agency , put it following an internal discussion on the implosion of the subprime mortgage market , “ These errors make us look either incompetent at credit analysis , or like we sold our soul to the devil for revenue . ”
The documents lend credibility to charges by Wall Street executives that the rating agencies deserve part of the blame for the current financial crisis .
“ The story of the credit rating agencies is a story of colossal failure , ” said Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) , the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , which is holding a series of hearings to investigate the causes of the market meltdown .
( Mother Jones also covered hearings on Lehman Brothers and AIG . )
The central problem that confronted the rating agencies , according to witness testimony and internal documents , was a fundamental conflict of interest , one that is inherent to the business model that many agencies adopted in the 1970s .
At the time , they moved from charging investors for ratings information to charging companies to rate their products .
Since issuers , not investors , are now the major profit center for the “ big three ” rating firms ( Moody ’s , Fitch , and Standard & Poor ’s ) , the rating firms have an incentive to deliver good ratings for the issuers , whether or not the financial products in question actually deserve them .
Raymond McDaniel , the CEO of Moody ’s , explained the problem in a confidential presentation to his board of directors in October 2007 .
Under the heading “ conflicts of interest , ” he wrote , “ the market … penalizes quality …
It turns out that ratings quality has surprisingly few friends : issuers want high ratings ; investors do n’t want ratings downgrades ; short - sighted bankers labor short - sightedly to game the ratings agencies . ”
In the same presentation , McDaniel noted , “ Analysts and MDs [ managing directors ] are continually ‘ pitched ’ by bankers , issuers , investors … [ and sometimes ] we ‘ drink the kool - aid . ' ”
Employees at Standard & Poor ’s also recognized that being paid by issuers often led to overly optimistic ratings for complex — and risky — financial products .
“ It could be structured by cows and we would rate it , ” Shannon Mooney , an analyst in the company ’s structured finance division wrote in an April 2007 instant message to a colleague .
Another Standard & Poor ’s employee remarked in a 2006 email , “ Let ’s hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters . ”
They were n’t alone in believing the ratings were unreliable .
Some of the investors who relied on those ratings also had doubts , and told the agencies as much .
A manager at mutual fund giant Vanguard told Moody ’s last year that the company and its competitors “ allow issuers to get away with murder . ”
Other big investment firms , including PIMCO , repeatedly criticized the rating agencies ’ practices .
And a top executive at Fortis Investments asked a Moody ’s official in a July 2007 call , “ If you ca n’t figure out the loss ahead of the fact , what ’s the use of your ratings ?
… If the ratings are b.s. , the only use in ratings is comparing b.s. to more b.s. ”
Dean Baker , an economist and the codirector of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , said in an interview that the agencies ’ conflicts of interest have long gone unaddressed .
“ It is remarkable that this has never become much of an issue before , ” Baker said .
“ The agencies want to get hired , and they ’re well aware of the fact that if they ’re not giving acceptable ratings , they may not be called back . ”
But Baker also emphasized that sometimes the rating agencies may have just been incompetent .
Unfamiliar with the new financial instruments issuers were asking them to rate , the firms went ahead and rated them anyway , he said .
Not all rating agencies use the issuer - pays business model that the Moody ’s and S&P employees acknowledged was so problematic .
Testifying on Tuesday , Sean Egan , a managing director at Egan - Jones Ratings , which still uses the investor - pays system , was a fierce critic of his competitors , calling their conflicts of interest the “ single greatest cause ” of the financial crisis .
“ The current credit rating system is designed for failure , ” Egan argued , saying that all the major financial companies that have “ failed or nearly failed ” have done so “ to a great extent because of …inaccurate … unsound , and possibly fraudulent ” ratings .
Unsurprisingly , Egan suggested that the market should rely more on companies like his .
“ We should go back to a model that ’s worked since biblical times … [ and ] represent those who invest in securities , not those who issue them , ” he said .
Baker said the best way to solve the conflict of interest problem is to take away issuers ’ right to choose which company rates their products .
Instead , he suggested , the exchange that the product is listed on should select the rating agency .
The issuer would just pay the bill .
On Tuesday , the top executives of Moody ’s , Standard & Poor ’s , and Fitch argued that there was no way they could have anticipated the collapse in the subprime market .
The CEOs also disputed the conflict of interest charges , arguing that an investor - pays model could potentially involve just as much conflict , since investors have much at stake in ratings as well .
“ Potential conflicts exist regardless of who pays , ” said McDaniel , the Moody ’s CEO .
But he said that his company “ will adopt whatever additional policies and procedures may be necessary ” to implement the Securities and Exchange Commission ’s forthcoming revised rules on conflicts of interest .
Despite Egan ’s warning that action is needed , Rep. Darrell Issa ( R - Calif . ) asked the witnesses how to keep Congress from “ doing what we do best : either doing nothing or overreacting . ”
But Issa focused mostly on a fear of overreaction , noting that conflicts of interest exist in many other business situations — accounting , Sarbanes - Oxley compliance , and underwriting , among others .
Egan pointed out that in most of those situations , the entities with conflicts still have something to lose .
They can be held criminally liable or sued if they issue false or misleading statements .
But ratings are treated as opinions and protected under the First Amendment , so there ’s little downside for misrating financials .
Indeed , since issuers want good risk ratings , the agencies could conceivably attract more business by rating products too highly .
Rep. Stephen Lynch ( D - Mass . ) emphasized the impact of the rating agencies ’ failures on individual investors .
Lynch explained that most everyday investors have no way of understanding the actual composition of the complicated financial products .
Instead , they rely on the ratings to let them know the level of risk an investment carries .
“ People in my district knew what ‘ triple A’ meant and they relied on that , ” he said .
“ And now a lot of people in my district feel that they have been defrauded . ”

America is built around the automobile .
Big cities may have decent transit systems , but most of us spend a lot of time slogging through traffic on a highway .
Say what you will , but the National Highway System is a crucial part of our transportation infrastructure .
Trouble is , it was n't built with city dwellers in mind .
Hulking expressways and overpasses too often bisect our cities , dividing neighborhoods , blocking access to waterfronts and promoting blight .
Many were built decades ago , and as they fall into disrepair , some activists say they should be razed entirely .
Replacing them with neighborhood - friendly boulevards would , they say , foster revitalization , restore communities and save taxpayers billions in construction costs .
" There 's a whole generation of elevated highways in cities that are at the end of their design life , " says John Norquist , head of the Congress for the New Urbanism .
" Instead of rebuilding them at enormous expense , cities have an opportunity to undo what proved to be major urban - planning blunder . "
It 's a novel idea that 's worked in cities like San Francisco , Portland and Milwaukee .
Norquist has a list of other cities that oughtta fire up the wrecking ball and take down a highway .
" Freeways Without Futures " outlines 10 urban highways that have long since outlived their usefulness .
It was compiled by the Congress for the New Urbanism and the Center for Neighborhood Technology , and it focuses on those areas with the best chance of removing a freeway and replacing it with a boulevard .
" The Federal Highway Fund just received a short - term bailout , " Norquist says .
" The money that does exist can be invested much more efficiently in surface streets and transit . "
This is not an abstract idea for Norquist .
He was mayor of Milwaukee when the city replaced the Park East Freeway with McKinley Boulevard six years ago .
CNU says averaged assessed land values in the area climbed 180 percent between 2001 and 2006 .
San Francisco saw similar gains after razing the Embarcadero and Central freeways .
" Fifty years ago , when there was flight from cities , industrialized waterfronts seemed like a convenient place to run freeways , " Norquist says .
" The result for the neighborhoods has been blight .
Cities like San Francisco that have removed freeways and reclaimed waterfronts have turned them into magnets for people and investment . "
CNU says the following cities could enjoy similar benefits if they 'd raze these 10 highways :

The beleaguered insurer American International Group has agreed to suspend payments to executives from a $ 600 million bonus fund as well as $ 19 million in payments to its former chief executive , the New York attorney general announced on Wednesday .
The moves are the latest steps in an effort by the attorney general , Andrew M. Cuomo , to prevent bonuses and other compensation to former executives at A.I.G. , which in recent weeks has received tens of billions of dollars in loans from the Federal Reserve .
“ There should not even be any contemplation of bonuses for executive performance because I find it hard to conceive of a situation that you could justify a performance bonus for management that virtually bankrupted the company , ” Mr. Cuomo said on a conference call with reporters on Wednesday afternoon .
Regulators and lawmakers have pointed to A.I.G. as an example of excessive greed in corporate America .
Although the Treasury Department is imposing limits on compensation to the most highly paid executives at companies that receive government aid , the limits do not address compensation paid in the past or under pre-existing employment contracts .
I ’ve avoided the GPS scene and have relied instead on printing out maps from Google / Mapquest / Live maps .
But having recently moved to a new city , I decided it was time to make the plunge .
After some basic research and asking around , I went for the Dash Express .
Here ’s my first impression of the Dash Express and GPS in general :
I do n’t know how I ’ve lived without this thing until now .
It ’s not perfect ( more on that in a sec ) but is so much more convenient than what I have been doing .
In fact , I think it ’s an even bigger jump in convenience than my first jump years ago ( the jump from using an outdated map you keep in your car to printing out turn - by - turn directions ) .
Truth be told , though , I do n’t think I would have been happy with a GPS system had I given it a try before the Dash .
The reasoning revolves around a number of features that are , as far as I can tell , exclusive to the Dash Express .
The most important one ( for me ) is Send2Car .
Send2Car is basically a God-send for anyone converting to GPS from map / directions printing .
It ’s simple .
Using an online account at dash.net , you can send addresses to your Dash Express .
The next time you power it on , it shows the latest address ( es ) you ’ve sent to it and asks you if you want to map / get directions to that location .
It ’s just that it ’s so much faster and more convenient than dealing with looking up an address and / or typing it in manually while in your car .
And what ’s even better is the browser plugin ( I use Firefox ) .
This makes it so that any address I find anywhere online I just highlight , right click , and click on “ Send2 Car ” from my regular ol ’ right click popup menu .
As an example , I like browsing for new restuarants on my computer and reading reviews from various sites .
Any time I want to give one a try , right click , Send2Car .
I only wish the feature would go one step further and let me manage my “ Send2 Car ” addresses from within my online dash .
net account .
As it is , it only sends addresses to your car .
If you want to look up or delete a previous address you ’ve sent to your device , you have to do that from the device itself .
But I brought this up with one of Dash ’s tech support guys , and he said that this feature will probably happen eventually .
Other nifty features include real - time traffic and automatic alternate route calculation .
All Dash GPS units are part of a network and give feedback on traffic conditions .
So if there are enough Dash users in a given area ( which there are in my area ) , you see real - time traffic on the route you ’ll be taking .
And the device automatically gives you two other routes to choose from and compare traffic with , if necessary .
Also , the device is integrated with Yahoo Local search so that you can browse a pretty comprehensive database of points of interest .
You can get movie listings or even compare the current price of gas among gas stations in your area , all directly from the device while driving .
It actually has a bunch of other advanced features that I have n’t even dived into ( such as GeoRSS and a developer API for add - ons from third party services ) .
As for the GPS part of the Dash Express , I find it works very well .
The voice is n’t annoying and turn - by - turn directions are spoken / displayed in an intuitive fashion .
The user interface overall is very simple and clutter - free while also displaying most relevant information when you need it .
If you make a wrong turn or skip a direction , I find that it recalculates your route very quickly .
But like I mentioned earlier , it ’s not perfect .
It takes way too long to get new “ Send2 Car ” addresses showing up on the device .
The problem is that once you turn it on , it takes a couple minutes to find an internet connection and resync .
In the meantime , unless you pull over and wait , you have to know the first few steps of wherever you ’re going before you get access to the address you sent to yourself earlier from your computer .
Part of the problem , for me specifically , is that our car is in a parking garage below our apartment complex .
And when we pull out of the parking garage into the open , there ’s nowhere to really hang out while waiting for the thing to get connected .
So we have to drive around a bit .
I ’m not sure if this problem can be fixed easily , but even halving the wait time would be a great improvement .
I ’ve heard some complaints of size .
The standard picture floating around online ( see picture above ) scared me off initially .
But once I received the device , I was pleasantly surprised .
Keep in mind that this is my first GPS , so I ’m not necessarily used to a tiny device .
It seems about the right size and is much smaller than I thought .
The picture above seems more like a marketing blunder to me .
It makes it look like one of those older , portable cube TVs .
It ’s actually not a cube and is much smaller and better looking than it appears in that picture .
When it ’s all said and done , this is a nearly flawless GPS device that does much more than what I was able to find via other devices .
The only other downside might be the price , $ 299 , though plenty of other GPS devices that do less are priced similiarly .
But there is a monthly fee of $ 10 to $ 13 ( depending on how much you prepay ) to use the Send2 Car and live traffic services .
( It has a nice , long trial period ; the first three months are free . )
Although , personally , I ’m fine paying a small incremental fee for value - added services I use that are n’t available from the competition .
* Update * Amazon now has the Dash Express selling for $ 254.49 .
Love your Wii but tiring of your standard control options ?
Looking for something that involves less arm swinging , feels a little bit more like an Xbox or PS3 experience , and loses that Classic Controller cable ?
Well the folks from Nyko are here for you , and they want to hold you all night long ... and they brought the Wing .
What 's the Wing you ask ?
It 's essentially a standard gamepad on highly concentrated crack - cocaine .
The wireless controller features two analog sticks and a plethora of buttons ( both up front and around the back ) , and can run for around 30 hours on a pair of AAA batteries .
No word on price or release date , but if you notice a sudden crime wave and rash of unexplained fires , the Wing is probably out .
THE PENNSYLVANIA GOP … .
It ’s not as if one state Republican Party office is known for being especially well respected , but the Pennsylvania GOP seems to be competing for some kind of prize in absurdity .
A new e-mail making the rounds among Jewish voters in Pennsylvania this week falsely alleged that Mr. Obama “ taught members of Acorn to commit voter registration fraud , ” and equated a vote for Senator Barack Obama with the “ tragic mistake ” of their Jewish ancestors , who “ ignored the warning signs in the 1930 ’s and 1940 ’s . ”
At first blush , it was typical of the sorts of e-mails floating around with false , unsubstantiated and incendiary claims this year .
But where most of the attack e-mails against Mr. Obama have been mostly either anonymous or from people outside of mainstream politics , this one had an unusually official provenance :
It was sponsored by the Pennsylvania Republican Party ’s “ Victory 2008 ” committee .
And it was signed by several prominent McCain supporters in the state : Mitchell L. Morgan , a top fund - raiser ; Hon. Sandra Schwartz Newman , a member of Mr. McCain ’s national task - force monitoring Election Day voting , and I . Michael Coslov , a steel industry executive .
After the email caused an uproar , leaders of the state party repudiated it , telling reporters that some of the email was “ accurate , ” but some of the attacks could n’t “ substantiated . ”
This is the same Pennsylvania Republican Party that recently issued a press release describing Obama as “ a terrorist ’s best friend , ” and the same Pennsylvania Republican Party that apparently was involved in promoting the Ashley Todd hoax .
That ’s a lot of nonsense in a short period of time for one state party .
Raised IN poverty , Dr. Shauna Blake Collins fought fear during nearly 14 years of education .
A dropout from a South - Central Los Angeles high school , she earned a GED diploma at 22 , became a licensed vocational nurse , a registered nurse , and finally , at 41 , a physician .
Confidence came only during the last two years of medical school .
“ Every step of the way , I was petrified , ” says the Winnetka mother of two toddlers , who recently graduated from UCLA ’s David Geffen School of Medicine .
“ The pressure I put on myself made me paralyzed . ”
Students who grow up amid economic insecurity often face many obstacles : overcrowded schools , lack of enrichment activities , violent neighborhoods .
Fear and stress can be two more problems .
Brain science is showing how these emotions have effects on the brain and how they can directly impede learning .
Some scientists and educators are suggesting ways in which kids and college students can combat the long - lasting effects of poverty - related stress .
Taking over thoughts

In response to fear or stress , the brain quickly releases adrenaline and cortisol , activating the heart , blood vessels and brain for life - saving action -- fighting or running .
The brain gives the threat priority over anything else -- including schoolwork -- and it creates powerful memories to help prevent future threats .
“ All families experience stress , but poor families experience a lot of it , ” says Martha Farah , psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania .
For 20 years , David Diamond , a neuroscience professor at the University of South Florida , has studied the effects of stress - related hormones in rats .
He found that high cortisol levels affect the hippocampus -- a key learning center in the brain -- in three ways .
They suppress electrical activity , decrease efficiency and reduce new cell growth .
These effects , thought likely to occur in humans as well , might be one reason it ’s hard for impoverished students to concentrate and learn -- especially if there is extra stress , violence or abuse in the child ’s environment , Diamond says .
In a 2006 issue of Brain Research , Farah reported that growing up in poverty affects thinking processes associated with several brain systems .
Sixty healthy middle - school students matched for age , gender and ethnicity but of different socioeconomic status took tests that challenged brain areas responsible for specific cognitive abilities .
Researchers found that children from low - income homes had significantly lower scores in areas of language , long - term and short - term memory , and attention .

Research , Farah says , suggests that the effect of stress on the brain may be the reason for these detected differences and disadvantages .
Fear also interferes with learning .
A study published in the February online journal of Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience shows that students raised in low - income homes have stronger fear reactions -- with potential consequences for concentration .
In the study , 33 healthy undergraduate students viewed pictures of facial expressions -- angry , surprised and neutral -- while MRI imaging measured their brain activity .
For students raised in low - income homes , the pictures of angry faces triggered a greater response in the amygdala , a brain region that processes fear and anger .
“ Growing up in a socially disadvantaged environment often exposes people to threats to their health and well - being , ” says Peter Gianaros , an assistant professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Pittsburgh , who headed the research .

Changing the brain
There are science - supported ways to mitigate these accentuated fear and stress responses and nurture the brain , researchers and educators say .
“ Change the experience , and you change the brain , ” says San Diego - based educator Eric Jensen , author of a 2006 book “ Enriching the Brain : How to Maximize Every Learner ’s Potential , ” who has developed a teachers ’ training program , “ Enriching the Brains of Poverty . ”
“ Many good schools have shown they can create experiences that change the brain for the better . ”
Among those experiences :
* Targeted preparation .
To help children succeed in school , Jensen teaches educators to build students ’ brain capacity in areas shown by science to be lagging : attention , long - term effort , memory , processing skills and sequencing skills .
He recommends a slate of activities for each -- for example , compelling stories , theater arts and fine - motor tasks all build attention skills , he says .

* Foster a mind - set of hope , determination and optimism -- and security .
There are many ways to foster hope , Jensen says , including asking about and affirming a student ’s dreams , bringing successful students back to talk to new ones , giving useful feedback on schoolwork and teaching students how to set and monitor their own goals .
Studies by Dr. Helen Mayberg of Emory University have reported lower activity in the thinking parts of the brain in people with depression , and research has uncovered brain changes as people get better , either with medical treatments or psychotherapy .
And in a study to be published this month in Neuron , Dr. Eric Kandel , a Nobel laureate and neuroscience professor at Columbia University , found that positive emotions -- safety and security -- affect learning capabilities of mice .
“ Behaviors and thoughts that relate to hope , love and happiness can change the brain -- just as fear , stress and anxiety can change it , ” Kandel says .
“ It ’s completely symmetrical . ”

* Meditation .
This has been proven in studies to lower stress .
* Social connectedness .
According to Diamond ’s work at the Veterans Hospital in Tampa , Fla. , “ When people are experiencing strong stress , they recover much better when they have social support than when they are socially isolated , ” he says .
Jensen recommends mentoring programs for children and student groups .
* Take control .
“ Feeling helpless increases stress hormones , ” Diamond says .
To offset learned helplessness and develop a sense of control , Jensen advised students to learn time - management skills and goal setting -- and reward small accomplishments .
Advertisement
* Exercise .
“ Exercise stimulates and energizes the brain to more efficiently process information .
Exercise actually makes more brain cells , ” Diamond says .
Sports , aerobic exercise , yoga , dance , walking and even exercising the smaller muscles used for playing a musical instrument can change the brain .
Music is calming , Diamond says .
“ If you feel better , you learn better . ”
* Eat well .
Marian Diamond , a neuroscientist and professor at UC Berkeley , has been using dietary changes to improve the learning capabilities of orphans and impoverished children in Cambodia .
For students living in poverty in the U.S. , she said , “ Be sure you ’re getting good sources of protein and calcium .
Each day , eat an egg -- or egg whites -- a glass of milk , and take a multivitamin . ”
Other researchers recommend cutting back on sugar and smoking because they raise cortisol levels .
* Spirituality .
In the January 2003 journal Urban Education , researchers reported that African American and Latino high school seniors who reported that they were very religious and were raised in intact families scored as well as white students on most achievement tests .
“ The achievement gap disappeared , ” says William Jeynes , an education professor at Cal State Long Beach .

A new global deal on climate change will come too late to save most of the world 's coral reefs , according to a US study that suggests major ecological damage to the oceans is now inevitable .
Emissions of carbon dioxide are making seawater so acidic that reefs including the Great Barrier Reef off Australia could begin to break up within a few decades , research by the Carnegie Institution at Stanford University in California suggests .
Even ambitious targets to stabilise greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere , as championed by Britain and Europe to stave off dangerous climate change , still place more than 90 % of coral reefs in jeopardy .
Oceanographers Long Cao and Ken Caldeira looked at how carbon dioxide dissolves in the sea as human emissions increase .
About a third of carbon pollution is soaked up in this way , where it reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid .
Experts say human activity over the last two centuries has produced enough acid to lower the average pH of global ocean surface waters by about 0.1 units .
Such acidification spells problems for coral reefs , which rely on calcium minerals called aragonite to build and maintain their exoskeletons .
" We can't say for sure that [ the reefs ] will disappear but ... the likelihood they will be able to persist is pretty small , " said Caldeira .
The new study was prompted by questions by a US congressional committee on how possible carbon stabilisation targets would affect coral loss .
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen from 280 parts per million ( ppm ) before the industrial revolution to more than 380 ppm now .
Campaigners and politicians in Europe and the UK say a new global climate deal , which is expected to be agreed next year , must aim to limit CO2 to 450 ppm , though scientists say that is unlikely and the world is heading for 550 ppm or even 650 ppm .
The research suggests that stabilising world carbon levels at 450 ppm would still dump so much carbon dioxide in the oceans that only 8 % of coral reefs would be surrounded by water with enough aragonite to maintain their structure .
Some 7 % of the ocean below 60 degrees south will see a shortage of aragonite , while parts of the high latitude ocean could see a pH drop of 0.2 units .
At 550 ppm CO2 in the atmosphere , no coral reef would have access to enough of the mineral .
Even stabilising CO2 at current levels would still leave some 60 % of coral bathed in seawater with low aragonite levels .
The increased amounts of carbon dioxide going into the ocean will also affect other marine life , such as shellfish , that need the calcium mineral to build carbonate shells .
Writing in the journal Geophysical Research Letters , the scientists say the risk posed by carbon pollution to coral and marine life could justify a carbon stabilisation goal " lower than what might be chosen based on climate considerations alone " .
The UK's Royal Society is preparing to issue a warning to policymakers on the issue , together with dozens of other international science academies .
Caldeira said the affected reefs would not disappear straight away , but that the change in water chemistry would leave them vulnerable to attack , bleaching or disease .
He said : " We 're losing the Arctic ice , it looks like we 're going to lose the coral reefs and we could lose much of the rainforest .
I find it disconcerting that these ecosystems that have been around on Earth for a long , long time are no longer able to survive . "

Water power is arguably the most valuable renewable energy resource – and also could be considered the most ignored , until recently .
Tidal power farms sustainably harnass renewable energy generated by lunar cycles , wave power parks take advantage of the natural repetitive motion of the surface of water and hydroelectic power plants harvest the kinetic energy produced by gravitation from changes in water levels .
Here are sixteen of the most innovative tidal , wave and hydroelectric power designs currently pushing the alternative energy envelope .
Click below for larger images of and additional information on these awesome designs :
( Advantages of &) How Ocean Tidal Power Works
Tidal power is in many cases the lowest - impact but also the most reliable form of taking energy from water .
Because it relies on repetitive lunar cycles , unlike wind or solar power , a tidal power station ( aka tidal farm ) can be relied upon to produce a predictable amount of energy .
Also , since most tidal power generators sit below the surface of the water they are not obstacles or eyesores to humans but can impact ecosystems .
( Advantages of &) How Surface Wave Power Works
Like tidal power , wave power generates energy energy primarily from large open bodies of water ( seas and oceans ) using an array of machines that individually harness the kinetic energy around them .
Water power stations ( or parks ) take advantage of the elliptical motion of surface waves to drive pistons and convert the power around them into electrical energy .
They are also relatively inexpensive to build and deploy .
( Advantages of &) How Hydroelectric Power Works
Unlike tidal and wave power , hydroelectric power relies on gravity that naturally pulls water from one level to another – often around artificial or natural waterfalls in large rivers .
Though they range in size and type they work primarily on the same principles : water passes through with force which rotates a series of turbines that in turn generate renewable alternative which can be used for all kinds of purposes .
Who says there is n't innovation going on ?
I 've been waiting for quite some time to talk about a company I 've known about for several months now .
The project has been kept very hush - hush , but the bits and pieces I 've learned about from several sources were put into context yesterday when I had a chance to speak with the CEO of the company heading up the project , Dag Kittlaus .
The company is called Siri , and it's so serious about it 's stealth status that it 's even registered the domain stealth - company.com .
We chatted today over the fact that they 've announced their $ 8.5 million Series A with Morgenthaler and Menlo Ventures .
Still , even with everything I know about the project , it 's difficult to frame it in just the right way without revealing more than I 'm supposed to .
Rather than focus on precisely how this works , I 'll talk a bit about the project from which the company originated .
It 's a small outfit you may have heard of called DARPA , also known as the place where the Internet was conceived .
DARPA gave the research outfit SRI International the contract to work on the CALO Project , which was commissioned with coming up with PAL .
Word soup enough for you yet ?
CALO stands for " Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes " and PAL stands for " Personalized Assistant that Learns . "
The original applications were meant to be military in nature ( CALO was inspired by the Latin root " calonis " which means " soldier 's servant ) , but as Dag explained today , the enterprise applications are pretty obvious .
What Siri is Up Against
One of the holy grails in AI research , something I 'm pretty familiar with from my own personal experience , is putting together a personal assistant that is both friendly , useful and reliable .
There are a couple of factors that tend to impede these well - meaning projects from being actually useful .
The first part is the semantic interpreters - the English language is a tough thing , and so far most projects still function on the Turing principal , which is more about fooling judges into thinking the machine is sentient rather than attempting ' actual sentience . '
As a result , most personal assistants will break down under heavy usage either revealing their limitations or by the other major shortcoming common to these projects : inefficient and frankly ' dumb ' information storage methods .
Most of the chatterbox AIs , for which most personal assistant AIs revolve around , function off the Eliza methodologies ( or if you need something more recent , Alice ) .
In Loebner / Turing tests where the job is to produce good conversations , their information storage methods work wonderfully .
When it comes to specific information storage and retrieval , asking the same question with slightly different wording can produce wildly different answers .
That 's Quite a Feat
These were the sorts of technical hurdles that CALO faced when they were assigned $ 200 million and a mandate to make AI work .
These issues have been present in every AI that 's attempted to tackle the personal assistant problem for the last thirty years .
There have been one or two exceptions , but no breakout stars have emerged into the public eye .
Some of the folks have been exposed to it have called Siri a search engine , but it really promises to be a whole lot more .
The way people interact with the Internet is still very highly manual , and Siri is an attempt to create an automated way of going at it .
So much of what we have in Web 2.0 and social media is waiting to be used in this way .
Every tool we interact with daily has an API , and we 've been manually hooking them into just about every service and social network we 've signed up for in the last six months .
Back last November , I jokingly suggested some potential definitions to the successor technology for Web 2.0 , and referenced Eric Schmidt and Ken Rutkowski's Web 3.0 definition : " applications that are pieced together . "
Chances are , you do n't need yet another search engine to go out and find content on the web .
You need bridges between your own content and communications .
You need your calendar to be aware immediately when you schedule a meeting via your email .
If there 's a scheduling conflict , it would n't be completely unwelcome if your personal assistant contacted you and the other participants to find a common time that works for everyone .
There are literally hundreds of applications along these lines that an intelligent learning agent can touch points of interaction in our lives and make the mundane parts of the day disappear .
I 'm waiting with baited breath to see exactly how ambitious Siri intends to be in tackling these issues it ' parent projects set out to do .
Dancing Obama and McCain ( Video )
We found a very funny video ofanddancing .
It 's fun , funky and fake but entertaining none the less .
The election is less than a week away .
This little dance - off has arrived just in time to provide some much needed comedy relief .
Obama Infomercial Video , Obama with Jon Stewart on The Daily Show here .
Check out the video below .
Some McCain aides say they had little choice with a candidate who simply was n't ready for the national stage , and that Palin did n't forcefully object .
Moments that Palin 's allies see as triumphs of instinct and authenticity — the Wright suggestion , her objection to the campaign 's pulling out of Michigan — they dismiss as Palin's " slips and miscommunications , " that is , her own incompetence and evidence of the need for tight scripting .
But Palin partisans say she chafed at the handling .
" The campaign as a whole bought completely into what the Washington media said — that she 's completely inexperienced , " said a close Palin ally outside the campaign who speaks regularly to the candidate .
" Her strategy was to be trustworthy and a team player during the convention and thereafter , but she felt completely mismanaged and mishandled and ill advised , " the person said .
" Recently , she 's gone from relying on McCain advisers who were assigned to her to relying on her own instincts . "
Palin 's loyalists say she 's grown particularly disenchanted with the veterans of the Bush reelection campaign , including Schmidt and Wallace , and that despite her anti-intellectual rhetoric , her closest ally among her new traveling aides is a policy adviser , former National Security Council official Steve Biegun .
She 's also said to be close with McCain 's chief foreign policy adviser , Randy Scheunemann , who prepared her for the Oct. 2 vice presidential debate .
When a McCain aide , speaking anonymously Friday to The Atlantic 's Marc Ambinder , suggested that Palin 's charge that Obama was " palling around with terrorists " had " escaped HQ 's vetting , " it was Scheunemann who fired off an angry response that the speech was " fully vetted " and that to attack Palin for it was " bullshit . "
Palin's " instincts , " on display in recent days , have had her opening up to the media , including a round of interviews on talk radio , cable and broadcast outlets , as well as chats with her traveling press and local reporters .
Reporters really began to notice the change last Sunday , when Palin strolled over to a local television crew in Colorado Springs .
" Get Tracey , " a staffer called out , according to The New York Times , summoning spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt , who reportedly " tried several times to cut it off with a terse ' Thank you ! ' in between questions , to no avail . "
The moment may have caused ulcers in some precincts of the McCain campaign , but it was an account Palin 's admirers in Washington cheered .
Palin had also sought to give meatier policy speeches , in particular on energy policy and on policy for children with disabilities ; she finally gave the latter speech Friday , but had wanted to deliver it much earlier .
She 's also begun to make her own ad hoc calls about the campaign 's direction and the ticket 's policy .
McCain , for instance , has remained silent on Democrats ' calls for a stimulus package of new spending , a move many conservatives oppose but that could be broadly popular .
But in an interview with the conservative radio host Glenn Beck earlier this week , Palin went " off the reservation " to make the campaign policy , one aide said .
" I say , you know , when is enough enough of taxpayer dollars being thrown into this bill out there ? " she asked .
" This next one of the Democrats being proposed should be very , very concerning to all Americans because to me it sends a message that $ 700 billion bailout , maybe that was just the tip of the iceberg .
No , you know , we were told when we 've got to be believing if we have enough elected officials who are going to be standing strong on fiscal conservative principles and free enterprise and we have to believe that there are enough of those elected officials to say , ' No , OK , that 's enough . ' "
( A McCain spokeswoman said Palin 's statement was " a good sentiment . " )
But few imagine that Palin will be able to repair her image — and bad poll numbers — in the eleven days before the campaign ends .
And the final straw for Palin and her allies was the news that the campaign had reported spending $ 150,000 on her clothes , turning her , again , into the butt of late - night humor .
" She never even set foot in these stores , " the senior Republican said , noting Palin had n't realized the cost when the clothes were brought to her in her Minnesota hotel room .
" It 's completely out - of - control operatives , " said the close ally outside the campaign .
" She has no responsibility for that .
It 's incredibly frustrating for us and for her . "
Between Palin 's internal detractors and her allies , there 's a middle ground :
Some aides say that she 's a flawed candidate whose handling exaggerated her weak spots .
" She was completely mishandled in the beginning .
No one took the time to look at what her personal strengths and weaknesses are and developed a plan that made sense based on who she is as a candidate , " the aide said .
" Any concerns she or those close to her have about that are totally valid . "
But the aide said that Palin 's inexperience led her to her own mistakes :
" How she was handled allowed her weaknesses to hang out in full display . "
If McCain loses , Palin 's allies say that the national Republican Party has n't seen the last of her .
Politicians are sometimes formed by a signal defeat — as Bill Clinton was when he was tossed out of the Arkansas governor 's mansion after his first term — and Palin would return to a state that had made her America 's most popular governor and where her image as a reformer who swept aside her own party 's insiders rings true , if not in the cartoon version the McCain campaign presented .
" There are people in this campaign who feel a real sense of loyalty to her and are really pleased with her performance and think she did a great job , " said the McCain insider .
" She has a real future in this party . "
The impact of the Russia - Georgia war continues to reverberate .
Gen. James Craddock , NATO ’s Supreme Commander , has requested authority to develop contingency plans to defend the Eastern European countries .
Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski recently told an American audience that " We need to make NATO ’s traditional security guarantees credible again " and that " NATO needs to recover its role , not just as an alliance but as a military organization . "
Kim Holmes of the Heritage Foundation advocates doing " more military contingency planning and military exercises with not only Poland , but the Baltic states . "
Senators Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman recently proclaimed the importance of " reinvigorating NATO as a military alliance , " with " contingency planning for the defense of all member states against conventional and unconventional attack . "
Until recently , NATO was treated like a social club , with invitations extended pro forma to anyone within geographic reach that exhibited proper manners .
But the conflict in the Caucasus brought home to NATO ’s 26 members the unpleasant prospect of war with Russia .
Moscow is truculent and the Europeans are nervous , yet US officials are pushing to bring both Georgia and Ukraine into NATO .
This step would directly bring conflict and war into the alliance .
Why is the US still in NATO ?
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created to prevent the Soviet Union from dominating Western Europe .
Europe had been devastated by World War II .
The USSR emerged from that conflict as the most powerful continental state .
Having fought to prevent Nazi Germany from dominating Eurasia , the US understandably sought to prevent the Soviet Union from achieving the same result .
This was an important but limited objective .
Washington made no effort to liberate Eastern or even Central Europe from Soviet control .
The US government commemorated the subjugation of the Baltic States , but made no pretense that their captivity threatened American security .
And no one shed any tears over the status of the more distant Soviet " republics " which had been part of imperial Russia .
NATO was for self - protection , nothing more .
Even so , the alliance barely fulfilled that role .
NATO always was America and the others .
The US spent far more money on the military , devoted a much larger percentage of its GDP to defense , and treated Moscow as a far more serious threat .
The Europeans , in contrast , often promised to hike military outlays but rarely delivered on their pledges .
They accepted Washington ’s aid but ignored Washington ’s priorities  building a natural gas pipeline to the Soviet Union , supporting Nicaragua ’s Marxist government , and more .
During the early years of the Cold War , the US may have believed it had no choice but to protect the Europeans , however feckless they might be .
But once the Western European states had recovered from World War II , America could and should have reduced its military role and troop levels .
The Europeans conceivably could have chosen not to defend themselves , but the prospect of military catastrophe has a way of concentrating the mind .
The point is not that there should have been no continuing alliance .
Rather , it should have become the European Treaty Organization , not remained the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
Then Europe could have decided how to defend itself without hectoring from Washington .
The end of the USSR and Warsaw Pact destroyed any rationale for the US to continue defending Europe .
The great hegemonic enemy and its ideological satellites were all gone .
The threat , never very strong , of a single power dominating both Asia and Europe had disappeared .
To ease Soviet concerns over the reunification of Germany , Washington even agreed not to expand NATO up to Russia ’s borders .
But then the West seemed to stop looking at NATO as a military organization .
Alliance advocates argued that NATO could promote student exchanges , encourage environmental protection , and combat the drug war  odd tasks for the quintessential military organization .
More seriously , the Europeans , at least , saw NATO as a means to help draw the former Soviet satellites into the Western orbit .
And the Clinton administration saw NATO expansion as a way to win the votes of ethnic Americans who were promoting their home countries .
So the alliance expanded through Central Europe into Eastern Europe , ending up 60 miles from St. Petersburg .
NATO now is looking to the Balkans , Ukraine , and Caucasus for new members .
The alliance has invited Albania and Croatia to begin membership talks .
Macedonia is next on the list , pending resolution of an esoteric dispute over its name with Greece .
Washington is pushing Georgia and Ukraine as members ; the Europeans have delayed any decision , while officially professing their support in principle .
Bosnia and Montenegro are more likely to be next , with Serbia  involved in a contentious dispute with the US and much of the EU over the status of Kosovo  lagging behind .
Other countries with NATO " Individual Partnership Action Plans , " which offer a possible prelude to membership , include Armenia , Azerbaijan , and Moldova .
While the original NATO was seen as bolstering US security , the new , expanded version , with nearly twice as many countries as the early alliance , hampers US security .
Most of the new members have brought along bilateral border disputes and historical antagonisms with Russia and each other .
None had robust militaries ; none had any intention of creating robust militaries .
Rather , all wanted to be defended on the cheap by someone else , namely America .
Washington seemed pleased to have more client states to order about , but it found the limits of gratitude when it came to winning troops for Iraq and Poland ’s and the Czech Republic ’s agreement to host missile defense systems .
The few score soldiers sent to Iraq by Albania and Estonia , for instance , demonstrated how little the newest members had to offer militarily .
Hungary ’s donation of a contingent of truck drivers without trucks illustrated that even a former Warsaw Pact member once invaded by the Soviet Union could not be bothered to develop serious military capabilities .
Poland demanded that US officials promise an extra helping of bilateral defense guarantees on top of NATO ’s Article 5 before they would participate in Washington ’s proposed missile defense system .
Moreover , what conceivable interest is served by incorporating Croatia or Albania or Macedonia or Serbia into NATO ?
The allied social club has degenerated into social work .
It ’s not clear against whom these countries need to be defended .
It ’s even less clear why America should do the defending .
A quick glance at any map demonstrates that Europe should be more concerned about the Balkans , assuming anyone outside of the Balkans should be concerned about the Balkans .
Finally , there are Georgia and Ukraine .
The US has continued its seeming efforts to encircle Russia by advocating that both be brought into NATO , but here , at least , the Europeans finally remembered that the alliance had something to do with war and said no at the April alliance summit .
What is the purpose of bringing either into the " North Atlantic " Treaty Organization ?
How would doing so advance US or European security ?
It obviously would n’t .
Indeed , no one who advocates expanding NATO to the Caucasus has made the slightest pretense that doing so adds military value to the alliance .
Some US officials appear to be focused on personal pique .
For instance , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says that " We will not permit Russia to veto the future of NATO , neither the countries offered membership nor their decision to accept it . "
She added : " The United States and Europe strongly support the independence and the territorial integrity of Russia ’s neighbors , " without explaining what justifies making that support military in nature .
NATO Secretary - General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer recently argued that the purpose of NATO enlargement is " to help create a stable , undivided Europe " and that " Georgia has a rightful place in this Europe . "
Actually , that sounds more like the purpose of the European Union .
You do n’t need a military alliance , originally intended to protect its members from a country which has dissolved , to make countries feel good about themselves and where they are located .
Rather more melodramatic were Senators Graham and Lieberman , who wrote : the conflict in the Caucasus " is a struggle about whether a new dividing line is drawn across Europe : between nations that are free to determine their own destinies , and nations that are consigned to the Kremlin ’s autocratic orbit . "
Even if this is an end worth war , Europe rather than America should be the potential combatant .
In fact , Georgia and Ukraine  meaning President Viktor Yushchenko and only about a fifth of the Ukrainian people  want into NATO because they want the US to defend them , not because they want to have warm and fuzzy feelings about their metaphorical geographical location .
No surprise there .
But Washington ’s positive response is the surprise , since Kiev would do nothing to defend the US or the other allies .
Expansion adds large obligations but only minimal capabilities to NATO .
True , both countries contributed small contingents to Iraq .
However , that action was a political rather than a military gesture , and was inadequate payment for a willingness to confront a nuclear - armed power over esoteric border disputes , such as the status of the Crimea and Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
Why are Washington policymakers willing to make such potential conflicts America ’s own ?
NATO advocates appear to view the alliance as a talisman to be waved at friend and enemy alike , to magically cement American dominance in regions of little concern far from home .
Never mind that Moscow has historic interests in the Balkans , is a long - time friend of Serbia , has a legitimate historic claim to the Crimea , has traditional ties to Abkhazia and South Ossetia  which have spent centuries struggling against Georgian domination  and just demonstrated its willingness to go to war to sustain what it perceives to be important security interests .
The ritualistic incantation of NATO is expected to cause Russia to turn tail .
Both Senators Barack Obama and John McCain advocate bringing Georgia and Ukraine into the alliance , but neither candidate has offered any evidence that expanding NATO would reduce the chance of a confrontation with Russia , and especially that either country is worth fighting for .
These two presidential wannabes just assume away all complications .
Particularly striking is the naiveté of Sen. John McCain , who justifies risking war for Tbilisi based on his friendship with Georgian President Mikheil " Misha " Saakashvili , a demagogic authoritarian nationalist who triggered the August war by launching an attack on South Ossetia .
But McCain does n’t stop there .
In the first presidential debate he declared : " watch Ukraine , and let ’s make sure that we  that the Ukrainians understand that we are their friend and ally . "
Apparently McCain ’s definition of an ally is a politically unstable country of no conceivable security interest to America bordering an increasingly assertive nuclear - armed Russia .
Now that ’s a mature , levelheaded strategy .
Other justifications for expanding NATO are even more frivolous .
Gary Schmitt and Mauro De Lorenzo of the American Enterprise Institute argued that at stake in Georgia ’s membership application " are international law , energy security , NATO ’s future , and American credibility when it comes to supporting new democracies . "
The specter of neoconservatives worrying about international law offers genuine comic relief .
Energy deposits in the Caspian Basin are but a tiny share of the world ’s reserves and access is not likely to be impaired irrespective of Tbilisi ’s geopolitical orientation .
NATO is irrelevant to America ’s future .
And US credibility in promoting democracy already has been wrecked by the catastrophe in Iraq , decades of blundering in Pakistan , a century worth of ineffective intervention in Haiti , continued support for autocracies in Egypt and Saudi Arabia , and much , much more .
The Heritage Foundation ’s Holmes appears to want to go to war in order to make and keep friends .
He calls for becoming " more imaginative in cultivating special friends , finding new ones and integrating these new relationships into a new global strategy . "
Which apparently means offering to defend them from a nuclear - armed power , because , well , we like having friends all over the world , irrespective of who they are , what they represent , and whether they can aid American security .
He suggests that the US " may need to give special security guarantees to Poland and the Baltic and other NATO states in the region , " as well as to Georgia " if Russia succeeds in blocking its membership in NATO . "
He does n’t explain why , other than claiming that " We need a new global network of special relationships . "
Well , yes , let ’s just offer to defend every country every where .
That should gain America lots of new , really special friends .
Perhaps most melodramatic is Jeffrey T. Kuhner , a columnist for the Washington Times .
He calls Ukraine " the strategic bulwark against Russian expansionism  the eastern ramparts of Western civilization . "
Moreover , " The battle over Ukraine is more than a regional test of wills .
It is a clash over the future of Europe . "
Even if such hysterical claims were true , the battle should be fought by Europe rather than America .
After all , the European Union countries have a combined GDP about 12 times that of Russia ’s , and spend about eight times as much on the military .
Let Europe defend Europe .
But there is no evidence that Moscow has designs on Eastern Europe , let alone Central or Western Europe .
The Europeans certainly do n’t seem to be worried ; on Wednesday the EU summit debated restarting talks with Moscow over a partnership treaty , with Germany and Italy in the lead pressing for a renewed dialogue .
Russia has returned to Great Power mode , which means it is interested in securing border security and contesting disputed territory .
For instance , Crimea was part of Russia until it was taken from Russia and given to Ukraine by Nikita Khrushchev , the Ukrainian - born General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party .
The transaction then was meaningless , and does not settle which nation should control the territory , with a majority Russian population .
In fact , there is no right answer to the Crimea , or South Ossetia , or Abkhazia , just like there was no right answer to Kosovo .
Even if there was , America has no reason to be involved .
The 27 members of the European Union have a larger population and GDP than America and are well capable of asserting their own interests .
Since they can rely on Washington , they spend only about half as much on the military as does the US , and have created forces with just a fraction of the combat capabilities of America ’s military .
Moreover , they are talking about cutting outlays in the midst of the ongoing economic crisis .
However , if they could no longer free ride on the US , they would have to honestly assess the risk of Russian aggression and take whatever steps they deemed necessary to prevent such a possibility .
And they could decide whether Georgia , Ukraine , or any other country truly was a " bulwark against Russian expansionism . "
Sen .
John McCain has inadvertently offered America the basis for a new foreign policy : " country first . "
Unfortunately , Sen. McCain believes that putting the US first requires promiscuous economic intervention at home and endless military intervention abroad .
But as normal people understand the phrase , it means risking American lives , treasure , and freedoms only to defend this nation , not to attempt to micromanage the globe .
" Country first " should apply to America ’s commitments around the globe  protecting Europe and beyond from Russia , defending Japan and South Korea , nation - building in Iraq and Kosovo , and meddling most everywhere else .
Let NATO come up with contingency plans for war with Russia , to strengthen its military credibility , and whatever else it would like .
But leave NATO to the Europeans and pull America ’s forces out of Europe .
After decades of wasting American lives and treasure promoting the interests of other nations , it truly is time to put " country first . "
As every day brings new instances of McCain - Palin crowds denouncing the Democratic nominee as a “ terrorist ” or “ traitor ” and in some cases even calling for his blood , Michael Barone bemoans the “ Coming Obama Thugocracy . ”
If the American right has lost its electoral edge and standing with the public at large , it has not lost its telltale imperviousness to irony .
In many ways it seems Barone is settling in to be one of the spokesman of the high - brow version of the revanchist paranoid right we ’re seeing on display in many of those McCain rallies .
Members of Congress reacted with fury this week as news leaked out that just two weeks after the feds gave an $ 85 billion rescue loan to American International Group , employees for the insurance giant are conferencing at one of the swankiest resorts in California .
The executives of subsidiary AIG American General gathered at the five - star St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort .
Ocean - view rooms start at $ 565 a night .
The story was broken by the activist group Outraged Taxpayer and now AIG is in full - scale damage control mode .
The company tells the Orange County Register that plans for the high falutin ' event were made months before AIG 's stock plummeted and tax dollars were pumped in to save the company .
AIG also says the hard - partying subsidiary " is fully capitalized . "
The incident can only further infuriate voters who suspect that Congress is bailing out Wall Street fat cats .
The watchdog group discovered that the executives were dining in a luxurious setting for a gourmet meal with gold tablecloths and fine crystal goblets .
The news is n't likely to sit well with AIG shareholders , many of whom lost life savings due to the company 's meltdown last month .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Huge plumes of water vapor and ice particles are spewing from Saturn ’s moon Enceladus at supersonic speeds in a way that strongly suggests they come from liquid water down below the icy surface , scientists said .
In this artist 's concept , the Cassini spacecraft makes a close pass by Saturn 's moon Enceladus to study plumes from geysers that erupt from giant fissures in the moon 's southern polar region .
The huge plumes of water vapor and ice particles are spewing from Enceladus at supersonic speeds in a way that strongly suggests they come from liquid water hidden down below the icy surface , scientists said in a study published in the journal Nature .
This offers new evidence that the moon may harbor conditions that could support life , even if only microbial organisms .
REUTERS / Karl Kofoed / Handout
The research , published in the journal Nature on Wednesday , offers new evidence that the moon may harbor an underground ocean of water , meaning conditions might exist that could support life , even if only microbial organisms .
“ We think liquid water is necessary for life , ” Candice Hansen of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , who led the study , said in a telephone interview .
“ This is more evidence that there is liquid water there .
You also need energy , you need nutrients , you need organics .
It looks like the pieces are there .
Whether or not there ’s actually life , of course , we ca n’t say , ” Hansen said .
The Cassini spacecraft in 2005 discovered humongous geysers erupting from fissures near the south pole of Enceladus into space -- reminiscent of the famed Old Faithful at Yellowstone National Park in the United States but on a grand scale .
Since then , scientists have debated whether this meant that Enceladus ( pronounced en- SELL - ah - dus ) , with a diameter of only 310 miles , was hiding a reservoir of liquid water .
It is one of about 60 moons of the dramatic ringed planet Saturn .
Based on data collected last year by Cassini ’s Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph instrument , the researchers said the behavior of the plumes supports a mathematical model in which the cracks that extend below the surface act as nozzles that channel water vapor from an underground liquid water reservoir .
The geysers continuously shoot plumes into space at more than 1,300 mph , the researchers said .
By using the instrument to observe the flickering light of a distant star as the geyser blocked its starlight , the researchers determined that the water vapor comes from narrow jets as it blasts into space .
“ We ’re saying we detected these jets within the plumes and the gas moving at supersonic velocities .
And we ’re saying that this is consistent with the previously developed model that has liquid water at depth ” under the surface , Hansen said .
The Cassini spacecraft , operated in a joint U.S. - European mission , flew close over the surface of Enceladus in March and actually through a plume , collecting samples of ice and gas .
“ There are only three places in the solar system we know or suspect to have liquid water near the surface -- Earth , Jupiter ’s moon Europa and now Saturn ’s Enceladus , ” Joshua Colwell of the University of Central Florida , another of the researchers , said in a statement .
“ Water is a basic ingredient for life , and there are certainly implications there .
If we find that the tidal heating that we believe causes these geysers is a common planetary systems phenomenon , then it gets really interesting , ” Colwell added .
Poll finds 23 % of Texans think Obama is Muslim UT poll shows McCain , Cornyn with comfortable margins
WASHINGTON — A University of Texas poll to be released today shows Republican presidential candidate John McCain and GOP Sen .
John Cornyn leading by comfortable margins in Texas , as expected .
But the statewide survey of 550 registered voters has one very surprising finding : 23 percent of Texans are convinced that Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama is a Muslim .
Obama is a Christian who was embroiled in a controversy earlier this year about his two - decade membership in Chicago 's Trinity United Church of Christ .
Yet just 45 percent of those polled identified the Illinois senator as a Protestant .
The Obama - is - a- Muslim confusion is caused by fallacious Internet rumors and radio talk - show gossip .
McCain went so far at one of his town hall meetings to grab a microphone from a woman who claimed that Obama was an Arab .
The Texas numbers are unusual because most national polls show that just 5 to 10 percent of Americans still believe Obama is a Muslim — less than half the number of Texans who buy into the debunked theories .
The UT poll shows McCain running ahead of Obama statewide , with a 51 percent to 40 percent margin .
Cornyn , a first - term Republican from San Antonio , leads Rick Noriega , a state representative from Houston , 45 percent to 36 percent .
Another 14 percent of voters remain undecided in the contest .
The poll found that 89 percent of Lone Star State voters say the country 's economic situation is worse than a year ago .
And President Bush and Congress both get record low marks .
Just 34 percent of Texans approve of Bush 's job performance — a big change for a former governor who won re-election 10 years ago with 70 percent of the vote .
And Congress is even more unpopular : Just 8 percent of Texas voters approve of the work being done on Capitol Hill .
The telephone poll was conducted by the Texas Politics Project and Department of Government at The University of Texas at Austin .
The poll was conducted from Oct. 15 to 22 , and had a margin of error of 4.2 percentage points .

The people back at Pinel & Pinel of France have come up with an innovative idea called the Movie Trunk .
It includes highly acclaimed Bang & Olufsen Beolab 6000 subwoofer , two Beolab 3 speakers , BeoVision 6 - 26 television , and the DVD1 DVD / CD player .
This fold out home theatre system is covered in an assortment of 51 vibrant leathers with nickel plated brass hardware and 3 drawers to store 48 DVD’s .
I think it ’s worth every dollar only that for now there is no dope on how much it costs .
Meanwhile you can ready your collection of 48 DVD ’s and tons of popcorn as you are not going anywhere for a very long time .
More fold out furniture and storage trunks from Pinel & Pinel website .
And she might not have had to clench her jaw and play for time when Gibson raised the Bush doctrine , the wacko preemption philosophy that so utterly changed the world .
The really scary part of the Palin interview was how much she seemed like W. in 2000 , and not just the way she pronounced nu-cue - lar .
She had the same flimsy but tenacious adeptness at saying nothing , the same generalities and platitudes , the same restrained resentment at being pressed to be specific , as though specific is the province of silly eggheads , not people who clear brush at the ranch or shoot moose on the tundra .
Just as W. once could not name the General - General running Pakistan , so Palin took a position on Pakistan that McCain had derided as naïve when Obama took it .
“ We must not , Charlie , blink , Charlie , because , Charlie , as I ’ve said , Charlie , before , John McCain has said , Charlie , that  and remember here , Charlie , we ’re talking about John McCain , Charlie , who , Charlie , is John McCain and I wo n’t be blinking , Charlie . ”
She tried to finesse her previous church comments about Iraq , asking worshipers to pray “ that there is a plan , and that plan is God ’s plan . ”
Earnestly repeating after her tutors , she said she had meant to echo Abraham Lincoln , that in war we must pray that we are on God ’s side rather than that he is on ours .
But her original comments sounded more W. than Abe  taking your policy and ideology and giving it the hallowed mantle of a mission from God .
Sarah has single - handedly ushered out the “ Sex and the City ” era , and made the sexy new model for America a retro one  the glamorous Pioneer Woman , packing a gun , a baby and a Bible .
Her explosion onto the scene made Obama seem even more like a windy , wispy egghead .
Like W. , Sarah has the power of positive unthinking .
But now we may want to think about where ignorance and pride and no self - doubt has gotten us .
Being quick on the trigger might be good in moose hunting , but in dealing with Putin , a little knowledge might come in handy .

We pointed out Sunday night that investor and wind crusader T. Boone Pickens admitted on 60 Minutes that he and his fund are down a staggering $ 2 billion from the drop in oil and natural gas prices this year .
For someone who ’s touting an energy plan to get the U.S. off foreign oil by using natural gas - powered vehicles and wind , it does n’t look so good to have bet so wrong on the drop in prices .
But here ’s even worse news :
The Wall Street Journal says about half of the investors in Picken ’s energy fund are heading for the exit faster than victims of a spontaneous Carrot Top show .
The Journal reports that , according to people close to the matter , some investors have asked to withdraw their funds due to 60 percent losses this year ; after those withdrawals BP Capital will have between $ 400 million and $ 500 million , down from $ 2 billion at the beginning of the year .
Personally Pickens has lost about $ 400 million this year , the Journal notes , and he will hold 20 percent of the fund after withdrawals , or $ 100 million .
Pickens told 60 Minutes that he would get his losses back , but he acknowledged that this is serious money .
As recently as September he was betting that oil would finish the year around $ 120 or $ 125 .
Pickens has also been planning on spending $ 10 billion on a massive wind farm in Texas , and he has been investing in other forms of clean power like natural gas distribution for vehicles .
Then there ’s the $ 58 million spent on running his energy plan media campaign .
We ’re wondering how the losses will effect his wind investment and overall energy plan .
On Monday , FPL Group , the largest wind operator in the U.S. said that it would slash wind turbine additions and spending next year .
Will Pickens be forced to cut back on clean energy ?
Update :
Well , it ’s starting to sound like Pickens could very well be cutting back on wind .
SolveClimate has a piece on a rumor that Pickens is selling off some of his wind turbines .
And Picken ’s Mesa Power told NewsChannel 10 that :
“ The capital markets are problematic for everyone , and we are keeping an eye on them .
We are committed to wind development projects and believe it ’s a viable business for us .
The capital markets may lead us to scale back a bit but we are still going forward with our wind business . ”
Update II : We confirmed with Picken ’s team that he may scale back his wind project .
As expected , Latino voters are turning away from the Republican party in droves .
As has happened at different points throughout United States history , New Americans — immigrants and the children of immigrants — are changing the face of the electorate .
And apparently they are n’t too happy with the way their communities are being treated .
This may in the end decide the outcome of the presidential election .
In a report released today , the Immigration Policy Center points out that New Americans are big voting blocs in key swing states , including : 14.8 % of the electorate in Nevada and 14 % in Florida .
IPC also notes that Latinos and Asians together account for 31.5 % of all registered voters in New Mexico , 16.2 % in Nevada , 12.6 % in Florida , and 11.1 % in Colorado .
Most daunting for those politicians who have chosen to scapegoat immigrants — according to a Pew Hispanic Center poll this summer , 75 % of Latino voters view the immigration issue as important or very important .

Han Sang-choon , deputy head of Mirae Asset Investment Education Institute , said investors ignored warnings over the past few months that trouble lay ahead for stocks and held on to funds thinking a big pay day was just around the corner .
“ I reckon people have n’t cashed in their funds because of personal greed and expectations ( of profits ) , ” he told an investor , according to quotes from the Friday TV show that appeared widely in South Korean media .
Even though Seoul shares ended down 2.73 percent on Friday for their lowest close since late October 2005 , brokerage Mirae Asset did not like the investment advice .
“ Therefore , we decided to sack our deputy head , Han Sang - choon , who gave individual views out of line with our institute ’s original purpose , and caused concern to investors , ” Kang Chang - hee , the head of the company ’s research institute said in a written statement .

Are virtual worlds the harbingers of the end of society ?
When people discuss the future of online communities and virtual environments it ’s the question that nags at the back of everyone ’s mind .
Even among virtual world evangelists it ’s a topic of concern , apprehension and uncertainty .
A concept and concern so powerful that mega hits like the Matrix have been based on it .
The question begs – are virtual worlds the harbingers of the end of society ?
Will , as most people fear the eventual march of technology result in environments so immersive , so powerful , and so socially disconnected that our species loses its ability and desire to interact , reproduce and perpetuate itself ?
Will virtual worlds and their progeny result in the eventual death of civilization ?
Experience tells me that most people believe it will .
I disagree .
In fact , not only do I disagree , but I ’m not worried in the least .
The forward march of technology is an interesting dilemma .
Especially since , with each new invention things previously unimaginable become a reality opening the gateway to future inventions and technology so far beyond the scope of our current understanding that they are , by today ’s standards , unfathomable .
The side effect of this forward moving evolution is change .
Sometimes a change so fundamental , it re-shapes our very lives .
Fire .
The wheel .
The written word .
Change can make the topic a very difficult one to explore , after all – change is scary or at the very least something that requires a transition period before it becomes comfortable .
So , where is the fine line between what we ’re afraid of because it ’s new or different , and what we ’re afraid of because it ’s detrimental ?
I believe the answer lies in our core nature as a species .
We are , fundamentally , social creatures .
We reach out , build communities , and seek out companionship .
We are not a -sexual and as such by our very biological makeup are hardwired to seek companionship .
Community is at the core of who we are , and our success as a species .
It powers our communities , which have enabled us to overcome great obstacles , eventually becoming the dominant form of life on earth .
It ’s for that very reason that the thought of technology breaking down those social bonds is so alarming .
It ’s also for that very reason that I ’m not concerned .
Humans – as a species – will always seek out other humans .
In fact , the lengths we will go to are spectacular .
A point I am continually reminded of when I look at gamers behavior .
A few years ago when I was spending a lot of my time playing Everquest and other online games , , , I was constantly amazed at the lengths guild / group members would go to in order to meet each other in person .
It ’s not uncommon for gaming guilds to hold meet - ups and while the lions share are more regionally oriented many are international in scope with members from all over the country ( and world ) flying in for small & medium sized face - to - face gatherings .
There ’s an important lesson here – even in one of the web ’s most immersive environments people still reach out to each other .
Another example of the power of community presence is LAN parties where groups of 3 or more gather in one location and all play / chat / etc. for hours and in some cases days .
At these events it ’s not uncommon to have X people in a room silently focused on their screens for surprisingly long blocks of time without verbal interactions .
Despite their apparent lack of social interaction , they are using Skype - like technology to communicate with each other and others throughout the world , chatting constantly , and interacting in a rich world with their avatars .
So , why gather at all ?
The comradship of being together .
The power and appeal of being in the presence of other humans and enjoying the face - to - face socialization that happens during downtime .
Again , these behaviors make it clear that as a species we thrive on , and hunger for , social interaction .
We are social creatures .
Confident in our social nature , I ’m not concerned about the growing influence of technology because fundamentally we will always reach out to connect physically .
The dynamics may change , but the physical presence of someone , especially a romantic partner , is an experience that technology can’t duplicate .
In cases where it comes close it may temporarily satiate our needs , but ultimately even in these instances real world social interaction will always win out .
That ’s why – to me – the fears about virtual world technology are a non-issue .
So , what happens if technology does move to the point where it can imitate and replace social interactions and the benefits of face - to - face interactions ?
That is the imagined matrix paradigm , a virtual reality so complete , real , and believable that you ca n’t tell the difference between it and the real world .
If , or rather when , technology evolves to the point where it is able to flawlessly imitate the real world , where does that leave us ?
Staunchly embedded and fiercely loyal to the world we know .
It ’s a scary thought , but realistically would that world be any less real , albeit different , than what we now classify as the “ real world ” ?
Would it truly be a bad thing if it satiated all of our needs and fulfilled us every bit as completely as the “ real world ” ?
I do n’t believe it would be bad .
In fact , at that point I believe it becomes every bit as real , valid and perhaps even essential as what we take for granted today .
So , are virtual worlds the harbingers of the end ?
If you believe that humans are fundamentally social animals and that we need that social interaction to survive , then your answer should be a confident no .
If , on the other hand , you do not believe that we are fundamentally social – what are you concerned about to begin with ?

But once it was delivered free of charge from Germany his council refused to empty it because he had bought it from an unofficial source .
Determined that his local authority should get rid of his green waste , Mr Fowler , 47 , took the bin to a gypsy camp – and to his amazement , the council collected it without hesitation .
Yesterday radio station director Mr Fowler said : “ This is complete double standards and profiteering by the council .
They were charging £ 60 for one of their bins , which I thought was a bit steep , so I bought one on the internet for £ 29 , including delivery .
“ But then I got a letter in the post saying that binmen would not collect it because it did not have a South Cambridgeshire District Council logo on it . ”
A powerful antioxidant in green tea may prevent or delay the onset of type 1 diabetes , Medical College of Georgia researchers say .
Researchers were testing EGCG , green tea ’s predominant antioxidant , in a laboratory mouse with type 1 diabetes and primary Sjogren ’s syndrome , which damages moisture - producing glands , causing dry mouth and eyes .
“ Our study focused on Sjogren ’s syndrome , so learning that EGCG also can prevent and delay insulin - dependent type 1 diabetes was a big surprise , ” says Dr. Stephen Hsu , molecular / cell biologist in the School of Dentistry .
They found it also worked well in their original disease focus .
In the mouse , EGCG reduced the severity and delayed onset of salivary gland damage associated with Sjogren ’s syndrome , which has no known cure .
“ EGCG modulates several important genes , so it suppresses the abnormality at the molecular level in the salivary gland .
It also significantly lowered the serum autoantibodies , reducing the severity of Sjogren ’s syndrome - like symptoms , ” Dr. Hsu says .
Autoantibodies are antibodies the body makes against itself .
Both type 1 diabetes and Sjogren ’s syndrome are autoimmune diseases , which cause the body to attack itself .
Autoimmune disorders are the third most common group of diseases in the United States and affect about 8 percent of the population , says Dr. Hsu .
Sjogren ’s syndrome can occur alone or secondary to another autoimmune disease , such as lupus , rheumatoid arthritis or type 1 diabetes .
The study , published in the Oct. 24 issue of Life Sciences , supports earlier research showing EGCG ’s impact on helping prevent autoimmune disease .
Researchers treated a control group of mice with water and a test group with a purified form of EGCG dissolved in the drinking water .
At 16 weeks , the EGCG - fed mice were 6.1 times more likely to be diabetes - free than the water - fed group , and 4.2 times more likely at 22 weeks .
“ Previous studies used another animal model that developed type 1 diabetes only after an injected chemical killed the insulin - producing cells .
That may not accurately resemble disease development in humans , because type 1 diabetes is a genetic disease , ” says Dr. Hsu , the study ’s corresponding author .
“ Our study is significant because we used a mouse model with the genetic defects that cause symptoms similar to human type 1 diabetes and Sjogren ’s syndrome , so the immune cells attack the pancreas and salivary glands until they are no longer functional . ”
Another related finding was that even when salivary cells were under attack , they seemed to be rapidly reproducing in the control group .
The proliferation was suppressed in the EGCG - fed group .
“ It ’s kind of counterintuitive – why would there be proliferation of the glandular cells occurring when the present cells are not secreting saliva ? ” says Dr. Kevin Gillespie , first author of the study he conducted for his master ’s research project at MCG .
The proliferation phenomenon also can be observed in psoriasis , an autoimmune disease affecting the skin and joints , says Dr. Hsu .
“ Normal skin cells turn over every 30 days or so , but skin cells with psoriasis turn over every two or three days . ”
Dr. Hsu ’s group previously found that green tea polyphenols , including EGCG , inhibited rapid proliferation in an animal model for human psoriasis .
“ We never thought proliferation was going on to this extent in the salivary gland , but we now believe it is tightly associated with Sjogren ’s syndrome , ” he says .
The next step is to observe Sjogren ’s syndrome in human salivary gland samples to determine whether the study findings hold up in humans .
“ If the abnormal expression of these genes is the same in humans as in the animal model , then the second stage will be intervention and treatment with a pure form of EGCG , ” says Dr. Hsu .
“ The benefit of using green tea in preventing or slowing these autoimmune diseases is that it ’s natural and not known to harm the body , ” says Dr. Gillespie , periodontics chief resident at Fort Gordon ’s Tingay Dental Clinic .
“ EGCG does n’t have the negative side - effects that can be associated with steroids or other medications that could otherwise be prescribed . ”

In 1999 , the Amsterdam News , the Harlem neighborhood newspaper had this to say about Wells :
" ... No appetites are safe from the magnificent Southern Creole cuisine when visiting Wells restaurant , located uptown in the Big Apple .
Famous for more than their chicken and waffles , Wells entertains customers with Caribbean flair and a frenzy of live music .
Harlem has n't been the same since Wells opened in May 1938 .
The owner , Elizabeth Wells , is determined to bring people a humble , homey atmosphere with exciting home - style cooking , but with a twist of island flavor and a lot of fun .
Joseph T. Wells , the late husband of Wells , had a record of cooking techniques in the mix .
Working as a waiter and manager of a restaurant in Florida , Joseph took his craft to New York during the late 1920s .
It was inevitable for the young entrepreneur to start his business and , by the spring of 1938 , the restaurant bearing his name opened its doors .
Elizabeth Wells entered the picture later .
They married in 1966 , even though she had joined the establishment in 1963 .
The married couple produced a son named Tommy Wells .
With an avalanche of victory for the restaurant , Wells bloomed as one of the greatest hot spots in Harlem , with a bevy of entertainers who dropped in ... Wells has been spinning the wheels of the restaurant with tip - top soul food and no regrets ... "
Wells Famous Restaurant
Wells was known for jazz , waffles , and celebrities throughout the 30s , 40s and 50s .
One story about Well 's seems to be widely told and re-told .
During late 1950s , Sammy Davis , Jr. and Kim Novak were dating .
One morning after breakfast at Wells ' Kim 's fur coat was found to be " missing " from the coat - room .
Frank Sinatra made a stern announcement to the crowd about the missing coat and it appeared back the next day .
Trademark for Wells : Chicken and Waffles Since 1938
In 1986 , the folks at Wells took out a trademark on their famous slogan " Home of Chicken and Waffles Since 1938 " .
We note that their trademark only applies to their graphic logo and they have not attempted to restrict the use of " chicken " " waffles " or " 1938 " only that they have been " famous " for the dish since 1938 .
The Harlem Renaissance Orchestra at Wells '
Wells continued to play a role even during the Swing Revival of the 1990s .
On Monday nights , the Harlem Renaissance Orchestra played in a small corner of the restaurant and many of the original Lindy Hoppers ( including Norma Miller and Frankie Manning ) were regulars , joined by whatever newcomers ( like the Rhythm Hot Shots ) may have been in town .
I made the pilgrimage to Wells in 1998 .
I loved the fried chicken and waffles , but I was not so thrilled about the carpet on the dance floor .
I have heard rumors that Wells may have closed its doors .
If so , this would be a real tragedy .
If any of our readers can clarify this point , pelase contact me .
Those of you with a taste for chcken and waffles may find them at equally famous places like Roscoe 's in Los Angeles and Gladys Knight 's Place in Atlanta .
Brief History of Waffles
Essentially , waffles are a form of griddle - cake based on flour , milk , eggs , butter , oil and leavening that are cooked on both sides simultaneously in a mold that takes the form of a gridded surface .
Because of the " teeth and gaps " of the waffle mold or " iron " , considerably more of the surface area is heated and caramelized relative to the " pancake " -- thus , the waffle has more taste and a crispness that enables it to serve as a support for other foods .
Waffles serve many of the same roles in sweets as toast serves in savories .
Waffles began in the high cusine of Europe and came to America by way of Thomas Jefferson who brought a waffle iron back from France in the 1790s .
Since Mr. Jefferson ( author of the Declaration of Independence ) relied on slaves for his cooking , skill at making waffles soon spread to the African - American community .
Recipes for both Waffles and Fried Chicken appear in What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking , ( Abby Fisher , 1881 ) .
Mrs. Fisher was a former slave and her book is generally considered the first cookbook written by an African - American .
Apparently , white people were eating waffles and fried chicken as well as recipes for the two appear in Mrs. Porter 's Southern Cookery Book published in 1871 .
Among the slaves , whose cuisine was based almost entirely on the scraps left behind by landowners and plantation families , poultry was a rare delicacy .
Similarly , waffles were unusual , expensive and time - consuming , and hence exotic .
As a result , chicken and waffles came to be a special - occasion meal in African American families , often supplying a hearty Sunday morning meal before a long day in church .
The technology of waffles is fourfoldfold : ( 1 ) the " iron " or mold in which the waffle is cooked ; ( 2 ) the method of heating the iron ; ( 3 ) the method of regulating temperature in the iron ; and ( 4 ) the recipe for the waffle batter .
We will explore the basic nature of each factor of technology .
However , this discussion will barely scratch the surface .
Those with very detailed appetites for information about Waffle Technology should consult :
George , William , Antique electric waffle irons 1900 - 1960 : a history of the appliance industry in 20th century America William George .
Includes bibliographical references and index .
ISBN 1-55395-632-X
Our survey of waffle technology is going to focus on my Manning - Bowman " Twin - o - Matic " machine .
It has all the general characteristics of electric waffle - makers with the unusual feature that it can make two at one time .
IF you have another kind of machine , it will have the same basic structure as the " Twin - O - Matic " with only half the components .
The Waffle Iron and its Heat
The mold that is used to cook waffles is a heavy , heat - retaining device with a top and bottom compartment .
The mold is gridded in a rectangular fashion such that protrusions on the top portion are complemented by depressions in the bottom ( and vice versa ) .
Because waffle molds were historically made out of cast iron , the device has come to be known as a " Waffle Iron " .
Today , aluminum and steel are the principal metals used to manufacture waffle " irons " .
Historical waffle irons go back to the 15th century and possibly before .
Like many utensils , the design and production of waffle irons was a matter between the customer and his blacksmith .
The closest thing to an old - fashioned non-electric waffle iron is the pizelle maker .
Pizzelle ( pronounced " pit-sell " ) are Italian wafer cookies .
The name comes from the Italian pizze for round and flat .
Many different cultures have adapted this technology and re-named it accordingly .
In Scandinavia they are also known as " Lukken " and in Holland as Krumcake .
All use an iron similar iron to the pizzelle .
The old style pizzelle irons required cooking over a heat souce as opposed heating with electric resistance coils irons .
You can still purchase the old style iron made by Brio at Literi in the City Market , near Galludet University >
Brio Manual Pizzelle Iron
The long handles are used to open the mold and then hold it over a fire .
Considerable skill is required to know when to put the dough into the mold and when to take it off the fire .
After years of practice , I now only burn about 10 % of the pizzelle that I attempt .
In the case of waffles , electric technology is much better , and we shall move to that forthwith .
Mr. Cole's Patent

In 1926 , Mr. Charles M. Cole of Oakland , California came up with a novel idea for cooking two waffles at once .
He devised a three - part mold with each segment heated by electric current .
This device allowed couples to have their waffle at the same time ( contributing to happy and harmonious breakfasts ) and also was fairly economical in use of electric current .
( In the 1920s , electricity was VERY expensive , perhaps 25 cents / Kwh in 1926 dollars .
This would be about $ 7.50 / kwh in today 's dollars compared with an actual cost of about 7 cents / Kwh . )
Electric Waffle Irons began as fairly utilitarian devices as shown in these photos of a very early Westinghouse appliance :

Electric Waffle Iron 115V 550W CAT NO VA - 4 or WA - 4
Westinghouse B&M Works Mansfield Ohio
Patented June 8-05 April 20-09 Ded 13 - Dec 27-21
This did the job , but it sure was n't streamlined .
Here is a photo from a World War II era training pamphlet .
The subject was " How to use electrical appliances . "
Many rural households were just getting electricity due to the Rural Electrification Administration ( REA ) and the pamphlet was intended to get folks up to speed with the rest of the country .
This photo shows the Government - approved method of " seasoning " a waffle iron ( you put oil on it and let is burn in , creating the organic equivalent of Teflon ) .
Any vegetable oil will do .

The Manning - Bowman Twin-O- Matic
There are a zillion waffle irons .
I own a bunch of them , but my favorite is the Manning - Bowman " Twin - O - Matic " both because of its unusual design and the way that it implicitly fosters " togetherness . "
The " twin " was designed by Karl Ratliff explicitly for the 1939 NEW YORK WORLDS FAIR .
The Twin is a direct descendant of Mr. Cole 's design but with an added Art Deco zest .
This unique design won world awards and is the ONLY waffle iron shown in Tony Fusco 's noted " ART DECO " BOOK , Volumes 1 and 2 .
It consists of 2 pieces : a double TOP / BOTTOM Waffle Iron derived from the Coles patent ( above ) and a circular chrome plated " trunion mount " that has 2 heavy Bakelite Cradles to support the irons .
It is somewhat unique because it has both a Thermometer and a Thermostat .
Twinomatic and Twinover
The Manning - Bowman " Twin - O - Matic "
Karl Ratliff Patent No. 2,116,688 for the " Twinover "
Click here if you want to learn how to get Free Patent Drawings
Manning - Bowman made a similar version , known as the " Twinover " .
The two appear to be very similar with the sole exception that the " Twin - O - Matic " has a raised bake indicator ( shown in the picture . )
The " Twinover " has a flush bake indicator .
The " Twin - O - Matic " makes two eight inch waffles , as opposed to the 4 - 6 inch waffles made by other double irons .
The Twin-O - Matic Details
( left ) The Trunion Mount and Raised Bake Indicator
( right ) The Bottom Waffle Section
The Manufacturer 's Plate
The instructions call for loading the " Top Waffle Section " first ( the " top " is the part with the bake indicator ) .
If one wanted a second waffle , you were instructed to wait for 15 seconds to let the first waffle " set " and , rotate the Waffle Iron 180 degrees on the trunion , open the " Hold - Fast " clamp and load the " Bottom Waffle Section . "
Details of the Twin
( left ) The " Hold - fast " clamps
( Right ) Patent No. 2,116,688 for the Trunion Parts
Click here if you want to learn how to get Free Patent Drawings
The two sections of the waffle iron are held together with clamps that keep the sections from separating .
Because the clamps form part of the trunion mount , there is never any danger that the section that is on the bottom will come open because its clamp part is bearing the weight in the mounting .
The upper section may always be easily opened due to the " U " shaped trunion opening .
This arrangement is quite clever but contains a small design flaw -- the electrical plug is on the hinge side of the trunion mounting .
It rotates 180 degrees and in doing so creates a flex in the cord ; eventually , the cord will show mechanical failure at the flex - point as illustrated below .
This " flaw " can be used in authenticating the cord that goes with the " Twin - O - Matic " .
However , safe operation requires an intact and properly insulated cord .
Wear on the Cord Caused by Flexing
Thermostatic Contols
While Mr. Ratliff did a wonderful job on the design of the " Twin - O - Matic " , we are indebted to Mr. Alan M. Young , and employee of Manning - Bowman for the " Waffle Iron Temperature Control and Indicator Therefor " .
The Thermometer and the Thermostat
Alan Young Patent No. 2,159,068 for the Thermostat and Thermometer
Click here if you want to learn how to get Free Patent Drawings
The Thermostat uses a bimetallic strip to break the circuit when the desired temperature is reached .
This is a strip made up of two metals that have different thermal expansion characteristics , such as steel and copper .
If one metal expands faster than the other , the strip will warp -- and the motion caused by this warping can do useful work ( like breaking the circuit ...)
In this case , a cam exerts some force on the bimetallic strip using a spring force to keep the contact in place for varying amounts of temperature .
For " high " settings , the bimetallic strip must warp a lot more to break the contact than for " low " settings .
When the temperature exceeds the desired setting , the strip " warps " and breaks the contact causing the resistance coils to cool .
Because the iron is not being heated , the temperature falls and consequently the bimetallic strip " un-warps " and makes contact again , causing the coils to re-heat the iron .
In this way , a continuous temperature is maintained in the cooking irons .
This ingenious device is widely used in electrical appliances in one form or another and is quite reliable and cheap to manufacture .
Check out a similar device used to control the temperature in electric irons .
The thermostat allows the automatic control of the temperature in the waffle iron .
However , the " Twin - O - Matic " also has a thermometer -- a device that indicates the actual temperature of the iron .
The principle behing the thermomenter is basically the same - a bimetallic strip is made with the property that its warping is a linear function of temperature .
This strip is connected to a lever mechanism that causes the small needle to rotate .
Hence , the position of the needle is a direct function of the temperature .
The dial is calibrated to reflect this .
Of interest is the fact that the thermometer and thermostat are two independent devices that are mounted coaxially in the upper grid .
The thermostat only measures heat in the upper section and must be callibrated to reflect heat in both the upper and lower sections .
An adjusting screw is provided for this .
Difference Between the
" Twinover " and " Twin - O - Matic "
The Twin-O - Matic has Mr. Young 's Thermostat that is mounted on the top waffle iron .
The thermometer is coaxial with the thermostat .
The Twin-O - Matic with raised Thermostat / Thermometer
The Twinover has NO Thermostat
If All Else Fails , Consult the Name Plate
Manning - Bowman made an earlier version of the " Twin " called the " Twinover " that only had the thermometer .
Because the " Twinover " is earlier , it may be a bit more valuable than the " Twin - O - Matic " , but it lacks the convenience of the Thermostat .
If you are an investor , go for the " Twinover " because it is older and rarer .
If you want waffles , go for the " Twin - O - Matic . "
The trunion base is interchangeable between the two models , so it is possible that you might find a Twinover " iron " on a " Twin - O - Matic " trunion ( or vice versa )
This would most likely lower the value of the combined object .
SO -- if you are buying one of these by mail or through an internet auction , please be sure to ask whether the trunion base matches the iron .
Alas , I DO NOT have the manual for either the Twinover or the Twin - o - Matic .
If someone out there in cyberspace has a copy of either manual , I would very gratefully appreciate having you send me either a photocopy or scan so that I may distribute it free in perpetuam
Alton Brown of the Food Network has a great recipe for a really fantastic made - from - scratch waffle batter .
( You can find by using the link or by searching for " waffles " in the " Good Eats " program .
To use your Twin , do this :
Make batter and let it sit for half an hour Plug the Twin in and wait for the needle on the thermostat to go to " bake " .
START WITH THE THERMOSTAT SIDE FIRST
Open the iron , and spray with " Pam " Add a ladle full of batter ( Alton uses an ice cream scoop )
Close the lid and flip Open , spray and add batter to the bottom .
DO NOT OPEN the iron until the steam has stopped emanating from between the plates .
If you have a Twin - O - Matic , you can set the temperature you want .
If you have a Twinover , you have to rely on the thermometer to tell you when to " bake .
On both , you 'll have to watch the thing so that your waffles do n't burn ( this is very easy after a small amount of practice ) .
Take the waffles out in the order you poured them .
When you clean the iron DO NOT REMOVE the accumulated black coating on the grids .
This is Nature 's Teflon !
If you use chrome polish , do n't get any in the grids !
I use my Twin - o - Matic every two weeks -- I make waffles and freeze them sortof like " Do- it - yourself - Eggo " - if you let the waffles cool and put them in a plastic bag , they can be frozen for up to two months , and reheated in a toaster oven ( set the toast selector on " dark " )
About a month ago , the airliner that was supposed to take me to Charlotte had to land in Asheville because of Tropical Storm Fay .
The airline put me up at a Marriott Suites hotel .
Everything was more - or - less mediocre EXCEPT the breakfast -- they had a modern - day replica of the Twin - o - Matic ( with Teflon , of course )
There was a machine that dispensed the right amount of batter into a plastic cup which was then taken to the waffle iron .
By flipping , you could make two waffles -- the thing was computer controlled .
It worked very well .
My fellow passengers were either amused ( or bored ) when I showed them the original item on my website .
Only a VERY SMALL number of people are interested in vintage appliances .
Advertisements for the " Twin- O - Matic "
Here are four ads for the Twin- O - Matic .
Manning - Bowman always portrayed its products as being used in very fashionable surroundings .
If you can't read the third ad , in the Quin cartoon , one Dowager says to the other : " Looks like our cook has been handling these .
Thank Goodness I 've got an unbreakable percolator . "
Manning - Bowman products were targeted at the ladies who had time to go to art museums , leaving the dirty work to servants .
Note that all four ads are for the " Twin - O - Matic " .
Here is an outdoor advertisement for Manning - Bowman .
Here are two very striking signs on the back ( alongside 32nd St. ) of 192 Lexington Ave. Manning , Bowman , & Co. [ of Meriden , Connecticut ] maintained an office and showrooms at this address from 1945 to 1975 .
The rather odd phrase " Manning Means Best Bowman " was a variation on the company slogan " Manning - Bowman Means Best " .
[ The Doehler Metal Furniture Co. , Inc. moved to 192 Lexington Ave. in 1933 and remained there until around 1990 .
Doehler did good business in defense contracts during the war . ]
Here are some materials that were sent to dealers in 1944 to encourage them to stock Manning - Bowman appliances
This page outlines the most popular of the Manning - Bowman appliances ( including the " Twin - O - Matic " ) and highlights the national advertising campaign using cartoons by the famous New Yorker cartoonist , Quin Hall .
Here is a book jacket by Quin Hall .
he also had several newspaper cartoon strips , including The Dolittles ( 1940 ) and Peter Plink 1948 .
This illustration anthropomorphizes the Twin- O - Matic and notes that post - war demand for small appliances will be a " half billion dollars " ( about $ 100 billion in 2005 dollars ) , and encourages dealers to sign up to sell Manning - Bowman appliances .
This is actually a very sad artifact , because the Manning - Bowman company was in deep financial distress because they could not get materials -- particularly chrome -- during World War II .
This was an attempt to sign up dealers so that credit and financing could be obtained to last out the materiel shortages imposed by the War .
It did not work , and soon thereafter , Manning - Bowman sank into a sea of red ink .
The company 's assets , including its spectacular Art Deco designs , were sold to the Bersted Corporation of Fostoria , Ohio .
Berstead watered down the designs and made low - priced " drug store " versions of many Manning - Bowman appliances .
( The Sandwich Grill on our Kitchen Aplliances page is a good example of this " cheapening " process . )
Alas , Manning - Bowman met an inglorious end , but it was merely a foretaste of the vast wave of shoddy appliances made in faraway dictatorships that suffocate the American marketplace today .

The Edicraft Hexagonal Waffle Iron
In 1887 , Thomas Edison built a research laboratory to be devoted to the " rapid and cheap development of inventions . "
Eventually , about 200 scientists , engineers , and technicians were employed there to invent to order , “ useful things that every man woman and child wants … at a price they can afford to pay . ”
The " Edicraft " line came close to fitting this paradigm -- it was developed in the late 1920s when electric appliances were a growing industry that generated high profits .
The " Edicraft " line included a clamshell type toaster , a sandwich grill , a waffle iron [ below ] , a combination grill / waffle iron and a coffee urn / water heater ( the “ Siphonator ” . )
The entire line was of high quality but were expensive , on the order of $ 25 per unit -- equivalent to $ 800 in 2011 !
The Edison Company stopped production of appliances in 1934 .
Edison died in 1931 , at age 84 , but his company , Thomas A. Edison Inc. , remained in business until 1957 when it became a subsidiary of McGraw - Electric .

TABLE BROILERS
We are including a look at Table Broilers here because they are part of the " make it at the table " ethos that prevailed when electric appliances were relatively rare and consequently tres chic .
Wealthy hostesses missed no chance to show off their shiny new appliances .
In turn , companies like Manning - Bowman sold appliances that were more like chrome sculpture .
When appliances became more commonplace , they were removed from the table and relegated to the kitchen .
The Manning - Bowman Smokeless Table Broiler
No doubt you have noticed a strange looking gadget in the ads for the Twin - O - Matic that looks something like a big chrome flying saucer .
That is the Smokeless Table Broiler and it is a real wonder .
Without further ado , let me introduce it to you :
Side View of the Manning - Bowman Smokeless Table Broiler
This appliance actually lets you grill at the table .
It actually works pretty well .
It can broil with the cover closed , sort of like a modern Weber kettle , or the dome can be reversed and it will work like a Hibachi .
It is very cleverly designed
Manning - Bowman Smokeless Table Broiler ready for Covered Mode
In the " Covered Mode " , the chrome " Dome " is hinged to the base and can be lifted with the wooden handle .
Food is placed on the grill and the cover is lowered .
The cord is plugged into a receptacle shown in the previous photo .
The receeptacle is ingenious in that it has two ways of plugging in the cord -- one only activates the inner heating coils ( " LOW " ) while the other connects both the inner and outer coils ( " HIGH " ) .
This is the only temperature regulation available -- and the thing gets quite hot !

Here are two ads that show the Manning Bowman Smokeless Table Broiler in direct competition with the Farberware Broiler Robot .
These ads came from facing pages in the September 18 , 1941 issue of LIFE magazine , and are a very rare example of head - to - head competition .
The Farber item was priced $ 2 less than the M - B appliance .
They were still both expensive !
$ 7.95 and $ 9.95 in 1941 would be approximately equal to $ 168 and $ 210 in terms of 2005 purchasing power .
We note that the Manning - Bowman folks were practically " giving away " a very nice serving platter ( for an extra $ 2 ) if you bought their broiler .
Competing Ads for Table Broilers - September 1941
One of my readers sent in the following photo of a Farber Broiler Robot in action .
This is reader Frank cooking a steak in the Robot while generating power from a Kohler 1A2 portable power plant .
This is the kind of gasoline generator that would have been used on farms prior to the Rural Electrification Administration .
Frank brings his generator to various shows -- he has quite a nifty rig there !

Holliwood followed with a design for an ornate broiler in 1944 and Farber got into the business in 1946 -- with a broiler that very closely emulates the Manning - Bowman version .
Recipes
There are two types of waffles : American Waffles ( made with baking powder ) and Belgian Waffles ( mostly made with yeast ) .
You can make either of them in your Twin - O - Matic .
They are about 100 % Carbohydrates , so Atkins people will have to just watch what goes on here .
American Waffles
This is a standard waffle recipe that was part of the instruction booklet for the Twin - O - Matic and is still being recommended by waffle iron companies .

Comments by Mike Adams , the Health Ranger ( NaturalNews ) With Breast Cancer Awareness month fully upon us once again , retail stores have been invaded with everything pink , including " pink ribbon " candies and personal care products made with blatantly cancer - causing ingredients .
Retail grocery stores like Safeway even hit up customers for donations at the cash register , promising to raise funds to find " the cure for cancer . "
Consumers of course , have virtually no idea where the funds they donate actually go , nor do they know the truths about breast cancer they 'll never be told by conventional cancer non-profit organizations .
In this article , I 'll reveal ten important myths about breast cancer , and the truths that can save your life .
Myth # 1 : Breast Cancer is not preventable The Truth : Up to 98 % of breast cancer cases can be prevented through diet , nutritional supplements , sunshine and exercise
It 's true : Breast cancer can be almost entirely prevented through commonsense changes in diet , the addition of anti-cancer nutritional supplements , boosting vitamin D creation from sunlight , avoiding exposure to toxic chemicals in consumer products , pursuing regular exercise and eating a live foods diet .
The breast cancer industry -- which depends on the continuation of cancer for its profits and employment -- has so far refused to teach women even basic cancer prevention strategies ( such as increasing the intake of vitamin D , which prevents 77 % of all cancers ) .
See :
Myth # 2 : Pink ribbon products are sold to raise money to support breast cancer victims .
The Truth : Nearly 100 % of the funds are used to recruit more breast cancer patients into highly - lucrative treatments that do more harm than good .
You know where all that money goes that you donate to the " search for the cure " and other cancer scams ?
Virtually none of it goes to actually teach women how to prevent cancer .
The World Health Organization says 70 % of all cancers are preventable , but the zero percent of women actually prevent it .
Those funds actually go to recruiting breast cancer patients by offering " free " mammograms .
This is the clever recruitment strategy of the
Want proof of where these funds go ?
Check out this grant list at the Komen for the Cure organization , and you 'll see it 's almost entirely spent on recruiting more women with mammograms :
http://www.komenphoenix.org/site/c.nsKZL3PHL...
When you read that list , note that there is not a single grant provided for nutritional education to teach women how to prevent cancer with vitamin D , cruciferous vegetables , anti-cancer herbs , supplements or to avoid dangerous cancer - causing food ingredients like sodium nitrite , MSG and chemical sweeteners .
Myth # 3 : The only proven treatments for breast cancer are chemotherapy and radiation The Truth : Chemotherapy does n't work and radiation causes cancer
Chemotherapy is a fraud , plain and simple .
It 's as ludicrous as poisoning patients with mercury and calling it medicine ( which is something doctors did a hundred years ago , by the way ) .
There is absolutely no reliable scientific evidence showing that chemotherapy has any positive effect whatsoever on breast cancer .
Try to find the science yourself :
It does n't exist !
Sure , there 's evidence that chemotherapy shrinks tumors .
Too bad , however , that tumor size is irrelevant .
Artificially reducing the size of a tumor does nothing to reverse the physiology of cancer in a patient 's body .
It does n't initiate the healing that needs to take place to reverse cancer and stay cancer free .
And this does n't even take into account the quality of life issues here : Chemotherapy does n't help people LIVE any longer , but it sure does make them DIE longer !
Myth # 4 : Chemotherapy is safe and does n't cause permanent damage to your health The Truth : Chemotherapy causes vomiting , hair loss , muscle loss , brain damage , heart damage , kidney damage and liver damage .
Much of this damage is permanent .

Myth # 5 : Regular mammograms are the best way to detect cancer The Truth : Mammograms harm 10 women for every one woman they help
Here 's part of a story we published in 2006 , called Breast Cancer Screening Harms Ten Women for Every One That it Helps ( https://www.naturalnews.com/020829.html)
" A new study by researchers from the Nordic Cochrane Centre in Denmark found that mammograms may harm ten times as many women as they help .
The researchers examined the benefits and negative effects of seven breast cancer screening programs on 500,000 women in the United States , Canada , Scotland and Sweden .
The study 's authors found that for every 2,000 women who received mammograms over a 10 - year period , only one would have her life prolonged , but 10 would endure unnecessary and potentially harmful treatments . "
Got that ?
For every 2,000 women receiving mammograms , only ONE would have her life extended at all .
TEN women , though , would be harmed with chemotherapy , radiation or mastectomies .
What the study did n't point out , by the way , is that all these treatments are highly profitable for the cancer industry .
That 's the real reason why mammograms are pushed so aggressively onto women .
It 's not because mammograms detect cancer ; it 's because mammograms make them money .
To the breast cancer industry , a woman is nothing more than a piece of meat with a cash reward attached to it .
The push for mammography is a marketing ploy designed to keep women scared , misinformed and lined up to be poisoned with chemotherapy while they shell out their life savings for treatments that , for most of them , are n't even medically justified !
That 's why I say the breast cancer industry is , by any honest assessment , a crime against women .
In America , husbands who beat their wives are considered criminals .
They 're arrested and locked away .
But those very same men , when wearing a doctor 's coat , can assault women with chemicals , slice off their breasts with scalpels and even kill those women ... all with impunity .
There 's not a single breast cancer doctor who has ever been arrested for the death of a patient .
The true history of western medicine 's violence against women
In time , of course , this will change .
Medical violence against women is a crime , regardless of whether the weapon is a fist , a baseball bat or a syringe full of chemicals that will cause permanent damage to her vital organs .
In time , chemotherapy will be outlawed and breast cancer doctors will be put out of work or prosecuted for their crimes against women .
Perhaps they 'll even be castrated as part of a " fitting " punishment .
To all the women reading this , note carefully the history of western medicine and its numerous assaults on women over the years .
Do you know where the term " hysterectomy " comes from ?
It comes from the belief by male doctors that women 's emotions were " hysterical , " and they believed the best way to " cure " women of their hysteria was to violently cut her reproductive organs out of her body .
The procedure was widely adopted by male surgeons and used for well over a hundred years to treat women who were diagnosed as suffering from virtually every kind of emotional variance you can imagine .
Doctors who did n't use scalpels to remove these organs from a woman 's body often resorted to so - called " pelvic massages " -- a medicalized raping of the female patient by the male doctor , of course .
Even today , tens of thousands of hysterectomies are performed each year with no medical justification whatsoever .
Doctors continue to view women 's bodies as diseased and abnormal , surgically removing their breasts and reproductive organs for no justifiable reason whatsoever .
It 's even being done today as a cancer prevention procedure , against women who have no cancer at all !
Western medicine 's treatment of breast cancer patients today is little more than an extension of hundreds of years of medical violence against women by the male - dominated medical establishment .
Want proof ?
Notice that cancer doctors never advise men to surgically remove their testicles as a way to " prevent " testicular cancer ?
That 's because the male surgeons performing these operations prefer to maim women , not men .
If you have the stomach for it , read the rest of the truth about how conventional doctors and surgeons commit outrageous medical violence against women and children even today :
Myth # 6 : BRCA - positive women should consider mastectomies to prevent cancer The Truth : Cruciferous vegetables target BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes , preventing cancer with nutrition
Women who are BRCA positive are being scared into utterly unnecessary double mastectomies -- a procedure that benefits no one except the surgeon .
What nobody is telling these women is that cruciferous vegetables contain anti-cancer nutrients that specifically target BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes , protecting these women from breast cancer .
All it takes is a single ounce of fresh broccoli juice each day , or fresh sprouts , superfoods or other nutrient - dense foods or juices consumed daily .
Cancer doctors , of course , conveniently forget to tell women about these little facts .
It would hurt their business if women knew how to prevent cancer on their own , at home , with everyday groceries and simple herbs .
Here 's text from one study that might interest you .
It shows that I3C ( from broccoli ) and genistein ( from fermented soy ) inhibit estrogen - stimulated receptor activity in a dose - dependent fashion :
" ... we showed that I3C induces BRCA1 expression and that both I3C and BRCA1 inhibit oestrogen ( E2 ) - stimulated oestrogen receptor ( ER - ) activity in human breast cancer cells .
We now report that both I3C and genistein induce the expression of both breast cancer susceptibility genes ( BRCA1 and BRCA2 ) in breast ( MCF - 7 and T47D ) and prostate ( DU - 145 and LNCaP ) cancer cell types , in a time - and dose - dependent fashion .
http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v94/n3/ful...
Conventional cancer doctors , of course , refuse to tell women about scientific evidence like this .
If women could prevent breast cancer with I3C , why would they need cancer doctors ?
The answer , of course , is that they would n't .
You can buy I3C , but the way , right here :
The FDA , of course , wo n't allow companies selling I3C supplements to tell you the scientifically - validated truth about their anti-cancer benefits .
It 's all part of the censorship and oppression that characterizes today 's cancer industry .
The U.S. government , of course , is the co-conspirator in this sad tragedy of misinformation .
It is the job of the FDA and the cancer industry to keep women stupid , uninformed and scared when it comes to breast cancer .
The last thing they want is for women to be nutritionally literate .
Myth # 7 : The cancer non-profits are searching for a cure for cancer The Truth : Even if one was found , they would never allow a cure to be publicized :
It would destroy the cancer treatment industry
It 's the great scam of the cancer industry :
We 're searching for a cure , they claim !
Never mind the fact that they 've been using this same con since the late 60's , when they claimed to be only a few million dollars away from curing cancer forever .
The search for " the cure " is pure deception .
It 's a clever con to take money from people for all those silly pink ribbon activities , but the truth is that the cancer industry does n't believe there 's such a thing as cure .
Just ask the FDA , the AMA or any state health licensing board :
Anyone claiming to have a cancer " cure " is immediately considered a quack .
Over the last several decades , countless doctors researching genuine cancer cures have been arrested , imprisoned or run out of the country .
Read about Stanislaw Burzynski to learn about just one example :
Finally , even if they actually find a " cure " ( which they wo n't , since that would destroy the profits of the cancer industry ) , do you think they would give it away for free ?
Of course not !
They 'd charge hundreds of thousands of dollars for it , milking the maximum profits out of a terrified population for their newest wonder drug .
Notice , by the way , that not a single conventional breast cancer non-profit group -- nor any drug company -- has announced that its breakthrough cancer drugs will be given away for free .
And that leads me to this question :
If they 're not planning on giving away the cure for free , then why are you giving them money for free to pay for their R&D ?
Why should people donate money to the wealthiest corporations in the world ( the drug companies ) who are going to take their money and use it to develop a new wave of drugs that are sold to cancer victims at outrageous price markups sometimes exceeding 550,000 % of the cost of the chemical ingredients ?
The truth is , anyone who donates money for any such " search for the cure " is being conned outright .
There 's a sucker born every minute , P.T. Barnum famously said .
What he neglected to add is that most of them are now buying pink products and thinking they 're helping find a " cure " for cancer .
Do n't be suckered .
Keep your money , or invest it in vitamin D supplements or anti-cancer herbs .
You want to cure cancer ?
Cure it in your own body first .
It 's a lot less expensive , and you get to keep your hair , too .
Myth # 8 : There is no cure for breast cancer The Truth :
There are MANY natural cures for breast cancer available right now
Just a few hours of research will turn up numerous natural cures for cancer : Vitamin D , cat 's claw herbs , the Essiac formula , medicinal mushrooms ,
All these cures have one thing in common :
They are ALL suppressed by the FDA and FTC .
Telling the truth about anti-cancer foods , herbs or supplements is now a criminal offense in America .
Myth # 9 : If my mother had breast cancer , I 'll get it too The Truth : Breast Cancer is not caused by bad genes ; it 's caused by bad diets
This is another common lie told to woman by cancer doctors to scare them into medically unnecessary cancer " treatments " ( which can kill you or harm you ) .
Did you know that radiation treatment for one breast actually causes cancer in the OTHER breast ?
See :
Your genes do n't control your health , but what you put in your mouth and on your skin has near - total control over your health !
If your parents had cancer , they were no doubt eating cancer - causing foods ( processed meats ) and not using anti-cancer foods , superfoods , herbs and supplements .
They were also likely deficient in vitamin D , and they probably did n't drink fresh anti-cancer vegetables on a daily basis (
Read the truth about processed meats :
Myth # 10 : Sunlight causes cancer The Truth : Sunlight generates Vitamin D in your skin , which prevents 78 % of ALL cancers
The disinformation put out by the cancer industry about sunlight has reached a level of absurdity that 's virtually unmatched in the history of medicine .
If you believe what the American Cancer Society tells you ( still being suckered ? ) , sunlight causes cancer !
Yes , that 's right : Sunlight causes cancer , they claim .
According to the entire cancer industry ( and most dermatologists , too ) , you'd be much better off hiding in a cave , or living your life under fluorescent lights or smothered in a layer of toxic sunscreen chemicals ( which actually DO cause cancer , by the way ) .
Somehow , the human race has miraculously managed to survived 350,000 years of natural sunlight without be obliterated .
This is nothing short of astonishing , given that sunlight is so deadly .
It sort of makes me wonder how the human race survived at all , with sunlight striking any given area of the Earth , say , 50 % of the time .
Did our ancestors live underground ?
The ploy here is so obvious that it 's child 's play to expose their strategy : Cancer industry authorities know that vitamin D prevents 77 % of all cancers .
Since sunlight exposure causes the skin to generate vitamin D in the human body ( for free , no less ) , the cancer industry has come to the realization that in order for it to continue surviving ( and exploiting cancer patients ) , it has to scare people away from anything that might actually prevent or cure cancer .
This is the whole reason behind the sunlight scare campaigns , of course .
It 's all just a clever profit strategy to keep people sick and diseased by enforcing widespread vitamin D deficiency across the human population .
Note , too , that this deficiency is especially prominent in men and women of darker skin color , which means the cancer industry 's whole campaign against sunlight is filled with disturbing racial overtones that smack of genocide .
( Ever wonder why breast cancer is FAR more aggressive in black women and white women ?
It 's the vitamin D deficiency caused by the skin color , of course .
But cancer docs never tell their black patients anything about it ...)
Remember this :
Healthy people with abundant vitamin D levels in their blood do n't get cancer and they almost never catch colds .
They also do n't need vaccines , by the way .
These are three huge profit centers for conventional medicine : Cancer , vaccines and colds .
This is why the industry goes to such great lengths to ( hilariously ) try to discredit the sun .
It 's hilarious because the sun , of course , is the source of ALL life on our planet .
Without the sun , there would be no plants , no bacteria , no animals , no fish and certainly no humans .
The sun is the single most important source of life on our planet , and without it , we 'd all die in a matter of a few hours ( from the cold alone ) .
That the cancer industry would declare war on the sun is just a disturbing example of how far removed modern medicine is from the real world .
Why the cancer industry is dangerous to women
The cancer industry people are living in a world of self - reinforced fictions , where sunlight is bad and chemotherapy chemicals are good ; where food is useless but pharmaceuticals are essential .
Almost everything said to you by a conventional cancer doctor is the opposite of what 's real , and yet they believe their own delusions only because those delusions are so widely shared by their colleagues .
It is circular logic at its worst , driven by arrogance and greed , and totally lacking any discernable degree of intellectual honesty or compassion for the value of a human life .
The cancer industry is , in a very real way , a danger to the safety of men and women alike .
It is a kind of home - grown medical terrorism , through which the application of fear and disinformation results in massive corporate profits that are only exceeded by the body count of our dead women ; our mothers , daughters , sisters , aunts and nieces who fall victim to conventional cancer treatments .
They are being lost to a medical regime wielding weapons of mass destruction : Chemical weapons ( chemotherapy ) , radiological weapons ( radiation ) and weapons of sharp steel ( scalpels ) .
These weapons of medical violence are being directed at our women for one purpose only :
To secure profits that go into the hands of a few wealthy men who sit at the top of these organizations , raking in fifty - million - dollar salaries while the cancer treatment centers send women home in body bags .
It is the ultimate act of cruelty to promise a woman " treatment " and then deliver poison .
It is the ultimate act of violence to promise a woman " healing " and then mutilate her body .
The cancer industry , as operated today , is ultimately a criminal organization engaged in acts of medical violence against women .
Why women should revolt against the cancer industry Even worse , it is being staffed by women , cheered by women and supported by women .
In World War II , before the Jews were exterminated , Nazi soldiers pried the gold fillings out of their mouths .
The fillings were sold off , and the money went to two places :
The pockets of the top Nazi commanders , and the continued funding of the prison camps and extermination chambers .
The Jewish prisoners , in other words , paid for their own gas chamber treatments using the gold right out of their own mouths .
Today , women are paying for their own cancer industry chemical assaults using the dollars right out of their own pockets .
Those who support the conventional breast cancer non-profits are feeding the very beast that may someday destroy them and send them home poisoned , emaciated , or mutilated beyond repair .
And you know what the pink ribbon non-profits will do to help these women ?
WIGS .
They 'll give them wigs to cover their hairless heads .
Chemotherapy victim or concentration camp prisoner ?
They both produce these same results .
Zyklon B gas , by the way , was manufactured by a pharmaceutical company .
It is no coincidence that women who receive chemotherapy visually resemble the women of the Nazi concentration camps .
They become emaciated through dangerous losses of muscle mass and bone mass .
They lose their hair , vomit their food and suffer the devastating effects of massive nutrient loss .
They are , in effect , both prisoners of the same system of control and violence against women .
It is a system that has existed for thousands of years , taking on new names and new faces as it shifts from one corner of the planet to another .
Today , that system of abuse and violence against women has a corporate logo , a cute pink symbol and a clever slogan .
It has hundreds of offices all across the country , and thousands of pink products in retail stores .
It is a system of violence against women , painted pink and repackaged as something that cares for women ; and in that disguise , aided by the purchasing dollars of gullible consumers , it is ensnaring women in a system of such great evil that it can only be accurately compared to historical events like the Holocaust .
May God save our women from the cancer industry , lest we lose four generations to this modern chemical holocaust that has been unleashed against our mothers , daughters , grandmothers and sisters .
And if our government will not protect us from this home - grown terrorism that seeks to turn the bodies of women into corporate profit centers , I hope that the People of America will one day wake up and take all justified ( non-violent ) measures to protect themselves from the cancer industry .
It is odd , I think , that women will protest in front of abortion clinics in order to save the life of an unborn child , and yet that same woman will say nothing when a cancer doctor destroys the life of her own mother or daughter .
It is time to start protesting the cancer clinics and cancer non-profits .
It is time to end this chemical holocaust and this medical violence against women .
The women should be marching against mammograms and chemotherapy , demanding the arrest and prosecution of cancer surgeons who perform unjustified double mastectomies .
Throughout history , women have fought hard for the right to vote , to pursue an education and to be heard .
I believe it is time that women exercised those rights to protect their freedoms and their lives from the conventional cancer industry .

It 's a lot less expensive , and you get to keep your hair , too . :
There are MANY natural cures for breast cancer available right nowJust a few hours of research will turn up numerous natural cures for cancer : Vitamin D , cat 's claw herbs , the Essiac formula , medicinal mushrooms , spirulina , cruciferous vegetables , green tea , graviola herbs , Chinese medicinal herbs , oxygen therapy , alkalizing water therapies and much more .
All these cures have one thing in common :
They are ALL suppressed by the FDA and FTC .
Telling the truth about anti-cancer foods , herbs or supplements is now a criminal offense in America . : Breast Cancer is not caused by bad genes ; it 's caused by bad diets
This is another common lie told to woman by cancer doctors to scare them into medically unnecessary cancer " treatments " ( which can kill you or harm you ) .

Your genes do n't control your health , but what you put in your mouth and on your skin has near - total control over your health !
If your parents had cancer , they were no doubt eating cancer - causing foods ( processed meats ) and not using anti-cancer foods , superfoods , herbs and supplements .
They were also likely deficient in vitamin D , and they probably did n't drink fresh anti-cancer vegetables on a daily basis ( www.JuiceFeasting.com ) .
Lastly , they no doubt had regular exposure to cancer - causing chemicals : Cigarette smoke , chemical solvents , perfume chemicals , household cleaners , pesticides , skin care products , conventional cosmetics , etc. Read the truth about processed meats : https://www.naturalnews.com/022288.html
Sunlight generates Vitamin D in your skin , which prevents 78 % of ALL cancers
The disinformation put out by the cancer industry about sunlight has reached a level of absurdity that 's virtually unmatched in the history of medicine .
If you believe what the American Cancer Society tells you ( still being suckered ? ) , sunlight causes cancer !
Yes , that 's right : Sunlight causes cancer , they claim .
According to the entire cancer industry ( and most dermatologists , too ) , you'd be much better off hiding in a cave , or living your life under fluorescent lights or smothered in a layer of toxic sunscreen chemicals ( which actually DO cause cancer , by the way ) .
Somehow , the human race has miraculously managed to survived 350,000 years of natural sunlight without be obliterated .
This is nothing short of astonishing , given that sunlight is so deadly .
It sort of makes me wonder how the human race survived at all , with sunlight striking any given area of the Earth , say , 50 % of the time .
Did our ancestors live underground ?
The ploy here is so obvious that it 's child 's play to expose their strategy : Cancer industry authorities know that vitamin D prevents 77 % of all cancers .
Since sunlight exposure causes the skin to generate vitamin D in the human body ( for free , no less ) , the cancer industry has come to the realization that in order for it to continue surviving ( and exploiting cancer patients ) , it has to scare people away from anything that might actually prevent or cure cancer .
This is the whole reason behind the sunlight scare campaigns , of course .
It 's all just a clever profit strategy to keep people sick and diseased by enforcing widespread vitamin D deficiency across the human population .
Note , too , that this deficiency is especially prominent in men and women of darker skin color , which means the cancer industry 's whole campaign against sunlight is filled with disturbing racial overtones that smack of genocide .
( Ever wonder why breast cancer is FAR more aggressive in black women and white women ?
It 's the vitamin D deficiency caused by the skin color , of course .
But cancer docs never tell their black patients anything about it ... )
Remember this :
Healthy people with abundant vitamin D levels in their blood do n't get cancer and they almost never catch colds .
They also do n't need vaccines , by the way .
These are three huge profit centers for conventional medicine : Cancer , vaccines and colds .
This is why the industry goes to such great lengths to ( hilariously ) try to discredit the sun .
It 's hilarious because the sun , of course , is the source of ALL life on our planet .
Without the sun , there would be no plants , no bacteria , no animals , no fish and certainly no humans .
The sun is the single most important source of life on our planet , and without it , we 'd all die in a matter of a few hours ( from the cold alone ) .
That the cancer industry would declare war on the sun is just a disturbing example of how far removed modern medicine is from the real world . , where sunlight is bad and chemotherapy chemicals are good ; where food is useless but pharmaceuticals are essential .
Almost everything said to you by a conventional cancer doctor is the opposite of what 's real , and yet they believe their own delusions only because those delusions are so widely shared by their colleagues .
It is circular logic at its worst , driven by arrogance and greed , and totally lacking any discernable degree of intellectual honesty or compassion for the value of a human life .
The cancer industry is , in a very real way , a danger to the safety of men and women alike .
It is a kind of home - grown medical terrorism , through which the application of fear and disinformation results in massive corporate profits that are only exceeded by the body count of our dead women ; our mothers , daughters , sisters , aunts and nieces who fall victim to conventional cancer treatments .
They are being lost to a medical regime wielding weapons of mass destruction : Chemical weapons ( chemotherapy ) , radiological weapons ( radiation ) and weapons of sharp steel ( scalpels ) .
These weapons of medical violence are being directed at our women for one purpose only :
To secure profits that go into the hands of a few wealthy men who sit at the top of these organizations , raking in fifty - million - dollar salaries while the cancer treatment centers send women home in body bags .
It is the ultimate act of cruelty to promise a woman " treatment " and then deliver poison .
It is the ultimate act of violence to promise a woman " healing " and then mutilate her body .
The cancer industry , as operated today , is ultimately a criminal organization engaged in acts of Even worse , it is being staffed by women , cheered by women and supported by women .
In World War II , before the Jews were exterminated , Nazi soldiers pried the gold fillings out of their mouths .
The fillings were sold off , and the money went to two places :
The pockets of the top Nazi commanders , and the continued funding of the prison camps and extermination chambers .
The Jewish prisoners , in other words , paid for their own gas chamber treatments using the gold right out of their own mouths .
Today , women are paying for their own cancer industry chemical assaults using the dollars right out of their own pockets .
Those who support the conventional breast cancer non-profits are feeding the very beast that may someday destroy them and send them home poisoned , emaciated , or mutilated beyond repair .
And you know what the pink ribbon non-profits will do to help these women ?
WIGS .
They 'll give them wigs to cover their hairless heads .
It is no coincidence that women who receive chemotherapy visually resemble the women of the Nazi concentration camps .
They become emaciated through dangerous losses of muscle mass and bone mass .
They lose their hair , vomit their food and suffer the devastating effects of massive nutrient loss .
They are , in effect , both prisoners of the same system of control and violence against women .
It is a system that has existed for thousands of years , taking on new names and new faces as it shifts from one corner of the planet to another .
Today , that system of abuse and violence against women has a corporate logo , a cute pink symbol and a clever slogan .
It has hundreds of offices all across the country , and thousands of pink products in retail stores .
It is a system of violence against women , painted pink and repackaged as something that cares for women ; and in that disguise , aided by the purchasing dollars of gullible consumers , it is ensnaring women in a system of such great evil that it can only be accurately compared to historical events like the Holocaust .
May
God save our women from the cancer industry , lest we lose four generations to this modernthat has been unleashed against our mothers , daughters , grandmothers and sisters .
And if our government will not protect us from this home - grown terrorism that seeks to turn the bodies of women into corporate profit centers , I hope that the People of America will one day wake up and take all justified ( non-violent ) measures to protect themselves from the cancer industry .
It is odd , I think , that women will protest in front of abortion clinics in order to save the life of an unborn child , and yet that same woman will say nothing when a cancer doctor destroys the life of her own mother or daughter .
It is time to start protesting the cancer clinics and cancer non-profits .
It is time to end this chemical holocaust and this medical violence against women .
The women should be marching against mammograms and chemotherapy , demanding the arrest and prosecution of cancer surgeons who perform unjustified double mastectomies .
Throughout history , women have fought hard for the right to vote , to pursue an education and to be heard .
I believe it is time that women exercised those rights to protect their freedoms and their lives from the conventional cancer industry .

The Cancer Industry 's Big Lie ( comic )
Johns Hopkins scientists report success in significantly suppressing levels of the " hunger hormone " ghrelin in pigs using a minimally invasive means of chemically vaporizing the main vessel carrying blood to the top section , or fundus , of the stomach .
An estimated 90 percent of the body 's ghrelin originates in the fundus , which can't make the hormone without a good blood supply .
" With gastric artery chemical embolization , called GACE , there 's no major surgery , " says Aravind Arepally , M.D. , clinical director of the Center for Bioengineering Innovation and Design and associate professor of radiology and surgery at the John Hopkins University School of Medicine .
" In our study in pigs , this procedure produced an effect similar to bariatric surgery by suppressing ghrelin levels and subsequently lowering appetite . "
Reporting on the research in the Sept. 16 online edition of Radiology , Arepally and his team note that for more than a decade , efforts to safely and easily suppress grehlin have met with very limited success .
Bariatric surgery -- involving the removal , reconstruction or bypass of part of the stomach or bowel -- is effective in suppressing appetite and leading to significant weight loss , but carries substantial surgical risks and complications .
" Obesity is the biggest biomedical problem in the country , and a minimally invasive alternative would make an enormous difference in choices and outcomes for obese people , " Arepally says .
Arepally and colleagues conducted their study over the course of four weeks using 10 healthy , growing pigs ; after an overnight fast , the animals were weighed and blood samples were taken to measure baseline ghrelin levels .
Pigs were the best option , he says , because of their human - like anatomy and physiology .
Using X - ray for guidance , members of the research team threaded a thin tube up through a large blood vessel near the pigs ' groins and then into the gastric arteries supplying blood to the stomachs .
There , they administered one - time injections of saline in the left gastric arteries of five control pigs , and in the other five , one - time injections of sodium morrhuate , a chemical that destroys the blood vessels .
The team then sampled the pigs ' blood for one month to monitor ghrelin values .
The levels of the hormone in GACE - treated pigs were suppressed up to 60 percent from baseline .
" Appetite is complicated because it involves both the mind and body , " Arepally says .
" Ghrelin fluctuates throughout the day , responding to all kinds of emotional and physiological scenarios .
But even if the brain says " produce more ghrelin , " GACE physically prevents the stomach from making the hunger hormone . "
The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health .
Authors on the paper are Brad P. Barnett , Tarek T. Patel , Valerie Howland , Racy C. Boston , Dara L. Kraitchman , Ashkan A. Malayeri , and Arepally , all of Johns Hopkins .

ST . LOUIS ( Reuters ) - With the U.S. financial crisis dominating voter concerns just two weeks before election day , Republican John McCain is facing renewed criticism for his choice of Sarah Palin as a vice presidential running mate .

Conservative commentators , late - night comedians and even retired Gen. Colin Powell have questioned the Arizona senator ’s judgment for putting the little - known Alaska governor on the White House ticket .
Palin , a mother of five whose staunch opposition to abortion rights has energized her party ’s base , is still drawing large crowds and bringing conservative voters who were wary of McCain back to the Republican fold .
But crucial independents in must - win battleground states on November 4 are having second thoughts , analysts say , after Palin ’s performance on the national stage failed to illustrate her readiness to take over the country ’s top job .
Powell , a Republican former secretary of state under President George W. Bush , cited McCain ’s shaky response to the financial crisis and his choice of Palin as one reason he crossed party lines to endorse Democrat Barack Obama .
“ She ’s a very distinguished woman , and she ’s to be admired , but at the same time , now that we have had a chance to watch her for some seven weeks , I do n’t believe she ’s ready to be president of the United States , which is the job of the vice president , ” Powell said on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
“ That raised some question in my mind as to the judgment that Senator McCain made , ” he said .
Influential Republican commentators like Peggy Noonan , a former speechwriter for Ronald Reagan , are also unimpressed .
“ There is little sign that she has the tools , the equipment , the knowledge or the philosophical grounding one hopes for , and expects , in a holder of high office , ” Noonan wrote of Palin in the Wall Street Journal last week .
“ This is not a leader , this is a follower . ”
McCain vigorously rejects that charge , and supporters at his rallies give enthusiastic support to the Alaska governor , brushing off criticism from the political left and the right .
“ I think she ’s qualified just by the simple fact ... ( of ) how she ’s handled being the governor of Alaska ( and ) seeing her as a mother and handling a family , ” said Nina Robinson , 46 , of Toledo , Ohio .
“ She ’s actually done something , you know , she ’s had to run a big budget , she ’s had to deal with that kind of stuff , ” said Robinson ’s husband , Darryl , 46 , a carpenter .
Palin ’s supporters cite her grit and concern for her family as qualities that go beyond political experience and say her critics are out of touch with average Americans .
ECONOMIC CRISIS
But many others are not convinced .
They question whether her experience as a small - town mayor and two years as governor of a lightly populated state with no international experience qualified her to handle a crisis should she become president .
McCain was grilled about her qualifications in a conference call with Jewish voters on Sunday and during an interview with “ Fox News Sunday ” he was asked whether Palin ’s choice as a “ cold political calculation ” had backfired .
“ As a cold political calculation , I could not be more pleased , ” McCain responded .
“ She ’s a reformer .
She ’s a conservative .
She ’s the best thing that could have happened to my campaign and to America . ”
Despite some narrowing in recent days , McCain is trailing Obama in national and battleground state opinion polls , which many observers chalk up to the economic crisis .
“ Before the financial crisis she helped him .
Now she hurts him , ” said Julian Zelizer , professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University .
“ Those questions about ( McCain ’s ) leadership , layered over a crisis that is scaring Americans in very profound ways , made Palin ’s weaknesses even more important in terms of whether she can handle these challenges , ” he said .
Michele Swers , an associate professor in government at Georgetown University , said concern about Palin was especially pronounced among independents , whom McCain is trying to woo .
“ The independent voters are the ones who are most likely to have questions about her and not be comfortable with her , and possibly that would be one more reason to turn away from McCain , ” she said .
“ But I think overall , if they ’re turning away from McCain , it ’s because of the economy . ”
At least one independent voter , who said she was a McCain supporter , disputed that at a rally in Ohio .
“ I like Sarah Palin .
I think she ’s refreshing , ” said Mary Carol Krotzer , 64 .
“ I do n’t want to live in a socialist country and I think that ’s where Barack and the Democrats are taking us . ”
Analysts said in the end , voters will most likely vote based on the presidential candidates -- not their running mates -- anyway .
“ People vote for president , not vice president , ” said Matthew Eshbaugh - Soha , an assistant professor in political science at the University of North Texas .
“ Powell has reservations , and I think numerous people express the Palin pick in the same light -- a question about McCain ’s judgment , ” he said .
“ I just do not think anyone who may decide their pick based on the ( vice president ) is still undecided . ”

If the government becomes a law breaker , it breeds contempt for law ; it invites every man to become a law unto himself ; it invites anarchy .
To declare that in the administration of the criminal law the end justifies the means ' to declare that the government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal ' would bring terrible retribution .
[ From dissenting opinion in Olmstead vs. United States , in which the court upheld the use of wiretaps in a case involving an investigation of bootlegging .
Brandeis strongly defended the individual right to privacy from government intrusion . ]
- Louis D. Brandeis , 1928
That 's what Congress is poised to do , " to declare that the government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal " with passage of the FISA Amendments Act.
Except , of course , that they have n't even secured any convictions through the warrantless surveillance , at least not that they 've made public -- and believe me , if they had any convictions to justify the program , we'd have heard about it .
The Congress is about to severely expand the already too - extensive authority of the president in surveilling the citizens of this nation .
In doing so , it is ignoring the fact that the government has become a law breaker and made the telcos accessories to the crimes .
Which brings us to the next words of wisdom from Justice Brandeis :
Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases .
Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants ; electric light the most efficient policeman .
- Louis D. Brandeis , quoted in Other People 's Money and How the Bankers Use It ( What Publicity Can Do , Ch 5 , p. 92 ) ( Frederick A. Stokes Co. ed. )
For the nation to regain any trust in government and respect for the rule of law , we have to know what happened .
We need to know what the administration was asking Qwest to do in February of 2001 , well before 9/11 .
We need to know who was targeted in the illegal surveillance program , and we need to know why .
" National security " is not an adequate excuse .
If it were , the administration and so many in Congress would not be fighting so hard for immunity for the telcos .
For one thing , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act already protects private parties who get a certification from the government that their actions are lawful .
This provision is utterly unnecessary , unless the information about Americans intercepted , stored , and turned over to the government does n't fall under the provisions set out in the existing FISA statute .
It 's hard to believe that Congress could actually be less curious and more secretive than than the Bush / Cheney administration in trying to keep this information from ever seeing the light of day .
Can it really be that they 're quaking in their shoes that the Republicans will call them names in the fall so they have no choice but to capitulate ?
Do n't they get that they 're going to be attacked anyway , and gutting the Constitution is n't going to be a preventive for that .
That seems to be a lesson that they are just not catching on to , despite Democratic wins in 2006 and in special elections this year .
If it has n't occurred to Barack Obama , who 's made it as far as securing the nomination for presidency , then I have little hope for the rest of the current crew .
However , there 's a tiny glimmer of hope in the fact that not all -- and in fact a majority -- of Democratic representatives in Congress have opposed retroactive amnesty .
Because of that opposition , a real compromise has arisen : Sen .
Bingaman has one of the three amendments that will be considered on July 8 when the Senate brings this back up .
EFF , who along with the ACLU is representing plaintiffs in these wiretapping cases , has endorsed the amendment :
The Bingaman amendment would prevent Congress from granting immunity in the dark , as described in the press yesterday , by " stay[ing ] pending cases against the telecoms and delay[ ing ] the effective date of any immunity provisions until 90 days after Congress received a report from the inspectors general of the intelligence agencies on the warrantless surveillance program " .
By placing a temporary hold on immunity and on the litigation until 90 days after the IG Report is submitted to Congress , the simple amendment would give Congress and the American people an opportunity to revisit the issue of telco immunity next year , in light of the audit 's findings .
The likelihood of an IG investigation or report by the Bush administration is so minimal as to mean that the decision on immunity would have to happen next year , under a new administration and Congress .
It 's a good idea .
The bad part here is that this amendment has to meet a 60 vote threshold to pass .
That threshold is going to be as hard to meet as the simple majority the amnesty stripping amendment will have to achieve .
But it does hold out the possibility that these crimes will be examined , and that it can happen with a new president , a new Congress .
It 's the kind of amendment that could garner support from moderate and conservative Dems and those few moderate Republicans who are really hoping to hold onto their jobs this cycle .
Which is , of course , where we come in .
Again , Justice Brandeis :
The most important political office is that of private citizen .
- Louis D. Brandeis
That means us .
Our job here is be the citizens that our elected representatives all too often fail to be .
That means holding our representatives , and our nominee , to do their damn job of supporting and defending the Constitution .
One option for fulfilling your duty as a private citizen is Ben Masel 's Operation Read the Bill .
Print a copy of the bill , find your Senators while they are home during this recess -- the 4th of July recess , no less -- and ask them if they 've done their duty of reading the bill .
Ask them if they know that they 're about to redefine the term " WMD " to possibly include many weapons that the U.S. military uses .
Ask them if they know they are about to cede even more of their power -- the power of protecting us , their constituents , from unlawful surveillance -- to the executive .
When you 're done quizzing them on the bill , ask them to support the Feingold / Dodd amendment to strip immunity from the bill and to support the Bingaman amendment .
Ask them to do their job .
Female coffee drinkers beware : that Pumpkin Spice Latte might shrink your breasts .
Or so you would think , if you scanned the headlines last week .
A new study in the British Journal of Cancer has incited mass hysteria over a tenuous link between coffee intake and breast size .
The Telegraph warns : “ Drinking Too Much Coffee Could Shrink Women ’s Breasts , ” while UPI throws in a pun : “ Study : Cups of Java Cut Cup Size .
” But the best comes from the New York Post : “ Women Face Drink & Shrink Dilemma , Coffee Poses a Booby Trap . ”
But before you pour that cup of coffee down the sink ( or “ accidentally ” spill it on your busty archnemesis ) let ’s take a closer look at that study :
Researchers from Sweden recruited 269 women ( average age was 29 ) to have their breast size measured and to answer a questionnaire about coffee intake and other lifestyle choices .
All the women were from families at high risk for breast cancer and about half carried a gene , CYP1A2*1 F , that is associated with breast cancer .
Essentially , the researchers were studying the relationship between CYP1A2* 1 F , breast size , and coffee intake .
The gene is known to control the metabolism of the hormone estrogen as well as certain chemicals found in coffee ; it ’s also been linked to higher breast density and thus higher breast cancer risk .
This is what they found :
For women who had CYP1A2 * 1 F , those who drank 3 or more cups of coffee a day had smaller breasts than those who drank less coffee ( average difference was about 150 mL ) .
However , for women who did not have the gene , drinking more than 3 cups of coffee was actually associated with slightly larger breast size ( average difference was about 50 mL ) .
The researchers do not have an explanation for the correlation between coffee and breast size .
They only conclude that because coffee was correlated with smaller breast size , it supports earlier studies that suggest coffee protects against breast cancer .
But just about all the media accounts gloss over the genetic element and focus on cleavage shrinkage .
Much of the problem lies in the use of the word “ shrink ” ( which appears nowhere in the paper itself ) to suggest that breasts will actually inflate and deflate based on coffee intake .
As the NSF points out , this was a cross-sectional study that took data from one point in time and “ because such a study does n’t look at time trends , it ca n’t establish what causes what . ”
Though the researchers controlled for some factors such as smoking and BMI , there are many others that could ’ve affected the results .
It ’s likely that a woman who drinks 3 + cups of coffee a day would have a different lifestyle than a woman who does n’t drink coffee .
The researchers also point out that breast volume is not the same as breast density , but they chose to measure breast volume because it was easier .
And how did they measure breast volume ?
They approximated the breasts as pyramids using the equation : base area x height / 3 .
So unless you believe your breasts are pyramid - shaped , do n’t worry too much about the coffee - induced " booby trap . "

Ejabberd And Pubsub : It Could Be Much Better
October 26 , 2008
XMPP Pubsub is one of the most interesting pieces of the XMPP protocol stack .
Unfortunately , the current implementations leave a lot to be desired .
Part of the reason for this is because people have n’t paid much attention to it until recently , and part of it is because it has a wide variety of use cases and some of them are still getting sorted out .
Ejabberd in particular has an implementation that is lacking in various ways .
: EXTENDED :
High Memory Use
Memory use with the ejabberd PEP plugin for pubsub is quite high .
Ever since we ’ve turned on pubsub and PEP at jabber.org we ’ve seen a marked increase in memory use - more than two times the normal amount .
This extra memory use has been responsible for the recent jabber.org downtime .
We ’ve now disabled pubsub and PEP until a workaround or a solution can be found .
It appears that the issue is isolated to the PEP plugin for pubsub , specifically with the entity capability cache , and the ejabberd team is investigating it further .
Missing Features
ejabberd ’s implementation is lacking several features .
Here ’s a few basic ones that I needed but are n’t yet implemented ( even in the yet - to - be- release 2.1.0 ) .
Access models other than presence and open -
At a minimum I would think people would require the whitelist access model .
It does n’t take too much work before you start wanting a few private pubsub nodes .

Multi-subscription support - Multi- subscription support is quite interesting , and would be very useful for implementing something like Twitter track in an XMPP world .
- Multi-subscription support is quite interesting , and would be very useful for implementing something like Twitter track in an XMPP world .
Missing hooks - ejabberd modules depends on server hooks to tap into functionality and defined points .
There is only one pubsub related hook currently .
I assume this will evolve as more pubsub functionality is requested and used .
Currently several ideas we are exploring are blocked on these issues .
We ’re working on patches to address the issues , but I ’m sure other people have their pet missing features too .
I looked briefly at Idavoll as an alternative , but it is missing multi-subscribe as well ; I did n’t check the access model support yet .
It would be really handy to see a feature matrix for all pubsub implementations using the service discovery features listed in the spec .
First MUC , Then BOSH , Now Pubsub
Multi-user chat was the first major XMPP extension that came to maturity .
Three years ago , BOSH support was quite lacking , but now there are a large number of implementations for both clients and servers .
I think the next big push will be for pubsub clients and implementations to mature .
I can’t wait , because pubsub is awesome .
Updated 2008 - 10 - 27 : Included more details on pubsub memory usage based on ejabberd teams response that it is a PEP issue as does not appear to affect the baseline pubsub .

Not very many photographers are fortunate enough to be granted access to shoot the Olympic Games .
Those who always are seem to come home with entertaining stories , and amazing images .
The rest of us must live vicariously through them .
Samy 's Camera and Nikon will be hosting a lecture by four accomplished and renowned sports photographers who recently returned from The 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , China .
Robert Beck and John McDonough of Sports Illustrated , Rod Mar of the Seattle Times , and Robert Hanashiro of USA Today will show images from the Games and talk about what it 's like to work in the Olympics environment , on Thursday , November 6th 2008 .
" I am basically going to play the ringmaster for Robert , Rod and John and moderate this wonderful panel , " said Robert Hanashiro .
" I 'll show some of my work and show some behind - the - scenes video I shot with my little point & shoot camera .
My role will be to give the people attending a sense of what we go through to cover the world 's biggest sports event . "
" This was my first chance to cover the Summer Olympics , and so every day was an eye - opening challenge , " Rod Mar said .
" I did some things right , I made some mistakes -- I 'll talk about both the successes and the failures . "
" You know , every team needs a good bench player , " said Robert Beck .
" That was my role at the Olympics .
I did n't cover The Dream Boy ( Michael Phelps ) , The Dream Kids ( various small gymnastic types ) nor the Dream Team ( the dunk studs from the NBA ) .
That 's cool .
I know my place in lesser history . "
Beck 's assignments included a list of diverse sports , such as cycling , volleyball , wrestling , fencing , judo , water polo , team handball , and track and field .
Each sport comes with it's own challenges and shooting strategies .
" I enjoy making pictures and there were plenty to made in Beijing , " said Beck .
" It 's not easy either .
One spends an inordinate amount of time traveling to and from venues and a great deal of time trying to get a good shot while there .
Photographers are very limited in what they can do , where they can go and how they can shoot at the Olympics .
But we had a job to do so you keep on working at it . "

" For me , having Robert Beck , Rod Mar and John McDonough on the same stage makes this a " must - see " event , " said Hanashiro .
" These guys are not only the top photographers working but also funny , informative , inspiring and yes , maybe even a little biting .
The interplay between these three will be something any student or photographer will not want to miss . "
" It 's kind of selfish , " said Hanashiro .
" One of the reasons why I love to be a part of these kinds of programs is that I get to see the work of other great photographers and most of all , hear them talk about it .
The diversity of this panel will be the most interesting part of this program . "
There will be a meet and greet with the photographers during a reception at 6:30 pm and Nikon will be on hand with all their latest equipment .
Following the lecture there will be a question and answer session with the photographers .

This looks kind of interesting :
http://wiki.reia-lang.org/wiki/Reia_Programming_Language
In short : it ’s a Ruby / Python type of language on top of Erlang .
It has a mishmash of Ruby and Python syntax , and also does objects , implemented as Erlang processes .
Funny quote :
Reia uses an indentation - sensitive syntax .
This allows Reia to look similar to Erlang without relying on “ ant turd ” tokens ( i.e. , ; and . ) to structure relationships between forms .
That made me laugh , and is in all seriousness , something that I do find to be a bit annoying in Erlang , especially when refactoring code .
You ca n’t just move a line of code from one place to another ; you move it , then change the line endings in both places .
My preference would be to do something more Ruby style rather than Python style for the following reason : the indentation thing makes it harder to use straight - up Python for templating purposes , whereas Ruby can be used as - is .
Templates are something that I would n’t particularly want to do in Erlang , either , so doing them with this language might be a very nice alternative .
Anyway , it looks to be in its infancy .
Unfortunately , it seems to require a more recent version of Erlang than what ships with Ubuntu Hardy .
Maybe Intrepid will have something recent enough to run it .
It ’s a little known fact that I originally wrote Hecl in Erlang , although , sadly , I ca n’t find the code any more .
Eighties pop star Rick Astley has a surprise nomination in the Best Act Ever category at this year 's MTV Europe Music Awards in Liverpool .
The 42 - year - old singer spoke to Newsbeat about being shortlisted , what he thinks of the ' Rickrolling ' phenomenon and how his daughter thinks his hits are naff .
Listen to Rick 's interview
So Rick , how did you hear about the nomination ?
A friend of mine e-mailed me this morning .
A bit of a shock really , bit weird I think , a bit off the scale .
How do you feel about it ?
It 's very very odd .
It 's very bizarre .
But you know what , pop music is bizarre .
To be honest I think they were going to award Ken Dodd as well but he was n't interested so they chose me .
Do you know who you 're up against ?
If you put U2 in a category for anything then you 're up against it are n't you ?
Christina Aguilera 's in there I think .
She 's a phenomenal singer .
I think someone 's having a wind - up , is the absolute truth of it .
Whatever -
It 's a bit of fun .
What do you think of your chances ?
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Not a lot .
I do n't think I 'll be buying a train ticket to Liverpool .
I think it 's a wind - up to be honest .
I never took it too seriously while I was doing it and it's a long time ago now so I do n't take this seriously either .
How do you rate the other acts ?
U2 - I really think they 're fantastic , I 've been to see them live a couple of times and they 're just pretty amazing .
In terms of an award like this - it needs to go to someone like that .
How the hell can you use the word ' ever ' and stick my name in that sentence ?
Have your say :
Who is your best act of all - time ?
If you 're invited , will you go ?
And if you win , will you go and collect the award ?
I do n't think I 'll go to be honest no - and I do n't think I 'll be winning anyway .
It 's not really for me .
I 'm really happy with the life I 've got and I 'll just leave it at that .
This came about because fans voted online and a lot of people are suggesting that 's because of Rickrolling - what is it ?
This is how Rick looked in his heyday back in the 80s I think it was my Mum - it took my Mum ages to put that many votes in .
I think that 's why I got up there .
It 's a bit of weird thing that happened a little while ago where you get sent a link for something and it turns out you get fooled and it's a link to my video instead .
I think it was a bit of a grin when it first happened but I think it got a bit boring for a lot of people soon after .
That whole thing 's been a bit bizarre to be honest .
What are you doing at the moment ?
I do bits and bobs .
I still do the occasional gig .
I actually enjoy doing that now because it was such a long time since I was doing it regularly .
I like getting up and singing my old songs occasionally and just having a nice life .
I 've been one of those really lucky people that 's managed to be a pop star for 15 minutes and then enjoy the benefits of it after .
What does your daughter think ?
Has she heard the news ?
I do n't think she would have heard this news no because I only heard that after I dropped her off this morning .
She just takes it all with a pinch of salt .
She 's aware of the fact that I had hits in the 80s .
She thinks that 's highly naff on the one hand like every 16 - year - old daughter should do of her Dad .
I think she 's also a bit proud as well , so that works out .

Google has released an " Ancient Rome 3D " layer for their popular Google Earth geographic browser .
The new layer shows many of the buildings , structures and topography that made up the city during the rule of Constantine the Great .
Some of the buildings even have interiors .
The Ancient Rome 3D feature was created in conjunction with the Rome Reborn Project 2.0 at University of Virginia 's Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities .
It is directed by Bernard Frischer , who started version 1.0 of Rome Reborn at UCLA in 1996 .
The purpose of the project is to depict a moment in time in Ancient Roman history , specifically June 21 , 320 A.D. , which was more or less the apex of the city 's development as the capital of the Roman Empire .
Google Earth 4.3 ( beta ) can be downloaded for the PC , Mac or Linux .
The Ancient Rome 3D layer can be found under Galleries in the Navigating Toolbar .

Staring In Slack - Jawed Horror At Michael Kinsley
I spent much of the last Democratic presidency staring in slack - jawed horror at Michael Kinsley .
I was afraid those days were gone forever !
So , I 'm pleased to have the chance to do so again at the dawn of the Obama administration .
What 's so shocking about Kinsley is that he 's not an inherently stupid man .
Yet he consistently writes things so bizarrely obtuse it 's like he'd just had an anvil dropped on his head .
It really goes to show the complete intellectual self - castration required to run in his levels of US society .
Here 's one of his greatest hits from the past , written in 1996 just after a Valujet flight had crashed in Florida :
[ T ] here is no reason every airline should meet the same level of safety .
In fact , it makes perfect sense for discount airlines to be less safe than traditional full - price carriers .
This is no excuse for negligence and rule - breaking .
But if the rules do n't recognize that some people , quite rationally , will wish to buy less safety for less money , they are doing the flying public a disservice .
Right .
And the 110 people who died on that flight got the information on which to " quite rationally " base their decision ... how , exactly ?
Via the popular Valujet slogan , " We cut back on inspections — and pass the savings along to you ! " ?
But that may have been surpassed by Kinsley 's column yesterday in defense of Larry Summers :
Opponents of Lawrence Summers for a second turn as Treasury secretary have , of course , brought up his 1991 memo as chief economist of the World Bank , in which he wrote that poor countries need more pollution , not less .
The memo was obviously meant to stimulate thinking and not to be implemented as policy .
But it also was undeniably correct .
Summers 's main point was that life and health are worth less in poor countries than in rich ones ...
Of course this should n't be true , but it undeniably is true , and rejecting the idea of poor countries earning a little cash by " buying " pollution from rich ones will do nothing to make it less true ...
Every economic transaction has two sides .
When you deny a rich country the opportunity to unload some toxic waste on a poor one , you are also denying that poor country the opportunity to get paid for taking the toxic waste .
And by forbidding this deal , you are putting off the day when the poor country will no longer need to make deals like this .
In his notorious memo , Summers was doing his job and doing it well : thinking outside the box about how to help the poor countries that are supposed to be the World Bank 's constituency .
Of course , anyone who has n't had an anvil dropped on his head understands the problem here : the benefits and costs in such situations DON'T ALL GO TO THE SAME PEOPLE .
Imagine the US exports its dangerous mercury industry to Zimbabwe , where life is cheap .
The profits from the mercury factory go to the factory owners , whereas all the mercury - poisoning deaths go to the factory 's workers and those who drink nearby water .
Moreover , the factory 's owners could well ALL LIVE OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY .
And in third world countries , governments rarely have the power to keep profits within their borders .
So Zimbabwe overall could easily end up with costs far greater than any benefits .
Kinsley certainly is willing to do a lot for his employers .
For his sake , and ours , I just hope they do n't require him to wet his pants on national TV .
ALSO : If Summers ' memo was " undeniably correct , " why should n't it be implemented as policy ?
AND : In 2001 I had an interview with Chris Rock to work on an HBO show that never happened .
At one point I described the Summers memo , and Rock 's face twisted into a memorable grimace of disgust .
It would be interesting to discuss with him now what he thinks about Summers being a prominent Obama adviser .

The next wave in the meltdown will be white - collar prosecutions , and there appears to be some promising material to work with at demolished AIG ( which , so far , has put the US taxpayer on the hook for $ 123 billion ) .
For example , here 's what Joseph Cassano , the head of AIG 's credit default swap insurance business in London , allegedly told an internal AIG auditor when explaining why the auditor was being excluded from valuation meetings :
" Because ... you would pollute the process . "
The auditor quit shortly thereafter and has since relayed his memory of the conversation to Congress .
Cassano , you 'll recall , is the AIG employee credited as being the most responsible for blowing the company to smithereens .
Like many such tidbits , this quote may be meaningless -- the flawed recollection of an angry ex-employee -- and derivative valuation is nothing if not subjective .
But it seems prosecutors have something to work with .
WSJ : At congressional hearings Tuesday , a former internal AIG auditor wrote that he had early on raised concerns about being excluded from conversations about the valuation of the derivatives .
The auditor , Joseph St. Denis , wrote in a letter to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that in early September 2007 , he learned that AIG 's financial - products unit had been asked for billions of dollars in collateral related to derivatives it had sold .
" I was gravely concerned about this , " Mr. St. Denis wrote .
The derivatives , known as credit - default swaps , protect buyers against the risk of default on other investments , and AIG believed the likelihood of making payouts was remote .
Mr. St. Denis wrote that the valuation model of one of AIG 's trading partners " apparently indicated " that , in fact , the unit " was in a potentially material liability position . "
Mr. St. Denis wrote he was n't personally involved in the valuation of the swaps at the unit .
In the last week of September 2007 , Mr. St. Denis wrote , the unit 's head , Joseph Cassano , said he had " deliberately excluded " Mr. St. Denis " because I was concerned that you would pollute the process . "
In the letter , Mr. St. Denis said he resigned on Oct. 1 , 2007 , and that later that month , AIG 's chief auditor , Michael Roemer , asked him why and said he would report those reasons to AIG 's audit committee .
Mr. St. Denis wrote that he told Mr. Roemer about Mr. Cassano's comment .
That would indicate that a key AIG executive last fall was aware of Mr. St. Denis 's concerns .

Recently I wrote an article titled Toxic Anger about the mortgage crisis and how it now seems that many hard - working Americans will be forced by the government to pay for people who live in foreclosed homes to keep their homes .
Well , the situation has not gotten any better .
More injustices abound .
It seems that we , the people who work hard , the responsible , are being forced by the government to support the following irresponsible , gambled and lost , groups :
We , the people , have already bailed out nine Wall Street banks who are thinking about using $ 108 billion dollars of the recent $ 125 billion taken from us by the government to give to employees as bonuses .
In fairness , many of these employees ' compensation packages are bonus driven and people are saying these folks should not work for free , but if your company went bankrupt and had to get stolen money to keep going , do you still deserve that money ?
After all , it is not coming from the company anymore .
We , the people , are supposed to bail out additional homeowners in expensive neighborhoods who can pay their mortgages just fine , but are learning the value in being a looter and are now ceasing to make their payments .
They have learned that is better to be a looter so they too can be in foreclosure and get a better mortgage on their home .
( Sorry I do n't have a link for this , but I heard it on 11/6/08 on CNBC . )
We , the people , are now supposed to bail out the auto industry and the United Auto Workers Union because although these companies are not profitable , we need them to stay in business and keep losing money .
President elect Obama has promised $ 50 billion of our dollars to keep them in business .
( Although how long they will stay is business is questionable since both GM and Ford posted losses of more than $ 27 billion in the first half of 2008 alone ) .
In addition , hedge funds , the insurance industry and others are all looking to get some of our money .
Daily , more people fall into the looting category and fewer feel the desire to remain producers .
Ayn Rand predicted this over fifty years ago in her brilliant book Atlas Shrugged .
A must read for all these days .
We are told we need to give these folks money because they are u201 Ctoo important to fail .
u201D
Here is a nice little article about past industries that did not get bailed out and as a result they brought the calamity of lost jobs .
These companies included the typewriter industry , hoop skirt manufactures , and the enormous horse and buggy carriage industry that took with it stagecoach drivers , wheelwrights , and blacksmiths , as well as those darned buggy whip manufacturers .
Okay , so by now you are angry : Really , really angry .
If you are like many Americans , this year you saw your home lose as much as 50 % and many portfolios are down 60 % .
Even if you live in a tiny apartment in New York City and do n't have a dime to your name , you have seen food and fuel prices go up like never before .
We are all paying for this in some form .
You now understand that all of these bailouts are coming from you and you do n't like it .
What can you do ?
What follows is advice I have heard from Ron Paul in various speeches , articles , and his recent book The Revolution : A Manifesto as well as other sources such as Lew Rockwell and the Mises Institute who teach Austrian Economics .
What can you do to fight this overreaching of government power ?
1. Educate , educate , educate .
First educate yourself .
Learn about the Austrian School of Economics and why printing trillions of dollars is hurting every single American , even those that do n't pay taxes .
It is called the Inflation tax and comes when the Federal Reserve prints more and more dollars and weakens the value of each .
This makes prices go up and we pay additional taxes in every penny we spend .
If printing money could solve all our problems , then why not just print up ten million dollars for every household in America ?
Would n't that jumpstart the economy ?
Actually , all that would do is cause the dollar to crash and send us into hyper-inflation .
If that is bad , then are n't these bailouts going to be bad one day too ?
We got into this mess by printing too much money .
How is more poison going to help the poisoned ?
2 . Hand out as many Red Pills as you can .
In other words , open people 's eyes about government theft .
For me , the u201 Cahau201D moment came when I learned ( and I admit I did not know ) that the government does not have any money .
It does not make anything .
It does not produce any money .
All the money it gets it takes from you and me .
Therefore , anytime they talk about how u201 Cweu201D need to give $ 700 billion dollars to anyone that is money that is taken from you and me in the form of higher direct taxes , higher taxes through inflation , or additional debt that must be paid back at some point by us .
3 . Use better language .
The government does not want you to put the focus on them and have taught us some bad habits .
Instead of saying u201 Cweu201D when talking about the actions taken by the U.S. Government , say , u201 Cthe U.S. Government .u201D
Such as : instead of u201 Cweu201D are fighting a war with u201CIraqu201D change it to the U.S. Government is fighting a war with the government of Iraq .
Only in America do we say u201 Cweu201D when speaking of the government .
4 . In the same vein , be clearer about current economics .
Instead of saying that Obama will save the big three automakers as if he is a generous leprechaun with an unlimited pot of gold , make it clear where the money is coming from and who is taking it .
Such as , I heard today that President elect Obama is considering stealing $ 50 billion dollars from the American public to give to certain auto companies .
( I say stealing , because no one asked me my opinion on the matter and if they had I would have said no .
If I do not have the right to say no , I call that stealing . )
Try this little test with this article here and see how it sounds when you replace all the language .
For example it talks about stimulus checks being given to Americans .
Well , these did not come out of this air .
Replace that phrase with u201 Cstimulus checks paid for with money stolen from the American people .
u201D
They do n't sound so stimulating any more .
5 . Stop watching mainstream news .
Most of it is propaganda or silly stories you can do without .
I tried this and two months later watched a national newscast .
I was shocked at all the direct lies and manipulations that were substituted as u201Cnews.u201D
For example , before the $ 700 billion dollar bailout we were told the sky would fall and credit would stop if we did not hand over our money to these banks .
Instead , they hoarded it , used it to purchase struggling banks in the biggest fire sale of the century and they barely increased the amount of credit extended to regular folk .
( Do n't get me wrong , I am not suggesting that they should have to give credit to the un-creditworthy — that landed us in this mess in the first place . )
But the world did not end .
Nothing much has changed except that these banks that were struggling a little are now doing quite well .
( Well , goodie for them .
I still can barely afford to buy groceries ) .
6 . To replace the loss of the mainstream news , get your information from sources such as Mises.org , LewRockwell.com , FFF.org , and FEE.org .
These are non-statist websites that are run by people who have already swallowed the Red Pill .
They know that the government is nothing but force , it is run by thugs and thieves , it is not our friend , and its sole purpose is to steal as much money from each of us as it can get away with .
These sites tell it like it is without a statist slant .
( A statist thinks the State — the government — is better at spending your money than you are and we can not be trusted to make our own decisions .
A non-statist thinks just the opposite : that we are adults , we know better than some bureaucrat how best to spend our limited resources and that our private lives are our business . )
7. Understand that the government is not trying to make sure everyone gets a home , but instead , they are doing their best to make sure everyone gets a thirty - year mortgage .
That sounds a lot less benevolent and a little more like crony capitalism does it not ?
The government is not the nanny state , it is the warden state .
It is not there to gently teach you and guide you ; it rules you with a heavy hand and stick .
Which reminds me — stop calling these politicians our u201 Cleaders .u201D
They are not leading us anywhere .
They are our rulers .
They tell us what to do and in most cases we have very little we can do about it .
Thoughts become much clearer when you use the proper language .
8 . Anytime you hear someone say that the free market caused this mess set them straight .
Do not let that lie spread any further .
The financial crisis was caused by government intervention in the markets .
Fannie and Freddie were both government - created programs designed to put a mortgage in every pot .
The Federal Reserve continually lowered interest rates ( as they are doing right now ) until money was so cheap it did n't make sense not to borrow more than you could afford .
In 1977 , the Community Reinvestment Act was designed to provide u201 Caffordableu201D mortgages to those with poor credit .
In 1995 , President Clinton made changes to the CRA that loosened credit standards even further and forced banks to make risky loans or face penalties .
These actions are as far from a free market as you can get .
This is corporatism and social engineering at its worst .
9 . Finally , do all you can to tell as many people what you have learned .
Tell everyone you know .
Understand that it is not the foreclosed homeowners who are stealing from you , it is the government .
( Although I have a thing or two to say to the people who stood outside the FDIC and protested about their mortgages being too high and demanded that the FDIC take money from you and me so they could have lower monthly payments .
Apparently , they now think the deal the originally signed could have been better .
AIG also thinks its bailout deal could have been better and now the old president of the company is asking for better terms .
Gee , could it be because he is a major shareholder ? )
These folks could not get a dime from us legally if the government was n't involved .
The automakers do not have a right to one penny from you unless the government decides to steal it from you .
Wall Street banks would fail or not based on their own business decisions without the government stealing from us to prop them up .
No matter how much these looters beg , it is government action that actually takes money from you .
So , keep it simple .
Keep it clear .
The problem is government power and the need to get rid of it .
It will not matter who is in charge if the government does n't have much power .
Moreover , we have a lack of understanding by most Americans that the government has no pot of gold to hand out .
Teach that all wealth transfer is theft .
Not too many people are comfortable being thieves .
If you teach them that each government program they are seeking is grand theft , they may think differently .
Explain that people have a right to their labor and they should not be made slaves to support leviathan .
Tell them that if we eliminated all the government programs we could get rid of the Income Tax and spend our money the way we want to .
Learn about how liberal programs such as minimum wage laws and the Americans with Disabilities
Act have actually hurt the people they are designed to help .
Learn how u201C freeu201D government education is not free at all ( many homeowners pay for it through property taxes ) and they are teaching our children how to be good little citizens that do not question government action .
Not much could be more dangerous to liberty .
Send articles to your friends .
But most important of all , keep learning .
It is easier to get clear information these days , but you have to look for it .
Remember though , only the educated can teach and this country needs to learn a whole lot of lessons .
Perhaps you might want to consider picking up copies of Murray Rothbard 's What has Government Done to Our Money and Ron Paul 's The Revolution : A Manifesto .
My husband and I are giving a copy of each to everyone on our Christmas list .
( Both of these can be found from the links on the front page of LewRockwell.com . )
Finally , for a brilliant inspiring speech by Ron Paul about what each of us can do to turn this country around , listen to this .
Peace .

The Ariel Atom is an amazing car and a sure - fire way to lose your license in a hurry , but with a price tag north of 50 grand , it can be tough putting one in your driveway .
Unless you build it yourself .
That 's just what one enterprising but so far anonymous gearhead in Utah did , cobbling together an impressive copy of the Atom from junk he had lying around .
The body was fashioned from an old kayak and a doghouse .
The stainless bits were recycled from old appliances , and the throttle assembly was pulled from a Dumpster .
It 's all attached to a frame that 's fashioned from what looks to us like old steel pipe , and the engine was pulled from a junked Acura RSX .
The builder , a college student known by his Flickr moniker Proximacentauri , spent 800 hours over the course of 15 months building the car , which offers impressive performance .
Proximacentauri says his Ariel Atom clone , which he calls Z59 , cranks out about 160 horsepower and does 0 to 60 in 4.5 seconds - just under a second behind the real Atom .
The car 's street - legal and registered , and Proxicentauri claims it gets 35 mpg .
You can follow the full build - up on his Flickr page , which is where we got the photos after first reading about the Z59 over at MAKE .

Some women , who live in countries where laws heavily restrict abortions , apply to the Internet in order to purchase medications that allow aborting pregnancy at home .
Women from more than 70 countries that restrict abortions , including Northern Ireland , used a website called Women on Web , as the main source to obtain the necessary medications .
The British Journal of Obstetrics and Gyneacology performed a review of 400 customers who used the medication .
The review found that about 11 percent required surgical procedure after taking the medicine that allows performing abortion in home conditions .
The website Women on Web says that it may help in reducing the issues related to unsafe abortions .
People who act against abortion called the development of the websites such as Women of Web " very worrying indeed " .
According to the research , about 8 percent of women who used the website did not use the medication they purchased .
About 11 percent required surgical procedure due to two main reasons : the drugs did not complete the abortion or because of too much bleeding .
Two hundred women responded to the questions regarding their experiences : 58 percent mentioned that they highly welcomed the possibility to have an abortion at home and 31 percent said that they had felt stressed but nevertheless found such experience quite satisfactory .
The website Women on Web says that it offers the drugs only to women that are less than 9 weeks pregnant and that are living in countries where abortion is highly restricted .
While being in Thailand , a woman from the United States , who has a rare medical complication when pregnancy may threaten her life , spoke about her experience after using Women on Web .
" Women on Web kept in contact with me via e-mail .
The medication arrived through Customs , properly blister - packed , with complete paperwork and a doctor 's signature .
Medication from other websites came in unmarked bottles with no instructions or paperwork - it was quite frightening .
I was not very far along - only three or four weeks .
It went smoothly for me .
I think it 's very important women have this resource to turn to in that situation - and they can need it for a number of reasons . "
The Family Planning Association , an organization based in Northern Ireland , has received a number of calls from women , who decided to buy abortion pills online .
The FPA 's representatives said that on two occasions women acquired drugs without any medical information , which led to complications and a need of aftercare .
" The Women On Web site is very helpful and reputable .
But for Northern Ireland women , it is encouraging them to break the law - and as an organization , we have to work within the law .
We 're really concerned about women accessing the rogue sites - we 're hearing about it and we know it 's happening .
There are potentially serious medical complications for women from sites which are n't well managed and this could be the new era of backstreet abortions , " said Audrey Simpson , the director of Northern Ireland FPA .
The anti-abortion campaigners stated that they were shocked by the existence of such websites .
" This is very worrying indeed .
It represents further trivialization of the value of the unborn child .
It 's like taking abortion into the shadows .
These drugs have side - effects and tragedies will increase , " said Josephine Quintavalle , a member of the group Comment on Reproductive Ethics .

Video : Watch
Alex show off his amazing intelligence
MY FIRST confession : I ’m a charter member of the Smart Bird Fan Club .
I love reading about crafty cowbirds and remarkable ravens ; I ’d rather watch a crow than a cardinal .
Yes , I ’m that neighbourhood nut who praises crows to the point of exasperation , “ But look at how cleverly they vandalised your garbage can ! ”
So I expected to adore Irene Pepperberg ’s book , Alex & Me , from word one .
After all , the Alex in question was a wonderfully talkative and gifted African grey parrot who could mentally organise objects by shape , colour and quantity …
As I write this , we are 24 hours away from the end of this seemingly endless presidential campaign , and all the signs point to a victory  some would say an overwhelming victory  by Barack Obama .
I wo n’t make any predictions here , what with the Bradley Effect and other unknowns  including the possibility of a " hanging chad " - like situation  but , given the polls , it ’s incumbent on me to give my readers an indication of what to expect from an Obama administration in the foreign policy department , and this is undoubtedly reflected in the personnel he ’ll assemble on his foreign policy team .
So who ’s up for major appointments ?
A number of names have been floated , some of them Republicans , for key positions like secretary of defense and secretary of state , notably the idea of keeping Robert Gates , the current defense chief , and bringing in Richard Lugar for secretary of state .
Both possibilities underscore the essential continuity of our misguided and increasingly dangerous foreign policy of global intervention .
Bill Richardson is also being mentioned for state , along with John " I Was For It Before I Was Against It " Kerry .
This particular appointment , however , does n’t tell us much about the foreign policy favored by Obama .
Recent secretaries of state have had minimal influence on actual policymaking and have often been at odds with the White House ; look at Colin Powell .
This is due to the ever - increasing power of the president over the conduct of U.S. foreign policy , a realm surrendered to the executive by Congress , in principle , long ago .
Under President Bush , the process accelerated and the foreign policymaking bureaucracy took on a distinctly monarchical flavor .
The president ’s national security adviser , the one with direct access to the king , became the key player .
Condi Rice , with her personal friendship with Bush II , was perfect for this role , and the next national security adviser is liable to play a similarly important part in shaping Obama ’s decisions .
The most troubling possibility here is Dennis Ross , a career foreign policy bureaucrat who was instrumental in shaping America ’s Israel - centric policy in the Middle East under George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton .
He is a longtime associate of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy ( WINEP ) , the scholarly adjunct of AIPAC , Israel ’s powerful lobbying organization in the U.S. , which he co-founded .
The beginning of Ross ’ career as a civil servant is a good indicator of what we might expect from him , and from the Obama administration when it comes to setting Middle Eastern policy .
When Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980 , he brought in Paul Wolfowitz to run the policy planning at the State Department , and Wolfie brought in his neocon buddies : I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Francis Fukuyama , Zalmay Khalilzad , James Roche , Stephen Sestanovich , Alan Keyes ( yes , that Alan Keyes ! ) , and Ross .
In short , Ross has always been a reliable member in good standing of the neocon foreign policy cabal , the very same group that lied us into war with Iraq  and is now intent on doing the same with Iran .
Although the neocons who came to Washington were mostly ex-Democrats , Ross stayed with his old party , although partisan allegiances seem not to mean much to him .
He has served under three secretaries of state : James Baker , Warren Christopher , and Madeleine Albright .
As special Middle East coordinator under President Bill Clinton , Ross was responsible for managing the Israeli - Palestinian negotiations , a process described by former negotiating team member Aaron David Miller as follows :
" With the best of motives and intentions , we listened to and followed Israel ’s lead without critically examining what that would mean for our own interests , for those on the Arab side and for the overall success of the negotiations .
The ‘ no surprises ’ policy , under which we had to run everything by Israel first , stripped our policy of the independence and flexibility required for serious peacemaking .
If we could n’t put proposals on the table without checking with the Israelis first , and refused to push back when they said no , how effective could our mediation be ?
Far too often , particularly when it came to Israeli - Palestinian diplomacy , our departure point was not what was needed to reach an agreement acceptable to both sides but what would pass with only one  Israel . "
" Without critically examining what that would mean for our own interests "  that ’s the key phrase here , one that fully describes the effect ( and also , perhaps , the intention ) of our Middle Eastern policy , one that puts Israel , not America , first .
Ross recently signed on to a plan , being pushed by something called the Bipartisan Policy Center , that is nothing but a roadmap to war with Tehran .
The report , written in the form of recommendations to an incoming president , says he must begin a military buildup directed at Iran from " the first day [ he ] enters office . "
The plan is to begin " pre-positioning additional U.S. and allied forces , deploying additional aircraft carrier battle groups and minesweepers , placing other war material in the region , including additional missile defense batteries , upgrading both regional facilities and allied militaries , and expanding strategic partnerships with countries such as Azerbaijan and Georgia in order to maintain operational pressure from all directions . "
Yes , Georgia , America ’s Israel of the Caucasus , is to be used as a forward base of operations against Iran .
Then there ’s the oil - rich tyranny of Azerbaijan , which is locked in a vicious ethnic war of attrition with Armenia ( and its own Armenian population ) .
The U.S. footprint , instead of shrinking under Obama , promises to grow even larger .
So you wondered why , during the debates , Obama was so belligerent on the Georgian question .
Obama and McCain both hew to the War Party ’s Orwellian view , which grotesquely inverts the truth , decrying " Russian aggression " when it was the Georgians who started that war .
One would normally expect this of McCain , whose chief foreign policy adviser was , until very recently , a paid lobbyist for the Georgians , but Obama , too , refuses to acknowledge Tbilisi ’s aggression against a " breakaway province . "
Ossetia has been de facto independent for more than a decade , and the supposedly smart Obama is no doubt aware of this  never mind the hundreds killed in the siege of Tskhinvali , the Ossetian capital city mercilessly assaulted by Georgian troops .
It gets worse , however .
Underscoring the point we have long made at Antiwar.com  that it is impossible to separate these various " theaters " of U.S. aggression , and that the Iraq and Afghan wars are bound to spread  the report goes on to note :
" The presence of U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan offers distinct advantages in any possible confrontation with Iran .
The United States can bring in troops and material to the region under the cover of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts , thus maintaining a degree of strategic and tactical surprise . "
[ Emphasis added . ]
Obama has long stressed he would immediately begin escalating the Afghan campaign , and perhaps open up a new front in Pakistan .
Certainly the Bush administration has laid the groundwork for this eastward shift of U.S. military resources  and so the stage is set .
When Rachel Maddow asked Obama the other day why our intervention in Afghanistan would n’t end up like the Iraq war , or more so , he emphatically rejected the comparison , yet he never addressed her underlying concern .
She just smiled , rather wanly , and went on to the next question .
I have another question , however , and it is this : what if the Afghan " surge " is a feint , directed not at some vague Taliban - affiliated tribes in the godforsaken wilds of Waziristan , but at the mullahs of Tehran ?
Under the pretext of going after Osama bin Laden , they can sneak enough troops into the region through the back door , then easily launch an attack from the east , and also from the north , where the Azeris and the Georgians are talking about entering NATO .
( Obama , by the way , fully endorses Georgia ’s NATO membership application , although he has n’t said anything , as far as I know , about the Azeris ’ ambition to join the club . )
Whether or not Ross gets the national security post , the fact remains that the War Party , far from being banished from Washington , will have an inside track in the new administration .
What ’s different about Obama , however , is that the other side also has a seat at the table  or , at the very least , is n’t completely locked out of the deliberations .
I was astonished to learn that none other than Gen. Anthony Zinni , retired Marine commander and trenchant critic of the neocon influence on the making of American foreign policy , is up for the job .
A 2003 Washington Post profile of Zinni reports :
" The more he listened to [ Deputy Defense Secretary Paul ]
Wolfowitz and other administration officials talk about Iraq , the more Zinni became convinced that interventionist ‘ neoconservative ’ ideologues were plunging the nation into a war in a part of the world they did n’t understand .
‘ The more I saw , the more I thought that this was the product of the neocons who did n’t understand the region and were going to create havoc there .
These were dilettantes from Washington think tanks who never had an idea that worked on the ground . ’
“ The goal of transforming the Middle East by imposing democracy by force reminds him of the ‘ domino theory ’ in the 1960s that the United States had to win in Vietnam to prevent the rest of Southeast Asia from falling into communist hands .
And that brings him back to Wolfowitz and his neoconservative allies as the root of the problem .
‘ I do n’t know where the neocons came from  that was n’t the platform they ran on , ’ he says .
‘ Somehow , the neocons captured the president .
They captured the vice president . ' ”
I would n’t bet the farm on Zinni getting it , but the fact that he ’s in the running at all is astonishing .
If that ’s the amount of change you want in American foreign policy , then you ’ll be happy with the Obama administration  even as they escalate the conflict in Afghanistan , spread it to Pakistan , and prepare for war with Iran .
How to Improve Your Relationships : 7 Awesome Tips from the Last 1900 Years
Image by fabbio ( license ) .
â€ œThe quality of your life is the quality of your relationships.â€ 
Anthony Robbins
â€ œFriendship is born at that moment when one person says to another , ‘ What !
You too ?
I thought I was the only oneâ€ 
C.S Lewis
I think the Tony Robbins quote above is pretty accurate .
The quality of your relationships – no matter in what form they may exist – obviously has a huge impact on your life .
But what can we do to create new relationships and improve our existing ones ?
Well , here are 7 timeless tips that people have used throughout the ages .
Hopefully youâ€™ll find something useful .
1 . Be open to new people .
â€ œEach friend represents a world in us , a world possibly not born until they arrive , and it is only by this meeting that a new world is born.â€ 
Anais Nin
Itâ€™s easy to get comfortable with what you have and what you know .
It feels familiar and safe .
But being open to new meetings and being open in those meetings can also be a great thing .
One of the best and quickest ways to grow and experience new things is simply to meet new people with an open mind .
You may feel some inner resistance before the meeting , but just like when you donâ€™t feel like going to the gym itâ€™s a good thing to not take that feeling too seriously .
Itâ€™s there because it makes it easier for you in the short run and because it keeps things as they are .
But just ignoring it and going ahead anyways is oftentimes much more rewarding .
2 . Be wary of building walls .
â€ œPeople are lonely because they build walls instead of bridges.â€ 
Joseph F. Newton Men
The ego wants to divide your world .
It wants to create barriers , separation and loves to play the comparison game .
The game where people are different compared to you , the game where you are better than someone and worse than someone else .
All of that creates fear .
And so we build walls .
But putting up walls tends to in the end hurt you more than protect you .
So how can you start building bridges instead ?
One way is to choose to be curious about people .
Curiosity is filled with anticipation and enthusiasm .
It opens you up .
And when you are open and enthusiastic then you have more fun things to think about than focusing on your fear .
Another is to start to see yourself in other people .
To get that there is no real separation between you and other people .
That may sound vague .
So one practical suggestion and thought you may want to try for a day is that everyone you meet is your friend .
Another one is to see what parts of yourself you can see in someone you meet .
3. Learn to like yourself .
â€ It is of practical value to learn to like yourself .
Since you must spend so much time with yourself you might as well get some satisfaction out of the relationship.â€ 
Norman Vincent Peale
As Peale says , you will have to spend a lot of time with yourself so you might as well make it pleasant .
This is also important because how you feel about yourself is often how people will tend to treat you .
If you like yourself then that comes through via your body language , voice tonality and words .
You will , for example , send out positive and confident signals .
Two things that people generally like and appreciate in other people .
How do you learn to like yourself ?
Well , that seems to be a challenge with many answers .
But one of the most important things is to do what you feel is the right thing to do consistently .
When you think and act as you would like and at least go for what you want â€ “ even though you may fail from time to time â€ “ you tend to feel good about yourself .
You live in alignment with what you think is right .
You are being â€ œthe best youâ€ .
Another thing is to some way down the road realize that adding more to yourself will never be enough .
Itâ€™s just the voice of the ego wanting more , more , more !
Itâ€™s like trying to fill up a bucket with hole in it .
A far better mindset is that you are already complete .
This makes you feel good about yourself and gives you more emotional stability .
What you add to your life â€ “ people , gadgets , food â€ “ can bring great experiences but you are already complete .
This mindset allows you to stop chasing â€ œthe next thingâ€ for the rest of your life .
However , to be able to take such a mindset seriously you may have to chase things and people for a while longer .
When the suffering has become enough , when youâ€™ve tried over and over again without finding what you look for then that is often the right time .
The time when you open up to trying a new perspective .
When you have suffered enough you will often take the leap and change .
You can read more about this in books by Eckhart Tolle like A New Earth and Stillness Speaks .
4 . Your relationships are in your mind .
â€ œAs you think so shall you be !
Since you cannot physically experience another person , you can only experience them in your mind .
Conclusion :
All of the other people in your life are simply thoughts in your mind .
Not physical beings to you , but thoughts .
Your relationships are all in how you think about the other people of your life .
Your experience of all those people is only in your mind .
Your feelings about your lovers come from your thoughts .
For example , they may in fact behave in ways that you find offensive .
However , your relationship to them when they behave offensively is not determined by their behavior , it is determined only by how you choose to relate to that behavior .
Their actions are theirs , you cannot own them , you cannot be them , you can only process them in your mind.â€ 
Wayne Dyer
â€ œIt is not he who reviles or strikes you who insults you , but your opinion that these things are insulting .â€ 
Epictetus
How you choose to interpret people and your relationships makes a huge difference .
So much of our relationships may be perceived to happen out there somewhere .
But as mentioned in tip # 2 in this article , your underlying frame of mind â€ “ do you build bridges or walls ?
â€ “ will determine much about your interactions both new people and people you know .
So you really have to go inside .
You have to realize that your interpretations from the past are interpretations .
Not reality .
You have to take a look at your assumptions and expectations and thought habits .
Find patterns that may be hurting you ( and others ) .
This isnâ€™t easy .
Or always pleasant .
You may discover that you have had some negative underlying habits of thought for many years .
But to change you have to do it .
Instead of just keep looking at yourself as some sort of unmoving and objective observer of the world and reality .
A change in you could â€ “ over time â€ “ change your whole world .
5 . Give value instead of the other way around .
â€ œSome of the biggest challenges in relationships come from the fact that most people enter a relationship in order to get something : theyâ€™re trying to find someone whoâ€™s going to make them feel good .
In reality , the only way a relationship will last is if you see your relationship as a place that you go to give , and not a place that you go to take .â€ 
Anthony Robbins
As mentioned above , itâ€™s useful to like yourself and see yourself as already complete .
Otherwise you may go chasing new relationships to get that kick of feeling good over and over again .
When you on the other hand like yourself , you spend less of your focus on what you can take and more on what you can give .
The desperate craving to get more , more , more and fill yourself up isnâ€™t there anymore .
Creating a habit of giving value in your everyday life and in your relationships is pretty awesome .
And itâ€™s something anyone can start to develop today .
Some of the things you can do to give value are :
Bringing a positive attitude and vibe into interactions .
Offering useful advice or knowledge to someone .
Giving a genuine compliment .
Just offering a listening ear to someone who needs it .
Cheering someone up .
Hugs .
Helping someone out with moving , cooking , cleaning up etc .
Taking the lead and creating a fun situation for your friends such as a picnic or a night out on the town .
Being totally present in conversation and focused on the other person .
Itâ€™s important to do this without hidden agendas .
If you do something just to get something back that often shines through .
A genuine compliment is powerful because you really and honestly mean it .
It backfires when you are just out to get something from the other person .
But of course , people who give a lot of value tend to get a lot of value back .
In the long run things tend to even out and you get what you give .
6 . Share with someone .
â€ œShared joy is a double joy ; shared sorrow is half a sorrow.â€ 
Swedish Proverb
Simple but easy to forget sometimes .
Sharing makes life and relationships a lot more fun .
And your hard times at least a bit easier .
7. Genuineness is the key .
â€ œNever idealize others .
They will never live up to your expectations .
Donâ€™t over - analyse your relationships .
Stop playing games .
A growing relationship can only be nurtured by genuineness.â€ 
Leo F. Buscaglia
I think that one of the most important things in a relationship of any kind is to be genuine .
Few things are as powerful as genuine communication and letting the genuine you shine through .
Without incongruency , mixed messages or perhaps a sort of phoniness .
Itâ€™s you to 100 % .
Itâ€™s you with not only your words but you with your voice tonality and body language â€ “ which some say is over 90 % of communication â€ “ on the same wavelength as your words .
Itâ€™s you coming through on all channels of communication .

SAO PAULO , Oct 27 ( Reuters ) - Brazil ’s central bank sold a total of $ 2.07 billion in dollar repurchase agreements and foreign currency swaps on Monday , helping the national currency strengthen more than 3 percent .
The bank also further eased reserve requirements on demand deposits , adding as much as 6 billion reais ( $ 2.67 billion ) to the country ’s financial system in a bid to stoke domestic lending .
Following is a chronology of the actions the government and central bank have taken to confront the recent market turmoil :
Sept. 19 : The central bank sells $ 500 million in dollar repurchase agreements in two separate auctions , the first sale of dollar repos since February 2003 .
Sept. 24 : The central bank raises the amount that banks can deduct from additional reserve requirements to 300 million reais from 100 million reais and postpones a planned increase of reserve requirements on leasing firms .
The measures free up 13.2 billion reais for lending .
Sept. 29 : The bank sells $ 527 million in reverse currency swaps , rolling over a small portion of similar paper coming due on Oct.
1 .
Oct. 2 : The central bank allows banks to deduct from reserve requirements the amount used to buy credit portfolios from small or mid-sized banks in distress .
The move potentially frees up an additional 23.5 billion reais for lending .
Oct. 6 : The bank offers dollar swap contracts for the first time in more than two years , selling $ 1.47 billion worth .
Oct. 6 : The government gives the central bank the authority to acquire loan portfolios of small and mid-sized banks in distress .
It also allows the central bank to extend loans in foreign currencies to local financial institutions .
Oct. 6 : The central bank says it will buy an unspecified amount of dollar - denominated bonds from Brazilian banks to increase credit lines in dollars for exporters .
Oct. 8 : The bank dips into its international reserves and sells dollars on the spot foreign exchange market for the first time in more than five years .
It sells an unspecified amount of dollars in three auctions .
Oct. 8 : The central bank increases the amount that banks can deduct from additional reserve requirements to 700 million reais from 300 million reais and cuts the percentage of additional reserve requirements that banks must deposit to 5 percent from 8 percent .
The measures free up an additional 23.2 billion reais for lending .
Oct. 13 : The central bank temporarily scraps reserve requirements on term and interbank deposits as well as additional reserve requirements on demand and term deposits .
It also eases reserve requirements for leasing firms that buy dollar repos and raises the amount banks can deduct from additional reserve requirements to 1 billion reais from 700 million reais .
The measures free up an additional 100 billion reais for lending .
Oct. 14 : The central bank reduces reserve requirements on demand deposits to 42 percent from 45 percent , freeing up an additional 3.6 billion reais for lending .
Oct. 14 : The National Monetary Council temporarily increases the percentage of demand deposits that banks must lend to the agricultural sector to 30 percent from 25 percent , freeing up an additional 4.5 billion reais for loans .
Oct. 16 : The central bank expands the list of securities banks can buy from competitors to free up reserve requirements on term deposits to include fixed - income securities and interbank deposit certificates , among others .
Oct. 16 : The National Monetary Council mandates that banks drawing on foreign currency credit lines from the central bank lend some or all of the funds to exporters .
Oct. 17 : The bank says it will start holding auctions of foreign currency loans to provide credit for exporters , accepting sovereign bonds and export receivables as collateral .
Oct. 20 : Bank sells $ 1.62 billion in foreign currency loans .
Oct. 22 : The government allows the central bank to carry out swap operations with foreign central banks .
Oct. 22 : Government says it will allow two state - controlled banks , Banco do Brasil and Caixa Economica Federal , to buy stakes in other financial institutions .
Oct. 23 : The Finance Ministry scraps a tax known as the IOF , which was 1.5 percent on currency exchange for inflows of foreign capital and 0.38 percent on foreign currency loans .
It says the main aim is to encourage short - term capital inflows .
Oct. 23 : The central bank says it stands ready to sell up to $ 50 billion in dollar swap contracts .
Oct. 24 : The central bank pumps nearly $ 2.5 billion into the foreign exchange market with the sale of currency swaps .
It also sells dollars in the spot currency market .
Oct. 24 : The national development bank offers to help exporters with losses from foreign exchange derivatives .
Oct. 27 : The central bank sells $ 1.25 billion in dollar repurchase agreements at a rate of 2.312 per dollar .
It also sells $ 815 million in foreign currency swaps in a bid to meet a surge in demand for the U.S. currency .
Oct. 27 : Banks will be allowed to deduct from reserve requirements on demand deposits a portion of advance payments to the national loan guarantee fund .
The measure may free up as much as 6 billion reais to the banking system .

Movie posters are art and , unfortunately , the forgotten one .
In the early years of cinema history , they were used just like advertising material .
Displayed in theatres only , movie posters had the same function as a menu in a restaurant : what feast can I enjoy this evening ?
Nowadays , movie posters play a big role in cinema memorabilia collection .
They have lost the “ informative ” tone to wear a more artistic and decorative dress .

Nowadays , movie posters play a big role in cinema memorabilia collection .
They have lost the “ informative ” tone to wear a more artistic and decorative dress .
We want to change it with this post .
Made in many different sizes and versions , and released in different moments all along a movie ’s life , posters immortalize in one static image the feeling and the atmosphere of a motion picture .
Some posters can be dark or try to frighten the audience , others bedazzling with bright colors ; some can be someway informative , while others can be fully teasing and may provide you only the date when movie will be released , even if you may not know what the movie is about .
In this post we present you a showcase of 50 beautiful movie posters .
We went through different decades of movie history and different genre , different graphical approach , colors and style .
Movies the posters are about may be famous or not , this is not the point .
Movie posters put together the love for for two different visual arts : cinema and graphics .
Enjoy !

Linux will be a passenger in every seat on Qantas ' Airbus A380s airplanes .
All of the airline 's superjumbos -- the first of which will commence flying next week -- will have their in flight entertainment systems powered by the operating system .
The A380 is the first Qantas aircraft to utilize the Panasonic eX2 Inflight Entertainment System ( IFE ) .
All of Panasonic 's X Series of IFE systems run on Linux .
And Qantas is not limiting it to the A380s .
The systems will feature in Qantas ' next batch of B737 - 800 aircraft ( which will use the Panasonic eFX system ) for both its Business and Economy customers , due in March 2009 ; its B787 or ' Dreamliner ' aircraft also due next year ; and on some of its older but soon - to - be revamped B767 - 300 fleet .
The eX2 powers many of the world 's leading airlines ' IFE .
For example , Singapore Airlines already operates the eX2 on its A380s , B747 and B777 aircraft while Emirates will carry the same system on its batch of almost 60 A380 aircraft .
It is believed two - thirds of the carriers who have placed orders for A380 aircraft will operate the eX2 IFE .
Qantas has said the IFE in the A380 aircraft will feature 17in touch screens that come equipped with noise cancelling headsets and video on demand options .
" Our system is state of the art and offers over 1000 entertainment options including everything from the latest release movies to our Lonely Planet destinational information as well as our tail mounted panoramic camera , " said John Borghetti , executive general manager at Qantas in a recent Web forum .
According to an article in Avionics Today , the A380 is the industry 's first one - gigabit backbone system , and will deliver something in the order of 5 M bps of data to the seat .
" That amount of bandwidth will provide not only high - quality video but concurrent capabilities like picture - in - picture , live text news and text messaging , " said Neil James , director of corporate sales and marketing for Panasonic Avionics .
Qantas Flight QF 93 which departs Melbourne for Los Angeles on October 20 will be the airline 's first commercial flight with the new airplane .
This story , " Linux Takes to the Air on Qantas " was originally published by Computerworld Australia .

Obama for president , Biden for vice president
The presidential ticket
The Chronicle endorses Barack Obama for president and Joe Biden for vice president of the United States

Rarely in our country 's history has the electorate gone to the polls to choose a new president in such challenging times with more at stake for the nation .
The economy is tottering under the strains of a global financial crisis unleashed by the unregulated excesses of U.S. lending institutions .
American soldiers continue to fight and die in two separate conflicts that remain open - ended .
At home affordable health care is unavailable to millions of citizens while measures to achieve energy independence and combat global warming sit on the legislative back burner .
Fear pervades so many households under the threat of unemployment and mortgage foreclosures .
One must go back to the Great Depression , and the reshaping of American domestic policy to vanquish it , to find a comparable era when the demands for change were so urgent .
The incoming administration must immediately focus and engage on so many fronts .
The tasks at hand will require stamina , creativity and leadership abilities to replace partisan gridlock with a national consensus on what is best for the American people .
The new leadership team must have the intellect and temperament to tackle complex issues with equally sophisticated solutions .
The current go - it - alone mentality in the White House on foreign policy must give way to an effort to work in concert with our allies while engaging our enemies at the negotiating table as well as on the battlefield .
After carefully observing the Democratic and Republican nominees in drawn - out primary struggles as well as in the general campaign , including three debates , the Chronicle strongly believes that the ticket of Sens.
Barack Obama and Joe Biden offers the best choice to lead the United States on a new course into the second decade of the 21st century .
Obama appears to possess the tools to confront our myriad and daunting problems .
He 's thoughtful and analytical .
He has met his opponents ' attacks with calm and reasoned responses .
Viewers of the debates saw a poised , well - prepared plausible president with well - articulated positions on the bread - and - butter issues that poll after poll indicate are the true concerns of voters .
While Arizona Sen. John McCain and his running mate Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin have struck an increasingly personal and negative tone in their speeches , Obama has continued to talk about issues of substance .
It is true that Obama has served less than a term in the U.S. Senate and that his previous elective experience is confined to the Illinois Legislature .
However , during that public service and his previous role as a community organizer on the streets of Chicago , he has developed an appreciation and understanding of the real - life concerns of middle - and low - income Americans .
On the Iraq war , Obama was an early voice of opposition to the initial invasion and his plan for a phased withdrawal of combat forces has been embraced by American and Iraqi policymakers .
His partner on the ticket , Biden , is one of the leading foreign policy experts in Congress .
They pledge to rebuild America 's diminished standing in the world and restore our reputation as the leading defender of democracy and human rights .
Obama 's health care plan mandates health insurance for all American children , an issue of vital importance to Harris County and Houston , which has the highest rate of uninsured youngsters in the nation .
By contrast , the proposal by McCain to offer a tax credit to Americans to purchase insurance while taxing health benefits for the first time will further discourage small business owners from providing employee health insurance .
One weakness Obama has shown is a tendency to demonize the energy industry , which will be an indispensable ally in developing alternative fuel sources in the future .
He would do well to rethink some of his positions and apply his consensus - building skills to an essential bulwark of the Texas economy .
On another issue of vital importance to the Houston area , Obama supports the U.S. space program and has wisely backed off an earlier proposal to delay NASA 's moon and Mars missions to save money .
McCain has an illustrious record of service to America , first as a pilot taken prisoner by the North Vietnamese , and then with a distinguished Senate career .
To his credit , he has broken with his own party in the past to fight for campaign reform , oppose the sanctioning of torture and acknowledge the threat of human - induced global warming .
However , in his bid for the presidency , he has aligned himself with a more conservative political base and disappointed moderates .
Perhaps the worst mistake McCain made in his campaign for the White House was the choice of the inexperienced and inflammatory Palin as his vice - presidential running mate .
Had he selected a moderate , experienced Republican lawmaker such as Texas Sen .
Kay Bailey Hutchison with a strong appeal to independents , the Chronicle 's choice for an endorsement would have been far more difficult .
In comments to the Chronicle editorial board during his Texas primary fight against Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , Obama explained why he believed he would be the best choice for president .
" More than any other candidate , I could bridge some of the partisan , racial and religious divides in this country that prevent us from getting things done , " said Obama .
" I believe that I could attract independents and some disillusioned Republicans into a working majority to bring about change on critical issues . "
Back in the spring , Obama 's sentiments seemed more a hope than reality .
Since then , we have watched him grow in the roles of candidate and leader , maintaining grace under fire without resorting to political expediency .
He is by far the best choice to deliver the changes that Americans demand .
Following up on a long running discussion between the likes of Hugh Macleod , Tim O’Reilly , and Nick Carr , Tim Bray today penned a piece entitled “ The Shape of the Cloud . ”
In it , he argues that Amazon ’s Web Services platform appears to him as not dissimilar from Altavista circa 1996 .
I do n’t personally subscribe to this belief , but I could probably build a case to defend it .
What I can’t defend , however , is his explanation for this assertion .
In spite of my respect for Tim , I fundamentally disagree on several levels .
To look at why , permit me to indulge in a ( significantly less snarky and massively less amusing ) Fire Joe Morgan - style treatment of his piece .
With all due apologies to those worthy masters , of course .
For those of you unfamiliar with Fire Joe Morgan , Tim ’s words are in bold , mine are not .
The Shape of the Cloud
There ’s an interesting argument going on about the business - structure futures of the Big Cloud that everyone assumes is in our future .
Some links in the chain : Hugh Macleod , Tim O’Reilly , Nick Carr , and Tim again .
A few points about this seem obvious ; among other things , Amazon Web Services is reminding me powerfully of Altavista .
Here are a few things that I think are true ; the last section gets back to AWS and Altavista .
Monopolies Don’t Require Lock-in
Google has ( effectively ) a monopoly on consumer search .
They have no lock - in ; anyone who wants to can switch their default search provider in a few seconds .
One could write a book , and several people have , about how they maintain their grip on the market , but let ’s skip that and just see this as an existence proof .
With you so far .
I accept both that Google has , effectively , a monopoly on search , and further that said monopoly does not depend on traditional IT lockin .
Which makes it , in my opinion , an exceedingly unique market .
I ca n’t think of another like it , and if pressed , for those somewhat similar , I do n’t think cloud would be in my Top 5 .
Which is to say , history tells us that Hugh Macleod ’s vision of a single insanely - huge cloud provider is perfectly believable .
Whoa .
There are a couple of assertions in there ; let ’s tease them apart .
First , that search and cloud are conflated ( without much discussion ) such that the history of the search market is directly applicable to the cloud market .
Sufficiently so that it ’s possible to predict one based on the history of the other .
Second , that Hugh Macleod ’s argument that the cloud could produce “ the largest company to have ever existed . ”
Personally , I cannot agree with either argument .
Taking them in order , the argument that search is predictive of cloud is wrong to me because :
Search infrastructures are built upon the cloud , but are not bought , sold or consumed ( typically ) like the cloud .
The user audiences are distinct , the barriers to entry and exit are distinct ( for both customers and providers ) , the revenue models are distinct , and so on .
Apart from the fact that the cloud is generally the infrastructure for the search , I see few commonalities between the technologies .
One is infrastructure , one is an application : apples to oranges .
As for Hugh ’s argument , I believe that to be unsupportable because :
The combined revenue from Dell , HP , IBM , Intel , and Microsoft would not be enough to secure even the title of the largest business right now , let alone in history .
We know Microsoft will be in this market .
We know Google will be in this market .
And , I ’d argue , we know Amazon will be in this market .
It ’s also likely that some combination of IBM , Rackspace , Sun and others will be players in this market .
Irrespective of whether or not we achieve some level of standardization , it ’s not reasonable – at present – to assert that we ’ll see any one of these players become ascendant and dominant in the way that Google or Microsoft are , because , fundamentally , search and cloud are different .
I could easily migrate from Google tomorrow ; migrating my application workloads from one provider to another , on the other hand , is non-trivial .
Yes , even with Java .
Ergo , projecting one massive , monopolistic player in this market – as we see in search – seems at present to be unreaslistic .
To me , the monopoly of Google search demonstrates little with respect to the prospects for a cloud monopoly .
Low Barriers to Entry Win
· We should have learned this by now .
You do n’t have to look back very hard at recent decades to see examples of technologies which have become pervasive even though , when they started catching on , they were n’t nearly as good as the competition .
The reason is , they were easy to learn and easy to deploy .
I ’m thinking , just for example , of Linux and PHP and HTML .
My sense is that the effortless - deployment threshold for the Cloud is somewhere below the effort required for AWS ’s EC2 / S3 combo ; perhaps something like what a smart modern PHP - hosting service provides .
This section , I generally agree with , although I think it assumes ( perhaps inaccurately ) that Amazon will be unable to evolve in the design / development / deployment area .
It ’s also worth noting that – the unique - to - me search application market aside – lower barriers to entry generally result in more competition rather than less , making the case for monopoly more problematic .
Economies of Scale
· I do n’t think they ’re that big a deal .
To play in this game , you ’re going to need a few tens of thousands of servers , bulk - bandwidth deals with key carriers , and multiple data centers on the ground in North America , Europe , and Asia .
That ’s really expensive to build .
But once a provider has got past the basic threshold , I ’m unconvinced that their cost per unit of service is going to drop much as they get bigger and bigger .
My take - away is that the big Cloud operator does n’t necessarily need to be a Microsoft or a Google or an IBM .
There are multiple pathways by which an unheralded startup could end up on top of the heap .
Disagree , as might have been predicted by this piece .
First , I think the above ignores the human economies of scale , in that Google et al can be expected to hire better , more qualified resources at a lower rate than your average business .
Especially in the cloud , as the large providers can simply present more interesting problems to the best and brightest by offering larger datasets to operate from , larger and more unique infrastructures , and ( particularly in this economy ) greater certainty and predictability in terms of compensation .
As Nick Carr writes , as the marginal cost of the data decreases , its value increases : this is true in people , just as it is in hardware , storage , networking , capacity planning and so on .
And , importantly , it ’s more true for Amazon or Google than it is for , say , your local cloud startup .
I know a few vendors that simply cannot procure the scale - out talent that they ’re looking for , not because they can’t pay , but because they ca n’t offer the types of challenges the elite are interested in .
This will become even more true over time , as the size of the datasets grows .
A few other items worth considering .
It ’s one thing to construct an internal or private cloud for your own use : it ’s quite another to construct an infrastructure sufficient for volume use .
And volume use will be a requisite if you ’re to make the economics work , because the margins of the cloud business to date have been exceedingly slim .
The net ?
I expect both the barriers to entry and the multi-faceted economies of scale to very actively throttle private cloud construction initiatives .
As evidence , I submit …
The fact that the overwhelming majority of cloud based startups we speak with today have declined to build their own infrastructure , and instead are focused on building value around infrastructures built and maintained by large providers like Amazon , Google , and Rackspace .
CIOs Are n’t Stupid
· They ’re bearing the scars of decades of being locked - in by Microsoft on their desktop software , and by Oracle on their databases ; the situation where your infrastructure vendors gain control over part of your budget .
So you can bet that as larger outfits take a strategic view of cloud computing , they ’re going to be appropriately paranoid about barriers to exit .
There ’s going to be a powerful demand for standards and for demonstrated interoperability .
Again , I disagree .
I ’m not arguing that CIOs are stupid , but rather they are constantly under pressure and hugely incented – both organizationally and personally – to focus on the now at the expense of the then .
Like baseball owners that get caught up in the moment and invest in massive free agent contracts that later ( inevitably ) prove to be albatrosses , history has demonstrated to me quite adequately that enterprises , at least , are more than willing to lock themself in if it solves a problem they have now quickly and cost effectively .
To be sure , there will undoubtedly be a great deal of discussion concerning lock - in and the need to avoid it , but I am entirely unconvinced that the industry , generally , has absorbed the lessons of the past sufficiently to avoid repeating it .
But maybe I ’m just a cynic .
A Historical Analogy
· To me , the cloud - computing landscape feels like the Web search landscape in 1996 .
Back then , Everybody who ’d thought about it had clued in that this was going to be really interesting and useful .
There had been a few offerings , much better than nothing but not really hitting a sweet spot .
[ Disclosure :
One of them was me . ]
Then Altavista launched and it was clearly better than anything else .
Meanwhile , Larry and Sergey were at Stanford thinking about transitive functions over the graph of Web hyperlinks .
Amazon Web Services smells like Altavista to me ; a huge step in a good direction .
But there are some very good Big Ideas waiting out there to launch , probably incubating right now in a garage or grad school .
I ’m quite sure this is true ; I just do n’t believe many of these Big Ideas will involve constructing infrastructures like Amazon’s .
Such an idea does n’t have to come from a big company .
And it does n’t have to be proprietary to grow fast and dominate the landscape .
It has to have no aroma of lock - in , it has to be obviously better , and most of all , more than anything else , it has to be really , really easy to get started with .
Assuming that I ’m incorrect , however , and that there will be a vibrant startup market aimed at delivering superior value to Amazon , how likely is it that they survive to challenge the big boys ?
From where I sit , it seems far more likely that these heavily capitalized startups – hardware , bandwidth and networking cost money , still – will be acquired early and often by the big boys , who are content to outsource innovation in the fabric to startups .
Ultimately , Tim and I agree that the cloud is still waiting on a platform that is truly easy to get started with , much in the way that Google was easier to use than Altavista .
I ’ll also allow that it ’s possible that Amazon goes the way of the one time search giant .
I simply do n’t consider that likely , and if anything , it seems even less likely to me that we ’ll see a cloud provider achieve the kind of market dominance that Google , IBM , Microsoft et al achieved before it .
But it ’ll be fun to watch , either way .
A few months ago I talked about our plans to create and offer a service for content delivery .
That service is called Amazon CloudFront and it is ready now !
Like all of our other services , CloudFront was designed with ease of use in mind from the very beginning .
There are no minimum usage commitments , no monthly fees , and no need to even talk to us .
Here ’s what you do :
Sign up for CloudFront .
Put your most frequently accessed static content into an Amazon S3 bucket and mark it as publicly readable .
Create a new CloudFront Distribution using a single REST - style POST call .
Capture the domain name returned by the call .
Generate fresh URLs for your content using the domain name from step 3 and hand them out .
By using our CNAME support you can even make the content appear as if it is coming from your own domain .
You can associate up to 10 CNAMEs with each distribution .
CloudFront will take care of the rest .
Requests originating anywhere in the world will be routed to one of 14 edge locations ( 8 in the United States , 4 in Europe , and 2 in Asia ) .
If the content is n’t already present at a particular edge location it will be fetched from S3 and cached at the edge .
You will be charged based on the number of requests that you make and the amount of data that you transfer .
Pricing is covered in depth on the detail page .
Because our costs vary by location , pricing for data served from edge locations outside of the US varies , and is currently slightly higher .
You will also pay the usual S3 price for the “ origin fetch ” which take place when a requested object is transferred from S3 to an edge location , and for storage of the object in S3 .
We are looking forward to seeing how this is put to use .
It is certainly going to be used to host software downloads , frequently accessed website components , and media files .
However , as is often the case with these new services , developers will find new and unique ways to put it to use before too long .
Our friends across the lake at Smartsheet have put together a nice worksheet which documents and generalizes the work that they did to support CloudFront in their own product .
Remarkably enough , parts of that website are already served up from CloudFront !
You can use this worksheet to assign tasks to your developers , review the status of the tasks , and much more .
We ’ve got plenty of CloudFront documentation including a Getting Started Guide , a Developer Guide , an FAQ , and even a Quick Reference Card .
Tool and library vendors have been working to support CloudFront in their products .
I ’ll update this post as I learn more .
Updates :
— Jeff ;
New York - based FullTurn Media , maker of racy sex-ed videos under the illumistream brand , was once one of YouTube 's ( GOOG ) most - watched producers .
Now it 's struggling to get a tenth of its traffic on the site .
Earlier this summer , the company was flying high -- averaging a million views a day .
But that ended in June when , in one fell swoop , YouTube classified most of its popular videos as " adult " -- which requires YouTube viewers to register to watch them .
It also took the videos out of contention for advertising spots in YouTube 's partner program , and removed them from all of YouTube 's leaderboards .
Why ?
FullTurn 's videos address sexual health themes with porn - like images and production values , and used to dominate YouTube 's leaderboard with suggestive thumbnails and click - friendly titles such as " Get Friendly With the G - Spot , " " Handling Too Much Man , " and " Micropenis . "
( The videos are available in original form on one of the company 's sites , sexhealthguru.com . )
YouTube 's forcing people to register to watch FullTurn 's videos reduced their video views from a million a day to about 100,000 .
Before the removals , YouTube accounted for 80 % of FullTurn 's video views and 20 % of revenue .
YouTube 's move appears to have been part of a broader crackdown on partner videos deemed advertising - unfriendly .
YouTube , of course , is under pressure to increase ad revenue .
At the same time , it is also by far the biggest venue for online video , and any small change causes major tremors in the small but growing Web economy of Web video .
The company did n't respond to a query about its standards for partner videos .
Other producers that spent time in YouTube 's penalty box included FordModels , SportsIllustrated Swimwear , and NoGoodTV .
Technically , FullTurn was suspended from YouTube for " thumbnail gaming , " or using images for video that do n't accurately reflect the content .
It 's a practice that annoys some YouTube partners , and can litter the leaderboards with deceptive videos .
Among the offending thumbnails : a woman suggestively eating a
banana on a video about nutrition , and a picture of two turtles in flagrante for a video about pheromones .
In its attempts to earn its way back into YouTube 's good graces , FullTurn has gone through and re-edited its catalog .

For years I have been arguing that the most objective — and perhaps , definitive — measure of a driver ’s ability to drive safely is whether he or she has been involved in an at - fault accident .
Speeding tickets , for example , do n’t really tell us whether a person is a safe / competent driver .
They just tell us that person was caught driving faster than a number posted on a sign — which may be illegal , but by no means necessarily unsafe .
For example , it ’s today perfectly legal to drive 65 or 70 mph on most highways .
But during the “ Drive 55 ” era , such speeds were illegal .
Did it suddenly become safe to drive at 65 or 70 on those same roads ?
Of course not .
The law changed , that ’s all .
Also : Skill varies .
Some drivers are perfectly able to handle a car at 80 or 90 mph as well or better than some drivers can handle the same car at 60 mph .
But the system considers the former as an “ unsafe driver ” simply by dint of his faster driving .
The point being , faster drivers are n’t necessarily unsafe drivers .
Insurance industry stats bear this out , incidentally .
Faster drivers actually tend to have fewer accidents than slow - pokes .
Also , while it ’s true that driving faster can increase the amount of damage / severity of injury if there ’s a crash , it does not follow that the risk of having a crash increases simply because “ x ” is traveling faster than “ y . ”
Unfortunately , our dumbed down speed limits force everyone to drive at the level of the least competent .
We also do nothing meaningful to deal with those marginal / iffy drivers .
They can have multiple at - fault accidents — and their license will be in less peril than the driver who has never had an at - fault accident but who has a couple “ reckless driving ” tickets — which in many states are issued as a matter of course for merely driving faster than 20 mph over the posted limit .
( During the “ Drive 55 ” era , one could get a “ reckless driving ” cite for doing 76 mph on the freeway .
Today the exact same speed is either legal — or a minor ticket . )
It ’s nonsense .
Rather than fixate on all these “ technical fouls ” such as driving faster than a number posted on a sign , why not focus on those drivers who have actually given definitive proof their judgment or skill ( or both ) is lacking ?
Driving 80 - something mph in a modern car on a modern Interstate highway is only “ reckless ” in the BS language of the insurance cartels and state / local authorities who make money on this scam .
However , if a driver blows through a red light and strikes another vehicle that had the right of way , that is incontrovertible evidence of “ reckless driving . ”
Yet our system focus to an overbearing extent on statutory “ speeding ” enforcement , with driving faster than a number on a sign the main thing the safety lobby drones on about endlessly about — and the primary offense traffic cops spend their time dealing with .
Objectively dangerous conduct behind the wheel — the driver who wanders across the double yellow while gabbling away on her cell ; the guy riding inches off the bumper of the car ahead of him — is routinely ignored by traffic cops .
Until it causes an accident .
And even then , the consequences are generally less serious than they would be if the driver had been nabbed for doing 80 - something — even if no metal was crunched and no one was hurt .
A minor ticket might be issued as a result of one car plowing into the rear end of another that was stopped at a light .
It is by no means certain .
But have the misfortune to drive by a radar trap and it ’s a sure bet you ’ll be going home with a piece of payin ’ paper in your pocket .
Are the roads any safer as a result ?
Or have the coffers of the state just gotten a little fatter ?
The sensible alternative ought to be this :
Whenever a driver is involved in an at - fault accident , he should be issued a ticket for unsafe driving ( specifics to be defined based on the particulars of each case ) and required to undergo a DMV evaluation that includes a re-test of basic skills and knowledge .
And that means real test — not the sad little pro forma drill they do in most states today .
In other words , a test that is actually possible to fail — and which requires the person to demonstrate higher than Forrest Gumpian levels of knowledge and skill .
An actual road test on actual roads should be part of the deal , too — along with a physical check - up of vision and so on .
I ’m not talking race car driver skill levels — or insisting upon visual acuity good enough to make it as an airline pilot .
But enough skill — and good enough vision — to be a competent driver and less of a risk to others out there , as well as oneself .
We need to weed out the barely marginal ( and sub- marginal ) drivers out there ; often , these are people who never speed — and so fly under the radar .
Until they cause an accident , of course .
At that point , red flags should be hoisted .
If a driver who has already been involved in one at - fault accident has another at - fault accident within a 5 year period , their driving privileges should be suspended until they have taken and passed ( at their expense ) a comprehensive driver training course that intensively focuses on basic skills / competence .
If they cannot pass , they cannot drive .
A third at fault accident in any five year period should result in permanent revocation of driving privileges for at least five years .
Some people should just take the bus .
But it ’ll never happen because of the money and power derived from the current system — and because this country is afflicted with an entitlement mentality and poisoned by the notion that everyone ’s “ equal . ”
Which of course , they ’re not .

Deadline to register to vote in state is today California Many county offices will extend hours for late registration rush
For people who want to vote in the Nov. 4 presidential election , it has come down to two choices for voter registration :
Now or never .
Today is the last chance for California residents to register , and most county election offices will be open late for would - be voters pushing the deadline to the limit .
Registration cards that are mailed can be received after the deadline , as long as they are postmarked by midnight tonight .
While presidential elections almost always attract the most voters , the 2008 contest between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain already looks like it will bring an unusually high turnout .
As of early September , about 16.2 million of California 's 23 million eligible voters had registered .
But there has been a flood of new registrations since then , with the secretary of state 's office often receiving as many as 20,000 to 30,000 a day .
" People who have been in this office through a dozen election cycles say they 've never seen this volume of registration cards , " said Kate Folmar , a spokeswoman for Secretary of State Debra Bowen .
In September , Democrats had an 11.6 million registration edge over Republicans , widening the 8.2 million - voter lead the party had four years ago .
Democrats have taken the registration lead in a handful of traditionally Republican - leaning California counties this year , most recently in San Bernardino County .
" Things are looking good , but we 're not stopping , " said Art Torres , chair of the state Democratic Party .
" We 're seeing energy that we did n't see in 2000 and 2004 . "
The state Republican Party has registered more than 100,000 new members since the June primary and has spent more than $ 1 million on registration efforts , said Hector Barajas , a party spokesman .
" We 've been signing up 9,000 to 10,000 a week , " he said .
" But numbers do n't vote , people vote , so we have to get people to the polls . "
Voters must register in the county where they live .
Many counties allow voters to check the status of their registration on the election department 's Web site .
There are few requirements to register to vote .
People must be American citizens who will be 18 years old by election day and not in prison or on parole for a felony .
The rate of suicide in the United States is increasing for the first time in a decade , according to a new report from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health 's Center for Injury Research and Policy .
The increase in the overall suicide rate between 1999 and 2005 was due primarily to an increase in suicides among whites aged 40 - 64 , with white middle - aged women experiencing the largest annual increase .
Whereas the overall suicide rate rose 0.7 percent during this time period , the rate among middle - aged white men rose 2.7 percent annually and 3.9 percent among middle - aged women .
By contrast , suicide in blacks decreased significantly over the study 's time period , and remained stable among Asian and Native Americans .
The results are published online at the website of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine and will be published in the December print edition .
The researchers also conducted a detailed analysis of suicide methods across specific population groups .
While firearms remain the predominant method , the rate of firearm suicides decreased during the study period .
Suicide by hanging or suffocation increased markedly with a 6.3 percent annual increase among men , and a 2.3 percent annual increase among women .
Hanging / suffocation accounted for 22 percent of all suicides by 2005 , surpassing poisoning at 18 percent .
" The results underscore a change in the epidemiology of suicide , with middle - aged whites emerging as a new high - risk group , " said study co-author Susan P. Baker , MPH , a professor with the Bloomberg School 's Center for Injury Research and Policy .
" Historically , suicide prevention programs have focused on groups considered to be at highest risk — teens and young adults of both genders as well as elderly white men .
This research tells us we need to refocus our resources to develop prevention programs for men and women in their middle years . "
Baker along with colleagues Guoqing Hu , PhD , Holly Wilcox , PhD , Lawrence Wissow , MD , MPH , analyzed data from the Web - based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System ( WISQARS ) mortality reports , which provides data on deaths according to cause and intent of injury by age , race , gender and state .
WISQARS mortality data are based on annual data files of the National Center for Health Statistics ( NCHS ) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) .
The reasons for the increase in the suicide rate are not fully understood .
" While it would be straightforward to attribute the results to a rise in so - called mid-life crises , recent studies find that middle age is mostly a time of relative security and emotional wellbeing , " said Baker .
" Further research is warranted to explore societal changes that may be disproportionably affecting the middle - aged in this country . "

There is a standard proof technique involving the relationship between injectivity and surjectivity on “ finite ” structures .
I rather like it — for the examples provided , it is very difficult to proceed without knowing the trick , even though the solutions are very simple .
Principle A : If is a finite set and is a function , then is injective if and only if is surjective .
Proposition 1 : If is a finite field and is a homomorphism of fields , then is an isomorphism .
Proof : is an ideal of , but it cannot equal , ( for ) so and is injective .
Therefore is surjective .
Proposition 2 : If is a finite simple group and is a homomorphism , then is an isomorphism or .
Proof : Either , in which case , or , in which case is injective , so is surjective .
Principle B : If is a finite dimensional vector space and is a linear transformation , then is injective if and only if is surjective .
Proposition 3 : If is a field and is an integral domain containing with finite dimension over , then is a field .
Proof :
It suffices to show that we can take inverses .
Choose any nonzero , and consider the map defined by .
Then is a linear transformation .
Since is an integral domain , is injective , therefore is surjective .
So there exists some with , so .
Problem :
Show that any finite integral domain is a field .
EDIT : As Steven points out in the comments , the following is also useful , and the proof is a good exercise :
Principle C : If is a Notherian module then any surjective homomorphism is injective , and if is an Artinian module , then any injective homomorphism is surjective .
( hint : in fact , for any , if is Noetherian , then for large enough we have .
If is Artinian , then for large enough we have . )

Sarkozy : " A decisive moment for the future of a civilised internet " French plans to throw persistent pirates off the net have got closer to becoming law .
The French Senate voted overwhelmingly in favour of the law , which aims to tackle ongoing piracy of music , movies , and games online .
Those caught illegally sharing digital media will get warnings e-mailed and posted to them before having their net connection terminated .
The proposed law now goes to the French National Assembly for final approval .
The idea to tackle piracy with such a three strikes law was first floated in November 2007 , when French President Nicolas Sarkozy called it : " a decisive moment for the future of a civilised internet " .
Under the plan , net firms will be enrolled as watchdogs that will keep an eye on consumers indulging in casual piracy .
Those spotted illegally sharing copyrighted works , such as music tracks or movies , will get two warnings , but if they do not heed these then their net connection with be terminated .
The French Senate voted 297 to 15 to back the law , which will also create a new governmental body that will oversee the anti-piracy work .
Companies will be encouraged to install firewalls blocking content sharing by employees .
Prior to the Senate vote , French politicians rejected an amendment , by Bruno Retailleau of the right - wing MPF party , which suggested using fines instead of cutting people off .
Mr Retailleau said the net had become an " essential commodity " and cutting people off went too far .
If enacted , the law will put France on a collision course with Brussels , which rejected a call to impose such " three strikes " laws across Europe in April 2008 .
Throwing people offline , it said , conflicted with " civil liberties and human rights " .
At the same time Sweden is reportedly drawing up laws that will make it easier to track down and prosecute persistent pirates .
The law might be enacted in early 2009 .

How perfumes and scented creams could make your unborn baby infertile
Risk : Perfume and scented creams could cause infertility or cancer in unborn boys
Pregnant women are being urged to stop using perfumes or scented creams after research suggested the products could cause unborn boys to suffer infertility or cancer in later life .
It found the reproductive systems of male foetuses were damaged at as early as eight weeks ' gestation by chemicals found in cosmetics .
Professor Richard Sharpe , who led the research at the Medical Research Council 's Human Sciences Unit , said that he had discovered a ' time window ' of eight to 12 weeks ' gestation , when certain hormones in the foetus are activated and the male reproductive system comes into being .
At that time , future problems of male fertility , including undescended testicles , low sperm count and the risk of testicular cancer could be determined if these hormones , such as testosterone , do not work properly , he added .
The experiments on rats confirmed that if the hormones were blocked , the animals suffered fertility problems .
Professor Sharpe said he had discovered the male programming window occurred far earlier in foetal development than was previously thought , before the reproductive organs fully develop , and when androgens in the foetus are most active .
' If the male foetus does not receive enough androgens it may not realise its full reproductive potential , ' he added .
' Women could stop using body creams and perfumes .
' Although we do not have conclusive evidence they do harm , there are components about which there are question marks ; for example , it could be certain combinations of chemicals . '
Professor Sharpe is due to unveil his findings this week at the Simpson Symposium in Edinburgh , a gathering of fertility experts organised by Edinburgh University .
Even if your best friend owns a top publishing Â company , giving you an immediate “ in , ” this does notÂ guarantee publishing success .
First , you have to write a quality book that has aÂ clear target audience .
And your book must answer aÂ common problem or need that audience shares .
Then youÂ have to develop a marketing plan , and stick to it forÂ at least two years .
Let ’s begin with the process that should commenceÂ before you write your first word .
Begin by reading AÂ LOT .
Read both books you passionately love and books Â you ca n’t seem to make it past page five .
Then figureÂ out what the author did in the book you loved , and Â what was wrong with in the book you could n’t finish .
Write down these points so they are crystal clear toÂ you .
Read other people ’s books for inspiration and toÂ discover what you should avoid as a writer .
The next step is to plan out your book .
Narrow downÂ your subject , and then divide it into chapters .
EachÂ chapter should address a specific aspect of theÂ problem your book is going to solve .
In each chapter , Â break the specific aspect down into several parts . Â
This will help your readers take in you information aÂ bit at a time instead of overwhelming them with every Â bit of information clogging up the pages until theyÂ feel like they ’re about to go blind .
It ’s not quiteÂ spoon - feeding the information to your readers , but Â it ’s close .
The next two steps are obvious .
Write your book and Â then revise it .
And then revise it again .
And perhapsÂ again .
Of course , writing is extremely hard , and Â writing a book can seem like an impossible task .
ThereÂ are many books out there that give you guidelines toÂ help you become familiar – and even love – the processÂ of writing and revision .
Find a number of books aboutÂ writing .
Better yet , find a number of books aboutÂ writing the specific type of book you aspire to write .
These can serve as roadmaps on your writing journey . Â
Once you ’ve written your ebook and revised it at least twice , show it to someone else whose opinion you respect .
If you ’re lucky enough to know a good editor , see if you have something to barter for him or her to go through your manuscript .
Or join a writing group and let the other members critique your work .
Then take all these ideas from other people , and revise your manuscript one last time .
And then stop !
Put down that pen !
Get your hands off the keyboard !
One of the most important steps to actually producing a book is to know when to stop writing and tinkering with it .
You ’ve finally written your ebook !
Pop open the bubbly !
Give yourself a night out on the town !
Okay , now that this necessary celebration is out of your system , what do you do next ?
How to turn your ebook into Profits
Ebooks are a revolutionary way to publish your bookwithout incurring the costs of print production .
All you need is a relevant and targeted subject and some inexpensive software , and you can transform your manuscript into a book .
The problem , in terms of actually seeing any profits from your ebook , is that the market is overwhelmed with ebooks , and many of them are not worth the time it takes to download them .
Just because the ability exists to easily produce an ebook , does n’t make it good writing .
Make sure your book does not simply rehash old material .
You will injure your credibility as an author by claiming to offer valuable new insights and disappointing your audience with material they ’ve read a zillion times before .
So spend enough time writing and revising your book to make sure it ’s of the highest quality and presents the most current information .
A good book will eventually sell itself ; false claims about your book will make it extremely difficult to sell any future books you may write .
Assuming you have determined that you do indeed have a quality product that answers some question or need of your target audience with NEW information , how do you know how much to charge for it ?
Rule number 1 : set a price for your book equal to its value .
An under - priced book will only give the impression that your book is n’t worth very much .
To figure out a fair price , estimate how much time you put into creating it and how difficult it was to transform the necessary information into understandable and engaging writing .
Figure out how much your time and effort is worth , and then price it accordingly .
The goal is for you to be adequately compensated for your talent , your time , and your effort .
Once you ’ve figured out a price that is high enough to convey the value of the book , but not so high as to be out of the reach of your target audience ’s mean budget , then it ’s time to offer it for sale on your website .
To attract sales , you will need to develop a promotional campaign , particularly if you are an unknown author .
There are multitudes of books about self - promotion that will guide you in your efforts .
Choose a plan that is both creative and professional .
Learn how to write a catchy yet informative press release , and send copies of your ebook to sites that specialize in ebook reviews .
Learn how to write powerful sales copy , or hire someone to write it for you .
This is an essential .
You absolutely need excellent sales copy to sell your book .
Make sure the copy includes all the reasons your target audience needs your book , and the benefits they will derive from buying it .
Use graphics in your promotional materials .
Beautiful graphics have the power to instantly convey the quality and value of your ebook .
Graphics can also convey the amount of valuable information the book contains , and your careful attention to detail .
Professional graphics sell professional books .
They reassure the customer that the product is what it claims to be .
Consider excerpting chapters for articles .
You can offer these tidbits for free on your website as a sort of demo of your book .

For years , books and articles and blogs on productivity have been showing us how to be more productive : crank out the tasks , multi-task , work faster , be organized .
In short , they ’ve taught us to be a good part of a corporation that wants more out of us .
But that ’s old - school productivity , or Productivity 1.0 .
Today let ’s take a look at Productivity 2.0 : a new set of rules have changed everything for the workers of the world .
Do n’t crank out tasks — learn to work with a deeper focus .
Do n’t plan and hold meetings and form committees — just launch the software or product or service and keep improving it .
Do n’t spend time organizing — you ’ve got more important things to worry about .
A little while ago I talked about the New Rules of Working … and today we ’ll look at how those new rules have changed the game for productivity .
Now , these ideas are n’t actually new , but they ’re being newly adopted by many , and will be adopted increasingly as workplaces change in the coming years .
Please note that , as always , your mileage may vary — these new rules of productivity wo n’t work for every single worker in every single office situation .
Certain jobs have different requirements .
But more and more , these trends are emerging and changing the way we look at productivity .
1. Do n’t Crank – Work With Deeper Focus .
Old School : Crank It Out .
The old school of productivity taught us how to crank out the tasks .
Each task is a widget that needs to be cranked , and the more we crank out , the better .
Speed is important , and cranking out more tasks is the ultimate criteria .
How many tasks can you finish in a day ?
Productivity 2.0 : Deep Focus .
The new worker is n’t as obsessed with speed .
He allows himself to slow down and work at a more leisurely pace .
He clears away distractions and allows himself to focus on the task at hand .
He gets passionate about important and exciting tasks and gets into Flow .
This allows for a new kind of productivity — one where quality matters , where amazing things are produced at an intense rate , where there is a passion and satisfaction in completing a task .
2. Minimize Out Meetings and Planning — Just Start .
Old School : Lots of planning is important .
Hold numerous planning meetings , draw up specs or detailed timelines , make sure things are well planned out before committing resources .
This , however , meant that things took time .
That was fine when the world moved at a slower pace .
Productivity 2.0 : Just Start .
Forget all the detailed planning .
Meetings are a waste of time , usually .
Instead , figure out the minimum requirements to launch , get those done as quickly as possible , and launch in beta mode .
Improve as you go along .
Things do n’t have to be perfect at launch .
Google exemplifies this philosophy — did it wait until it had a better email program than Microsoft Outlook to launch Gmail ?
Heck no — it just launched to a small group of users and used their feedback to improve the service , expanding its group of users as it went along .
Now it ’s the best online email program .
Same thing with Google Chrome — was it better than Firefox when it launched in beta ?
Nope ( although it ’s better than IE in my opinion ) … but you can bet that it will continue to improve with all the feedback it gets .
Edit : I changed the title of this point to reflect that some planning is necessary — “ overplanning ” is not .
3. Paperwork is out — automate with technology .
Old school : Crank through tons of paperwork .
The old productive worker had tons of incoming papers , and lots of paperwork to fill out .
And productivity methods taught him how to crank through that paperwork .
Productivity 2.0 : Automate with technology .
Many workers are learning to go paperless .
And because everything is becoming digital , you can use technology to process it faster .
People can fill out online forms instead of paperwork , and computers can pull the data in the forms into databases that can be manipulated in many ways .
There ’s no need for photocopying , scanning , faxing , filing , collating , hole punching , printing , or any of the many other office tasks that are associated with paper .
People can buy something online and it can be produced and shipped to their door with no need for paperwork — it can all be automated .
Many little tasks that used to be performed by humans can now be automated through computers .
4 . Do n’t multi-task — multi-project and single - task .
Old school : Multi - tasking is productive .
Juggling tasks shows how productive you are , says old school productivity .
I ’ve written enough about multi-tasking for you to know where I stand on that .
Productivity 2.0 : Multi - project and single - task .
While I wo n’t go on once again about single - tasking — focusing on one task at a time to be more effective — I will say that multi-projecting has its uses .
Let ’s say you ’re working on Task 1 of Project A — you should single - task while working on Task 1 .
But when it ’s done , you might need to wait for a response from your boss before moving on to Task 2 .
In that case , while you ’re waiting , you can work on Task 1 of Project B , single - tasking while doing that .
When you ’re done with that , you might need to hear back from a client before moving on to the next task of Project B — in which case you can either return to Project A if your boss responded , or move on to Project C. Single - task while working on any one task , but working on different projects to make your time more efficient can be a useful skill .
5 . Produce less , not more .
Old school : Produce more .
Again , the idea was to crank out as much as possible .
Good managers tried to get as much productivity out of their workers as possible .
Good workers produced more .
Productivity 2.0 : Produce less .
More is n’t necessarily better .
The old thinking can lead to a big pile of crap .
Instead , focus on quality , on innovation , on creativity .
Focus on the important stuff .
Let ’s take a software engineer as an example : one engineer can write tons of code , knocking out one program after another .
But a second engineer can focus on a really innovative program , and though he has produced much less code and fewer programs and has spent more time on a single program … his software can change the industry .
It can win awards and recognition .
It might even be the company ’s main source of income if it catches on .
Produce things that change the world , with a long - lasting impact .
6. Forget about organization — use technology .
Old School : Be organized .
The productive worker of the past had drawers full of files , all organized thoroughly so that nothing would ever be lost .
He had a Filofax full of contacts and appointments .
He organized his computer files into folders and sub - folders and sub -sub - folders and on and one .
It took a lot of time , but it was worth it .
Productivity 2.0 : Tag , archive and search .
With technology , that ’s not necessary .
Tag a file with a certain label , archive it , and find it later through its label or through search .
This approach saves a lot of time , a lot of effort , and a lot of headaches .
You can spend your time on more important tasks .
7 . Out with hierarchies — in with freedom .
Old School : Hierarchy .
The old way of thinking is that hierarchies are more efficient .
After all , in a dictatorship , the trains run on time , no ?
Well , that ’s not always true .
Hierarchies require a lot of top - down decision - making , and a lot of up - and - down communication .
The bottom level is often left powerless to act until the top level makes decisions , and the top level is often left without important information necessary to make those decisions , because they are n’t down at the bottom in the trenches .
As a result , there ’s a lot of inefficiency .
Productivity 2.0 : Independence , freedom , and collaboration .
Hierarchies are being flattened out .
In fact , whole new forms of organization and collaboration are being created all the time .
People more and more are working independently , either within a company or as freelancers and consultants .
They take on jobs as they like , and collaborate with others at will .
Workers are empowered to make decisions , communication is more efficient , and people with freedom are generally happier with their jobs and more passionate about the work they produce .
8 . Work fewer hours , not more .
Old School : Work longer hours .
Work long and hard !
Be a top producer !
Burn out by age 40 !
Working long hours earned you points with your boss , and there was a competition to see who worked the most and the hardest .
Productivity 2.0 : Work fewer hours .
With more freedom , workers are realizing that work is n’t everything , and that it ’s more important to be happy , to produce important work , to have the freedom to be creative and innovative , to be passionate about your work … than to give everything you have for something you do n’t care about .
As a result , more people are working from home .
More people have flexible working hours , working early and leaving early or coming in late and leaving late .
More people take naps in the afternoon , when their productivity normally flags , and wake up refreshed and ready for a productive round 2 .
More people are setting limits to their working hours , and realizing that with those limits they actually make better use of the fewer hours they work .
I 've noticed lately that a lot of people seem to have discovered that Barack Obama is a socialist .
There 's a lot of that going around .
Socialism , I mean .
The only politician that I know of on the national scene who is definitely not a socialist is Texas congressman Ron Paul .
And look where that got him .
During the presidential primary campaign Paul was treated as a laughingstock by his fellow Republicans for such stances as his call for young people to be permitted to opt out of Social Security .
Paul 's having the last laugh these days .
As you can see in this clip , the entire U.S. economy is now socialist thanks to the big corporate bailout , says Dr. Paul .
And then there is the unpleasant fact that every senior citizen in America is what my Aussie friends used to call " a dole bludger , " someone who takes welfare without working .
One such apparent dole bludger held forth at a recent McCain rally in Wisconsin .
The old codger worked himself up into a frenzy that even the hot - tempered McCain might envy , screaming " I 'm mad , I 'm really mad ! " and then shouting , " And what 's going to surprise ya , is it 's not the economy , it 's the socialists taking over our country . "
The old coot made it clear that the hated socialists are the Democrats .
But assuming he was over 65 , which he certainly appeared to be , the guy is receiving the benefit of at least two socialist programs .
One , of course , is Social Security .
There 's a reason they called it " social " security and not Capitalist Security .
It 's a welfare program and the current codgers are getting a free ride paid for by working Americans .
True , they paid into it , but anyone who lives a normal life span will get out a lot more than he or she put in .
And then there 's Medicare .
The current crop of seniors paid a pittance into it during their working years , but they now have the benefit of a system of socialized medicine till the day they die .
Does this guy really want McCain to fight socialism in America ?
Imagine McCain told this guy he was absolutely right and as of January President McCain would end Social Security and Medicare and pay back to senior citizens the amount they paid in , with interest .
By February , this geezer would be at a rally demanding to have his Medicare coverage restored .
The truth is , Americans love socialism .
They 'd better .
This is a socialist country .
Here 's an interesting article that compares our government - funded health care systems , primarily Medicare and Medicaid , with other countries :
" The average rich - country government spends 6.7 percent of GDP on health ; America 's 6.8 percent is very slightly higher .
The national health systems of Canada and Britain cost about 6.9 percent of GDP , and that of Australia 6.4 percent .
Germany 's government spends the most on health care at 8.9 percent of GDP , followed by Norway , Sweden , France , and Denmark . "
The big difference , of course , is that in most of those countries the socialized system covers everyone , while our socialized system covers just the poor and the elderly .
Oh yeah , do n't let me forget government workers .
They have a system of guaranteed benefits and early retirement that the typical Brit or Swede would envy .
So our system is socialism .
It 's just an inept form of socialism .
And it 's also an unsupportable form .
The baby - boomer retirement was going to bankrupt us even before the recent market meltdown .
Now we could be on the verge of a slide into Third - World status .
I 've been to countries where you need to carry a backpack just for the bills needed to buy a beer .
It 's not a pretty sight .
The only way to prevent that would be to take the harsh medicine that Dr. Paul offered us during the primary season .
But not a lot of Americans want that prescription , and I suspect the old crank in this video would be among the last to down a dose of it .
NOTE : Michael Cannon of the Cato Institute just sent me a link to this paper in which he argues that Obama 's plan is socialized medicine , as is Medicare .
He does n't deal with McCain 's plan , but it is slightly less socialist than Obama's .

iPods In Combat
by James Dunnigan
August 27 , 2008 Discussion Board on this DLS topic The U.S. military went into Iraq with few troops able to speak Arabic .
Now they can use their iPods to do the talking for them .
A new software product , VCommunicator Mobile , and a speaker than plugs into where the ear buds go , enables troops to quickly access a library of phrases .
There is also a set of protective covers for the iPod and speaker , with Velcro straps so that you can attach both to your arm .
If all this sounds very soldier - friendly , that 's because the product was designed with the help of troops from the 10th Mountain division , who have been using 260 of these specially equipped iPods for the last year .
This cost the army $ 800,000 , and included language modules for Iraqi Arabic ( it 's a distinct dialect ) and Kurdish ( an Indo - European language spoken in the north ) .
There are also modules for languages spoken in Afghanistan ( Dari and Pushto ) .
Over 700 troops are using the device in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The VCommunicator Mobile software and libraries takes up four gigabytes per language , so it can be used on the smaller , and more rugged , Nano iPods .
The software displays graphics , showing either the phrase in Arabic , or a video of a soldier making the appropriate hand gesture ( there are a lot of those in Arabic . )
There are collections of phrases for specific situations , like checkpoint , raid or patrol .
You can use any accessory made for the iPod , like larger displays or megaphones .
The army has been developing translation devices like this since 2001 .
All previous ones needed a laptop or PDA ( a device being made obsolete by more powerful cell phones ) .
The VCommunicator Mobile approach took advantage of the fact that most troops had iPods and knew how to operate them .
That saved a lot of training time .
It was also discovered that many Iraqis were familiar with iPods , or had their own .
They were fascinated by this use of the iPod , and this helped break the tension .
While the translation is one way , but asking for " yes / no " answers , or directions ( to an arms cache , a wanted man , or someone in need of medical help ) , the VCommunicator Mobile worked quite well .
While troops quickly pick up a basic vocabulary of phrases , the VCommunicator Mobile accelerates the process , as troops can use it to help them learn more Arabic ( or Dari or Phusto ) .
VCommunicator Mobile also comes with an editor , that runs on a laptop , enabling troops to edit their libraries , adding new phrases or reorganizing them .
The army has found that the troops can handle a lot of technology , if the stuff is actually useful .
In that case , soldiers will often buy stuff with their own money .
Not so much with VCommunicator Mobile , as it costs $ 2,000 to have an iPod loaded with just one language .
The army has also provided a solar recharger for the iPods of troops spending a lot of time out in the hills of Afghanistan .
WASHINGTON --
The Army is launching a new war against an old foe : the lingering problem of sexual violence within the military .
Last month , 80 high - ranking generals gathered at a hotel in Alexandria , Va. , for a mandatory , weeklong summit devoted to combating the crime .
In a Sept. 22 essay in Army Times , Army Secretary Pete Geren and Gen. George Casey , the service 's chief of staff , said it was " repugnant to everything a soldier stands for " and promised a " zero tolerance " policy for harassment or assault .

Viva La Paris !
Samantha Ronson and Lindsay Lohan ( PHOTOS )
andarrived in Paris today via the Gare Do Nord train station after leaving London on the Eurostar .
The couple spent several days on British soil engaged in shopping , partying and in Ronson 's case , getting in a couple of DJing gigs .
Rumors have floated that the couple plan to get engaged in Paris .
They are staying at the beautiful Ritz Hotel .
We 'll just have to wait to see what transpires in that regard .
The couple took in the sights earlier Friday , including the famed Champs - Elysees before arriving at the VIP Room , where Ronson was slated to work the sound board .
Unfortunately the City of Lights was n't all warm and friendly to Lindsay .
The fashionista has sported two fur coats while on her European travels .
A PETA activist reportedly dumped a sack of flour over her head early Saturday morning while screaming " Lindsay Lohan fur hag ! "
According to a bystander : " Lindsay was mortified and then furious .
She 's in Paris supporting her girlfriend , DJ Samantha Ronson , and I think she was planning on a flour - free weekend . "
Check out the video below .
We 'll be scouring the net for the Lindsay Lohan flour photo and hope to post it soon .

I ’ve just found a wonderful article on how the Jivaro - Shuar , an indigenous people from the upper Amazon basin , shrink human heads after killing their enemies in battle .
It ’s from the medical journal Neurosurgery but it ’s most fascinating for what it reveals about the complex customs and social relations that surround the practice .
The actual head shrinking is the end point in a raid on an enemies camp which apparently happens periodically , as they are almost always in revenge for being the victim of an earlier raid .
The victim of the revenge raid is not necessarily the perpetrator of the last attack .
The new target is picked out by the shaman while under the influence of a hallucinogenic beverage called nat√©ma ( apparently a type of ayahuasca ) .
The significance of this vengeance cycle is remarkably similar to the one described by Jared Diamond in a New Yorker article on violence in the Handa people of New Guinea that we covered earlier this year .
The article does explain the process of shrinking heads , if ever you find yourself with a spare one , as well as the complex ritual and ceremonies that accompany the process and seem to pervade the whole life and identity of the Jivaro - Shuar .
Anyway , on to the head shrinking .
After carefully removing the skin from and discarding the skull , a ritual pot is used to heat water .
As the water begins to grow warm , with a command , the headman leads the warriors in the rite : he seizes what remains of the head by its hair and , with the warriors ‚
Äô hands laid upon his hand grasping the victim ‚Äôs head , he dips the head three times in the water .
As he does this , he intones , ‚ ÄúI dip the head in the boa ‚Äôs water .
‚Äù
The warriors in turn respond , ‚ Äú He is boiling the head .
‚Äù
The skin of the head is then placed in the vessel and allowed to steep for 15 to 20 minutes as the participants watch in silence .
When the water reaches a boil , the vessel is removed from the fire , and the skin is recovered from the water with a stick and hung up on the tip of a spear to dry … .
They retrieve the skin from its place on the spear and bind the hair on its scalp .
Eyelet holes are pierced through the base of the neck , transforming the skin into a sort of pouch .
The mouth is sewn shut with darts from below as the participants intone : ‚ Äú He is sewing .
‚Äù
The eyelids are sutured closed in a similar manner .
With the enemy ‚Äôs skin now a pouch with a single mouth , the base of the neck , the skin is dried with heated sand and stones .
The sand is heated on a round , hollow plate .
The senior member of the party leads the warriors involved in the kill in scooping up the sand with a vessel and pouring it into the head , then shaking the head to drive the sand as far into the pouch as possible .
This is repeated for hours as the participants repeat the chant , ‚ ÄúI am pouring sand .
‚Äù A large flat stone is likewise heated in the fire and used , held with the help of a leaf folded for the purpose , on the outside layer of the skin .
The head is then complete .
Interestingly , once made , the heads are usually discarded as the significance lies in the process rather than the product .
It ’s a completely fascinating article and really worth reading in full .

CAPE CORAL , Florida ( Reuters ) - Long before she filed for bankruptcy , Ann Neukomm was “ under water ” -- she owed more on her mortgage than her house was worth -- a situation more and more Americans are finding themselves in .

As the financial crisis hits Main Street America , nearly one in six U.S. homeowners are finding themselves in the same position , threatening the U.S. economy with a new wave of foreclosures and bankruptcies .
About 12 million U.S. homeowners owe more than their homes are worth , compared with 6.6 million at the end of last year and slightly more than 3 million at the close of 2006 , said Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody ’s Economy.com .
“ At the root it ’s ‘ the ’ problem , ” said Zandi .
“ If you ’re going to put your finger on the one thing that ’s gotten us into this fiasco , it ’s the fact that millions of homeowners are under water on their homes . ”
If , like Neukomm , these homeowners go into foreclosure , it would add to the oversupply of homes , delay a recovery in the housing market , and add to pressure on banks .
Already , U.S. consumer spending is slumping as homeowners find they can no longer take equity out of their homes to fund their lifestyles .
In a slowing economy , it does n’t take much to push an underwater mortgage into default .
“ When you ’re under water and you have some kind of hit to your income or some kind of unintended expense , that ’s when you default .
And so now we ’ve got this noxious mix of millions of people under water and quickly rising unemployment , ” Zandi said .
Like Neukomm , 57 , many people got into trouble by refinancing mortgages to pull out cash when rising property values made it seem like an almost risk - free deal .
She ended up filing for bankruptcy in May after failing to keep up with mortgage payments on her home in Cape Coral , a once - booming town in southwest Florida .
“ It ’s a dirty word , ” said Neukomm of her bankruptcy and personal feelings of failure .
“ Nobody wants to say it . ”
WASTELAND
Cape Coral , built over swampland near Fort Myers on Florida ’s palm - fringed Gulf Coast , was fertile ground for the real estate boom , which peaked across much of the United States three years ago .
It is now a wasteland , with barren strip malls , a bloated inventory of unsold or abandoned homes and ubiquitous for - sale signs that speak volumes about the plunge in housing prices and surge in mortgage defaults that triggered the U.S. credit crunch last year .
With current home prices likely to decline on average by another 10 percent , Zandi said there will be 14.6 million homeowners under water by September next year .
“ House prices have collapsed and you ’ve got many homeowners who bought homes in the last three years who put very little down or have been borrowing against their homes , ” said Zandi .
“ That ’s causing this to rise very rapidly . ”
Economists like Zandi worry that the underlying housing crisis could eventually prove much more costly to the U.S. taxpayer than the $ 700 billion the U.S. government has pledged to recapitalize banks and buy up distressed debt from financial institutions .
“ The government is going to have to start filling this negative equity hole and that ’s just going to be a direct cost to taxpayers , ” Zandi said .
“ This is going to be the really costly part , I think , for taxpayers . ”
While the U.S. government has focused its rescue on banks , it has done little to help individuals who are struggling to pay their mortgages , apart from the HOPE NOW program , which has facilitated a few hundred thousand mortgage restructurings .
The government may have no option but to step in , especially if a rising tide of foreclosures and falloff in property and other tax revenues endanger municipalities and local governments and force some into bankruptcy .
Both presidential candidates have outlined plans for relief for distressed homeowners but critics say they have been short on details and there appears to be little consensus about how best to help homeowners who are under water .
DREAM HOME
Among homeowners in danger is Virginia Washington , a 64 - year - old medical secretary from California who bought her retirement home in the town of Tolleson , Arizona , in 1996 .
“ It was supposed to be my dream home , but it has turned out to be a nightmare , ” said Washington , who owes $ 207,000 on a house that is worth about $ 150,000 .
Whereas many families that are now saddled with negative equity simply hand the keys back to the bank and walk away , Washington is haunted by the fear of losing the $ 65,000 in savings she put down as her deposit .
“ Many people did not put any money down on a home and they feel free to walk away .
But $ 65,000 , there ’s no money tree that grows that kind of money , ” she said .
In Stockton , California , a town that has become a posterchild of the U.S. housing crisis , Zillow.com said nearly every homeowner who bought in 2006 is now under water .
There are countless other troublespots across the country .
Nationwide , for those who purchased U.S. homes since the beginning of 2003 , nearly one in three now have negative equity .
Nearly half of buyers who purchased in 2006 are under water .
Despite tighter credit and underwriting for home loans this year , Steve Berg , a managing director at research firm LPS Applied Analytics , said mortgages originated in 2008 were on par or trending worse than those originated last year or in 2006 .
“ Presumably the equity position of the borrowers in the loans originated this year should be better , ” Berg said in an interview .
“ That does n’t appear to be the case , and certainly not to the magnitude you ’d expect . ”
Foreclosed homes already account for 50 percent of all home sales in some markets , according to Zillow.com , an online real estate research service .
For homeowners like Neukomm , any solution to the negative equity problem will be too late .
Any day now , she says she expects to receive a letter giving her 21 to 30 days to abandon the house she bought back in 2000 .
“ I can make my credit card payments .
I just ca n’t do it with the house , ” she said , adding that she was now looking at rental properties in Cape Coral .
You may get away with lying to the rest of us , but this man is powerful enough to expose you - and ridicule you .
Here 's another surreal moment in a campaign where pop cultural figures are standing up to raw lies and power as effectively as the MSM .
More effectively , in fact :
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
This blog was periodically updated at the top , but can best be read from the bottom .
I have incorporated my two earlier blogs of the day in it .
And now I am going home .
5:25 p.m. | Lessons of the day : What did we learn today ?
The first thing is that the authorities remain determined to staunch the panic and keep the credit markets functioning .
But it is far from clear they can do so .
The Fed ’s indication that it might intervene in the corporate commercial paper market was merely the latest effort to persuade investors that they need not fear .
Trouble is , such attempts only emphasize the obvious vulnerability of the system .
The late rally may help to encourage Asian markets when they open in a few hours , even if the Dow was not able to hold above 10,000 .
Another favorable sign — I think — is that the S.&P. financials index bottomed at 231.96 , more than 6 points higher than the July 15 panic low of 225.83 .
Nothing relieved the impression formed over the weekend that Europe is scrambling and quarreling rather than acting .
I had hoped that central banks would cut rates on a coordinated basis , as I wrote early this morning .
Perhaps that will come , but it appears that the European Central Bank is still worried about inflation and unwilling to take part .
Jean - Claude Trichet , the central bank president , sounded like he was patting himself on the back today , when he talked about how his central bank had been “ among the first ” to provide liquidity to the banking system , and that it would keep doing so .
The problem , he thinks , is that investors are worrying too much .
“ We ’ve reached the stage where the pendulum has swung the other way .
Private shareholders are overestimating the risk .
My appeal is to shoulder their responsibility to be calm and to have trust , ” Mr. Trichet said .
One economist I know — who is more worried about depression than inflation — suggested that now is a good time to invoke the Bush Doctrine , which gives us the right to intervene anywhere , with or without allies , if we think someone is doing serious harm to American national interests .
He suggested the Marines should be sent to Frankfurt to take control of the European Central Bank .
Such a move might be very well better received in Italy and France .
When the euro began almost a decade ago , it was the Anglo - Saxon economists who thought it could never last .
Now we have the first crisis , and it is showing the strain .
There is speculation that one or more countries might try to leave the currency — something that is not supposed to be possible — if the economy in Europe gets bad enough .
It certainly seems likely to get bad .
Fourth quarter G.D.P. is likely to plunge in most developed countries .
A CNN poll over the weekend found that most Americans think a depression is at least somewhat likely .
Mr. Trichet is right .
Fear is overdone , or at least I hope it is .
But I suspect he could do more good with action than with cheerleading .
4:50 p.m. | Not quite 10,000 : The Dow closed under 10,000 for the first time since Oct. 26 , 2004 today , even though it was far above the low of the day ,
Over that period of nearly four years , here are the best and worst performers of the stocks now in the index , as measured by Bloomberg .
( Figures do not include dividends . )
Best
1. Hewlett - Packard , up 129 %
2. McDonalds , up 98 %
3. Exxon Mobil , up 57 %
4. Chevron , up 42 %
5. Coca -Cola , up 30 %
In other words , a tech recovery , two oil companies and two companies that sell inexpensive food or drinks .
Worst
1. General Motors , down 77 %
2. Citigroup , down 60 %
3. Alcoa , down 45 %
4. Home Depot , down 42 %
5. General Electric , down 36 %
A car company that bet on S.U.V.s , a basic material company facing a recession around the world , a troubled bank , a retailer dependant on a vibrant housing market , and a conglomerate that long depended on its financial arm .
3:58 p.m. | 10,000 or bust :
The psychologically important level of 10,000 on the Dow — do you remember that phrase ? — was breached today .
But in the final minutes of trading the index got up to 10,030 , only to fall back .
Can it close above 10,000 ?
Does it matter ?
3:45 p.m. | Rally ? :
The Dow industrials are up more than 200 points from their low , which was hit at 2:45 .
We ’ll see if that holds , but it is at least a little encouraging .
2:45 p.m. | The Crash of 2008 : If the S.&P. 500 closes where it is now , ( 1009.07 , down 8 percent for the day ) it will have lost more than 13 % over the past three sessions .
The only other time declines of that magnitude occurred since World War II was in the crash of 1987 .
Prior to that , the last one was in May 1940 , when France fell to Germany .
2:05 p.m. | Why It Is n’t Working : John Higgins of Capital Economics offers his analysis of why this is happening :
If policymakers think that adding extra liquidity is going to solve the credit crunch on its own , they are going to be sorely disappointed .
This is because upward pressure on interbank rates is a consequence , not a cause , of the crisis .
It is a shortfall of bank capital that has made financial institutions reluctant to lend to one another .
Boosting liquidity is therefore only a necessary , but not a sufficient , condition for stabilising the financial sector .
In fact , until banks are adequately recapitalised , funding pressures may even get worse .
This also explains why the markets ’ reaction to the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act ( EESA ) has been so lukewarm .
Bank capital will only get a lift from the $ 700 billion “ troubled asset relief program ” if the authorities overpay for the assets they buy . ”
He thinks the Fed will cut rates to 1 percent or lower , from 2 percent now .
1:50 p.m. | Depression ?:
Do you think a new depression is likely ?
CNN and Opinion Research are out with a new poll , taken over the weekend , which finds that about three of five adults think a depression is at least somewhat likely .
Here is the question :
As you may know , the U.S. went through a depression in the 1930s in which roughly one out of four workers were unemployed , banks failed across the country , and millions of ordinary Americans were temporarily homeless or unable to feed their families .
Do you think it is very likely , somewhat likely , not very likely , or not likely at all that another depression like that could occur in the U.S. ?
Very likely , 21 %
Somewhat likely , 38 %
Not very likely , 29 %
Not likely at all , 13 %
Another question : “ How would you rate the economic conditions in the country today — as very good , somewhat good , somewhat poor , or very poor ? ”
A majority , 53 percent , picked “ very poor , ” the worst choice offered .
Another 31 percent said “ somewhat poor . ”
That left just 16 percent — about one of six people — to say the economy was very good or somewhat good .
I ’ve never seen poll results that negative .
CNN says that the sampling error could be up to 4.5 percentage points , but these numbers are horrid even if you assume they overstate the gloom by more than that .
1:35 p.m. | World Recession ? :
The president of the World Bank , Robert Zoellick , is out today with a gloomy assessment of the effect of the financial crisis :
“ The events of September could be a tipping point for many developing countries .
A drop in exports , as well as capital inflow , will trigger a falloff in investments .
Deceleration of growth and deteriorating financing conditions , combined with monetary tightening , will trigger business failures and possibly banking emergencies .
Some countries will slip toward balance of payments crises .
As is always the case , the most poor are the most defenseless . ”
The state of the financial system is feeding over to economies around the world , reducing demand and threatening to produce deep recessions .
There is no way to know how much that is affecting the market , but it must be playing a part .
1:25 p.m. | Dick Fuld Talks : Dick Fuld , the chief executive of Lehman Brothers , was among the most self - confident executives I have ever known .
It must be killing him to have to sit through lectures by politicians , as is happening today .
I have n’t had the time to listen to all of the questioning , But when I tuned in , he was defending his decision to repurchase $ 10 billion in stock as the company faced what congressmen said was a liquidity crisis .
He denies he thought there was such a crisis .
“ At that time , at the end of the year , last year , I did not believe we had that problem , ” he said .
And , anyway , he had to do it to avoid diluting shareholders , as would have happened if the company had handed out stock to executives without repurchasing an equal number of shares .
Could n’t he admit that , with hindsight , that was a serious mistake ?
12:30 p.m. | Hanging the Crepe : Peter Morichi , an economist at the University of Maryland , is out with a verdict :
It ’s official !
The bank bailout has not worked .
That strikes me as premature , coming as it does before the Treasury has spent the first of those 700 billion dollars .
What would be more accurate to say is that trust in official promises is no higher than trust in bank balance sheets .
As they say in Missouri , Show Me .
Over in Europe , Silvio Berlusconi , the Italian prime minister , released a joint statement from no fewer than 27 member countries of the European Union saying they will “ take whatever measures are necessary to maintain the stability of the financial system . ”
It strikes me that is a hopeless task .
There is little stability left to maintain .
The Paulson plan is an effort to restore some stability .
Europe has yet to come up with anything similar , as can be seen in this updated version of the article I and colleagues wrote for today ’s paper .
11:45 a.m. | “ The Market Has Flopped ” : The Group of 30 , a group of former regulators and government officials , and current and former corporate chieftains , is out with a long report on financial regulation today .
It offers no conclusions , but is interesting in describing the weaknesses of all the systems used around the world .
At a news conference today , the people in charge of writing the report , Paul Volcker , a former Fed chairman , and Roger Ferguson , a former Fed vice chairman who now runs TIAA - CREF , a money management firm , along with the chairman of the Group , Jacob Frenkel , a former governor of the Bank of Israel and now , unfortunately , vice chairman of A.I.G. , had some interesting things to say .
Mr. Frenkel noted that “ things are highly contagious today , ” and that the old distinction regulators used , between solvency and liquidity , was badly blurred .
Mr. Ferguson observed that none of the financial regulatory systems had worked especially well , and that they would need to be restructured almost everywhere .
But he added that even the best regulation would not stop financial institutions from making mistakes .
The best lines , as usual , came from Mr. Volcker , the only living ex-Fed chairman who still has a good reputation for financial wisdom .
“ The Treasury has become the lender of last resort in the United States , which I think is appropriate , ” he said .
He noted that in Britain , with the most consolidated regulatory scheme , the Financial Services Authority still seemed to have trouble communicating with the Treasury and the Bank of England and that regulatory communication may have been better in the United States , despite its fragmented nature .
Mr. Volcker ’s skepticism of the new financial system has been well known for years , and was ignored by its biggest fan , Alan Greenspan , who succeeded Mr. Volcker at the Fed .
Mr. Volcker recalled the “ intense lobbying process ” that had largely allowed markets to supplant banks as providers of funding with minimal regulation .
“ In the U.S. , the market took over , ” he said .
“ The market has flopped . ”
When things got tough , he added , “ everybody is running back to Mother , the commercial banking system . ”
11:30 a.m. | Why Pay Bank Dividends ?:
The Danish bank - rescue decision mentioned below should be considered by American regulators .
If ever a sector needed to hold on to its capital , it is the banking sector .
Why should they pay dividends or repurchase stock ?
Investors are not fooled .
Halting stock option programs may not be as good an idea .
But at least they should be changed to require that those cashing in options pay their own taxes , rather than have them withheld by the company in a transaction that amounts to a share repurchase .
And regulators ought to ban repricing of options , or issuance of new options to replace hopelessly out - of - the - money options .
The managements should not be rewarded for having driven their share prices down .
11:20 a.m. | Guarantee Everything : The Danes announced their bank rescue today , and it is interesting because it deals with the interbank lending market directly :
The government is going to guarantee all interbank loans as well as deposits .
“ The situation is regarded with great concern given the international market - failure where even healthy banks are having trouble getting access to liquidity .
This threatens financial stability in Denmark and if unadressed may cause significant disruptions to firms and households . ”
But the banks have reason to not be thrilled by this , or at least their managers and owners do :
“ The scheme will run for two years with the possibility of an extension if financial stability concerns necessitate its continuation .
The Parties stress that the banking industry must complement the safety by displaying a cautious approach and strengthening their balance sheets during the two year period .
Therefore , the safety net is combined with a ban on dividend payments and share repurchases by banks as well as new stock options for management .
Expiring stock option programmes must not be renewed or extended . ”
8:43 a.m. | The Fed Is Worried : Now the government is talking about financing companies directly .
If the banks and the markets cannot or will not do it , Uncle Sam will .
The Fed put out a statement this morning that said it would start paying interest on deposits and would increase the size of its Term Auction Facility auctions .
Both are ways of getting cash out to banks .
But the banks are not lending very much , and the commercial paper market is in danger of closing up as investors seek safety above everything .
So the Fed added :
In addition , the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department are consulting with market participants on ways to provide additional support for term unsecured funding markets .
The Fed added that it was prepared to do more “ as necessary to foster liquid money market conditions . ”
So we may soon have the government deciding which companies deserve short - term loans , and at what interest rates .
Does this remind anyone else of central planning systems ?
6:57 a.m. | Now What ?:
The scrambles in Europe last night do not seem to have impressed investors any more than Congressional passage of the bailout did .
As I write this , most European markets are down more than 5 percent for the day , after Asian markets closed with losses in the same range .
So what do the authorities do next ?
One possibility is for Henry M. Paulson Jr. , the Treasury secretary , to spend that $ 700 billion as fast as he can .
That would make it even more difficult for the Treasury to really evaluate what it was buying , and make eventual scandal more likely , but there is desperation in the air .
More likely is that the central banks will swing into action with the move they know best — cutting interest rates .
There could be a coordinated rate cut very soon , perhaps involving the Federal Reserve , the Bank of England , the European Central Bank and other central banks in Europe .
The Bank of Japan is charging only one - half of a percentage point , but maybe they would go along to provide a sense of worldwide unity .
Perhaps the Chinese would also join in .
The risk there is that it would not work , or at least not seem to work , and the chorus about “ pushing on a string ” would grow louder .
But I doubt the central banks will be able to stand by if the market carnage continues very long .
There is certainly enough economic weakness to justify action , and plunging commodity prices provide reasons to put aside inflation concerns .
It 's beyond pathetic that some critics are saying * BlackkKlansman * is Spike Lee 's greatest film .
It 's not even in the same universe as * Do the Right Thing * ...

Greens , Liberals tied in BC : multiple polls
In the last five polls released by the polling firms Ekos and Harris - Decima , the Greens have climbed precipitously in British Columbia which , when combined with the faltering Liberals , now places them in a statistical tie with the Liberals for the first time ever .
Still behind both the Tories and the New Democrats , the Greens nevertheless have very good reason to be happy whilst the Liberals have very good reason for concern .
Unfortunately for the Greens , however , this surge in support is not translating into any seats in BC in either the Paulitics arithmetic seat projection or the Paulitics geometric seat projection , however both do have them in several very strong second - place showing in BC .

The DNC hits McCain hard on gambling :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGq6UCIKEkM]
One reason this matters politically is summed up in a column today by David Brody at CBN.com ( “ Christian News 24/ 7 ” ) :
The DNC knows that McCain ’s so called penchant for gambling can hurt him among some social conservatives .
It may not play well with other strongly religious voters as well .
Indeed , the last thing McCain needs is another problem with the Evangelical base .
In this case , the gambling issue could most likely trump the lobbyist issue .
I mean it ’s not like he ’s playing the lottery or bingo or a quick 25 cents slot machine .
This is high stakes gambling we ’re talking about .
Then you throw in the lobbyist angle and you have a dangerous credibility issue .
Will voters buy it and will it stick ?
Does this bother you ?
McCain ’s got gambling issues : both his love for the tables and his lobbyists .
And , his wife made all her money from beer .
That ’s a tough combo for the evangelicals .
The conventional reason for investing in the stock market -- perhaps offered with a bit less confidence now that we 're in the midst of a stock market crash -- is , " It offers higher returns . "
But that gets us ahead of ourselves .
We can learn a lot by taking a couple of steps back and looking first at our financial goals .
Most people have a long list of financial goals , starting with things like paying the rent , putting food on the table , keeping the lights turned on , and so on .
Work your way down the list and you get to things like replacing the old car , buying a house , putting the kids through college , and ( sooner or later ) retiring .
Most people 's wants , if you list them all out like that , will exceed their expected lifetime earnings ( even before including the Ferrari , apartment in Paris , yacht , and private jet ) .
And that 's why people so automatically shoot for investments that offer the maximum returns -- outsized returns are their only hope of satisfying all their wants .
That thinking , though , leads people to make all sorts of poor choices .
As a thought experiment , imagine someone whose wants could be comfortably satisfied by his or her income .
( Since wants tend to expand without limit , I admit this is a bit tricky , but give it a try . )
Such a person would n't need to invest at all ( beyond establishing an emergency fund ) .
In fact , investments would only make sense in the context of some particular goal -- leaving a legacy for example .
I 'd like to suggest that this is really true of everyone .
You just lead yourself astray if you line up all your wants on one side , and then create an aggressive portfolio on the other , hoping for some big wins to bridge the gap between your income and all the stuff you want .
Note that I 'm not suggesting that you target particular investments to specific goals -- that 's definitely the wrong approach .
Your entire investment portfolio supports all your goals .
Rather , the defect is in letting your wants grow without bound , putting you in a situation where the sum of your income and the return to ordinary saving still does n't add up to enough to satisfy them .
Now , it 's fine to have some out - of - reach desires .
( For example , I 'd like to have a private rail car , which although much cheaper than a private jet , is still likely to be forever beyond my means . )
The problem is letting them get out of control in a way that distorts your entire investment strategy .
My suggestion is that you classify your wants into the important ones and the unimportant ones -- and that the portion of your portfolio that 's going to fund the important ones needs to be conservatively invested .
Lots of people have made the point that the stock market is no place for money that you expect to need in the next 5 years .
The events of the past year suggest that maybe an even longer period is in order .
If you 're prepared to delay your retirement by 5 or 10 years in order to have a shot at retiring 5 or 10 years early , then an aggressive investment strategy may be in order .
The same sort of thinking is probably not appropriate for your college savings or the down payment on a new car .
Here are some thoughts on some specific categories of investments :
Cash is n't much of an investment -- but it 's what you actually need when you 're ready to spend .
Your emergency fund should be in cash ( money market fund , high - rate savings account , t- bills , etc. ) .
is n't much of an investment -- but it 's what you actually need when you 're ready to spend .
Your emergency fund should be in cash ( money market fund , high - rate savings account , t- bills , etc. ) .
Short - term bonds rarely yield much more than cash -- but they 're a good choice for money that you 're going to need at some particular time in the near future .
( For example , as your kid approaches high school , it might make sense to start moving his college savings into short - term bonds with maturity dates that match the tuition bills . )

There 's good reason to hope that your investment in gold will maintain its value , but little reason to hope that it will grow in value .

Still , do n't expect a return from gold that will fund any of those wants on your list . )

If you 've got a 10 - year time horizon , stocks are a good choice .
Real estate is another classic investment , but be careful not to delude yourself .
As an investment , your home is worth whatever it lets you avoid paying in rent .
Properties that you rent out are definitely investments -- but being a landlord is as much like having a second job as it is like owning an investment like stocks or bonds .
To answer the question I started with , the reason to invest in stocks to earn a higher return is that it lets you satisfy wants that you could n't otherwise afford .
But those higher returns come with higher risks -- risks that mean that maybe those wants wo n't be satisfied at all .
As recent events have made clear , the average return for the stock market may be higher than the average return of most other investments -- but that does n't mean that you can plug the average return into your plans and have any expectation that you 'll get that return in any particular year .
Even if you have a long time horizon , stocks may be down right when you 're ready to spend the money .
I guess you do n't need me to tell you that .
Do some thinking about your wants .
A shot at high returns in the stock market makes good sense for funding some of your wants -- especially the less important ones ( the sports car ) and the longer - term ones ( early retirement ) .
But for the important ones , and the ones with shorter time horizons -- arrange to cover those without relying on outsized investment returns .

This summer I attended a weekend seminar sponsored by Auburn University on the subject of World War I literature .
I did not know what to expect in regard to any antiwar literature but I was very surprised to be introduced to what I now believe to be the best antiwar novel and movie .
William March is the author of this novel Company K and the movie goes by the same name .
My favorite antiwar novel and movie prior to this was All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich M. Remarque , a German soldier who fought in the trenches during World War I .
March wrote about his similar experiences as an American Marine in the same trenches .
Both authors speak of the horror and brutality of the experience of modern warfare and nothing about individual bravery , patriotism or the " glory of war . "
The real name of William March was William Edward Campbell , who was born in Mobile , Alabama and grew up in small towns in Alabama and the Florida Panhandle .
He attended the University of Alabama School of Law and worked for a law firm in New York City .
When America entered WWI he enlisted in the Marine Corps and saw extensive action in the hardest , bloodiest battles , including Verdun and the Meuse - Argonne .
He was highly honored and decorated by both the French and the Americans by being awarded the French Croix de Guerre and by America , with the Distinguished Service Cross and the Navy Cross .
He makes no reference in the book to his individual actions or honors .
After the war , March returned to Mobile , Alabama and became one of the organizers and a shareholder in what became an extremely successful business by the name of Waterman Steamship Corporation .
He served as its vice - president and eventually became very wealthy as a result of his investment .
He resigned early and began to travel widely in Europe , especially to Hamburg and London , and then returned to New York City to write his first novel , Company K which was published in 1933 .
He wrote several other novels including Come in at the Door , The Tallons , and The Looking Glass .
He finally returned to the South , living in the French Quarter of New Orleans , where he wrote his final novel , The Bad Seed .
It was later made into a play and then a Hollywood movie , which brought him some notoriety .
This last novel is about an eight - year - old girl who does not know right from wrong and becomes a murderer .
March died in his sleep in 1954 at the age of 61 .
Company K had apparently been out of print for several years when director and producer , Roger Clem , who is mainly known for his documentary films , made the movie in 2004 , with an excellent cast , and can be rented from Netflix .
The movie faithfully captures the essence and meaning of the novel about the futility and brutality of war , and especially the psychological scars left on the soldiers .
In 2006 , the University of Alabama Press reprinted the novel .
Writer and literary critic , Alistair Cooke has described March as " the unrecognized genius of our time . "
March tells the stories of 137 members of Company K in the first person , some describing contemporary events , some recounting the war long afterwards , and some speak from the grave .
A brilliant introduction is provided by Phillip D. Beidler , a professor of English at the University of Alabama .
He describes the book as " . . . the most furious novel of war ever written by an American up to its time and quite arguably at least as furious and graphic as any written since . "
Beidler goes on to say :
So throughout Company K , the narratives of individual soldiers become a litany of callousness , brutality , and degradation .
This is most clearly reflected in a single incident lodged both literally and figuratively at the center of the book , something that might be thought of as the novel ’s primal scene : the execution of twenty - two German prisoners .
The order , as a series of narratives tell us , is passed down from Captain to Sergeant to the Corporal who leads the detail .
Otherwise good and decent men recoil , yet now participate in mass murder .
Private Walter Drury , the one soldier who refuses the order and runs is subsequently sentenced to twenty years in prison .
( 128 — 129 ) His friend , Private Charles Gordon , remains , and , as he fires , sees the enormity of the deed in all the fullness of its awful truth .
" Everything I was ever taught to believe about mercy , justice and virtue is a lie , " he thinks .
" But the biggest lie of all are the words , u2018 God is Love . ’
That is really the most terrible lie that man ever thought of . "
( 130 — 132 ) Meanwhile , the thing done , Private Roger Inabinett rummages nonchalantly among the bodies for valuables and souvenirs .
On Sunday , we are told by Private Howard Nettleton , they are all ordered to go to church .
( 138 — 139 )
Professor Beidler also states :
As with Hemingway , mixed with the violence and the brutalization , there is some talk of loss of illusion , of betrayal through patriotic lies .
Yet in March , more than in any of his contemporaries , this too is ultimately subsumed into a depth of horror that goes far beyond any Lost Generation conceit .
Here , individual soldiers come relentlessly forward , one after the other , the living and the dead commingled , to offer grim first - person testimony ; and in narrative after narrative , there is mainly just one fundamental fact of modern warfare : the fact of violent , ugly , obscene death .
Men die of gas , gunshot , grenade .
They die by the bayonet .
They are literally disintegrated by high explosive .
They commit suicide .
They murder prisoners .
They murder each other .
They kill wantonly and at random , at times in error and virtually always against whatever small portion they can recall of their better instincts .
Killing and dying , dying and killing , they have lost touch with any fact of life save the fact of death ’s absolute dominion .
This final reality March insists on to the degree that he often seems to have less in common with his fellow Americans than with his British poet - contemporaries such as Wilfred Owen , Robert Graves , and Seigfried Sassoon .
And , as with the latter , the death depicted is never gallant sacrifice .
It is not grand , valorous , brave death .
It is bowel - ripping , head - shattering , body - rending death .
It is the kind of death that makes men scream for their mothers , soil their trousers , dissolve themselves into whimpering wrecks .
Moreover , it is death on the whole vast scale of modern mechanization .
Beidler concludes , " In sum , a novel formed again , as with Company K , from a collocation of individual fragments , becomes a vast , enormous testament to the utter insignificance of individuality in a world of modern , mass - production war . "
Even though , William March ( William Edward Campbell ) , after the war became a very successful and wealthy businessman and a brilliant novelist , he suffered terribly for the rest of his life from what we now call " post - traumatic stress " or severe depression , nightmares , hysterical reactions related to his throat and eyes and required frequent psychiatric assistance .
This book is written by a soldier who experienced the greatest horror in protracted and intense combat , unlike the writer , Stephen Crane , who experienced no combat , yet wrote the excellent book about war realism , The Red Badge of Courage .
This American classic about the Civil War that has been read and studied by generations of readers , however , is not the more brilliant and disturbing antiwar novel Crane originally wrote .
It is now known that the original publication in 1895 was altered by the publisher , D. Appleton and Co. of New York , by making many deletions , including an entire chapter to present a less realistic picture of war so as to be more acceptable to the readers of the time .
Ernest Hemingway , who only experienced about six days of combat as a Red Cross ambulance driver still wrote a widely acclaimed novel , A Farewell to Arms .
Some critics say Hemingway suffered more psychological trauma from being rejected by the nurse who cared for him in the hospital and became his girlfriend and then left him for an Italian officer , than from the wounds received in combat .
Other literary critics say
" . . . his description of the German attack on Caporetto — of lines of tired men marching in the rain , hungry , weary , and demoralized — is one of the greatest moments in literary history . "
When you read the stories told by March however , and see them depicted in the movie , you can feel the passion and experience the horrible pain of someone who had actually been there and suffered through it all for a long period of time .
In Company K March portrays himself as Private Joseph Delaney , who writes a book after the war and explains to his wife the reason for writing it :
I wish there were some way to take these stories and pin them to a large wheel , each story hung on a different peg until the circle was completed .
Then I would like to spin the wheel , faster and faster , until the things of which I have written took life and were recreated , and became part of the wheel , flowing toward each other , and into each other , blurring and then blending together into a composite whole , and unending circle of pain . . . .
That would be the picture of war .
And the sound that the wheel made , and the sound that the men themselves made as they laughed , cried , cursed or prayed , would be , against the falling of walls , the rushing of bullets , the exploding of shells , the sound that war , itself , makes . . .
The book and movie Company K are highly recommended and hopefully will become widely known and understood in order to help stop the mindless , unnecessary foreign wars and foreign policy America has engaged in for so long .
March recognizes that simply telling the horrors of war will not be enough .
It will also take a widespread understanding of the false reasons and premises used to get America into unjust , aggressive wars and knowledge of the real consequences of those wars , especially the loss of freedom which occurs whether you win or lose .
Unfortunately , March does not address the alleged reasons for the war , or America ’s entry into it , but he has one of the soldiers in the book state :
At first I used to listen to Les Yawfitz and that fellow Nallett argue in the bunk house .
They ’d been to college , and they could talk on any subject that came up .
But mostly they talked about war and how it was brought about by moneyed interests for its own selfish ends .
They laugh at the idea that idealism or love of country had anything to do with war .
It is brutal and degrading , they say , and fools who fight are pawns shoved about to serve the interest of others .
For a while I listened to them , and tried to argue the thing out in my mind .
Then I quit thinking about it .
If the things they say are really true , I do n’t want to know it .
I ’d go crazy and shoot myself , if I thought those things were true . . . .
Unless a man does feel like that , I ca n’t understand how he would be willing — how he would permit himself to —
So when they start talking now , I get up and leave the bunk house , or turn over to the wall and cover up my ears .
Regrettably , most Americans protect their comfort level by navely believing the patriotic political myths about all of our wars being just and for the defense of our freedom .
Most people do not want to be disturbed or shocked by the real truth concerning the horrors experienced by our soldiers in actual combat .
William March certainly addresses this last subject in Company K better than any other novel I ’ve read .

Explanation : Giant star forming region W5 is over 200 light - years across and about 6,500 light - years away in the constellation Cassiopeia .
W5 's sculpted clouds of cold gas and dust seem to form fantastic shapes in this impressive mosaic of infrared images from the Spitzer Space Telescope .
In fact , the area on the right includes the structures previously dubbed the Mountains of Creation .
New evidence indicates that successive generations of stars formed in the W5 region in an expanding pattern of triggered star formation .
The older , earlier generations of stars seem to cluster near the middle of the enormous cavities , with younger stars seen near the rims .
Winds and radiation from the older , central stars likely carve out and compress surrounding interstellar material , triggering the collapse that gave rise to younger , later generations of stars farther out .
In the false - color image , heated dust still within the cavities appears red , while the youngest stars are forming in the whitish areas .
W5 is also known as IC 1848 , and together with IC 1805 it is part of a complex region popularly dubbed the Heart and Soul Nebulae .
As process geometries are being driven hard by AMD 's primary competitor , Intel , it makes a good business case to outsource this effort with the likes of TSMC and others where the core competancy is solely focused on wafer fab process technologies and capitalization for equipment resources .
The WSJ reports , " Advanced Micro Devices Inc .
Tuesday is announcing a broad plan to cut costs by spinning off its manufacturing operations to a new joint venture , according to people familiar with the matter .
It looks like the rumored spin -off of AMD 's manufacturing operations is just hours away now and reports are starting to ping across the wire of a " significant announcement " that AMD CEO Dirk Meyer will be making shortly .
In fact , we 've been invited to a press web cast at 8 AM EST that AMD will hold in the morning .
Historically , AMD has taken largely an in - house fabrication model for their wafer fabrication .
However , capitalizing this effort is a huge recurring and perpetual investment that frankly only makes sense if there are significant and off - setting economies of scale .
As process geometries are being driven hard by AMD 's primary competitor , Intel , it makes a good business case to outsource this effort with the likes of TSMC and others where the core competancy is solely focused on wafer fab process technologies and capitalization for equipment resources .
The WSJ reports , " Advanced Micro Devices Inc .
Tuesday is announcing a broad plan to cut costs by spinning off its manufacturing operations to a new joint venture , according to people familiar with the matter .
The new venture , which will make chips for AMD and other companies , will take over facilities that include large AMD factories in Germany , with funding provided by investment entities associated with the government of Abu Dhabi , these people said .
They will contribute cash to the venture as well . "
The fact of the matter is most semiconductor manufacturers operate under an outsourced fabrication model like this and there is an excellent business case for the obvious cost efficiencies of not having to maintain your own fabrication lines and drive costly , bleeding - edge process technologies .
AMD will join the ranks of NVIDIA and many others with this new model , if it comes to pass ( which it certainly does look very likely ) .
With the current economic conditions , we think they 're definitely making the right move .
More details to come after our press webcast briefing tomorrow morning .
From AP :
Al - Qaida supporters suggested in a Web site message this week they would welcome a pre-election terror attack on the U.S. as a way to usher in a McCain presidency .
The message , posted Monday on the password - protected al - Hesbah Web site , said if al - Qaida wants to exhaust the United States militarily and economically , “ impetuous ” Republican presidential candidate Sen .
John McCain is the better choice because he is more likely to continue the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ This requires presence of an impetuous American leader such as McCain , who pledged to continue the war till the last American soldier , ” the message said .
“ Then , al - Qaida will have to support McCain in the coming elections so that he continues the failing march of his predecessor , Bush . ”
It is stories like this that make me weep for my country .
When people so low , so completely divested of a moral compass , can impact an election to the detriment of the whole nation .
John McCain knows only too well how these kind of sleazy , win - at - all - cost tactics work and should be the FIRST person to stand up and speak against them .
Key West resident Joelna Marcus received a phone call today .
She was asked if she is Jewish , and she replied in the affirmative .
She was asked if she was religious .
She was then asked if her opinion of Barack Obama would change if she knew that Obama had given lots and lots of money to the PLO .
There are no perjoratives strong enough to describe the kind of slimeball that would do this .
CONTRADICTORY ATTITUDES towards immigration are revealed in a new study which has found that a majority of Irish people believe society has “ reached its limits ” in accepting other races , religions and cultures .
“ Problems ” could arise if there was further immigration from people within these minority groupings , preliminary results of the survey indicate .
The analysis by sociologists from Mary Immaculate College ( Mary I ) and University of Limerick ( UL ) is based on a survey carried out late last year of people living in the west , midwest and south .
It was presented at this weekend ’s annual Sociological Association of Ireland conference in Galway .
Significantly , a majority of respondents had also agreed that it was a “ good thing ” for any society to be made up of people from different cultures and religions , the study by Amanda Haynes and Eoin Devereux ( UL ) and Michael Breen ( Mary I ) noted .
Some 86.6 per cent agreed with this thesis , compared with 74.4 per cent in a Eurobarometer study of 2003 .
Almost 70 per cent questioned also felt that diversity added to Ireland ’s strengths – a rise of over 10 per cent from a similar Eurobarometer question in 2003 .
However , almost 79 per cent felt that there was a “ limit ” to this , and just over 67 per cent felt that this limit had been reached .
This suggested that people may be giving “ politically correct ” answers to certain questions , the conference heard .
In an analysis of questions relating to myths and misinformation , the study found extreme “ lack of clarity ” among respondents about the difference between an asylum seeker and a refugee .
Only 15.4 per cent of the sample cited “ safety ” as a reason why people seek asylum here , with more than twice as many believing it was related to “ employment or social welfare ” .
Most respondents overestimated the number of asylum seekers who had come to Ireland the previous year , and nearly 40 per cent thought that the direct provision allowance was over € 100 a week .
Over 90 per cent of respondents believed reports about immigrants in the media , and the negativity of much of this coverage is reflected in reports of which respondents remembered details .
Also speaking at the conference , Claire Dorrity of University College Cork ( UCC ) said there was an urgent need for an “ ethnic - led ” umbrella group at national level to help influence policy .
Minorities also needed to be represented by members of their own ethnic group at political level to avoid misrepresentation .
Research on the Brazilian community in the south Galway town of Gort by Brian McGrath of NUI Galway found that a lot of people with undocumented status lived in fear and an “ informal economy ” worked on the basis of trust .
However , this can allow for exploitation .
Up to a third of the town ’s population is Brazilian , since the first small group arrived to work in the former Duffy meat plant almost 10 years ago .
A number of those interviewed in Portuguese for the research said that while strong family networks made it easier for more recent migrants to settle , a “ dominant majority ” from Goias in south central Brazil is seen as “ closed ” to those from other parts .
“ They do n’t pass the jobs . . . nobody wants to help the others , ” one interviewee said .
The arrival of more Brazilians in later years had eroded a sense of obligation to compatriots , and there were instances where jobs were being “ sold ” and where people were paying compatriots for basic language services and assistance .
Children of Brazilian migrants provided a key towards integration , and national policy should include far greater support for the school network in facilitating integration , said Mr McGrath .

No really .
At least according to Duncan Forgan at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Edinburgh .
The Drake equation famously calculates the number of advanced civilisations that should populate our galaxy right now .
The result is hugely sensitive to the assumptions you make about factors such as the number of planets that orbit a host star that are potentially habitable , how many of these actually develop life and what fraction of that goes onto become intelligent etc .
Disagreement ( ie general ignorance ) over these numbers leads to estimates of the number intelligent civilisations in our galaxy that range from 10 ^ - 5 to 10^6 .
In other words , your best bet is to pick a number , double it ….
So Forgan has attempted to inject a little more precision into the calculation .
His idea is to actually simulate many times over , the number of civilisations that may have appeared in a galaxy like ours using reasonable , modern estimates for the values in the Drake equation .
With these statistics you can calculate an average value and a standard deviation for the number of advanced civilisations in our galaxy .
Better still , it allows you to compare the results of different models of civilisation creation .
Horgan has clearly had some fun comparing three models :
i. panspermia : if life forms on one planet , it can spread to others in a system
ii .
the rare - life hypothesis : Earth - like planets are rare but life progresses pretty well on them when they occur
iii .
the tortoise and hare hypothesis : Earth - like plants are common but the steps towards civilisation are hard
And the results are :
i. panspermia predicts 37964.97 advanced civilisations in our galaxy with a standard deviation of 20 .
ii .
the rare life hypothesis predicts 361.2 advanced civilisations with an SD of 2
iii .
the tortoise and hare hypothesis predicts 31573.52 with an SD of 20 .
Those are fantastically precise numbers .
But before you start broadcasting to your newfound friends with a flashlight , it ’s worth considering their accuracy .
The results of simulations like this are no better than than the assumptions you make in developing them .
And these , of course , are based on our manifestly imperfect but rapidly improving knowledge of the heavens .
The real question is whether we ’ll ever have good enough data to plug in to a model like this to give us a decent answer , without actually discovering another intelligent civilisation .
And the answer to that is almost certainly not .

Plans Unveiled for Off - Grid Tidal - Powered Data Center in UK
October 20th , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
A major tidal power developer has confirmed it is in the early planning stages of developing an off - grid data center in Northern Scotland to be powered exclusively by tidal energy .
Atlantis Resources Corporation and Morgan Stanley said they are in the early stages of planning a tidal power project located in Scotland ’s Pentland Firth , reports BBC Scotland .
Pentland Firth separates the Orkney Islands from the Scottish mainland , and has huge potential tidal energy resources .
>> More on tidal power at CleanTechnica
“ Given that data centres need to be built somewhere , it makes sense to place them as close as possible to renewable energy sources that are currently grid - constrained , ” said John Woodley of Morgan Stanley ’s European and Asian power , gas and related businesses .
Morgan Stanley is aiming to attract customers such as Google , who have fast growing computing capacity needs .
Several companies interested in tidal energy at Pentland Firth
The straights in the Pentland Firth have tidal flows that reach speeds of up to 16 knots every day of the year — leading some to call it the Saudi Arabia of marine power .
The data center itself would require about 150 megawatts of power .
Officials have also said they ’d like to use the excess heat from the data center to warm greenhouses .
In August , the Crown Estate made the Pentland Firth the first UK marine site to be opened up for commercial scale development .
And as we previously reported at CleanTechnica , ScottishPower Renewables has designs on developing tidal energy at the Pentland Firth site .
But Atlantis ’ plan may give them a step - up on their competitors at ScottishPower by side - stepping one of the most substantial hurdles to installing any large - scale renewable energy project , and that is connecting to the national grid .
Atlantis says the first series of turbines would be operational in 2011 , at a projected cost between £ 250 m - £ 300 m ( US $ 400-600 million ) .
But the developers must still secure planning permission , another hurdle for renewable energy projects .
Projects a fraction the size of the Pentland Firth proposal , such as the Marine Current Turbine ’s SeaGen project took 13 years to gain regulatory approval .
Atlantis and other potential developers can apply for seabed leases beginning in January 2009 .
Leases will be awarded next summer .

Treasury Sec. Hank Paulson ’s $ 700 billion bailout plan now has a name : the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
But even as Capitol Hill debates TARP , few seem to have noticed the proposal item that puts taxpayers on the hook for future bailouts .
It ’s in Section 6 , and the key phrase is this : “ The Secretary ’s authority to purchase mortgage - related assets under this Act shall be limited to $ 700,000,000,000 outstanding at any one time . ”
What does “ at any one time ” actually mean to economists ?
It means that if everything we American taxpayers buy re-evaluates down to zero , we get to buy more .
That ’s hardly taxpayer “ protection . ”
With several hundred billion dollars of write - downs already announced this year by the part of the industry compelled to post their losses , it ’s a safe bet that $ 700 billion worth of the junkiest assets in existence will be heading to zero the second they are purchased .
But that ’s not all the bad news .
With Sunday ’s announcement that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have decided to become bank holding companies , the last pretense of respect for the Glass - Steagall was dropped .
The Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956 prevented bank holding companies from engaging in non-consumer oriented banking activities , like investment banking .
It also prohibited such entities headquartered in one state from acquiring banks in another state .
The interstate restrictions were gutted in 1994 , and the 1999 Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act took care of the rest .
At first this meant that commercial banks could buy investment banks and insurance companies , hence Citigroup ( which is a combination of Citibank , Travelers Insurance and Salomon Brothers investment bank ) , and the latest incarnation waiting to post lots of losses , Bank of America - Merrill Lynch .
But even with a new name , Goldman Sachs is still an investment bank , in the same way that a horse by another color is still a horse .
Changing its status to bank holding company will mean access to the bailout fund , and give it the ability to buy any commercial bank out there .
Which it likely will .
Nonetheless , that looming problem was n’t addressed by Congress Tuesday .
Instead , Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) responded to TARP with THOR ( Taxpayer Protection , Housing , Oversight and Regulation ) and warned , “ the financial system is clogged , and if we do n’t react the patient will suffer a heart attack .
So we must act and must act soon … ”
Somewhere , Former Treasury Secretary Carter Glass , the co-author of the Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 that separated speculative investment banks from consumer - oriented commercial ones , is turning in his grave .
As much press as the TARP vs. THOR discussion is getting , one voice of reason deserves more attention : Sen. Byron Dorgan’s .
As he has said , “ this proposal looks to me like a stampede in the wrong direction …to reward the very people on Wall Street who created this mess , and who pocketed more than $ 100 billion over the last several years making it . ”
In 1999 , Dorgan had the foresight to vote against the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act that repealed the financial protections put in place following the Great Depression .
He warned then that a ‘ financial swamp ’ would result from “ the casino - like prospect of merging banking with the speculative activity of real estate and securities , and that the bill will raise the likelihood of future massive taxpayer bailouts . ”
Dorgan was spot on .
Not only are we trapped in the complex deregulated financial system that resulted , but the bailouts are just beginning .
In advocating new protections similar to the Glass - Steagall Act and the need to address this crisis not just quickly , but correctly , he ’s likely spot on again .
If only the rest of Congress felt the same way .
We ’re getting lots of email about the election but this letter , sent by a reader in California , made me cry .
This year our son , who is now thirteen , came out to us .
Our son is gay .
We are fine with this .
The amazing thing about our boy is that he goes to school every day and lives his life true to himself .
He ’s a happy child .
He writes poetry .
He skips .
He ’s a track star .
He excels at algebra .
He loves the Stylistics .
He has a blinding smile .
Most of the kids at his school love him .
But some of the boys call him “ faggot . ”
Yesterday our usually sunny boy , all five - feet - four inches of him , came home staring at the ground , visibly upset .
Some of the boys at school were taunting him with cries of Yes on 8 , the California proposition aimed at eliminating the right to marry for those who want to marry another of the same gender .
The boys were punished by the school , but the damage was done .
Who are these followers of Jesus Christ who would tell my son , taken from his family at three , and homeless until he was nine , that he cannot marry and have a family of his own ?
Today my thirteen - year - old son joined me in the voting booth .
As I voted for Obama my son put his hand on top of mine .
He did the same thing when I voted no on Proposition 8 .
He was late for school , but I ca n’t think of a better reason .

“ There are so many incoming missiles that the president is really going to need help no matter how he structures his presidency , ” said Joel K. Goldstein , a law professor at St. Louis University and author of “ The Modern American Vice Presidency : The Transformation of a Political Institution . ”
“ Yes , we need to know whether the vice president is ready to occupy the highest office , can handle a crisis and be trusted with the nuclear codes .
But , equally important , do they have something to offer that will be meaningful in helping the next administration succeed ? ”
Mr. Goldstein said the ascendancy of the office began with Walter Mondale , who secured a central role as adviser .
Jimmy Carter gave him a West Wing office , an autonomous staff and access to all key meetings , perks that have gone to succeeding vice presidents .
Mr. Mondale said in an interview Friday that his role grew from talks he had with Mr. Carter before joining the ticket .
He did not want to run any program but to be a freelance adviser with only one client  the president .
“ I did n’t want to do something someone else is doing , but to help the president on big issues and stay up to speed to be of help when needed , ” he said .
Mr. Mondale said that Mr. Cheney took the office that he had modernized and “ really went off the rails , ” with blowups over wiretapping , torture and the leaking of the name of a C.I.A. employee , Valerie Plame .
“ This is a real issue that should have been debated last night , ” he said .
Mr. Cheney has said that a vice president ’s authority derives solely from the Constitution and his relationship with the president .
His spokeswoman , Lea Anne Foster , strongly denied that he had overstepped the law or Constitution in the performance of his duties .
Vice presidents after Mr. Mondale were given wider scope than those who came before .
President Clinton entrusted Al Gore with the chore of streamlining government and overseeing global warming policy .
He also carried a substantial foreign affairs portfolio .
Dan Quayle had a lesser role but kept the West Wing office and met regularly with the first President Bush .
He spent much of his time on goodwill missions , raising money and chairing panels on the economy and space .
Gets Booed at His Own Rally , During First Honorable Moment of His 2008 General Campaign ...
Brad Friedman Byon

As Josh Marshall notes , in his must - read take on the video clips at right from a McCain rally yesterday , it 's " Weird .
Sad. Surreal . "
" There 's something else to note too , " writes Marshall .
" Over the last 48 hours several name brand Republicans have come out and either chided or denounced McCain 's borderline incitement .
And given how taboo it is to level such criticism of your own nominee at this stage of the election you have to assume these criticisms were only the tip of the iceberg , with a far more intense and angry barrage of criticism voiced privately . "
" [ L ] look at the facial expressions .
McCain looks down as he says it and has the countenance of someone who been forced to tell someone else they 're sorry , " he continues .
" I get from his expression a sense of a man that is , in addition to all the other things he 's angry about , is frustrated or angry at the situation he 's gotten himself into .
But he has sown the wind and now he 's reaping the whirlwind . "

Lainojen ja kulutusluottojen vertailu
Suurempiin kertahankintoihin , kuten esimerkiksi auton tai veneen hankkimiseen , lomamatkaan tai kodin remontointiin tarkoitettua lainaa kutsutaan kulutusluotoksi .
Joskus kulutusluotosta käytetään myös termiä käyttöluotto .
Kulutusluottoihin kuuluu niin vakuudelliset kuin vakuudettomatkin lainat .
Laina - ajaltaan kulutusluotto on yleensä lyhytaikainen ( alle 5 vuotta ) ja sen koko on useimmiten joitakin tuhansia euroja .
Kulutusluottoa voi hakea pankeista sekä yksittäisiltä luotto- ja lainapalveluita tarjoavilta rahoitusalan yrityksiltä .
Pankit tarjoavat yleensä suurimmat kulutusluotot , joiden koko voi olla jopa 25 000 euroa .
Vuosikorko tämänkaltaisissa luotoissa on tyypillisesti yhdeksästä kolmeenkymmentä prosenttia , joskin korkeampiakin korkoa voidaan periä .
Luottojen hintoja voi verrata toisiinsa tarkastelemalla lainan todellista vuosikorkoa .
Todellinen vuosikorko sisältää koron lisäksi myös kaikki muut lainan kustannuksiin sisältyvät kulut , kuten kiinteät hoito- ja käsittelymaksut .
Koska kulutusluottoon ei useinkaan tarvita vakuutta , ovat sen korot esim .
asuntolainojen korkoja korkeammat .
Pieniin pikavippeihin verrattuna kulutusluotto puolestaan on usein huomattavasti edullisempi .
Kulutusluottohakemuksen pystyy nykypäivänä tekemään helposti Internetissä lähes jokaisen kuluttajille suunnattua rahoitusta tarjoavien yritysten verkkosivuilla .
Lainavertailu auttaa edullisimman kulutusluoton löytämisessä .
Markkinoilla on nykyisin lukematon määrä luotonantajia ja vielä suurempi määrä eri lainapalveluita .
Hinnoittelu ja lainojen ehdot ovat hyvin monenkirjavat .

Hello ,
I ’m sad to announce you Guy Decoux ’s death in the beginning of the month
of July 20008 .
He was 53 years old .
He died accidentally , intoxicated by
the smokes of the fire that took place during the night in his flat in
Louveciennes ( near Paris ) .
Guy Decoux was network and system admin at the Plant Genomics
Research Unit of INRA ( Agricultural Research labs , where he worked
since 1982 ) in Moulon ’s Farm ( Moulon ’s plateau [ 1 ] , in the south west
of Paris ) .
He was an Internet pioneer .
For example , he worked on Oraplex ,
one of the first Oracle to web gateways .
He deployed the first
website that gave access to an ACeDB [ 2 ] system by the end of 1993 .
He had worked on bioinformatic free software , like ProticDB [ 3 ] , a
plant proteomic database .
He was part of the generation of developers who switched from Perl
to Ruby in the 90s .
While his mastering of Perl was already great ,
his knowledge about Ruby was so deep and impressive that a lot of
Rubyists
would have been very happy to have the same one .
Guy contributed to
Dave T. ’ book , “ Programming Ruby ” .
Of course he polled for the
comp.lang.ruby and fr.comp.lang.ruby newsgroups creation .
He was maintaining some libraries like PL / Ruby [ 4 ] a procedural language
for PostgreSQL , bdb/bdb1 [ 5 ] bindings for Berkeley DB , bz2 [ 6 ]
bindings the libbzip2 compression library and MMap [ 7 ] class ,
a class for Memory - mapped files .
To my knowledge , he was the only french person to have commits right
to Ruby MRI source code .
I do n’t know if he was officially member
of the Ruby Core Team ( I do n’t know if there is an official Ruby Core
Team list ) .
I ’m not sure ‘ ts ’ ( what does ‘ ts ’ mean in his electronic address ? )
had ever been to RubyConf nor any Ruby conference .
Well I do n’t
know if there is a french Rubyist who ever meet him .
Was he mysterious
or secret ?
Maybe he was just reserved .
His colleagues described
Guy as reserved , kind , available , professional and technically
very competent .
His messages on Ruby - Core or Ruby - Talk , sometimes
with a bit of humor , show all that .
This is a loss for Ruby Community .
In the name of french association RubyFrance , I present my condolences
to Guy Decoux ’s family , his friends and his collegues .
– Jean -François .

Claim :
The removal of yellowcake uranium from Iraq in 2008 proved that Saddam Hussein had been trying to restart Iraq ’s nuclear program .
Status : False .
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , August 2008 ]
Uranium in Iraq ?
Uranium in Iraq ?
I wonder why this has n’t been on the evening news . . .
Secret U.S. mission hauls uranium from Iraq Last major stockpile from Saddam ’s nuclear efforts arrives in Canada http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25546334
Secret U.S. Mission Hauls Uranium From Iraq
On July 5 , 2008 , the Associated Press ( AP ) released a story titled : Secret U.S. mission hauls uranium from Iraq .
The opening paragraph is as follows :
The last major remnant of Saddam Hussein ’s nuclear program – a huge stockpile of concentrated natural uranium – reached a Canadian port Saturday to complete a secret U.S. operation that included a two week airlift from Baghdad and a ship voyage crossing two oceans .
See anything wrong with this picture ?
We have been hearing from the far - left for more than five years how , ‘ Bush lied . ’
Somehow , that slogan loses its credibility now that 550 metric tons of Saddam ’s yellowcake , used for nuclear weapon enrichment , has been discovered and shipped to Canada for its new use as nuclear energy .
It appears that American troops found the 550 metric tons of uranium in 2003 after invading Iraq .
They had to sit on this information and the uranium itself , for fear of terrorists attempting to steal it .
It was guarded and kept safe by our military in a 23,000 - acre site with large sand beams surrounding the site .
This is vindication for the Bush administration , having been attacked mercilessly by the liberal media and the far - left pundits on the blogosphere .
Now that it is proven that President Bush did not lie about Saddam ’s nuclear ambitions , one would think the mainstream media would report the story ?
Once the AP released the story , the mainstream media should have picked it up and broadcast it worldwide .
This never happened , due in large part I believe , to the fact that the mainstream media would have to admit they were wrong about Bush ’s war motives all along .
Thankfully , the AP got it right when it said , “ The removal of 550 metric tons of ‘ yellowcake ’ — the seed material for higher - grade nuclear enrichment — was a significant step toward closing the books on Saddam ’s nuclear legacy . ”
Closing the book on Saddam ’s nuclear legacy ?
Did Saddam have a nuclear legacy after all ?
I thought Bush lied ?
As it turns out , the people who lied were Joe Wilson and his wife .
Valerie Plame engaged in a clear case of nepotism and convinced the CIA to send her husband on a fact finding mission in February 2002 , seeking to determine if Saddam Hussein attempted to buy yellowcake from Niger .
The CIA and British intelligence believed Saddam contacted Niger for that purpose but needed proof .
During his trip to Niger , Wilson actually interviewed the former prime minister of Niger , Ibrahim Assane Mayaki .
Mayaki told Wilson that in June of 1999 , an Iraqi delegation expressed interest in ‘ expanding commercial relations ’ for the purposes of purchasing yellowcake .
Wilson chose to overlook Mayaki ’s remarks and reported to the CIA that there was no evidence of Hussein wanting to purchase yellowcake from Niger .
However , with British intelligence insisting the claim was true , President Bush used that same claim in his State of the Union address in January of 2003 .
Outraged by Bush ’s insistence that the claim was true , Wilson wrote an op-ed in the New York Times in the summer of 2003 slamming Bush .
Wilson did this in spite of the fact that Mayaki said Saddam did try to buy the yellowcake from Niger .
The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence disagreed with Wilson and supported Mayaki ’s claim .
This meant nothing to Wilson who was opposed to the Iraq war and thus had ulterior motives in covering up the prime minister ’s statements .
It was a simple tactic really .
If the far - left and their friends in the media could prove Bush lied about Hussein wanting to purchase yellowcake from Niger , it would undermine President Bush ’s credibility and give them more cause for asking what other ‘ lies ’ he may have told .
Yet , the real lie came from Wilson , who interpreted his own meaning from the prime minister ’s statements and concluded all by himself that the claim of Saddam attempting to purchase yellowcake was ‘ unequivocally wrong . ’
Curiously , the CIA sat on this information and did not inform the CIA Director , who sided with Bush on the yellowcake claim .
This was made public in a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report in July 2004 .
Valerie Plame also engaged in her own lie campaign by spreading the notion that the Bush administration ‘ outed ’ her as a CIA agent .
Never mind that it was Richard Armitage — no friend of the Bush administration — who leaked Plame ’s identity to the press .
Never mind that Plame had not been in the field as a CIA agent in some six years .
The truth is , due to their opposition to the war , Joe Wilson , Valerie Plame , the mainstream media and their left - wing friends on the blogosphere engaged in a propaganda campaign to undermine the Bush administration .
Now that Saddam ’s uranium has been made public and is no longer a threat to the world , do you think these aforementioned parties will apologize and admit they were wrong ?
Do n’t count on it .
The rest of the Ame ! rican people should hear the truth about Saddam ’s uranium .
It is up to you and me to inform them every chance we get .
As far as the anti-war crowd is concerned , the next time they say that , ‘ Bush lied , ’ we should tell them to , ‘ Have the yellowcake and eat it too . ’
Origins :
In 2001 , the government of Italy came into possession of documents that purportedly demonstrated Iraqi officials were attempting to buy uranium yellowcake from Niger ( yellowcake can be enriched in centrifuges to produce weapons - grade uranium ) , and the Italian government shared these documents with intelligence officials in the U.S. and U.K .
The CIA
dispatched former ambassador Joseph Wilson to Niger in February 2002 on an eight - day trip to that country to investigate ; later , on 6 July 2003 , Wilson wrote an op - ed piece published in the New York Times ( “ What I Did n’t Find in Africa ” ) charging that “ some of the intelligence related to Iraq ’s nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the Iraqi threat ” and criticizing the Bush administration for citing the yellowcake evidence as proof of a possible Iraqi nuclear threat and using this claim as a key element in persuading members of Congress to pass a resolution authorizing use of force against Iraq and in “ selling the war ” to the American public .
( In 2004 , a bipartisan Senate intelligence committee report challenged the claims Wilson made in his op - ed piece , saying that “ rather than debunking intelligence about purported uranium sales to Iraq , [ Wilson ’s report had ] bolstered the case for most intelligence analysts . ” )
Shortly after the publication of Wilson ’s op - ed piece , syndicated columnist Robert Novak revealed that Wilson ’s wife , Valerie Plame , was a CIA operative , information he said had been obtained from two senior administration officials .
Critics charged that the exposure of Valerie Plame ’s identity was a deliberate tit - for - tat retaliation orchestrated by the Bush administration that endangered lives ( including Plame ’s ) in order to punish Wilson for taking his disagreement with the White House public .
Both sides ( and their supporters ) accused the other of lying and double - dealing , and more than five years after the beginning of U.S. military involvement in Iraq , the “ Plame affair “ remains one of the more contentious political issues associated with that war .
Flash forward five years :
In July 2008 , the U.S. government announced that it had completed the secret removal of 550 metric tons of yellowcake from the Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center in Iraq , material which was sold and shipped to Cameco , a Canadian uranium producer .
The U.S. was anxious to transfer the yellowcake out of Iraq for a variety of safety concerns :
Although the material cannot be used in its current form for a nuclear weapon or even a so - called dirty bomb , officials decided that in Iraq ’s unstable environment , it was important to make sure it did not fall into the wrong hands .
Although the material cannot be used in its current form for a nuclear weapon or even adirty bomb , officials decided that in Iraq ’s unstable environment , it was important to make sure it did not fall into the wrong hands .
There are also health dangers associated with concentrated forms of natural uranium , and since little is secure in Iraq , officials wanted to remove it .
After the American invasion in 2003 , Tuwaitha was looted .
Barrels used to store the yellowcake were stolen and sold to local people , who used them to store water and food and to wash clothes , according to a report by the atomic energy agency .
The item reproduced in the example block above cites the July 2008 removal of yellowcake from Iraq as proof that Iraq had in fact been buying yellowcake in an attempt to restart its nuclear program ( and ultimately produce nuclear weapons ) before the U.S. invasion of March 2003 , and that therefore the Bush administration was right and Joseph Wilson was wrong .
However , that claim is erroneous .
The yellowcake removed from Iraq in 2008 was material that had long since been identified , documented , and stored in sealed containers under the supervision of U.N. inspectors .
It was not a “ secret ” cache that was recently “ discovered ” by the U.S , nor had the yellowcake been purchased by Iraq in the years immediately preceding the 2003 invasion .
The uranium was the remnants of decades - old nuclear reactor projects that had put out of commission many years earlier :
One reactor at Al Tuwaitha was bombed by Israel in 1981 , and another was bombed and disabled during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 .
Moreover , the fact that the yellowcake had been in Iraq since before the 1991 Gulf War was plainly stated in the Associated Press article cited in the example above :
Tuwaitha and an adjacent research facility were well known for decades as the centerpiece of Saddam ’s nuclear efforts .
Tuwaitha and an adjacent research facility were well known for decades as the centerpiece of Saddam ’s nuclear efforts .
Israeli warplanes bombed a reactor project at the site in 1981 .
Later , U.N. inspectors documented and safeguarded the yellowcake , which had been stored in aging drums and containers since before the 1991 Gulf War .
There was no evidence of any yellowcake dating from after 1991 , the official said .
Or , as the New York Times stated more plainly :
The yellowcake removed from Iraq was not the same yellowcake that President Bush claimed , in a now discredited section of his 2003 State of the Union address , that Mr. Hussein was trying to purchase in Africa .
What happened was that U.S. Marines stumbled across known stocks of uranium stored beneath the Tuwaitha nuclear research center , stocks that were not suitable for use in atomic weapons and had long since been cataloged , stored in sealed containers , and safeguarded by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , stored at a site that had been repeatedly surveyed by U.N. inspectors :
American troops who suggested they uncovered evidence of an active nuclear weapons program in Iraq unwittingly may have stumbled across known stocks of low - grade uranium , officials said .
They said the U.S. troops may have broken U.N. seals meant to keep control of the radioactive material .
American troops who suggested they uncovered evidence of an active nuclear weapons program in Iraq unwittingly may have stumbled across known stocks of low - grade uranium , officials said .
They said the U.S. troops may have broken U.N. seals meant to keep control of the radioactive material .
The Vienna - based International Atomic Energy Agency , which has inspected the Tuwaitha nuclear complex at least two dozen times and maintains a thick dossier on the site , had no immediate comment .
But an expert familiar with U.N. nuclear inspections told The Associated Press that it was implausible to believe that U.S. forces had uncovered anything new at the site .
Instead , the official said , the Marines apparently broke U.N. seals designed to ensure the materials are n’t diverted for weapons use or end up in the wrong hands .
“ What happened apparently was that they broke IAEA seals , which is very unfortunate because those seals are integral to ensuring that nuclear material does n’t get diverted , ” the expert said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
Several tons of low - grade uranium has been stored at Tuwaitha , Iraq ’s principal nuclear research center and a site that has been under IAEA safeguards for years , the official said .
The Iraqis were allowed to keep the material because it was unfit for weapons use without costly and time - consuming enrichment .
The uranium was inspected by the U.N. nuclear agency twice a year and was kept under IAEA seal at least until the Marines seized control of the site .
The U.N. nuclear agency ’s inspectors have visited Tuwaitha about two dozen times , including a dozen checks carried out since December , most recently on Feb .
6 . It was among the first sites that IAEA inspectors sought out after the resumption of inspections on Nov. 27 after a nearly four - year break .
The U.S. did manage to ameliorate a substantial security concern by secretly shipping stored yellowcake out of Iraq in mid-2008 , but that act was not , as claimed above , proof that Iraq had been purchasing uranium and attempting to restart its nuclear program prior to the U.S. invasion .

Google Netherlands has agreed to hand over the IP addresses of a Gmail user in an alleged spy case .
The CEO of Dutch internet incubator company iMerge suspected that a former disgruntled employee , who also acted as a system administrator , had secretly created an auto - forward rule in one of the company 's mail servers .
Several mails , including business conversations and a romantic discourse which led to a divorce , were forwarded to a Gmail address .
Because Gmail does n't reveal someone 's IP address in outgoing mail headers , iMerge could n't take legal action against the former employee .
Google initially declined to provide iMerge with requested IP addresses on the grounds that " disclosing the user 's identity violated rulings on the balance between freedom of expression and a person 's right to his reputation . "
However , a Dutch court believed the offence was serious enough and forced Google to reveal all the log files it had on the account .
Immediately after the ruling , Google provided the required data , including a list of IP addresses .
Last year , Google would not hand over the IP address of an anonymous blogger who slandered Shaarei Tikva councilmen .
When a Israeli judge ruled that the blog 's content raised suspicions of criminal conduct , Google rolled over .
In July , Google was told cough up the personal data of every person who has ever watched a Viacom video on the YouTube website as part of a billion - dollar court case .
Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) called the ruling a " set - back to privacy rights . " ®

IN “ W. ” , his biopic about his Yale classmate , Oliver Stone details Colin Powell 's agonies during George Bush 's first term .
Throughout the film Mr Powell repeatedly raises doubts about the invasion of Iraq — and is repeatedly overruled by the ghoulish trio of Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld and Karl Rove .
In one of the final scenes , with his direst warnings proving correct , Mr Powell turns to Mr Cheney and delivers a heartfelt “ Fuck you ” .
The real Colin Powell used more diplomatic language in endorsing Barack Obama on October 19th , but the impact was much the same .
Mr Obama is a “ transformational figure ” , he mildly said , and his old friend John McCain had erred in choosing a neophyte as a running - mate .
But you would have to be naive not to see the endorsement as a verdict on the Bush years .
Mr Powell is now a four - star general in America 's most surprising new army : the Obamacons .
The army includes other big names such as Susan Eisenhower , Dwight 's granddaughter , who introduced Mr Obama at the Democratic National Convention and Christopher Buckley , the son of the conservative icon William Buckley , who complains that he has not left the Republican Party : the Republican Party has left him .
Chuck Hagel , a Republican senator from Nebraska and one - time bosom buddy of Mr McCain has also flirted heavily with the movement , though he has refrained from issuing an official endorsement .
The biggest brigade in the Obamacon army consists of libertarians , furious with Mr Bush 's big - government conservatism , worried about his commitment to an open - ended “ war on terror ” , and disgusted by his cavalier way with civil rights .
There are two competing “ libertarians for Obama ” web sites .
CaféPress is even offering a “ libertarian for Obama ” lawn sign for $ 19.95 .
Larry Hunter , who helped to devise Newt Gingrich 's Contract with America in 1994 , thinks that Mr Obama can free America from the grip of the “ zombies ” who now run the Republican Party .
But the army has many other brigades , too : repentant neocons such as Francis Fukuyama , legal scholars such as Douglas Kmiec , and conservative talk - show hosts such as Michael Smerconish .
And it is picking up unexpected new recruits as the campaign approaches its denouement .
Many disillusioned Republicans hoped that Mr McCain would provide a compass for a party that has lost its way , but now feel that the compass has gone haywire .
Kenneth Adelman , who once described the invasion of Iraq as a “ cakewalk ” , decided this week to vote for Mr Obama mainly because he regards Sarah Palin as “ not close to being acceptable in high office ” .
The rise of the Obamacons is more than a reaction against Mr Bush 's remodelling of the Republican Party and Mr McCain 's desperation : there were plenty of disillusioned Republicans in 2004 who did not warm to John Kerry .
It is also a positive verdict on Mr Obama .
For many conservatives , Mr Obama embodies qualities that their party has abandoned : pragmatism , competence and respect for the head rather than the heart .
Mr Obama 's calm and collected response to the turmoil on Wall Street contrasted sharply with Mr McCain 's grandstanding .
Much of Mr Obama 's rhetoric is strikingly conservative , even Reaganesque .
He preaches the virtues of personal responsibility and family values , and practises them too .
He talks in uplifting terms about the promise of American life .
His story also appeals to conservatives : it holds the possibility of freeing America from its racial demons , proving that the country is a race - blind meritocracy and , in the process , bankrupting a race - grievance industry that has produced the likes of Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton .
How much do these Obamacons matter ?
More than Mr McCain would like to think .
The Obamacons are manifestations of a deeper turmoil in the Republican rank - and - file , as the old coalition of small - government activists , social conservatives and business Republicans falls apart .
They also influence opinion .
This is obvious in the case of Mr Powell : Mr Obama is making liberal use of his endorsement to refute the latest Republican criticism that he is a “ socialist ” .
But it is also true of lesser - known scribblers .
At least 27 newspapers that backed Mr Bush in 2004 have endorsed Mr Obama .
Moreover , the revolt of the intellectuals is coinciding with a migration of culturally conservative voters — particularly white working - class voters — into Obamaland .
Mr Obama is now level - pegging or leading among swing - groups such as Catholics and working - class whites .
A recent Washington Post - ABC poll shows him winning 22 % of self - described conservatives , a higher proportion than any Democratic nominee since 1980 .
Do n't blame the rats
The more tantalising question is whether the rise of the Obamacons signals a lasting political realignment .
In 1980 the rise of the neocons — liberal intellectuals who abandoned a spineless Democratic Party — was reinforced by the birth of working class “ Reagan Democrats ” .
Is the Reagan revolution now going into reverse ?
There are reasons for scepticism .
Will libertarians really stick with “ Senator Government ” , as Mr McCain labelled Mr Obama in the best slip of the tongue of the campaign ?
Will economic conservatives cleave to a president who believes in “ spreading the wealth around ” ?
Much depends on how Mr Obama governs if he wins , and how the Republicans behave if they lose .
Mr Obama talks about creating an administration of all the talents .
He promises to take the cultural anxieties of Reagan Democrats seriously .
For their part , hard - core Republicans are handling their party 's travails abysmally , retreating into elite - bashing populism and denouncing the Obamacons as “ rats ” who are deserting a sinking ship .
If the Republican Party continues to think that the problem lies with the rats , rather than the seaworthiness of the ship , then the Obamacons are here to stay .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Tobacco companies manipulate the amount of menthol in cigarettes to make those first few puffs more palatable to young smokers , U.S. researchers said on Wednesday in a finding that could fuel support for more tobacco regulation .
Smokers take a cigarette break outside a government office building in Boston , Massachusetts May 5 , 2008 .

“ Menthol stimulates the cooling receptors in the lung and oral pharynx , ” said Dr. Gregory Connolly of the Harvard School of Public Health .
“ It makes smoking easier . ”
The study , published in the American Journal of Public Health , comes as the U.S. Congress considers legislation that would give the Food and Drug Administration broad authority to regulate tobacco .
Representatives of tobacco companies R.J. Reynolds , Philip Morris and Lorillard disputed the findings .
“ It would appear this report is simply an effort to push support for federal regulation of the tobacco industry , not a scientific review of the menthol category , ” said David Howard , a spokesman for R.J. Reynolds , a unit of Reynolds American Inc and maker of Camel and Kool cigarettes .
Lorillard Inc spokesman Michael Robinson said in a statement : “ The American public should view this report for what it is , a politically motivated lobbying tool . ”
Smoking is the biggest cause of preventable death in the United States , killing more than 400,000 people each year .
Menthol cigarette brands have been rising in popularity with adolescents and the highest use has been among younger , newer smokers .
A 2006 national survey found that 44 percent of smokers aged 12 to 17 reported using menthol cigarettes , as did 36 percent of smokers aged 18 to 24 .
Connolly and colleagues studied internal company research on menthol use released as part of a large tobacco settlement .
They also conducted independent laboratory tests and reviewed population studies on smoking trends .
According to the study , in 1987 R.J. Reynolds identified low menthol varieties as a new strategy to recruit new , young smokers .
“ First - time smoker reaction is generally negative , ” it said in a company document .
“ Initial negatives can be alleviated with a low level of menthol . ”
STARTING OUT MILD
Big tobacco makers in the United States agreed in 1998 to pay $ 206 billion to 46 states to help pay the costs of treating ailing smokers under a 25 - year master settlement .
The deal , which included restrictions on the advertising and marketing of tobacco , ended a long legal battle with the states .
Connolly said tobacco companies use mild menthol cigarettes to target younger smokers and stronger menthol flavors for established smokers .
“ Menthol helps the nicotine go down , ” Connolly said in a telephone interview but he added that too much menthol is hard for new smokers to tolerate .
Among the brands tested , the researchers found those with the greatest market growth among young adults -- Lorillard ’s Newport brand and Philip Morris USA ’s Marlboro Milds -- had the lowest menthol levels .
He said it was clear to him that tobacco companies “ are using an ingredient here to make nicotine addiction easier . ”
David Sylvia , a spokesman for Altria Group Inc ’s Philip Morris unit , disputed that the company manipulates menthol levels to gain market share among adolescents .
“ There is very little direct relevant data that shows menthol affects initiation , ” Sylvia said , adding the products “ were not designed for nor marketed to underage smokers . ”
He said Philip Morris supports FDA regulation of tobacco .
Lorillard , which opposes the legislation , also rejected the idea that the company targets youth smokers .
“ Lorillard does not engineer any of its cigarettes to promote smoking initiation or nicotine addiction , ” Robinson said .
According to the American Lung Association , each day 4,000 children under 18 smoke their first cigarette and almost 1,100 of them will become regular smokers .
Connolly said the findings underscore the need for tobacco regulation by the FDA .
The bill before the House of Representatives prohibits fruit - and candy - flavored cigarettes but exempts menthol from an immediate ban .
But Connolly said the bill would grant the FDA the power to regulate menthol levels .
The lack of a specific ban on menthol has led the National African American Tobacco Prevention Network to withdraw its support for the bill , claiming it is incomplete and discriminates against blacks .
More than 70 percent of black smokers in the United States use menthol cigarettes , compared with about 30 percent of white smokers , the researchers said .
The Campaign for Tobacco - Free Kids said in a statement the study shows how a lack of tobacco regulation allows companies to manipulate their products in harmful ways .
With Republican John McCain edging ahead of Democrat Barack Obama in the latest polls , the two candidates are now locked in a bitter political fight over a core issue : who can best claim the mantle of change .
Obama , who founded his campaign on a pledge to reform Washington , on Friday unleashed new TV advertisements , revised his stump speech and released a strategy memo that all challenge McCain ’s efforts to cast himself as a maverick and reformer who can bring change .
McCain vowed in a TV interview to appoint Democrats and independents to his administration if elected .
His campaign also unveiled an ad that promises , “ Change is coming , ” the cry McCain has adopted since he accepted his party ’s nomination Sept.
4 .
The latest back - and - forth highlighted the fact that both campaigns believe that whoever can make the best case for changing Washington will win the White House .
Rather than the economy , Iraq or other specific issues , “ change ” has become the most heated subject of debate as the race enters its final seven weeks .

McCain ’s shift has been most dramatic since he chose Sarah Palin , the little - known governor of Alaska , as his running mate two weeks ago .
Since then , he has largely abandoned his long - standing claim that his 26 years of experience in Congress was his chief qualification for the Oval Office .
Instead , McCain is breaking new ground in presidential politics by essentially bashing his own party , as well as his opponent , as he casts himself as someone who can change the way Washington does business .
Experts say no candidate in memory has worked so hard to disassociate himself from the party he now leads as presidential standard - bearer .
In speeches and printed handouts , McCain rarely even identifies himself as a Republican .
His advertising goes further .
A TV ad launched last week in Ohio and other battleground states suggests that McCain and Palin are at war with their own party .
“ He battled Republicans and reformed Washington , ” the announcer intones .
“ She battled Republicans and reformed Alaska . ”

In his new TV ads and in campaign events Friday , Obama struck back by insisting McCain represents “ more of the same ” as President Bush , and he ridiculed McCain ’s claims that he is not a traditional Republican .
“ John McCain ’s economic policies are identical to George Bush ’s .
His tax policies are identical to George Bush ’s .
His education policy , which is essentially nothing except arguing for vouchers -- identical to George Bush ’s , ” Obama , a first - term Illinois senator , told a rally of about 1,500 people in Concord , N.H .
“ John McCain has not broken with his party .
He is not offering anything different than what we ’ve seen out of George Bush for the last eight years .
“ Change has to be more than a slogan , ” Obama says to the camera in one new ad .

Obama ’s aides said privately that they will try to ignore Palin , a public sensation who has helped reinvigorate McCain ’s campaign , and that they expect her high profile to diminish as her novelty wears off .
They hope to refocus voters ’ attention on McCain ’s record of voting to support Bush administration policies .
For now , McCain ’s recasting of himself as the agent of change appears to be paying off .
According to the latest Gallup survey , 54 % of Americans believe McCain would be effective in changing the way things are done in Washington -- close to the 61 % who believe that about Obama .
McCain “ has been saddled with the scarlet letter R , " for Republican , said Larry Sabato , director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia .
“ He ’s trying to change the scarlet letter to an I .
He ’s trying to run as an independent . ”
The senator from Arizona has a record of sometimes criticizing his own party and reaching out to Democrats on issues such as immigration and campaign finance reform .
And candidates for national office often lambaste Washington even as they seek to move or extend their stay there .

But McCain ’s fervent attempt to carve a new public image goes deeper , analysts say .
When he accepted the Republican presidential nomination in St. Paul , Minn. , he avoided uttering the name of the current , unpopular White House occupant .
But Bush got off easy compared with his party .
“ We lost the trust of the American people when some Republicans gave in to the temptation of corruption , ” McCain declared .
Some GOP veterans warn that McCain risks going too far and alienating the grass - roots Republicans he needs to lick envelopes , knock on doors and get out the vote on election day .

“ He ’s walking a tightrope there , ” said Stuart Spencer , a former advisor to President Reagan , citing McCain ’s party - bashing convention speech .
But he added : “ Part of the Democratic position is they ’re going to tie him to Bush , and he ’s got to untie himself .
This is one way of doing it . ”
Don Sipple , another veteran Republican strategist , called the tactic “ kind of dicey , ” given McCain ’s long tenure in Washington .
Other presidential nominees have chided their own party or railed against its excesses , “ but McCain has clearly distanced himself ” more than previous candidates , said Alan Brinkley , a historian and presidential scholar at Columbia University .
In 1968 , Democrat Hubert H. Humphrey , then vice president , publicly broke with President Johnson by calling late in the campaign for an end to the bombing of North Vietnam .
But he lost to Richard M. Nixon .
In 1976 , Republican President Ford could not escape the Watergate taint of the disgraced Nixon White House in which he served as vice president , and he lost to Jimmy Carter .

In 1992 , Bill Clinton successfully ran as a “ different kind of Democrat , ” one who occasionally would criticize his own party , but still a Democrat .
Ken Khachigian , another Republican operative , said he did n’t anticipate a backlash from party regulars .
“ I think the party ’s smelling victory , and to the extent that he ’s found a way to get there , I ’m not so sure they ’re going to be bothered by it , ” he said .
“ Victory is a great unifier , believe me . ”

Hi guys and girls , this is the first and only guest post on my blog .
It 's written by Waldner from #awk on FreeNode IRC Network .
He works as a sysadmin and does shell scripting as a hobby .
Waldner will be happy to take any questions about the article .
You can ask them in the comments of this post or on IRC .
This article takes a look at ten tips , tricks and pitfalls in Awk programming language .
They are mostly taken from the discussions in #awk IRC channel .
Here they are :
Update : Mr. Waldner just notified me that he has improved the tips on being idiomatic .
See " Idiomatic Awk " on his website .
In this paragraph , we give some hints on how to write more idiomatic ( and usually shorter and more efficient ) awk programs .
Many awk programs you 're likely to encounter , especially short ones , make large use of these notions .
Suppose one wants to print all the lines in a file that match some pattern ( a kind of awk - grep , if you like ) .
A reasonable first shot is usually something like
awk '{if ( $ 0 ~ / pattern / ) print $ 0} '
That works , but there are a number of things to note .
The first thing to note is that it is not structured according to the awk 's definition of a program , which is
condition { actions }
Our program can clearly be rewritten using this form , since both the condition and the action are very clear here :
awk ' $ 0 ~ / pattern / { print $ 0} '
Our next step in the perfect awk - ification of this program is to note that / pattern / is the same as $ 0 ~ / pattern / .
That is , when awk sees a single regular expression used as an expression , it implicitly applies it to $ 0 , and returns success if there is a match .
Then we have :
awk '/ pattern / { print $ 0} '
Now , let 's turn our attention to the action part ( what 's inside braces ) .
print $ 0 is a redundant statement , since print alone , by default , prints $ 0 .
awk '/ pattern / { print} '
But now we note that , when it finds that a condition is true , and there are no associated actions , awk performs a default action that is ( you guessed it ) print ( which we already know is equivalent to print $ 0 ) .
Thus we can do this :
awk ' / pattern /'
Now we have reduced the initial program to its simplest ( and more idiomatic ) form .
In many cases , if all you want to do is print some lines , according to a condition , you can write awk programs composed only of a condition ( although complex ) :
awk ' ( NR%2 && / pattern / ) || ( ! ( NR%2 ) && / anotherpattern / ) '
That prints odd lines that match / pattern / , or even lines that match / anotherpattern / .
Naturally , if you do n't want to print $ 0 but instead do something else , then you 'll have to manually add a specific action to do what you want .
From the above , it follows that
awk 1 awk ' " a " ' # single quotes are important !
are both awk programs that just print their input unchanged .
Sometimes , you want to operate only on some lines of the input ( according to some condition ) , but also want to print all the lines , regardless of whether they were affected by your operation or not .
A typical example is a program like this :
awk ' {sub ( / pattern / , " foobar " )
}1 '
This tries to replace " pattern " with " foobar " .
Whether or not the substitution succeeds , the always - true condition " 1 " prints each line ( you could even use " 42 " , or " 19 " , or any other nonzero value if you want ; " 1 " is just what people traditionally use ) .
This results in a program that does the same job as sed 's / pattern / foobar / ' .
Here are some examples of typical awk idioms , using only conditions :
awk ' NR % 6 ' # prints all lines except those divisible by 6 awk ' NR > 5 ' # prints from line 6 onwards ( like tail -n +6 , or sed ' 1,5d ' ) awk ' $ 2 == " foo " ' # prints lines where the second field is " foo " awk ' NF >= 6 ' # prints lines with 6 or more fields awk ' / foo/ && / bar / ' # prints lines that match / foo / and / bar / , in any order awk ' / foo / && !/ bar / ' # prints lines that match / foo / but not / bar / awk ' / foo/ || / bar / ' # prints lines that match / foo / or / bar / ( like grep -e ' foo ' -e ' bar ' ) awk ' / foo / ,/ bar / ' # prints from line matching / foo / to line matching / bar / , inclusive awk ' NF ' # prints only nonempty lines ( or : removes empty lines , where NF==0 ) awk ' NF --' # removes last field and prints the line awk ' $ 0 = NR " " $ 0 ' # prepends line numbers ( assignments are valid in conditions )
Another construct that is often used in awk is as follows :
awk ' NR==FNR { # some actions ; next} # other condition {# other actions} ' file1 file2
This is used when processing two files .
When processing more than one file , awk reads each file sequentially , one after another , in the order they are specified on the command line .
The special variable NR stores the total number of input records read so far , regardless of how many files have been read .
The value of NR starts at 1 and always increases until the program terminates .
Another variable , FNR , stores the number of records read from the current file being processed .
The value of FNR starts from 1 , increases until the end of the current file , starts again from 1 as soon as the first line of the next file is read , and so on .
So , the condition " NR==FNR " is only true while awk is reading the first file .
Thus , in the program above , the actions indicated by " # some actions " are executed when awk is reading the first file ; the actions indicated by " # other actions " are executed when awk is reading the second file , if the condition in " # other condition " is met .
The " next " at the end of the first action block is needed to prevent the condition in " # other condition " from being evaluated , and the actions in " # other actions " from being executed while awk is reading the first file .
There are really many problems that involve two files that can be solved using this technique .
Here are some examples :
# prints lines that are both in file1 and file2 ( intersection ) awk ' NR==FNR { a [ $ 0 ] ; next} $ 0 in a ' file1 file2
Here we see another typical idiom : a [ $ 0 ] has the only purpose of creating the array element indexed by $ 0 .
During the pass over the first file , all the lines seen are remembered as indexes of the array a .
The pass over the second file just has to check whether each line being read exists as an index in the array a ( that 's what the condition $ 0 in a does ) .
If the condition is true , the line is printed ( as we already know ) .
Another example .
Suppose we have a data file like this
20081010 1123 xxx 20081011 1234 def 20081012 0933 xyz 20081013 0512 abc 20081013 0717 def ... thousand of lines ...
where " xxx " , " def " , etc. are operation codes .
We want to replace each operation code with its description .
We have another file that maps operation codes to human readable descriptions , like this :
abc withdrawal def payment xyz deposit xxx balance ... other codes ...
We can easily replace the opcodes in the data file with this simple awk program , that again uses the two - files idiom :
# use information from a map file to modify a data file awk ' NR==FNR { a [ $ 1 ] =$ 2 ; next} { $ 3 =a [ $ 3 ] }1 ' mapfile datafile
First , the array a , indexed by opcode , is populated with the human readable descriptions .
Then , it is used during the reading of the second file to do the replacements .
Each line of the datafile is then printed after the substitution has been made .
Another case where the two - files idiom is useful is when you have to read the same file twice , the first time to get some information that can be correctly defined only by reading the whole file , and the second time to process the file using that information .
For example , you want to replace each number in a list of numbers with its difference from the largest number in the list :
# replace each number with its difference from the maximum awk ' NR== FNR {if ( $ 0 > max ) max =$ 0 ; next} { $ 0 =max - $ 0}1 ' file file
Note that we specify " file file " on the command line , so the file will be read twice .
Caveat : all the programs that use the two - files idiom will not work correctly if the first file is empty ( in that case , awk will execute the actions associated to NR==FNR while reading the second file ) .
To correct that , you can reinforce the NR==FNR condition by adding a test that checks that also FILENAME equals ARGV [ 1 ] .
It 's not uncommon to see lines in scripts that look like this :
somecommand | head -n +1 | grep foo | sed 's / foo / bar / ' | tr ' [ a - z ] ' ' [ A - Z ] ' | cut -d ' ' -f 2
This is just an example .
In many cases , you can use awk to replace parts of the pipeline , or even all of it :
somecommand | awk ' NR > 1 && / foo /{sub ( / foo / , " bar " ) ; print toupper ( $ 2 ) } '
It would be nice to collect here many examples of pipelines that could be partially or completely eliminated using awk .
Yes , we all know that awk has builtin support for range expressions , like
# prints lines from / beginpat / to /endpat / , inclusive awk ' / beginpat/,/endpat / '
Sometimes however , we need a bit more flexibility .
We might want to print lines between two patterns , but excluding the patterns themselves .
Or only including one .
A way is to use these :
# prints lines from / beginpat / to /endpat / , not inclusive awk '/ beginpat/,/endpat/{if (!/beginpat/&&!/endpat/) print} '
# prints lines from / beginpat / to /endpat / , not including / beginpat / awk '/ beginpat/,/endpat/{if (!/beginpat/) print} '
It 's easy to see that there must be a better way to do that , and in fact there is .
We can use a flag to keep track of whether we are currently inside the interesting range or not , and print lines based on the value of the flag .
Let 's see how it 's done :
# prints lines from / beginpat / to /endpat / , not inclusive awk '/ endpat/{p=0};p;/beginpat/{p=1} '
# prints lines from / beginpat / to /endpat / , excluding /endpat / awk '/ endpat/{p=0} /beginpat/{p=1} p ' # prints lines from / beginpat / to /endpat / , excluding / beginpat / awk 'p ; /endpat/{p=0} /beginpat/{p=1} '
All these programs just set p to 1 when / beginpat / is seen , and set p to 0 when / endpat / is seen .
The crucial difference between them is where the bare " p " ( the condition that triggers the printing of lines ) is located .
Depending on its position ( at the beginning , in the middle , or at the end ) , different parts of the desired range are printed .
To print the complete range ( inclusive ) , you can just use the regular / beginpat / , / endpat / expression or use the flag technique , but reversing the order of the conditions and associated patterns :
# prints lines from / beginpat / to /endpat / , inclusive awk '/ beginpat/{p=1};p;/endpat/{p=0}'
It goes without saying that while we are only printing lines here , the important thing is that we have a way of selecting lines within a range , so you can of course do anything you want instead of printing .
Suppose we have a file like this
line1 line2 line3 line4 FOO1 line5 line6 FOO2 line7 line8 FOO3 line9 line10 line11 FOO4 line12 FOO5 line13
We want to split this file on all the occurrences of lines that match / ^FOO / , and create a series of files called , for example , out1 , out2 , etc .
File out1 will contain the first 4 lines , out2 will contain " line5 " and " line6 " , etc .
There are at least two ways to do that with awk :
# first way , works with all versions of awk awk - v n=1 '/ ^FOO [ 0 - 9 ] */{close ( " out " n ) ;n++; next} {print > " out " n} ' file
Since we do n't want to print anything when we see / ^FOO / , but only update some administrative data , we use the " next " statement to tell awk to immediately start processing the next record .
Lines that do not match / ^FOO / will instead be processed by the second block of code .
Note that this method will not create empty files if an empty section is found ( eg , if " FOO5
FOO6 " is found , the file " out5 " will not be created ) .
The " - v n=1 " is used to tell awk that the variable " n " should be initialized with a value of 1 , so effectively the first output file will be called " out1 " .
Another way ( which however needs GNU awk to work ) is to read one chunk of data at a time , and write that to its corresponding out file .
# another way , needs GNU awk LC_ALL=C gawk - v RS = ' FOO [ 0 - 9 ] *
' -v ORS= '{ print > " out " NR} ' file
The above code relies on the fact that GNU awk supports assigning a regular expression to RS ( the standard only allows a single literal character or an empty RS ) .
That way , awk reads a series of " records " , separated by the regular expression matching / FOO [ 0 - 9 ] *
/ ( that is , the whole FOO ... line ) .
Since newlines are preserved in each section , we set ORS to empty since we do n't want awk to add another newline at the end of a block .
This method does create an empty file if an empty section is encountered .
On the downside , it 's a bit fragile because it will produce incorrect results if the regex used as RS appears somewhere else in the rest of the input .
We will see other examples where gawk 's support for regexes as RS is useful .
Note that the last program used LC_ALL=C at the beginning ...
Sometimes awk can behave in an unexpected way if the locale is not C ( or POSIX , which should be the same ) .
See for example this input :
-rw-r--r-- 1 waldner users 46592 2003-09-12 09:41 file1 -rw-r--r-- 1 waldner users 11509 2008-10-07 17:42 file2 -rw-r--r-- 1 waldner users 11193 2008-10-07 17:41 file3 -rw-r--r-- 1 waldner users 19073 2008-10-07 17:45 file4 -rw-r--r-- 1 waldner users 36332 2008-10-07 17:03 file5 -rw-r--r-- 1 waldner users 33395 2008-10-07 16:53 file6 -rw-r--r-- 1 waldner users 54272 2008-09-18 16:20 file7 -rw-r--r-- 1 waldner users 20573 2008-10-07 17:50 file8
You 'll recognize the familiar output of ls -l here .
Let 's use a non-C locale , say , en_US.utf8 , and try an apparently innocuous operation like removing the first 3 fields .
$ LC_ALL=en_US.utf8 awk -- re-interval ' {sub ( /^( [ ^[ : space : ] ] +[ [ : space : ] ] + ) {3} / , " " ) }1 ' file - rw - r--r-- 1 waldner users 46592 2003-09-12 09:41 file1 -rw-r--r-- 1 waldner users 11509 2008-10-07 17:42 file2 -rw-r--r-- 1 waldner users 11193 2008-10-07 17:41 file3 -rw-r--r-- 1 waldner users 19073 2008-10-07 17:45 file4 -rw-r--r-- 1 waldner users 36332 2008-10-07 17:03 file5 -rw-r--r-- 1 waldner users 33395 2008-10-07 16:53 file6 -rw-r--r-- 1 waldner users 54272 2008-09-18 16:20 file7 -rw-r--r-- 1 waldner users 20573 2008-10-07 17:50 file8
It looks like sub ( ) did nothing .
Now change that to use the C locale :
$ LC_ALL=C awk -- re - interval ' {sub ( / ^( [ ^[ : space : ] ] +[ [ : space : ] ] + ) {3} / , " " ) }1 ' file users 46592 2003-09-12 09:41 file1 users 11509 2008-10-07 17:42 file2 users 11193 2008-10-07 17:41 file3 users 19073 2008-10-07 17:45 file4 users 36332 2008-10-07 17:03 file5 users 33395 2008-10-07 16:53 file6 users 54272 2008-09-18 16:20 file7 users 20573 2008-10-07 17:50 file8
Now it works .
Another localization issue is the behavior of bracket expressions matching , like for example [ a - z ] :
$ echo ' èòàù ' | LC_ALL=en_US.utf8 awk ' / [ a - z ] /' èòà ù
This may or may not be what you want .
When in doubt or when facing an apparently inexplicable result , try putting LC_ALL=C before your awk invocation .
Update : Mr. Waldner just notified me that he has improved this section of the article on his website .
See " CVS Parsing With Awk " .
This is another thing people do all the time with awk .
Simple CSV files ( with fields separated by commas , and commas cannot appear anywhere else ) are easily parsed using FS= ' , ' .
There can be spaces around fields , and we do n't want them , like eg
field1 , field2 , field3 , field4
Exploiting the fact that FS can be a regex , we could try something like FS ='^ | , | $ ' .
This can be problematic for two reasons :
actual data field might end up correponding either to awk 's fields 1 ... NF or 2 ... NF , depending on whether the line has leading spaces or not ;
for some reason , assigning that regex to FS produces unexpected results if fields have embedded spaces ( anybody knows why ? ) .
In this case , it 's probably better to parse using FS= ' , ' and remove leading and trailing spaces from each field :
# FS= ' , ' for ( i=1 ;i< =NF ;i++ ) { gsub ( /^ *| *$ / , " " , $ i ) ; print " Field " i " is " $ i ; }
Another common CSV format is
" field1 " , " field2 " , " field3 " , " field4 "
Assuming double quotes cannot occur in fields .
This is easily parsed using FS= ' ^ " | " , " | " $ ' ( or FS= ' " , " | " ' if you like ) , keeping in mind that the actual fields will be in position 2 , 3 ... NF - 1 . We can extend that FS to allow for spaces around fields , like eg
" field1 " , " field2 " , " field3 " , " field4 "
by using FS='^ " | " , " | " $ '.
Usable fields will still be in positions 2 ... NF - 1 . Unlike the previous case , here that FS regex seems to work fine .
You can of course also use FS= ' , ' , and remove extra characters by hand :
# FS= ' , ' for ( i=1 ;i< =NF ;i++ ) { gsub ( / ^ * " | " *$ / , " " , $ i ) ; print " Field " i " is " $ i ; }
Another CSV format is similar to the first CSV format above , but allows for field to contain commas , provided that the field is quoted :
field1 , " field2 , with , commas " , field3 , " field4 , foo "
We have a mixture of quoted and unquoted fields here , which cannot parsed directly by any value of FS ( that I know of , at least ) .
However , we can still get the fields using match ( ) in a loop ( and cheating a bit ) :
$ 0=$0 " , " ; # yes , cheating while ( $ 0 ) { match ( $ 0 , / [ ^ , ] * , | * " [ ^ " ] * " *,/) ; sf=f=substr($0 , RSTART , RLENGTH ) ; # save what matched in sf gsub ( / ^ *" ? | " ? *,$ / , " " , f ) ; # remove extra stuff print " Field " ++c " is " f ; sub ( sf , " " ) ; # " consume " what matched }
As the complexity of the format increases ( for example when escaped quotes are allowed in fields ) , awk solutions become more fragile .
Although I should not say this here , for anything more complex than the last example , I suggest using other tools ( eg , Perl just to name one ) .
Btw , it looks like there is an awk CSV parsing library here : http://lorance.freeshell.org/csv/
( I have not tried it ) .
Let 's say we want to check whether a given string is a valid IP v4 address ( for simplicity , we limit our discussion to IP v4 addresses in the traditiona dotted quad format here ) .
We start with this seemingly valid program :
awk - F ' [ . ]' ' function ok ( n ) {return ( n>=0 && n < =255 ) } {exit ( ok ( $ 1 ) && ok ( $ 2 ) && ok ( $ 3 ) && ok ( $ 4 ) ) } '
This seems to work , until we pass it ' 123b.44.22c.3 ' , which it happily accepts as valid .
The fact is that , due to the way awk 's number to string conversion works , some strings may " look like " numbers to awk , even if we know they are not .
The correct thing to do here is to perform a string comparison against a regular expression :
awk - F ' [ . ]' ' function ok ( n ) { return ( n ~ /^( [ 01 ] ? [ 0 - 9 ] ? [ 0 - 9 ]
|2[ 0 - 4 ] [ 0 - 9 ]
| 25 [ 0 - 5 ] ) $/ ) } {exit ( ok ( $ 1 ) && ok ( $ 2 ) && ok ( $ 3 ) && ok ( $ 4 ) ) } '
We want to check whether two ( unsorted ) files contain the same data , that is , the set of lines of the first file is the same set of lines of the second file .
One way is of course sorting the two files and processing them with some other tool ( for example , uniq or diff ) .
But we want to avoid the relatively expensive sort operation .
Can awk help us here ?
The answer ( you guessed it ) is yes .
If we know that the two files do not contain duplicates , we can do this :
awk '! ( $ 0 in a ) { c + + ; a [ $ 0 ] } END { exit( c==NR/2?0:1) } ' file 1 file2
and check the return status of the command ( 0 if the files are equal , 1 otherwise ) .
The assumption we made that the two files must not contain duplicate lines is crucial for the program to work correctly .
In essence , what it does is to keep track of the number of different lines seen .
If this number is exactly equal to half the number of total input records seen , then the two files must be equal ( in the sense described above ) .
To understand that , just realize that , in all other cases ( ie , when a file is only a partial subset or is not a subset of the other ) , the total number of distinct lines seen will always be greater than NR / 2 .
The program 's complexity is linear in the number of input records .
We have this file :
1,2,3 , ,5 , foo 1,2,3,0,5 , bar 1,2,3,4,5,baz
and we want to replace the last field with " X " only when the fourth field is not empty .
We thus do this :
awk - F ' , ' - v OFS= ' , ' '{if ( $ 4 ) $ 6 = " X " }1 '
But we see that the substitution only happens in the last line , instead of the last two as we expected .
Why ?
Basically , there are only two data types in awk : strings and numbers .
Internally , awk does not assign a fixed type to the variables ; they are literally considered to be of type " number " and " string " at the same time , with the number 0 and the null string being equivalent .
Only when a variable is used in the program , awk automatically converts it to the type it deems appropriate for the context .
Some contexts strictly require a specific type ; in that case , awk automatically converts the variable to that type and uses it .
In contexts that does not require a specific type , awk treats variables that " look like " numbers as numbers , and the other variables are treated as strings .
In out example above , the simple test " if ( $ 4 ) " does not provide a specific context , since the tested variable can be anything .
In the first line , $ 4 is an empty string , so awk considers it false for the purposes of the test .
In the second line , $ 4 is " 0 " .
Since it look like a number , awk uses it like a number , ie zero .
Since 0 is considered false , the test is unsuccessful and the substitution is not performed .
Luckily , there is a way to help awk and tell it exactly what we want .
We can use string concatenation and append an empty string to the variable ( which does not change its value ) to explicitly tell awk that we want it to treat it like a string , or , conversely , add 0 to the variable ( again , without changing its value ) to explicitly tell awk that we want a number .
So this is how our program should be to work correctly :
awk - F ' , ' - v OFS= ' , ' '{if ( $ 4 " " ) $ 6 = " X " }1 ' # the " " forces awk to evaluate the variable as a string
With this change , in the second line the if sees the string " 0 " , which is not considered false , and the test succeeds , just as we wanted .
As said above , the reverse is also true .
Another typical problematic program is this :
awk '/ foo/{tot++} END {print tot} '
This , in the author 's intention , should count the number of lines that match / foo / .
But if / foo / does not appear in the input , the variable tot retains its default initial value ( awk initializes all variables with the dual value " " and 0 ) .
print expects a string argument , so awk supplies the value " " .
The result is that the program prints just an empty line .
But we can force awk to treat the variable as numeric , by doing this :
awk '/ foo/{tot++} END{print tot+0} '
The seemingly innocuous +0 has the effect of providing numeric context to the variable " tot " , so awk knows it has to prefer the value 0 of the variable over the other possible internal value ( the empty string ) .
Then , numeric - to - string conversion still happens to satisfy print , but this time what awk converts to string is 0 , so print sees the string " 0 " as argument , and prints it .
Note that , if an explicit context has been provided to a variable , awk remembers that .
That can lead to unexpected results :
# input : 2.5943 10 awk ' { $ 1=sprintf ( " %d " , $ 1 ) ; # truncates decimals , but also explicitly turns $ 1 into a string ! if ( $ 1 > $ 2 ) print " something went wrong ! " } # this is printed
Here , after the sprintf ( ) , awk notes that we want $ 1 to be a string ( in this case , " 2 " ) .
Then , when we do if ( $ 1 > $ 2 ) , awk sees that $ 2 has no preferred type , while $ 1 does , so it converts $ 2 into a string ( to match the wanted type of $ 1 ) and does a string comparison .
Of course , 99.9999 % of the times this is not what we want here .
In this case , the problem is easily solved by doing " if ( $ 1+0 > $ 2 ) " ( doing $ 2+0 instead WON'T work ! ) , doing " $ 1= $ 1+0 " after the sprintf ( ) , or using some other means to truncate the value of $ 1 , that does not give it explicit string type .
Suppose you have a file like this :
Yesterday I was walking in = the street= , when I saw =a black dog= .
There was also =a cat= hidden around there .
= The sun= was shining , and =the sky= was blue .
I entered = the music shop= and I bought two CDs .
Then I went to = the cinema= and watched =a very nice movie= .
End of the story .
Ok , silly example , fair enough .
But suppose that we want to print only and all the parts of that file that are like =something= .
We have no knowledge of the structure of the file .
The parts we 're interested in might be anywere ; they may span lines , or there can be many of them on a single line .
This seemingly daunting and difficult task is actually easily accomplished with this small awk program :
awk - v RS='= ' '! ( NR%2 ) ' # awk - v RS='= ' '!( NR%2 ) {gsub (/
/ , " " ) ; print} ' # if you want to reformat embedded newlines
Easy , was n't it ?
Let 's see how this works .
Setting RS to '= ' tells awk that records are separated by ' =' ( instead of the default newline character ) .
If we look at the file as a series of records separated by '= ' , it becomes clear that what we want are the even - numbered records .
So , just throw in a condition that is true for even - numbered records to trigger the printing .
GNU awk can take this technique a step further , since it allows us to assign full regexes to RS , and introduces a companion variable ( RT ) that stores the part of the input that actually matched the regex in RS .
This allows us , for example , to apply the previous technique when the interesting parts of the input are delimited by different characters or string , like for example when we want everything that matches < tag > something </tag > .
With GNU awk , we can do this :
gawk -v RS ='</?tag >' ' RT== " </tag > " '
or again
gawk -v RS = '</?tag >' '! ( NR%2 ) '
and be done with that .
Another nice thing that can be done with GNU awk and RT is printing all the parts of a file that match an arbitrary regular expression ( something otherwise usually not easily accomplished ) .
Suppose that we want to print everything that looks like a number in a file ( simplifiying , here any sequence of digits is considered a number , but of course this can be refined ) , we can do just this :
gawk - v RS = ' [ 0 - 9 ] +'
' RT{print RT} '
Checking that RT is not null is necessary because for the last record of a file RT is null , and an empty line would be printed in that case .
The output produced by the previous program is similar to what can be obtained using grep - o .
But awk can do better than that .
We can use a slight variation of this same technique if we want to add context to our search ( something grep - o alone cannot do ) .
For example , let 's say that we want to print all numbers , but only if they appear inside " -- " , eg like --1234 -- , and not otherwise .
With gawk , we can do this :
gawk -v RS = '--[ 0 - 9 ] +--' ' RT{gsub (/--/ , " " , RT ) ; print RT} '
So , a carefully crafted RS selects only the " right " data , that can be subsequently extracted safely and printed .
With non-GNU awk , matching all occurrences of an expression can still be done , it just requires more code .

Luckily Halloween is still 2 weeks away so there ’s loads of time to think about what you ’re handing out to the kids who ring your bell …
Over the years the traditional Halloween offering CANDY has been loosing muster .
For some unknown reason people have taken it upon themselves to get creative with what they give out to the little tykes who show up on their doorstep .
More and more people shun candy for other alternatives .
And , as always , it ’s the kids that suffer .
We know , we know , America ’s a fat wasteland of obese sugar - fueled children .
And we ’re all for healthy snacks , exercise and a healthy lifestyle .
Just not on Halloween .
The one day of the year when the 3 meals of the day should actually be Candy .
Candy .
And more candy .
Here now are 10 things not to give out .
Hopefully you wo n’t .
10 .
Peanuts : Nuts are one of the most common and severe allergies kids get .
Halloween ’s for the sugar rush , not the Emergency Room .
M&M peanuts , as much as we love them , fall into this category .
9. Mini-Lollipops :
They look like candy but really they ’re not .
Remember it ’s Halloween , not a hotel lobby or the Principals office .
Dum - dums are just that .
Pass them by .
If you want to give lollipops , try Blow - Pops .
8. Unwrapped candy :
When I was a kid some people would just drop in a handful of candy corns or something like that .
Do n’t be that idiot .
First of all , candy corn sucks !
Second , passing out unwrapped candy will only get you a visit from the Neighborhood Watch .
7. Loose Change : Look neighbor , if my little ones wanted your pennies and nickels , I ’d send them by next week collecting for UNICEF or something .
Spare the change and hand out some mini Kit -Kats .
6. Old People Candy : A good rule -
If it looks like it belongs in a candy dish , do n’t hand it out .
Chocolate mints , peppermint suckers , gum drops , yeah those types of things .
5. School Supplies : Apparently there are people who give out pencils , erasers , colored markers , post it notes and the like .
Shame on them .
Halloween candy is found at the supermarket , not the office supply closet .
4 : Religious literature : Yeah , yeah , we know Halloween has a pagan roots and such but take one day off from spreading the gospel will yeah Flanders .
3 : Healthy crap : Apples .
Raisins .
Juice boxes .
Carrots .
Granola bars .
Etc. I ’m all for eating healthy but these are for the other 364 days of the year .
Halloween is for candy .
Got it .
Hold your slim - good - body preaching for November 1st .
2. Sugar - free candy : Just do n’t go there .
( Note : If your kids diabetic then limit him to a piece or 2 or real candy a day . )
1 : A toothbrush : Nothing says “ I ’m an asshole " more than handing out a toothbrush .
Especially if you ’re the neighborhood dentist .
Oh yeah , Happy Halloween !

I think my wife is cheating on me I 've never talked about this before , but I really need the boards advice on what could be a crucial decision .
Ive suspected for some time now that my wife has been cheating on me .
The usual signs
Phone rings but if I answer , the caller hangs up .
My wife has been going out with the girls a lot recently although when I ask their names she always says ,  Just some friends from work , you dont know them . 
I always stay awake to look out for her taxi coming home , but she always walks down the drive .
Although I can hear a car driving off , as if she has gotten out of the car round the corner .
Why ?
Maybe she wasnt in a taxi ?
I once picked her cell phone up just to see what time it was and she went berserk and screamed that I should never touch her phone again and why was I checking up on her .
Anyway , I have never approached the subject with my wife I think deep down I just didnt want to know the truth , but last night she went out again and I decided to really check on her .
I decided I was going to park my motorcycle next to the garage and then hide behind it so I could get a good view of the whole street when she came home .
It was at that moment , crouching behind my bike , that I noticed that the valve covers on my engine seemed to be leaking a little oil .
Is this something I can fix myself or should I take it back to the dealer ?

Use these resources in OpenSecrets.org 's Influence & Lobbying section , which are also found at the left , to learn more about Washington 's influence industry and its most powerful players .
Just about any interest group you can think of has a presence in Washington - and spends money to maintain that presence .
Here we 've totaled all the campaign contributions over the years from more than 100 interest groups , so that you can see patterns that might have affected policies with an impact on your life .
We also track how much interest groups have been spending on lobbying , which is the other side of the influence coin .
Professional advocates make big bucks to lobby members of Congress and government officials on the issues their clients care about .
But the money that industries , companies , unions and issue groups spend on lobbying is often just a drop in the bucket compared to what they can reap in return if their lobbyists are successful .
Here you can see who spends what on federal lobbying and where they focus their resources .
You 've heard it before - it's not what you know , it 's who you know .
In our nation 's capital , success comes with a combination of knowledge and personal connections .
This database tracks thousands of individuals who 've spun through Washington 's " revolving door " , employing professional relationships and know - how accumulated through public service to advance the goals of their private employers .
In a campaign finance system where all the money originates from individuals , political action committees , or PACs , control the most " corporate " of money .
Controlled by companies , trade associations , unions , issue groups and even politicians ( a subset called " leadership PACs " ) , these committees pool contributions from individuals and distribute them to candidates , political parties and other PACs .
PACs can also spend money independently on political activities , including advertising and other efforts to support or oppose candidates in an election .
Influence in Washington is created from many ingredients .
Here we give you at - a - glance profiles of the political donations , outside spending and lobbying expenditures of more than 20,000 labor unions , corporations and trade groups , as well as the number of lawmakers who have personally invested in them .
More detailed profiles are available for the 150 or so biggest all - time contributors since 1989 .
For the longest time , campaign ads were almost exclusively produced by candidates and political parties , but in recent years outside issue groups have been getting in on the action .
They often operate as so - called 527 committees ( taking their name from the relevant section of the IRS tax code ) .
Sometimes mysteriously named , these advocacy groups frequently have ties to labor , big business and super - wealthy individuals .
Unlike political committees , they can accept unlimited contributions from just about anyone , and they deploy that money in various ways to influence elections .
Keep an eye on these shadowy groups here .
Afghan who faked death so British ex-wife could claim £ 300,000 insurance caught after his fingerprints were found on death certificate
An Afghan man forged his own death certificate so his British ex-wife could claim a £ 300,000 payout on their life insurance policy .
A court heard that Ahmad Akhtary , 34 , got a fake death certificate from Afghanistan claiming he had died of ' brain trauma ' after being involved in an accident in his home country .
His wife , Anne , a 43 - year - old mother of triplets , then submitted a claim to Norwich Union for the £ 300,000 payable on their joint life policy if one of them died .
But it was not long before the ' unsophisticated ' plot went wrong - because Akhtary continued to live openly in Gloucester , working , paying tax and keeping appointments with his GP .
Ahmad Akhtary 's death plot was foiled
Anne Akhtary came clean early on
Prosecutor James Cranfield told Gloucester crown court that Norwich Union investigators were alerted to the scam when they heard Mr Akhtary had been to see his GP six months after his alleged death .
They confronted Mrs Akhtary about her claim - and she admitted the truth .
When her ex-husband was tracked down and arrested , however , he denied being involved or having any knowledge of the fake death certificate .
But he was caught out when his fingerprints were found on the Afghan document .
Factory worker Akhtary , 33 , of Stratton Road , Gloucester , pleaded guilty to attempting to obtain £ 300,000 from Norwich Union by deception between August 25 , 2005 and November 11 , 2006 .
His wife , 43 , of Cotteswold Road , Gloucester , also admitted the attempted deception as well as a charge of forgery .
Judge Mark Horton sentenced them both to nine months jail suspended for two years .
Ahmad was also ordered to complete 60 hours of unpaid community work and Anne 40 hours .
Mr Cranfield told the court the couple had met in May 2002 and married in September 2003 .
In November 2003 they got a £ 110,000 mortgage to buy a house in Cotteswold Road , Gloucester , and in August 2005 they took out their joint life policy with Norwich Union .
Shortly after taking out the policy , which became active in October 2005 , they began divorce proceedings , Mr Cranfield said .
The divorce was finalised in November .
The couple were briefly reconciled and lived together again in December and January 2006 but Akhtary then moved out again .
Mr Cranfield said that in April 2006 Mrs Akhtary asked Norwich Union to send her a claim form .
' Information was provided that he had died in an accident in Afghanistan following some brain trauma , ' he said .
' The insurers requested a death certificate .
Mrs Akhtary duly provided it .
' It is an Afghanistan certificate .
It gives cause of death as brain trauma following accident .
This was submitted on the 9th October 2006 and gave the date of his death as March 2006 .
' However , Norwich Union received a phone call a few weeks after the claim was received .
' They were told that Mr Akhtary 's GP had seen him at his practice on 6th September 2006 and he had attended hospital on 28th September .
' So it was not the most sophisticated way of going about making a false claim . '
Mr Cranfield said that in November 2006 , Mrs Akhtary gave a signed statement saying how she had become involved in submitting a fraudulent claim , where the fake death certificate came from and indicating she would be pleading guilty .
On the other hand , Mr Akhtary was arrested and interviewed in February 2007 and indicated he knew nothing about the scheme .
Mr Cranfield said Akhtary was of previous good character but his ex-wife had criminal convictions including one for making a false statement to get benefits .
Jonathan Stanniland , prosecuting , said it was an ' unsophisticated offence ' .
' During the period he was supposed to be shamming his demise he was visiting his GP regularly in connection with his health , working , paying tax in his own name , living at an address at which he was registered and openly conducting his business and social affairs in Gloucester .
' Those were not the actions of a person who fully appreciates the serious nature of the offence in which they have become embroiled . '
Mr Stanniland said Akhtary feared for his family in Afghanistan if he was jailed - because his mother , who lives in ' desperate circumstances ' relied on the £ 500 a month he sends her from his UK earnings .
Barrister Philip Warren acting for Mrs Akhtary said she had wanted to drop the deception plot when the first fake death certificate got lost in the post and did not arrive with Norwich Union .
However , Akhtary wanted to carry on so he got a second fake certificate for her to send , Mr Warren said .
' Norwich Union , it would appear , were not fooled for one minute and within a month the investigators visited Mrs Akhtary .
' She crumbled and was in tears and abandoned the enterprise then . '
Mr Warren said that the strain on Mrs Akhtary , as a single mother of 12 year old triplets , had been ' palpable ' during the long wait for the case to come to court .
Passing sentence , Judge Mark Horton said all fake insurance claims were serious but the couple had been unsophisticated in the way they went about it and no money had in fact been lost .
' Your pursuit of this money was hesitant to say the least . ' he said .
But he told the couple that although prison terms were merited he did not feel it necessary to make them immediate .
Negotiations with unions will be critical to saving the airline
Italy 's national airline , Alitalia , may have to cancel some flights because of a lack of funds to buy fuel , a top official has warned .
Augusto Fantozzi , Alitalia 's bankruptcy administrator , made the comments as he called unions to emergency talks a day after the latest session broke down .
The unions earlier quoted him as saying flights could not be " guaranteed " because we cannot " get fuel " .
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi blamed " political " motives for the failure .
He said he would do all he could to save Alitalia from collapse .
" The executive is always ready ... to give all the possible support to get to the only solution possible to avoid the airline going bust , " he said .
Alitalia later issued a note it said was sent by Mr Fantozzi , which said : " There are difficulties relating to the supply of fuel which could put some flights at risk , " Reuters news agency said .
Italian investment consortium CAI , which was poised to take over the company 's profitable parts , walked away from talks with the unions on Friday , accusing them of intransigence .
CAI chief executive Rocco Sabelli said on Saturday it was not ready to make any further concessions .

Several tax experts said they believe Republican vice - presidential nominee Sarah Palin is required to pay federal taxes on $ 25,000 in reimbursements from the state of Alaska for her children 's travel expenses .
The Alaska governor released her 2006 and 2007 tax returns on Friday , sparking a lively debate on tax blogs and among tax professionals over whether reimbursements and per-diem meal payments from the state should be subject to federal taxes .
Since taking office in December 2006 , Gov. Palin , whose state salary is $ 125,000 a year , received reimbursements totaling $ 43,500 for travel and lodging for her family in connection with state business .
Of that total , $ 25,000 was for her children 's travel and the rest was for her husband , Todd , the Washington Post reported .
While several tax experts have raised serious questions about whether the payments to Gov.
Palin are taxable income , they said the case was clearer cut for treating the reimbursements for the children 's expenses as taxable income .
" The kids are a slam dunk problem , " said Robert Spierer , a partner with the accounting firm Perelson Weiner LLP in New York City .
" The husband you could make an argument that he had to be there because it was required for spouses to be there . "
But not the children , he said .
" I do n't think I would ever claim that on my clients ' returns .
I can't think of a real strong argument for it . "
Gov. Palin also accepted $ 17,000 in per-diem meal payments for nights spent at her home in Wasilla , 40 miles from the governor 's office she used in Anchorage , Alaska 's largest city .
Gov. Palin often used that office rather than traveling to the state capital of Juneau , more than 800 miles away .
Several tax experts have argued this should be counted as taxable income .
Also on Saturday a senior Georgian official said by telephone that Russian bombers were flying over Georgia and that the presidential offices and residence in Tbilisi had been evacuated .
The official added that Georgian forces still had control of Tskhinvali .

Neither side showed any indication of backing down .
Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia declared that “ war has started , ” and President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia accused Russia of a “ well - planned invasion ” and mobilized Georgia ’s military reserves .
There were signs as well of a cyberwarfare campaign , as Georgian government Web sites were crashing intermittently during the day .
The escalation risked igniting a renewed and sustained conflict in the Caucasus region , an important conduit for the flow of oil from the Caspian Sea to world markets and an area where conflict has flared for years along Russia ’s borders , most recently in Chechnya .
The military incursion into Georgia marked a fresh sign of Kremlin confidence and resolve , and also provided a test of the capacities of the Russian military , which Mr. Putin had tried to modernize and re-equip during his two presidential terms .
Frictions between Georgia and South Ossetia , which has declared de facto independence , have simmered for years , but intensified when Mr. Saakashvili came to power in Georgia and made national unification a centerpiece of his agenda .
Mr. Saakashvili , a close American ally who has sought NATO membership for Georgia , is loathed at the Kremlin in part because he had positioned himself as a spokesman for democracy movements and alignment with the West .
Thanks a lot , President Bush .
According to Leigh Jones , the Galveston County Daily News reporter who 's Twittering her reporting from around the battered island , Bush 's visit there is hampering relief workers .
" Emergency personnel can't get over the causeway because the president is here .
No one can move around the island .
Gridlock is crazy , " she wrote .
Later , she adds , " I hope the island can get some benefit from this presidential visit . "
Some of the problems are also due to residents being allowed to come back for what 's being called " look and leave . "
Their cars will be marked " LL " with shoe polish as they come to town ; they 'll be allowed to check their property and then be forced to leave , Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas has announced .
The policy may not last long , though .
The Houston Chronicle is reporting that I - 45 is paralyzed , with a two - mile back - up from Texas 519 .
That 's hurting relief efforts , the Chron reports .
" Our resources are not able to get through , " said TxDOT spokeswoman Raquelle Lewis .
" We have National Guard sitting in traffic , we have our crews sitting in traffic , we have FEMA resources sitting in traffic . "

The turtle only had a shell covering its underside A newly discovered fossil from China has shed light on how the turtle 's shell evolved .
The 220 million - year - old find , described in Nature journal , shows that the turtle 's breast plate developed earlier than the rest of its shell .
The breast plate of this fossil was an extension of its ribs , but only hardened skin covered its back .
Researchers say the breast plate may have protected it while swimming .
The turtle fossil , found near Guangling in south - west China , is thought to be the ancestor of all modern turtles , although it differs markedly ; it has teeth rather than a bony plate , the shell only covers its underside and it has a long tail .
The fossil find helps to answer key questions about the evolution of turtles , Dr Xiao - Chun Wu from the Canadian Museum of Nature was one of the first to examine the fossil .
Aquatic life " Since the 1800s , there have been many hypotheses about the origin of the turtle shell , " explained Dr. Wu . " Now we have these fossils of the earliest known turtle .
They support the theory that the shell would have formed from below as extensions of the backbone and ribs , rather than as bony plates from the skin as others have theorised , " Dr Wu explained .
The researchers say this idea is supported by evidence from the way modern turtle embryos develop .
The breast plate grows before the shell covering their backs .
O. semitestacea probably lived in shallow waters
The fossilised turtle ancestor , which has been named Odontochelys semitestacea , meaning half - shelled turtle with teeth , probably inhabited the river deltas or coastal shallows of China 's Nanpanjiang trough basin - the area where the fossil was unearthed .
Researchers say the development of the shell to first protect the underside points to a mainly aquatic lifestyle .
Dr Olivier Rieppel from Chicago 's Field Museum also examined the fossil .
" This strongly suggests Odontochelys was a water dweller whose swimming exposed its underside to predators .
Reptiles living on the land have their bellies close to the ground with little exposure to danger , " he said .
The researchers say further evidence to support the idea that this species lived mainly in water comes from the structure and proportions of the fossil 's forelimbs , which closely resemble those of modern turtles that live in similar conditions .

Anti-Obama Writer Detained in Kenya
Jerome Corsi , who wrote an anti-Obama book called The Obama Nation , was in Kenya investigating Obama ’s connections to Kenya .
He was to hold a press conference in which he was going to discuss what he had found .
There was a little surprise waiting for Corsi as he made his way to the press conference , though .
It was the Kenya ’s immigration department .
They swooped in an arrested him before he could make public his findings .
Corsi had promised a news conference today that would “ expose details of deep secret ties between U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and a section of Kenya government leaders , their connection to certain sectoral groups in Kenya and subsequent plot to be executed in Kenya should Senator Obama win the American presidency . ”
Somebody did n’t want this information out there .
Here is some of what Corsi was going to reveal :
Corsi was set to show Obama and Odinga have been in direct contact since the senator ’s visit to Kenya in 2006 .
He was to claim Obama advised Odinga on campaign strategy and helped him raise money in the U.S. for the Kenya presidential campaign .
Obama was raising money in the United States and sending it to the campaign of a foreign election .
But what about that campaign strategy that Obama helped Odinga with ?
Corsi was to report Odinga ’s 2007 presidential campaign strategy called for exploiting anti-Kikuyu tribal sentiments , claiming victory and charging voter fraud even if the campaign knew the election had been legitimately lost .
Odinga , Corsi said , also was willing to fan the flames of ethnic tribal tensions
Ethnic tribal tensions ?
Could this be equivalent to the class warfare that the Democrats love to use in America as a campaign strategy ?
But the kicker to me is that Odinga was prepared to claim voter fraud occurred even if he knew that the charges were unfounded and untrue .
That is straight out of the Democrat playbook , and foreshadows what can be expected from Obama in the extremely unlikely event that he loses the election .
So somebody wanted Corsi silenced , was it Odinga or was it the Obama campaign that made the call to collect on a debt for the campaign money that was funneled into Kenya ?
In order to answer that question we must once again look to Barack Obama ’s past .
Barack Obama has already admitted that he is in favor of silencing the people who do not agree with him and I am not only talking about his approval of re-instituting the fairness doctrine to shut down conservative radio and blogs .
That would have to wait until he was president , he is already in the game of harassing and threatening those who oppose him with the “ truth squads ” that he sent out in Missouri to intimidate people who run commercials that are critical of him .
He is also pressuring television stations not to run ads critical of him by the NRA .
Is it really too much of a stretch to think that Obama had a hand in this ?
But Obama ’s defiance of the freedom of the press and of free speech , is n’t where his disdain for the constitution ends .
As director of the Joyce Foundation he worked hard to undermine an individual ’s right to keep and bear arms using the court system , and will continue to do so once he assumes the presidency with his judicial nominees .
Regardless of what he now says .
And of course no discussion of Obama ’s past can be finished without talking about his association with William Ayers .
Obama ’s campaign likes to say that Obama was only eight when Ayers committed his terrorist attacks on the Pentagon , but Obama ’sassociation with Ayers is much more recent than that .
As director and co-founder with William Ayer of The Chicago Annenberg Challenge he helped fund William Ayers and his radical teachings in Chicago .
Which then leads us to Reverend Jeremiah Wright and his radical , race baiting , hate mongering , anti-American sermons that Barack Obama attended for twenty years .
And brought his children to .
Obama ’s past is filled with associations to people unfriendly with America and with ideas that are contrary to the constitution and the rights of speech , press , and the right to bear arms .
So again I ask , is it so hard to believe that Obama had a hand in this writers detainment in Kenya ?
All of these associations and beliefs are just too conveniently coincidental for me to believe .
Barack Obama has a pattern here , it is a pattern that we are supposed to ignore .
If you dare to ask about Obama ’s past you are accused of either engaging in the politics of personal destruction , or of personal attacks , or of being a racist .
Or all of the above .
We are supposed to believe that Barack Obama ’s past is not relevant to the campaign , but who a person is today derives from who he was and what happened to him in the past .
Barack Obama ’s past is just too damn shady and I can not ignore it .
Obama ’s past does matter today , especially when the associations that he claims were long ago were allot more recent than Obama cares to admit .
But why was Corsi coincidentally detained just as he was headed to his press conference ?
Was it just another coincidence ?
Or was there more ?
What was Corsi going to reveal ?
Just one more question , could it have been a birth certificate ?
A press release issued on Oct. 2 , 2008 , by the Taiwan Civil Alliance offered some penetrating analysis on a Swiss Court ’s ruling regarding the international legal status of Taiwan .
The press release is repeated here for reference :
Swiss Court Should Amend Ruling in Taiwan Case
The Taiwan Civil Alliance deplores the recent ruling of the Geneva First Instance Court in regard to the international legal status of the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) .
Background to the Court Case :
In July 2007 , the Taiwan governing authorities filed a lawsuit against the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) in Geneva , Switzerland .
The lawsuit was in response to the ISO ’s failure to respond to repeated requests from Taiwan for a name change designation in the ISO 3166 country codes list .
During court hearings held in November 2007 and February 2008 , lawyers for the ISO maintained that the country codes list was created in 1974 in accordance with the United Nations ' practice of referring to Taiwan as " Taiwan Province , China . "
Accordingly , they argued , this appellation on the ISO country codes list simply follows commonly accepted international practice .
The Taiwan governing authorities do not agree , and the lawsuit demands that the organization correct Taiwan 's designation from " Taiwan Province , China " to " Republic of China ( Taiwan ) " in the country codes list , based on the simple fact that Taiwan is not a part of the People ’s Republic of China .
However , in an attempt to block Taiwan 's legal action , the ISO challenged Taiwan 's legal eligibility as a plaintiff during all previous court hearings .
Historical Details : After the Republic of China ( ROC ) was expelled from the United Nations in October 1971 , the People ’s Republic of China ( PRC ) assumed China ’s seat at the UN .
At present the ROC government on Taiwan has formal diplomatic relations with less than 25 countries , mostly small states in Central & South America and the Pacific area .
Ruling :
In a ruling delivered Tuesday Sept. 16 , 2008 , to the Geneva bureau of Taiwan 's representative office in Switzerland , the Geneva First Instance Court held that whether the country is a member of the United Nations and whether it has diplomatic relations with Switzerland are of no relevance in the current legal action .
The Court further found that the “ Republic of China ( Taiwan ) ” is an eligible plaintiff in the case , on the grounds that it possesses all the elements of statehood and that its government holds and effectively exercises sovereignty over its territory .
The Taiwan Civil Alliance stresses that the court ’s reasoning in this case is faulty , and should be amended at an early date .
While it is true that Taiwan is not a part of the PRC , legally speaking it is not part of the ROC either .
Moreover , Taiwan does not possess all of the necessary elements of statehood .
In order to understand the true reality of Taiwan ’s international legal status in the world today , it is necessary to review the history of Taiwan from the late 1800 ’s to the present .
The following summary gives numerous key points of analysis .
(1) The Republic of China was entrusted with authority over Formosa and the Pescadores as agent for the Allied Powers .
This arrangement was specified in General Order No. 1 of Sept. 2 , 1945 .
Such trust on behalf of the Allied Powers , led by the United States , remains in effect today .
Nothing in the post - war San Francisco Peace Treaty ( SFPT ) nor in any other treaty ever executed by or between the Republic of China and the other Allied Powers has altered this trusteeship arrangement .
(2) The United States of America is and remains the " principal occupying power " of Taiwan under SFPT Article 23 ( a ) .
Furthermore , United States Military Government ( USMG ) jurisdiction over Taiwan is active as per SFPT Article 4 ( b ) .
(3) Following the acceptance of the surrender of Japanese forces in Taiwan by the representatives of the ROC's Chiang Kai-shek ( CKS ) , Taiwan remained de jure Japanese territory .
The ROC government occupied Taiwan on behalf of the Allied Powers ( led by the United States ) pending a peace treaty with Japan , which would change the legal status of Taiwan .
(4) When the ROC moved its central government to occupied Taiwan in mid-December 1949 , it became a government in exile .
According to international law , there are no actions , procedures , or initiatives which a government in exile can take to become internationally recognized as the legal government of its current locality .
(5) Pursuant to the SFPT , Japan renounced its sovereignty over Taiwan ( Formosa ) and title to its territory .
Article 2 ( b ) of the SFPT provided , " Japan renounces all right , title and claim to Formosa and the Pescadores . "
China never became a party to the SFPT .
Neither the ROC government , which occupied the island of Taiwan as agent for the " principal occupying power , " nor the government of the People 's Republic of China ( " PRC " ) , which controlled mainland China , signed , ratified , or adhered to the SFPT .
(6) Article 25 of the SFPT specifically provided that the Treaty did " not confer any rights , titles or benefits on any State which [ was ] not an Allied Power [ as defined in Article 23 ( a ) . ]
(7) Specifically , China , a non-party , was not entitled to any benefits under Article 2 ( b ) dealing with the territory of Taiwan ( Formosa ) .
(8) While Article 2 ( b ) of the SFPT did not designate a recipient of " all right , title and claim to Formosa and the Pescadores , " Article 23 ( a ) of the SFPT designated the United States as " the principal occupying power " with respect to the geographic areas covered by the SFPT , including " Formosa and the Pescadores . "
(9) Following the entry into force of the SFPT , the government of the ROC continued to occupy Taiwan as agent for the United States , " the principal occupying power . "
( 10 ) The Treaty of Peace between the ROC and Japan , which was signed on April 28 , 1952 , and entered into force on August 5 , 1952 ( the " Treaty of Taipei " ) , did not transfer sovereignty over Taiwan from Japan to China either .
( 11 ) The SFPT did not terminate the agency relationship between the United States , the principal , and the ROC , the agent , with regard to the occupation and administration of Taiwan .
Up to the present day , the United States continues to be the “ principal occupying power ” and the ROC is fulfilling the role of a “ subordinate occupying power . ”
In military terminology , the ROC is conducting a proxy occupation of Taiwan .
( 12 ) Currently , Taiwan is an occupied territory of the United States , and it has not yet attained a “ final political status , ” Neither the SFPT nor the Treaty of Taipei nor any other subsequent legal instruments or occurrences after 1952 changed the status of Taiwan .
( 13 ) With no transfer of the territorial sovereignty of Taiwan to the ROC at any time from the 1940 ’s to the present , the ROC in Taiwan can not be said to own legal title to Taiwan territory .
From a strict legal standpoint , with no legal basis to claim Taiwan as part of its national territory , Taiwan does not meet the Montevideo Convention ’s criteria for statehood , and indeed the international community does not recognize Taiwan as a state .
( 14 ) Following the entry into force of the SFPT on April 28 , 1952 , the ROC did not exercise sovereignty over Taiwan and did not have title to its territory .
Today , Taiwan remains as occupied territory of the United States , and the ROC government in exile continues to conduct a proxy occupation of Taiwan territory .
The Taiwan Civil Alliance hereby publicly proclaims that the recent ruling by the Swiss Court in Geneva is in error , and should be amended at an early date .
The Taiwan Civil Alliance urges all international organizations , courts , and government bodies to conduct more careful research before adjudicating on the international legal status of Taiwan in the future .
The correct designation for Taiwan is neither " Taiwan Province , China " or " Republic of China ( Taiwan ) , ” but simply “ Taiwan . ”
The present day status of Taiwan has arisen as a result of the Pacific War against Japan , and must be understood in light of the historical developments as outlined above .

Additional Details on the Taiwan status issue :
The following five criteria for a proxy occupation may be outlined .
Commentary for the situation of the Republic of China in Taiwan is given for each criterion .
(1) The local administration meets the definition of military occupation under the laws of war , as specified in the Hague and Geneva Conventions .
Commentary : According to the laws of war , territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of foreign armed forces .
Hence , the only possible legal significance for the completion of the Oct. 25 , 1945 , Japanese surrender ceremonies in Taiwan is to say that the “ military occupation of Formosa and the Pescadores has begun . ”
(2) The government forces conducting the local administration are not of the same country as the conquering forces .
Commentary :
All military attacks against Taiwan in the WWII period were conducted by US military forces , hence the United States is the “ conqueror . ”
However , the government forces conducting the local administration are those of the Republic of China .
(3) A delegation of administrative authority for the military occupation of the territory is clear from the provisions of the peace settlement and / or military orders .
Commentary : In General Order No. 1 of Sept. 2 , 1945 , General Douglas MacArthur directed the forces of Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China to go to Taiwan to accept the surrender of Japanese troops .
(4) If there was a cession of the territory in a peace treaty , the government of the local administrative authorities was neither designated as the “ recipient , ” nor as the ( principal ) occupying power .
Commentary :
In the post - war San Francisco Peace Treaty ( SFPT ) , Taiwan was not awarded to the Republic of China .
Indeed , the ROC was not a party to this treaty .
Importantly , the United States was designated as the principal occupying power .
(5) Final disposition of the territory is still subject to the determination of another government entity .
Commentary : According to Article 4 ( b ) of the SFPT , the final disposition of the Article 2 territory ( i.e. “ Japanese property ” ) of Taiwan is subject to the final determination of the United States Military Government ( USMG ) .
Obviously , the US Commander in Chief can speak for USMG .
In summary , the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) does not possess all the elements of statehood .
Furthermore , its government neither holds nor exercises sovereignty over Taiwan territory .

The giant Halloween pumpkin that weighs more than a Mini
Twin brothers were today celebrating setting a new European record by growing a massive pumpkin weighing more than a Mini car .
Ian and Stuart Paton 's giant squash weighed in at a staggering 1457lb - more than 104 stone - and had to be lifted by forklift truck .
The pumpkin smashed the previous British record of 1,341 lb set by father and son farmers Mark and Frank Baggs last month .
Anyone for some pumpkin pie ?
It also trumped the European record of 1357lb set by a Belgian grower last week .
The record - breaking pumpkin took 129 days to grow and was weighed using a special winch device at the Annual Pumpkin Show in Netley , near Southampton , Hants .
The Patons used a trailer pulled by a Volvo estate car to transport their giant vegetable to the show at Netley 's Royal Victoria Country Park where it was weighed in front of witnesses .
It was planted in a greenhouse in April and needed one and a half tonnes of manure to reach its current size .
Twin brothers have set a new European record by growing a massive pumpkin weighing as much as a Mini car .
Ian and Stuart , both 47 , run the Pinetops nursery in Lymington , New Forest , and held the British record one year ago with a pumpkin weighing 1,188lb .
Ian said the pair were delighted to reclaim their title .
He said : " It 's nice to have the record back because we had it a couple of years ago with a pumpkin weighing 1,124lb and then last year with one at 1188lb .
" This is the biggest and best so far .
No one else will beat it this year .
" Stuart and I are always looking ahead and we are now going to try to grow another pumpkin to beat the world record this time next year .
" It 's all about having a bit of luck and the right seeds - and we 've definitely got the right seeds so it 's just a matter of time now .
Too big to fit in the shopping trolley
" We grow our best ones in a greenhouse to keep the wind off and plant them in one and a half tonnes of manure .
" At it 's fastest stage this one was growing at 30lb a day - that 's more than two stone .
" Pumpkins do most of their growing at night and it may even have managed up to 50lb in 24 hours if it was as warm as 25 degrees celsius overnight . "
An original Mini motor car weighs 1360 lb ( 617kg ) .
The average pumpkin weighs about five pounds and takes up to three months to mature .
To establish a British record , pumpkin growers must have their vegetable weighed and photographed in front of witnesses at a recognised event .
They must then send photographs and documentary evidence to the website ' bigpumpkins.com , ' which keeps British records .
The world 's heaviest - ever pumpkin weighed in at 1,689lbs and was grown by Joe Jutras of Rhode Island , USA , in 2007 .
But expert Clive Bevan reckons climate change means British farmers will soon be competing with their bumper crops .
He said : " Pumpkins love lots of sun , showers and humidity which is why Americans have always grown the biggest pumpkins but soon we may be able to able to grow them as big . "
Ecuador says CIA infiltrated its military Agence France - Presse
Published : Friday October 31 , 2008
Print This Email This QUITO ( AFP ) 
The US Central Intelligence Agency had " full knowledge " of the deadly Colombian raid March 1 on a FARC rebel camp inside Ecuador that led to a rupture in ties between Bogota and Quito , Ecuador 's Defense Minister Javier Ponce said .
The CIA " had full knowledge of what was happening in Angostura , " the border area in Ecuador where the attack took place , Ponce said while presenting the results of an official investigation into the suspected infiltration of Ecuador 's armed forces by US intelligence agents .
Investigators " even detected a call by the CIA on the morning of March 1 announcing the attack in Angostura , " the minister added .
Authorities suspected that the incursion -- decried by the Organization of American States as a Colombian " premeditated violation " of Ecuadoran sovereignty -- relied on support from a US aircraft assigned to joint US - Ecuador anti-drug missions from a US Former Operating Location ( FOL ) in Manta , Ecuador , he said .
" The main doubt is about the activities of a US intelligence aircraft which surprisingly arrived at FOL Manta one week before the attack ....
The arrival of this plane marked the beginning of night flights that had not been normally undertaken from the FOL , " Ponce said .
The same aircraft " permanently withdrew from the base " four days after the raid , he added .
In April , Ecuador 's leftist President Rafael Correa sacked his defense minister and police chief after alleging the CIA had infiltrated his country 's security apparatus to help US ally Colombia .
The raid on the camp of the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) killed more than 20 people , including FARC 's number - two guerrilla Raul Reyes , four Mexicans and an Ecuadoran .
A diplomatic stand - off quickly ensued , with Quito expelling Bogota 's ambassador on March 3 and both sides ordering thousands of troops to their common border .
While military tensions have eased , diplomatic relations between the neighbors have yet to be normalized .
The FARC is Latin America 's oldest and most powerful insurgency , and has been trying to topple the Bogota government since the 1960s .
Some of the hospice patients talk about their impending deaths , or about God .
Most just talk about what people always talk about  unfinished business and unanswered questions : regrets over firing an employee 50 years ago ; the pet no one has yet promised to adopt ; feeling sick to death of being sick yet not ready to die .
About Bach .
“ How did he dream up that music ? ” one woman asks .
Listening to final inquiries like these has long been the domain of a family priest or rabbi .
But for a growing number of Americans who do not know a member of the clergy , that bedside auditor is increasingly likely to belong to an emerging professional class known in the hospice world as a pastoral counselor or chaplain , who may or may not be a clergy member .
The encounter with a chaplain can be profound and spiritual , and sometimes religious in a traditional way .
More and more , though , ministering to the terminally ill in hospice care is likely to be nonsectarian , or even secular .
In the quarter - century since Medicare and some private insurers began picking up the bill for hospice care , it has become a common recourse for the terminally ill .
With doctors , nurses , social workers and ample supplies of pain medication dispatched to their homes or nursing facilities in the final weeks and months , about 1.3 million Americans died last year in hospice care .

Michael Lohan is Backpedaling Again !
For some reasonhas seen the light once again .
This time Lindsay Lohan 's daddy is backpedaling on all of the nasty things that he has previously spewed about her girlfriend
While attending a book party on Oct. 21st , Michael spoke with New York magazine and said , " I definitely regret all the things I said about Samantha . "
He added that he 's a Christian and that he should not pass judgment on anyone .
In his past rants Michael has called Ronson " dark , hideous and a disgusting representation of humanity " .
That 's mighty big of him to take back those cruel things .
He claims to have learned not to use the media as a way to talk with his daughter .
So , who knows what to believe with Michael ?
He says that he has been speaking with Lindsay recently , but he has said that in the past too .
The actress has been known to immediately counter those claims with some iteration of ' he 's full of it ' .
When daddy ' no bucks ' was asked more about Lindsay 's life he said , " Family matters should be kept private , I 've learned that now . "
We know we have heard this exact statement from Michael in the past so it will be interesting to see how long he can keep his yapper shut .

Breaking Down How To Find The Best Cloud Storage Option For You
Are you looking to expand your business soon ?
Are you wondering how and where you can store your company ’s data ?
Cloud storage is something you should seriously look into .
Cloud storage is a service model that facilitates the transmission and storage of data .
Cloud storage keeps the data on remote storage systems .
From there , the storage provider manages and maintains the data accordingly .
With so many cloud storage choices , how do you pick the best cloud storage option for your business ?
Continue reading below as we discuss some of the most important factors to consider when choosing a cloud storage provider .
Finding the Best Cloud Storage Option
There ’s no doubt that cloud storage offers several benefits to businesses .
A recent study revealed that 87 % of businesses accelerated after using cloud services .
Moreover , 52 % of organizations enjoyed an improvement in IT security .
To find the best cloud storage option , you must first understand cloud computing .
You should know the key characteristics of great cloud storage providers .
What exactly are they ?
Let ’s take a look at some of the most important factors to consider when scouting for providers :
1. Do Some Comparisons
One of the first things you can do as you begin your search is to do some basic comparisons .
You want to compare the basic features , the storage options , and the cloud server costs .
If you are a small business and you only want the bare minimum , you may first look into the cost - free options .
There are a few cloud storage companies that offer free storage .
However , expect the very limited storage space .
If you need something more substantial , it ’s the paid plans that you want to look into .
As for the other capabilities , you may want to consider something that offers a high level of functionality .
You want to invest in something that offers mobile app capabilities .
This is crucial especially if you want to stay on top of your data even if you ’re outside of the office .
Meanwhile , price comparisons can be tricky .
Though it ’s tempting to go for the cheapest option , it ’s not always the best move to make .
You must weigh the offerings that come with the plan .
Strike a balance between the features and what your business can afford .
2. The Level of Security
Another key factor to consider is the storage provider ’s level of security .
Keep in mind that hackers continue to improve their techniques .
Thus , you need to invest in a cloud plan that comes with top - notch security features .
One of the basic features to look for is superb encryption .
Encryption must cover data while it ’s at rest or in transit .
Moreover , find a provider that offers other additional security features .
One example is two - factor authentication .
This works perfectly against brute force attacks .
3. Stability of the Provider
Even if a cloud storage provider offers notable security , you must also determine if they are capable of maintaining a high level of service .
Find out of the companies you are comparing are financially stable .
Avoid companies that are still establishing a successful business model .
You also do n’t want to bank on a company that has a small customer base .
Though there are newer providers that may offer excellent services , there is a risk of them losing steam .
When this happens , they may end up folding sooner rather than later .
If you have enough money , go for a reputable provider .
Another option is to go for managed services .
This is perfect for companies that wish to have their private clouds .
It ’s also a great choice for businesses looking for more flexibility .
4. Availability Matters
On top of excellent security , you also want your cloud provider to be available all the time .
Find a provider that reports at least 99.9 % uptime .
Do n’t believe the companies ’ marketing ploy .
Almost all of them will claim 100 % availability .
Hence , you need to do some research on the numbers and uptime records .
Furthermore , check the data centers .
You want to make sure the provider distributes these data centers geographically .
This is an important element in ensuring the availability of cloud services .
Proper distribution of data centers plays a role , especially during natural disasters .
Geographic distribution helps massively in diversifying risk .
5. Check for Cloud - to - Cloud Backups
Generally , companies use cloud storage for data backup purposes .
Some also keep copies of on - premises backup .
What several companies fail to realize is the importance of cloud - to - cloud backup .
This involves backing up your active data from your Software as a Service ( SaaS ) environment .
SaaS pertains to your cloud - based software .
It ’s a common notion that cloud providers conduct long - term backup by default .
The truth is , cloud storage providers do not offer this service upfront .
You will need to pay extra fees for this premium service .
What you want to get is to get a cloud storage plan that copies cloud - based data to another cloud .
The target destination can be a cloud from a different provider or another region .
Additionally , practice keeping two local copies of your data on different backup media .
Also , keep at least another one as a remote copy .
6. Accreditations and Validations
Last but not least , go for a cloud storage provider that comes with accreditations and validations .
There are third - party groups that conduct periodic audits of different cloud storage providers .
These third - party assessors check the security procedures of the providers .
They conduct audits to ensure the safety and quality of the hosting and processing of data .
One of the most notable auditing standards is the SSAE 16 .
Another is the ISO 27001 certification that ensures the provider meets international standards in information security management systems .

And once you get the cloud storage plan that you need , your next goal is to maximize its benefits .

StackOverflow.com just launched this last week , and it looks pretty cool .
It seems like it might be our best shot at getting back to the sort of useful discussion that we used to have on the Usenet back in the 90's .
Lots of signal , hardly any noise , and even the occasional correct answer .
Sign me up !
Uh ... wait a sec ... I can't sign up .
StackOverflow has made the inexplicable blunder of requiring its users to sign in via OpenID .
That means you can't simply pick a username and password , but must instead go away and find yourself an OpenID provider , sign up for that , and bring it back to StackOverflow .
It 's like 14 steps , depending on which provider you choose .
Observe :
Click login
Read a ton of instructions
Locate and click the " get one " link
Dismiss the javascript error popup from openid.net
Read a bunch more instructions
Find and click the " ClaimID " link ( it 's the first one on the list of providers )
Click " Create a new account "
Type in your information
Open your email , find their email , click the link
Go back to StackOverflow , click login again
Paste in that giant URL that is now your OpenID
Type in your Username & Password
Type in a bunch of Personal Info
... and you 're in !
Easy as that !
Now , for sake of comparison , let 's take a look at the steps required to start using Twiddla ( the web meeting playground that we 've been working on these last several months here at Expat ) :
Click the " New Meeting " button
Can you spot the difference ?
Look , it 's not just me saying this .
Talk to any Usability expert you like , and they 'll tell you that every barrier that you put in front of your users will cause a certain percentage of them to leave and not come back .
For most sites , even stopping to ask for a Username & Password is too intrusive .
That 's why we built Twiddla the way we did .
Our stated goal with Twiddla is to get the hell out of your way so that you can get some work done .
We 've taken that idea so far that most of our users will never see a login screen of any description .
Some might not ever know they 've used Twiddla at all , since we keep our Logo hidden away in the corner where it 's not in your way .
Can we say the same about StackOverflow 's new registration system ?
Unfortunately not .
For me , it was 10 minutes of grumbling " StackOverflow " , " F'ng StackOverflow " under my breath while stumbling through the painful OpenID signup process .
Complete usability failure .
I can only hope they 'll come to their senses and put in a reasonable username / password login like everybody else .

In all fairness , we ca n’t really call Obama ’s proposed national service plan a new draft .
First , he ’s not talking about requiring young people to do military service .
Second , we are getting decidedly mixed signals as to whether the service will be compulsory .
At first , the word " required " was used freely ; now we see much talk of tax credits , less talk of requirement .
Nevertheless , this new program certainly feels like the next step toward a new draft .
Just as Ike ’s planners made sure that the national highway system could see usage as a military transport system , Obama ’s civilian service corps could make mustering a draft army much , much easier .
After all , this is the guy who said ( vis - a - vis the establishment of ROTC programs on all college campuses ) :
I think it ’s important for the president to say , this is an important obligation .
If we are going into war , then all of us go , not just some .
Hm .
And when did you sign up , Barky ?
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
You probably already know this quote , from a speech he gave in Colorado Springs :
" We can not continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives we ’ve set .
We ’ve got to have a civilian national security force that ’s just as powerful , just as strong , just as well - funded . "
God only knows where the money is to come from .
Obama now seems to have drawn this big idea from his secret buddy Rahm Emanuel , that noted rust - proofer of brakes , who wrote the following in a 2006 book ominously called The Plan :
It ’s time for a real Patriot Act that brings out the patriot in all of us .
We propose universal civilian service for every young American .
Under this plan , All Americans between the ages of eighteen and twenty - five will be asked to serve their country by going through three months of basic training , civil defense preparation and community service . …
Here ’s how it would work .
Young people will know that between the ages of eighteen and twenty - five , the nation will enlist them for three months of civilian service .
They ’ll be asked to report for three months of basic civil defense training in their state or community , where they will learn what to do in the event of biochemical , nuclear or conventional attack ; how to assist others in an evacuation ; how to respond when a levee breaks or we ’re hit by a natural disaster .
These young people will be available to address their communities ’ most pressing needs .
Wittily , Emanuel adds : " This is not a draft . "
This puckish reference goes , of course , to Magritte : " Ceci n’est pas une pipe . "
I always get a little worried — more than a little , truth be told — when politicians insist that our post - Apocalypse clean - up crew is insufficiently staffed .
That sort of talk makes me wonder what they ’re up to .
Especially when we think back to the ominous words of one Joseph Biden :
" It will not be six months before the world tests Barack Obama like they did John Kennedy .
The world is looking …
Remember I said it standing here if you do n’t remember anything else I said .
Watch , we ’re gonna have an international crisis , a generated crisis , to test the mettle of this guy . "

These days , it only takes an increasingly - cheap USB thumb drive and a program like UNetbootin to create a portable Linux desktop you can run on any computer that can boot from a USB port .
But check out the list of distributions UNetbootin can download and install — it 's huge , and the names do n't tell you much about which distro is best for on - the - go computing .
Today we 're detailing four no-install distributions — Damn Small Linux , Puppy Linux , Xubuntu , and Fedora — and helping you decide which might work for that spare thumb drive you 've got lying around , or as just a part of your multi-gig monster stick .
Read on for a four - way faceoff of bootable Linux systems .
Note :
All but one of the systems tested here were created with UNetbootin , available for Windows and Linux downloads , and using the latest version available that could boot from USB .
All were run on the same laptop , a 2.0 gHz Centrino Duo ThinkPad with 2GB of memory / RAM .
Fedora 9 was run using its own live USB creator , as explained previously .

Our take ( and yours )
After using each of the systems above to browse a few web pages , edit a Word document and check out a few music files on my Windows partition , I found myself liking Puppy Linux , on the whole , more than the others .
It can work as either a fully - live system that start you clean each time , or give you a persistent disk space to store you stuff in .
It 's not a bad looking desktop either , and aside from a wireless quirk , I found it decently easy to use and really fast - moving .
That 's just my take , of course .
We want to hear which system our USB - booting readers prefer .
Tell us your preference in the poll , and detail your " other " votes , or disagreements , in the comments .
The Federal Communications Commission has declared victory after the release of an engineering study on whether its proposed free and smut - free broadband service will harm mobile phone use in other bands .
" We will be able to move forward with broadband services as proposed by FCC Chair Kevin Martin without causing undue interference to licensed users of adjacent spectrum , " Commission spokesperson Rob Kenny told Ars Technica on Friday .
" This is good news for everybody interested in bringing free broadband to those without access to the Internet . "
As Ars has reported , on Friday , September 5 , the FCC's Office of Engineering and Technology concluded a battery of wireless interference tests to determine whether the FCC 's proposal is technically doable .
The Commission is considering auctioning off the AWS - 3 ( 2155-2180 MHz ) band for a national , free broadband service that filters out smut .
The winner of the sale would be required to roll out the program over 10 years and pay a small portion of its revenue each year to the United States Treasury .
But the big wireless companies , led by T - Mobile , charged that the service could cause interference in the nearby AWS - 1 band , where the firm paid billions for spectrum in 2006 .
The company asked for a delay in the proceeding pending a series of interference tests .
Following the experiments , a T - Mobile official declared that they " verified there would be widespread , harmful interference to customers of AWS - 1 operators , including T - Mobile 's customers , from the adjacent AWS - 3 band under the FCC 's proposed rules . "
But that does not appear to be what the Commission 's OET has concluded in its report .
The summary says that " AWS - 3 devices could operate at a power level of up to 23 dBm / MHz equivalent isotropic radiated power ( EIRP ) and with out - of - band emissions ( OOBE ) attenuated by 60 + 10 * log ( P ) dB without a significant risk of harmful interference . "
That 's pretty similar to what the FCC originally proposed in its original Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking outlining the plan .
The report also adds that in the past the FCC has " adopted less stringent OOBE standards under flexible service rules whereby the licensees and industry work together cooperatively to manage potential interference . "
Needless to say , the latest news was warmly received by M2Z Networks , the biggest booster of this proposal and the most likely bidder for the service .
M2Z CEO John Muletta told
Ars that the " public interest has been held hostage for six months , " as a result of T - Mobile 's and AT&T's " unfounded claims of interference to disguise their intent to prevent the introduction of new broadband competition in the AWS - 3 band . "
" We think that now is the time to make a decision , " Muletta added .
" This will really change the opportunities for broadband . "
But T - Mobile 's circumspect response to the OET 's conclusions suggests that the company is n't throwing in the towel yet .
The company 's regulatory affairs Vice President Kathleen Ham told us that the firm " will read the report in detail to determine if [ the OET has ] correctly evaluated the extensive record for multiple parties that have expressed concern about interference .
Given the importance and complexity of these technical issues , the FCC needs to provide for sufficient time for comment on the report before any FCC action on these rules . "
The OET 's report will now be added to the proceeding record , and further comments will be considered .
Among other sticky questions to be grappled with is the First Amendment constitutionality of the FCC requiring the service to be filtered for smut .
Civil liberties groups have emphatically told the agency that the proposal as outlined will not survive court scrutiny .
The current proposal requires an " always on " network - based filtering mechanism .
The FCC's Kenny says that Commission Chair Martin is willing to consider proposals to let adults opt - out of the filter , but wants the essence of the plan to be " mindful of the fact that we need to protect children from questionable content . "
I recently found myself wishing for an async library for MySQL .
My goal is to be able to fire off queries to a group of federated servers in parallel and aggregate the results in my code .
With the standard client ( DBD : : mysql ) , I 'd have to query the servers one at a time .
If there are 10 servers and each query takes 0.5 seconds , my code would stall for 5 seconds .
But by using an async library , I could fire off all the queries and fetch the results as they become available .
The overall wait time should not be much more than 0.5 seconds .
While I found little evidence of anyone doing this in practice , my search led me to the perl - mysql-async project on Google Code .
It 's a pure - Perl implementation of the MySQL 4.1 protocol and an asyncronous client that uses Event : : Lib ( and libevent ) under the hood .
The code contains little in the way of documentation or examples , aside from the simple bundled test script .
After a bit of mucking around with it , I managed to cobble together a working example .
It looks like this :
#!/usr /bin/perl -w use strict ; use Event :: Lib ; use Data :: Dumper ; use MysqlAsync ; use AsyncCaller qw/ schedule / ; $ Data : : Dumper :: Terse = 1 ; $ |=1 ; my $ expected_results = 25 ; my $ results = 0 ; my $ dbh ; for ( 1..$expected_results ) { # my $ secs = int ( rand ( 5 ) ) ; my $ secs = rand ( 5 ) ; my $ query = qq[ select sleep ( $secs ) ] ; schedule ( 0.001 , sub{ my $ dbh = MysqlAsync -> new ( database => { host => " localhost " , port => 3306 , database => " mysql " , passwd => " xxxxxx " , user => " root " , } , connect_timeout => 1 , max_requests => 25 , db_timeout => 10 , # logfile => " / tmp/mysqllog " , ) ; $ dbh - > get_array ( $ query , \&result ) ; } ) ; } event_mainloop ( ) ; exit ; sub result { my ( $ result ) = @_ ; if ( defined $ result ) { print " result : " . Dumper ( $ result ) ; } else { print " error : " . Dumper ( $ dbh - > error ( ) ) ; } $ results ++ ; # all done ? if ( $ results == $ expected_results ) { exit ; } } __END__
Sure enough , that code runs in just a bit more time than the longest query it executes , rather than the sum of all the query times .
What still surprises me is that this code does n't appear to get a lot of use ( or at least discussion ) in the real world .
In the PHP world , the mysqlnd driver offers async queries .
So count this as my contribution to demonstrating that Perl can do async MySQL queries too .

Gay men should be forced to have ' health warning ' tattoos , says Stock Exchange chaplain
Offensive : The Rev Peter Mullen faces a possible disciplinary hearing for the remarks on his blog , which have been condemned by the Bishop of London
A leading clergyman is facing calls for his resignation after a series of outspoken remarks about gay men .
The Rev Peter Mullen , chaplain to the London Stock Exchange , called for homosexuals to be tattooed with warnings about the perils of gay sex in a cigarette - packet - style health warning .
Mr Mullen , 66 , has insisted it had all been a joke and he had nothing against gay men .
But he was forced to remove the comments from his internet blog , and the Bishop of London described them as ' highly offensive ' .
In the blog , Mr Mullen wrote : ' Let us make it obligatory for homosexuals to have their backsides tattooed with the slogan SODOMY CAN SERIOUSLY DAMAGE YOUR HEALTH .
' In addition , the obscene ' gay pride ' parades and carnivals should be banned for they give rise to passive corruption , comparable to passive smoking .
Young people forced to witness these excrescences are corrupted by them . '
Mr Mullen , who is rector of St Michael 's Cornhill and St Sepulchre without Newgate in the City of London and writes a regular column for a regional newspaper , said sex education films should be shown in schools , highlighting sodomy as a ' filthy practice ' .
The films should end , he said , with the admonition : ' We do after all , know the importance of washing our hands after going to the lavatory . '
The remarks were posted in June , a day before another posting in which he condemned the blessing of two gay priests .
Peter Cowell and David Lord became the first homosexuals to be blessed in an Anglican service - by the Rev Martin Dudley - with a traditional marriage liturgy in which they exchanged vows and rings .
The service infuriated many senior figures in the Church of England and reignited the row over gay clergy which threatens to tear apart the worldwide Anglican Communion .
It also prompted an extraordinary poem by Mr Mullen , beginning : ' The Bishop of London is in a high huff .
' Because Dr Dudley has married a puff ;
' And not just one puff - he 's married another :
' Two priests , two puffs and either to other . '
The Bishop of London , the Rt Rev Richard Chartres , issued a public rebuke to Mr Mullen , who was ordained in 1970 and has been in the historic Stock Exchange post since 1998 .
A spokesman said : ' While clergy are entitled to their own personal views , we recognise that the content of this text is highly offensive and is in no way reflective of the views of the Diocese of London . '
Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell accused Mr Mullen of ' quite outrageous homophobia ' .
He said : ' As a chaplain , Rev Mullen ought to be a spiritual guide to all employees of the Stock Exchange .
' He should resign or be sacked .
If he was mocking black or Jewish people in a similar vein , the Stock Exchange would instantly remove him and the Church would relieve him of his duties .
' He is not even fit to be a parish priest . '
A spokesman for the Stock Exchange said the clergyman had no formal role and that it was merely a historical ' legacy title ' .
Mr Mullen insisted his remarks had been in jest .
' I wrote some satirical things on my blog and anybody with an ounce of sense of humour or any understanding of the tradition of English satire would immediately assume that they 're light - hearted jokes , ' he said .
' I certainly have nothing against homosexuals .
Many of my dear friends have been and are of that persuasion .
' What I have got against them is the militant preaching of homosexuality . '

IRVING , Texas -- Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo has a broken finger on his throwing hand and could be out as long as four weeks .
Romo , who had started 30 straight regular - season games since replacing Drew Bledsoe in 2006 , broke his right pinkie on the first play of overtime in a 30 - 24 loss at Arizona on Sunday .
" We do n't know how long he 'll be out .
It depends on how fast that heals , " coach Wade Phillips said Monday .
" I 'd say week to week , depending on quickly he heals .
Different people heal differently . "
The injury , which Phillips said wo n't require surgery , leaves the Cowboys ( 4 - 2 ) with 40 - year - old Brad Johnson as the starter .
Johnson , who won a Super Bowl with Tampa Bay , has n't started a game since 2006 in Minnesota .
" It 's unfortunate for Tony to have to go through something like this , " Johnson said .
" He 'll recover quick , he has a great attitude about it .
" At this time , it 's really just important for the offense especially to just kind of catch on to my snap count , and the way we manage the huddle . "
The Cowboys had no plans Monday to sign a veteran quarterback or trade for one before Tuesday 's trade deadline , a team source told ESPN's Michael Smith .
Romo missed on three straight passes to start the overtime , having passed for 321 yards and three touchdowns in regulation despite heavy pressure .
He was sacked three times and knocked down 19 times .
" Obviously , he had trouble throwing the ball that last series in overtime , " Phillips said .
Romo , whose hand was heavily wrapped after the game , fumbled three times Sunday , losing one , but -- for the first time in nine games -- did n't throw an interception .

After reading DnD 4th Ed Alignments over at tenletter , I felt inspired to comment a bit on my own experience and opinion of alignments and related concepts in RPGs :
What I ’m Doing with Alignments :
Right now , I ’m running a D&D 3.5 game ( plus house rules ) with standard two - axis alignments .
When you make a character , you choose one from Lawful / Neutral / Chaotic , and one from Good / Neutral / Evil .
I just went with the traditional choice that has existed since the dawn of Advanced Dungeons in Dragons in the late ’ 70s .
I think , in my next campaign world , I ’m going back to having the single - axis Law / Chaos alignment system that existed in the original D&D before AD&D came up .
Good and evil are choices , and not defining characteristics , for members of PC races .
Law and Chaos , on the other hand , will be the only alignment deities and supernatural beings really have , and PCs can subscribe to one or the other .
Most members of PC races would either be neutral in the “ unaligned ” sense or choose either Law or Chaos because they equate one or the other with Good , but the truth is that both contribute to Good and Evil pretty much equally .
I do n’t think a character should be locked into Good or Evil , ever .
Law and Chaos , on the other hand , could be literal alignments — you choose to dedicate , to align , yourself with one or the other for some reason .
Thus , you might have anarchists versus totalitarians , with both sides holding to their ideals for “ the good of the world ” .
Meanwhile , you could have two Lawful gods that are allied against Chaos , one disapproves of the other ’s methods even if their ends are the same , while the other disapproves of the first one ’s squeamishness and unwillingness to do what needs to be done to assure victory over the forces of Chaos .
The same might exist in reverse on the Chaos side of things , of course .
Ultimately , what it all boils down to is that there is a mystical , metaphysical True Law and True Chaos , while Good and Evil are defined more by what you do in any given moment , and are a matter of choice rather than absolutes .
Then again , in another campaign world at a later time , I might try using only the Good / Evil axis .
We ’ll see .
Other Games and the Alignment Issue :
Rifts and other Palladium Books games have an interesting alignment system , which does n’t specifically rely on any particular axes .
Instead , each alignment is simply its own description of underlying , somewhat archetypal motivations , including options like Scrupulous , Unprincipled , and Miscreant .
It works well .
Old - school Vampire : the Masquerade , meanwhile , was more personality - oriented ; you ’d choose a couple of personality descriptors that do things for you like define circumstances under which your character might regain Willpower points for successfully pursuing personal core motivations , and different types of vampire character would have different moralities , each with their own virtues and sins defined for them .
The implication in V:tM was that one could easily create a new moral system like the others just for one ’s own character , suggesting a very relative nature to morality .
Other World of Darkness games did n’t have the same codified systems of morality , however — that was a uniquely Vampire - oriented thing , and tied in with the vampire character ’s fight against the complete takeover of the Beast within ( or the attempt to reconcile oneself with that Beast , to make peace with it , in some cases ) .
I do n’t really know what ’s happening on the “ alignment ” front in the rebooted World of Darkness , and do n’t particularly care , having chosen to boycott White Wolf years ago .
Star Wars games have had an interesting time trying to work with the Light Side and the Dark Side of the Force , since it ’s all part of a canon created outside the realm of roleplaying games , George Lucas is n’t involved in RPG design ( probably a Good Thing ) , and nobody really seems to want to agree on what the Light and Dark Sides of the Force actually represent .
While the prequel trilogy sucked in too many ways to count , they did introduce some good , interesting new ideas , including a weird kind of sense that the Light Side is basically just Law and Community , while the Dark Side is Chaos and Individuality .
The fact that the representatives of the Dark Side are , for the most part , bad people seems in some respects to be more of an accident than any intrinsic characteristic of the Dark Side itself .
Remember , Darth Vader was the realization of a prophecy that Anakin would “ bring balance to the Force ” , implying that the ascendancy of the Jedi order , and its domination of all things Force - related , was in some respects a sickness .
There are , naturally , games that eschew the concept of alignments entirely , for whatever reason .
The Price of Freedom and Cyberpunk come to mind .
My Opinions on Alignments :
I do n’t know that there ’s any such thing as a One True Alignment System .
Different worlds can benefit from different alignment systems , even within the same game .
Alignment systems affect the flavor of the game so strongly that limiting oneself to the specific alignment system presented in a Player ’s Handbook in all its particulars , with no willingness to alter it to suit your particular campaign setting , strikes me as foolish and unimaginative .
Some games are better off with no alignment system equivalent at all , of course — like The Price of Freedom or Cyberpunk .
What I do know is that I find the bizarre limitations of the 4th Ed alignment system , complete with its very authoritarian worldview that implies a strictly Lawful philosophy is Extra Good , and the less dedicated you are to Law and Order the more Evil you must be , pretty damned ridiculous .
As for the problem of multiple interpretations of different alignments , I do n’t see a problem with that .
Several people can be Good People in the real world and yet have incompatible moral codes .
Let the interpretation of the alignment depend on the individual , rather than expecting everybody in the world to have the same exact notion of what an alignment means .
If you want your Lawful Evil character to be a power - hungry would - be dictator , while someone else wants his Lawful Evil character to be a petty bureaucrat who delights in meting out punishments to those who disturb the order and tranquility of her life , I do n’t see why that has to mean someone ’s “ wrong ” in his or her interpretation of what Lawful Evil means .
Mr. Bramble told Reuters ’ pool reporter that he was n’t voting for Obama because he did n’t think he had enough experience .
Bramble ’s wife , Kit , 75 , said after meeting Obama , “ He was very nice ” but added she ’d been a conservative Republican since Barry Goldwater ’s era and she would n’t vote for Obama .
The gentleman next to Fanning , Lenox Bramble , 76 , flashed an angry look at her .
“ Be civil , be courteous , ” he admonished her .
Another woman , Cecilia Hayslip , 61 , yelled back at Fanning ( per Reuters ) , “ At least he ’s not a warmonger ! ”
There was a lot of noise and excitement and positive reception as well and it was unclear whether Obama heard her .
12:33 p.m. Sen. Barack Obama entered the barbecue joint where an older and majority white clientele of dozens was eating lunch after church services .
At the other end of the restaurant , Diane Fanning , 54 , who works at a discount club , began yelling : “ Socialist , socialist , socialist - – get out of here ! ”
... that “ Colin Powell is a RINO , R - I - N - O , Republican In Name Only .
This is my one day off , ” she muttered .
Later , Obama came to the long table where Fanning and other members of a local First Presbyterian church were gathered .
He held out his hand to her to shake it and asked , “ How are you , ma’am ? ” but she declined to shake .
He spoke at length with many of the other parishioners at the long banquet table , however , and got a much friendlier reception as he spoke about healthcare , taxes and Social Security .
Fanning told the pool reporter , “ Some of them are just nicer than I am .
I know how some of them think . ”
But several of her fellow churchgoers said their support was genuine .
Betty Waylett , 76 , told him , “ You ’re doing a great job . ”
She told the pool reporter she is a Republican but will vote for Obama because she likes the way he speaks and his manner .
Waylett , who is white , said Obama ’s race was not a factor .
“ I never thought about it one way or the other . ”
Pastor Randal Bremer , also at the table , said Obama told him , “ Whether you vote for me or not I ’ll need your prayers . ”
Bremer told the pool reporter , “ I ’m very impressed by his ability to meet people on a down - to - earth level ” and that he would pray from him but that he planned to vote for John McCain , mostly because he prefers smaller government and McCain ’s position on the Iraq war .
He thinks there have been important gains in Iraq and “ I do n’t want to see that damaged by a premature pullout . ”
Bloomberg news quotes Mike Long , 33 , a furniture salesman who is a first - time voter , said ( per Bloomberg ) that after talking with Obama about healthcare , he ’d gone from less than 50 % likely to vote for him to “ 98 % ” likely .
Sheila Evans , 39 , who is biracial , told Obama , “ I ’m so proud of you . ”
She said Obama had chosen a restaurant frequented more by whites , while one a couple of doors down had predominantly African American diners on Sundays .
But some of the other older white diners looked surprised and slightly uncomfortable as Obama stopped at their tables to shake hands .
“ I ’m surprised , but I ’m not going to say anything else , ” said diner Pat Smith who was joined by her husband .
A group of six retired women said they were mostly Democrats - – but mostly undecided about how to vote .
“ I have to pray about it , think about what ’s best for our country , ” said Dorothy Buie , one of the women .
Obama ordered some food to go for himself and aides .
They ordered chicken , collard greens , baked beans , cole slaw and wings .
The tab was $ 13.91 .
The visit lasted about a half hour .

The I - Ball camera allows troops to see into hostile areas A " grenade " camera , that would enable soldiers to look into hazardous areas , is being developed for UK troops .
Dubbed the I - Ball the wireless device is robust enough to survive being thrown onto a battlefield .
The I - Ball 's internal camera gives a 360 degree view , with images being sent from the instant it is launched .
It is thought the new technology would enable soldiers to see into potential danger spots without putting themselves at risk of ambush .
We are very excited about the technology 's potential to help our troops
Paul Thompson , Dreampact
The ball can be fired from a grenade launcher - or thrown into a room - giving troops vital information of who - or what - is on the ground or around the corner .
Scoping out Inside the sphere are image sensors and two fish - eye lenses .
The data is then sent back and remapped through a type of processor known as a Field Programmable Gate Array which compensates for spin and tumble and then displays a true 360 image in real time .
The concept came about as part of the Ministry of Defence 's ( MoD ) Competition of Ideas in 2007 .
Urban terrain is a very dangerous environment in which to operate Paul Thompson , from Scotland - based firm Dreampact , which is developing the I - Ball , said that although the gadget was still in the early stages of development , he had high hopes of it being able to perform well on the battlefield .
" We have overcome some significant technological challenges in developing the I - Ball technology , " he said .
" Although it is in its early stages , we are very excited about the technology 's potential to help our troops to be better prepared for battle .
"
The MOD 's director of technology development - Professor Andrew Baird - also sounded a positive note .
" The technology behind I - Ball is an exciting new development that has very significant potential across a range of military equipment and operational scenarios , particularly in difficult urban operations , " he said .

The call came in to Tower 41 Condominium , a salmon - pink set of buildings on Pine Tree Drive , on February 22 , 2006 .
Why , asked real estate broker Ricardo Herran , had his client 's application to live there been rejected ?
In a hushed voice , a curly - haired secretary told him : " It 's two men .... Residents are conservative . "
Herran 's client , Steven Bloomfield , is gay .
He is also a dream tenant .
The slight , bespectacled 48 - year - old makes six figures , has stellar credit , and is about as imposing as a granny in a rocking chair .
" My face got hot with humiliation and rage , " he says .
" I felt like a piece of shit . "
Info gay hate
The Miami -Dade Equal Opportunity Board ( EOB ) found this past August 22 that the Tower 41 Condominium Association had discriminated against Bloomfield and his partner Jose Gonzalez based on sexual orientation .
This finding might cost the condo owners money in court .
And on gay - friendly Miami Beach , it could damage the building 's reputation as a peaceful , welcoming place .
This case is just the beginning .
Even as complaints about discrimination against gays have increased in Miami - Dade — up from five to a record 29 last year — county commissioners have chopped the board 's annual budget from about $ 600,000 to $ 300,000 .
Administrators recently laid off half of the discrimination investigators , bringing staff down to five .
All of this comes at a time when " we 're up to our ears in cases , " says EOB Director Marcos Regalado .
The county began tracking complaints only in 1998 , when commissioners overwhelmingly approved a human rights ordinance banning discrimination based on sexual orientation .
In describing the vote , the New York Times cited as a catalyst civic leaders ' belief that " intolerance was bad for an economy that depended on tourism . "
Almost immediately , reports about gay discrimination spiked .
People complained they 'd been turned down for apartments , fired from jobs , and treated badly in stores .
The task of investigating went to the EOB , which handles about 380 cases per year related to housing , employment , and public accommodation discrimination for all minority groups .
The board has no power to penalize those who behave badly , but its findings have strong influence in court .
Many property owners and others settle cases in mediation rather than have the findings made public .
The board often recommends offending businesses take sensitivity classes .
The EOB has considered about 160 gay - related cases over the years .
Among the recent ones :
• In May 2006 , Nicole Waters and Viviana Villagra were turned away from Creative Weddings , a Coral Gables boutique , after requesting their names be printed on a wedding invitation .
Owner Erasmo Cruz allegedly stepped back from the counter and stated , " I am a Christian . "
After mediation , Cruz was required to pay $ 300 and take classes .
• The next month , handyman Jorge Sarasti claimed bosses at The Grand Condominium , near the Venetian Causeway , repeatedly harassed him .
In one instance , he said , a boss brought a black dildo to work and told him : " You like the big dicks . "
Sarasti was fired soon after that .
The case is still open .
• In March 2007 , Nelson Bernal was fired from Cosmetic Dermatology in Coral Gables for complimenting a male co-worker in an e-mail .
His bosses interpreted the statement as a come - on and terminated him without proper procedure .
After mediation , he took home a $ 2,000 settlement .
• In June 2007 , Renita Holmes said she was threatened and kept out of a public meeting by Martin Luther King Economic Development Corporation in Liberty City because of her butch appearance .
A group of " good old boys " kicked her out , she says .
The case is still open .
The Bloomfield case is among the most clear - cut conflicts the EOB has seen , says board investigator Bennie Barnes : " It 's like finding a four - leaf clover . "
In most gay discrimination cases , he says , " manor and methods are more subtle , " which makes evidence harder to come by .
In fall 2005 , Bloomfield learned that a job transfer would soon bring him and Gonzalez to Miami from New York City .
On January 18 , he drove by Tower 41 and liked the neighborhood .
The next day , he returned and found elderly Jewish folks speaking Yiddish in the lobby .
He felt safe and appreciated the quiet , calm atmosphere .
A scrawny 80 - year - old condo association member wearing a yarmulke gave Bloomfield a tour , he recalls .
While he was viewing a living room , a woman in the building questioned him about a roommate .
" She asked me in a very nosy way , " he says .
" It made me nervous . "
Though he 's openly gay , he answered , " I 'll be living with a friend . "
Ten days later , he submitted a rental application and followed it up with a payment of $ 7,500 , for five months ' rent and deposit .
One thing he thought was odd : Board members asked for photographs .
The couple reluctantly submitted head shots .
The condo association ran multiple credit reports and criminal background checks .
They even requested Gonzalez 's immigration papers .
Everything came up clean .
By February 16 , Bloomfield learned he had been approved to rent , so the couple paid made arrangements to move in March 1 , 2006 .
Gonzalez quit school in New York and canceled his gym membership .
Bloomfield cleaned out his office desk at American Express and hired movers to pack up his New York condo .
A week later — three days before they were scheduled to leave — their agent Ricardo Herran phoned a secretary named Kate at Tower 41 .
She informed him " they " had not been approved .
She said the association was looking for dirt on the couple , had found nothing , but denied the pair anyway .

Advertisement Messages have been sent to a planet 20 light years from Earth in the hope they will reach intelligent alien life .
Some 501 photos , drawings and text messages were transmitted on Thursday by a giant radio - telescope in Ukraine normally used to track asteroids .
The target planet was chosen as it is thought capable of supporting life .
Any reply to the messages - collated through a competition by the social networking website Bebo - would not reach Earth for 40 years .
The competition - A Message From Earth - invited Bebo's 12 m users to send in missives they would like extra-terrestrials to receive .
The beamed messages will be sent 120 trillion miles into space Topics submitted ranged from the environment , politics and world peace to family relationships and the sender 's first kiss .
Having been translated into a binary format , the 500 selected will travel 120 trillion miles into space after being sent via high - powered radio waves from the National Space Agency of Ukraine 's RT - 70 radar telescope in Evpatoria .
Here we are After being launched at 0600 GMT Bebo's mission commander Oli Madgett said the message " passed the Moon in 1.7 seconds , Mars in just four minutes and will leave our Solar System before breakfast tomorrow " .
Organisers hope the hi-tech package will reach its target - the planet Gliese 581C - in early 2029 .
Bebo spokesman Mark Charkin said : " A Message From Earth presents an opportunity for the digital natives of today ... to reconnect with science and the wider universe in a simple , fun and immersive way . "
If anybody 's out there and they find that signal , they at least know it that ... there must be a planet with some pretty clever things on it
Seth Shostak
SETI astronomer Seth Shostak , a senior astronomer from the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence Institute in California , said whether aliens who might receive the messages would understand them was beside the point .
" The point might simply be : well , here we are ; we 're clever enough to build a radio transmitter , " he told the BBC .
" So if anybody 's out there and they find that signal , they at least know it that , in the direction of that star system over there , there must be a planet with some pretty clever things on it . "

What are these ?
One of the important communication mechanisms in the Mozilla project is IRC .
IRC is a great tool for instant communication among large groups of diverse people .
However , it ’s easy to mis-use IRC , so I ’d like to propose some etiquette rules :
Think / search before your ask
Google can answer a fair number of questions .
Keep the signal / noise ratio high on IRC by checking FAQs and google before asking questions .
Ask questions in the right channel
Some channels welcome newbies : #xulrunner and #extdev specifically welcome new XULRunner application authors and extension developers .
Some channels ( # developers ) are used for serious / deep project communication , and do n’t really welcome novices .
If you ’re not sure , feel free to silently watch the channel for a few minutes .
If you do n’t know which channel is right , feel free to ask “ is this the right channel to ask questions about X ” .
The channel residents will let you know !
IRC is not good for some questions
Complicated questions are difficult to answer on IRC : “ When I configure with –enable - XX while cross- compiling from YY , I have problem ZZ . ”
To answer this question you need to sort through all sorts of issues such as why you ’re using –enable - XX , what the actual error message is , and details about the cross - compile setup .
You ’d be much better off posting this question to the appropriate newsgroup ( mozilla.dev.builds in this case ) .
If I say to you “ please post details about this question to the newsgroup ” , it ’s not because I do n’t like you or do n’t want to help you … it ’s because IRC is n’t a good medium for answering your particular question .
IRC does n’t take up my whole attention
Most of the people on IRC are also doing work ( coding , reviewing , writing , whatever ) .
If somebody does n’t have time to talk to you right now , feel free to wait for somebody else to come along , or send email / post to the newsgroups .
Demanding somebody ’s attention on IRC is very rude .
If you really need their attention , send email .
Do n’t send uninvited private messages
Asking questions in the appropriate channel is nice behavior .
Other people in the channel can look at the conversation and even provide help .
By sending me a private message , you are demanding my attention ( see above ) , and drastically limiting the number of people who can help you .
Unless you know me really well , do n’t send me private messages .
IRC is not email
If I do n’t respond to you right away , do n’t assume that I ’ve seen your message .
If I do n’t respond to your message and you need to get in touch with me , please send me email .
Please do n’t ping every four hours until I respond to you .
Day by day , the dreams of hundreds of millions of people around the world are being smashed .
It is a terrible thing to see from the sidelines .
It is far worse to be a participant .
The dreams of easy retirement are disappearing .
So are the dreams of automatic wealth .
Americans , more than any other people , bought into the dream of automatic wealth .
“ Just buy a larger home with 5 % down and wait .
You will get rich . ”
The dream of leveraged money trapped homeowners .
It also trapped hedge fund investors .
This dream has yet to play itself out in a wave of bankruptcies .
It will .
Hedge funds , leveraged 30 to 1 , have few reserves apart from stocks in their portfolios .
When the stock market falls , they receive margin calls .
They must sell more stocks .
This depresses the stock market , which triggers more margin calls .
Getting rich looked easy when stocks were rising .
Going bankrupt looks easy now .
Leverage is a two - way street .
The sellers of dreams are still in business .
“ Buy stocks and hold . ”
“ Do n’t sell in a panic . ”
“ This market will rebound . ”
“ The decline in the American stock market since March 2000 is an aberration . ”
“ We ’re bullish on America . ” “ The government ’s bailouts will work . ”
“ The market is approaching a bottom . ”
Those who were seduced by the dream want to believe these reassurances .
There is a market for these reassurances .
But , week by week , the audience is shrinking .
So is their capital .
Recovery is a dream based on fiat money .
Prices will go back up , say the cheerleaders .
Yes , they will .
When the Federal Reserve System pumps in new money at over 300 % per annum , which it did from late August to late October ( adjusted monetary base ) , eventually prices will rise .
But few people will be made richer .
Here is the three - step religion of recovery : monetary inflation , increased Federal spending , and regulation .
Congress promises to implement this program until the dream revives .
Congress promises monetary inflation without price inflation , Federal spending without the crowding out of capital to fund business , and regulation without bureaucracy .
This program will not work .
It can not work .
We need the opposite program : monetary stability , Federal surpluses , and reduced bureaucracy .
We will not get this program . . . ever .
The dream was always naïve .
The Reagan revolution was based on monetary inflation after the weekend of August 13 , 1982 , when the FED ’s tight - money policy , which began in the fall of 1979 under Carter , was self - consciously reversed in the wake of the Mexican bank crisis .
The Reagan revolution was also based on massive Federal deficits , beginning in 1983 .
While bureaucracy ’s grasping hand did decline under Reagan , as evidenced by the reduction of pages in the “ Federal Register ” from 60,000 a year to under 40,000 a year in his first term , it started back up in his second term .
It has continued to rise to its present 70,000 a year .
The dream of easy wealth through easy money and debt has accelerated in every American generation since the end of World War II .
We have now come to a new phase .
Money will be far easier as the Federal Reserve inflates , but profits through debt will become more elusive .
Meanwhile , those few Americans who have pension funds dream of the return of the boom of 1982 to 2000 .
THE STOCK MARKET
Last Friday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 300 points .
This was considered a good day .
It had been down over 600 points in the first hour .
Volatility is constant .
The experts do not know whether this market is ready to soar or not .
My guess : it ’s not .
Alan Abelson , who has been writing a wry weekly column for Barron ’s for over 30 years , cited the work of John Harris .
Harris says that in the years since 1928 , whenever a Presidential election is accompanied by a bear stock market , the market continued down to year ’s end after the election in four out of four cases : 1932 , 1948 , 1952 , and 2000 .
The average loss on the S&P 500 was 5.9 % , but on average the low was 10 % .
Past is not necessarily prologue , but it surely is attention - catching .
EXHAUSTION
The experts say that the traditional sign of a bear market climax is a panic sell - off of shares .
This is called exhaustion .
Exhaustion can produce a bottom .
It also creates a sucker ’s rally .
In October 2002 the S&P 500 bottomed at 777 .
That was one of the strangest oddities in stock market history .
On Friday the 13th , August 1982 , the Dow bottomed at 777 .
The S&P 500 arrived at 777 in a most intriguing way .
It closed below 800 in mid-2002 .
Then it soared back to about 950 .
Then it fell back to 777 .
Then it soared again to about 950 .
Then it fell back below 800 .
Only in the first quarter of 2003 did it begin its long trek back up .
It peaked in late October 2007 .
Then the rout began .
The bulls are waiting for the final sell - off .
They tell people to stay in this market , yet they also predict a final sell - off .
It seems to me that it is better to sell your shares — all of them — and short the market .
This way , you profit from the final sell - off .
But the analysts never mention this strategy , let alone recommend it .
Despite the fact that exhaustion has not happened , the analysts also assure us that the stock market is still fundamentally sound — Herbert Hoover ’s famous phrase from 1930 to 1932 .
There is bad economic news on all fronts , but somehow the stock market is sound .
Yet the economy is in recession — something the analysts have denied until recent weeks .
The stock market ’s bottom is supposed to send a message : the economy is going to recover in six months .
Or nine months .
Yet the experts are now talking about a recession that lasts longer than the traditional 11 months .
Then why should the stock market be close to the bottom ?
“ IS IT CRASH YET ? ”
The economy is slowly sagging .
This has not been like a fall off a cliff .
It has been more like a stroll down a hill .
The overleveraged behemoths of finance have taken huge hits , as have the taxpayers , but the economy is not showing signs of anything remotely catastrophic .
There seems to be a disconnect between the stock markets of the world and the world economy .
The Hang Seng index of Hong Kong is down by two - thirds over the last year .
Yet the Chinese economy , while slowing , still seems to be growing above 7 % .
These are government - supplied figures .
We should not take them too seriously .
But the trend is still positive .
Are the Asian stock markets not forecasting really bad news to come in 2009 ?
This is what bullish analysts ought to argue .
We are told that the Hang Seng index is selling off because profit projections had been wildly optimistic a year ago .
Maybe so , but the question remains :
Why ?
The answer is the Austrian theory of the trade cycle .
The economic boom is created by rising monetary inflation .
The bust occurs when the rate of monetary expansion slows .
The Chinese central bank is slowing the rate of monetary inflation .
It had pumped in money ( M1 ) at a rate of close to 20 % per annum for several years .
Year to year in September , M1 rose at less than 10 % .
In June of 2007 , I predicted what I thought was going to happen in China .
The bubble in China resembles the bubble 1995 — 2000 NASDAQ in the United States .
The Chinese stock market is trading at a price / earnings ratio above 50 .
Some stocks are trading at 80 .
In a speech on June 12 , Alan Greenspan commented , “ Some of these price - earnings ratios are discounting Nirvana . ”
But let us not forget that the NASDAQ reached a p/e ratio of more than 200 in December , 1999 .
In late January , I wrote this :
At some point , China ’s central bank will be successful in slowing price inflation .
The economic boom requires ever - larger percentage increases of the money supply .
By merely following the policies of the previous year , the central bank will produce a recession .
If the central bank is serious about slowing inflation through interest rate increases , it will see its goal achieved .
Price inflation will in fact slow .
The cause of the slowdown will be a recession in China .
What could trigger this ?
A recession in the United States could .
Falling demand for the goods produced by China ’s export sector will produce bankruptcies in China .
They will order no more goods and services .
These effects will ripple through the Chinese economy .
In the absence of the recessionary efforts of central bank policy , these ripples could be contained by growth in the other sectors .
But a reduction of Chinese economic growth is already in the pipeline .
The central bank ’s policy of letting interest rates rise is sufficient to create a domestic recession .
China is now where I thought it would be .
China is cutting jobs in the export sector .
The government is intervening to save jobs — the standard approach of governments all over the world .
In short , the recession is spreading fast .
The crash in Asian stock markets is not a random event .
We have not had a crash in American stocks comparable to the fall in Asian stocks , but the trend is relentless .
The stock market does not reverse for long .
Optimism is fading .
But it still remains .
The average pension fund investor has not called the fund to tell it to stop buying stocks .
He does not have to tell the fund to sell — just stop buying .
Because companies match investments in 401 ( k ) programs , investors stay in .
They are told endlessly that American stocks will return to their tradition of producing 7 % per annum returns , despite the fact that the Dow is down sharply from its peak in 2000 of 11,700 , even without the 22 % loss to price inflation .
The bulk of retirement investors still believe the mantra , despite the evidence .
The falling economy will push down profits .
This will push down the denominator of the price / earnings ratio .
Prices will fall .
The stock market has obviously reversed its momentum .
It heads lower , week by week .
The public cannot seem to come to grips with what I have been predicting ever since last November : the end of the boom in stocks and the coming of a long recession .
CONCLUSION
I think the market will get exhaustion .
There will be a sharp move downward .
But I also expect to see a repeat of 2002 and 2003 : spiked upward moves followed by spikes downward .
When will this happen ?
I do n’t know .
The market is grinding away investors ’ optimism .
This psychology has not yet moved to real pessimism — when investors abandon the constant slogan , “ Do n’t sell in a panic . ”
They should have sold calmly a year ago .

These compensation figures are taken from the summary compensation tables included in public companies ' 2007 proxy statements ( DEF 14A form ) , as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
As such , the tallies represent essentially what each CEO cost his company in fiscal year 2007 -- not what the CEO pocketed .
For example , while these numbers include stock awards and option awards , the figures in the compensation table represent the cost of these awards to the company in fiscal year 2007 .
That 's less than face value , since the company ( from a financial reporting perspective ) accounts for the expense over the vesting period of the award .
" You 're seeing the charges of the previous awards that are vesting in that year and are being reflected in the financial statements of the company , " explains Nora McCord , a consultant at Steven Hall & Partners , which specializes in executive compensation consulting .
" So it 's not [ the full value of ] what was awarded that year , it 's kind of an amalgamation of what has been awarded and what is still vesting from previous years . "

In his radio talk show today , Bill O’Reilly blew up at some of his usual recent targets , like Chris Dodd and Barney Frank .
But he also notably excoriated President Bush and his fellow conservative radio hosts , guys with whom most people assume O’Reilly identifies .
The entire tape is after the jump , but here are his best lines :
• “ Most talk radio is conservative - dominated , ideologue , Kool - Aid–drinking idiots . ”
• “ It ’s Clinton ’s fault ?
Clinton has n’t been in office in eight years .
It ’s Bush ’s fault ! ”
• “ These [ conservative talk ] idiots are misleading you , they ’re lying to you . ”
• “ Walk away from these liars , these right - wing liars .
They ’re not looking out for you . ”
• “ Barney Frank … disgusting .
Pointing fingers .
It ’s you , you big fat toad ! ”
• “ If they were in this room right now , I ’d hit them , Dodd and Frank . ”
We might have just shed a tear .
The facts are these : a trend that began in the 1960s is holding back kids one year before they start kindergarten .
Instead of starting at 5 , they start at 6 .
Part of this is due to changes in state laws which have pushed back the enrollment age cut off ( e.g. must be 5 by September , instead of by December ) .
But this is only a small part .
There are three important trends .
First , the kids held back are not being kept at home -- they are being enrolled in preschools .
So it is a purposeful delay of kindergarten specifically , not a delay of " going away to school . "
Second , upper income , white parents hold their kids back at the highest rate .
Infer as you will .
Third , boys are held back at higher rates than girls , and this difference is increasing every year .
Unfortunately , the authors draw the wrong set of conclusions from these findings .
For their own ( good ) reasons , they are arguing the impact on society , not on the individual .
For example , while there is a clear benefit in the first few grades to being one year older , the authors find that this improvement is not present later on in high school .
In fact , they show , the older kids are at a significant disadvantage -- for example , higher drop out rates .
But if a kid is one year older when he drops out , he 'll have finished one less year of school , so yes , he 'll be less educated .
But the expectation of the kids of the upper income parents -- the highest rate -- is n't that they 're going to drop out .
So this negative does n't apply to those kids .
Similarly , the authors say the delay depresses lifetime earnings ; but this is obviously only because they will work one year less in their lives .
Again , the individuals themselves do n't care about this ; society and the tax collectors do .
Where they do see benefit is in athletics : an older varsity player will be , on average , stronger than a younger one .
The practice of benching someone for a year so that they get older is redshirting , and the authors apply it to the kindergarten process as well .
So on the one hand , the practice has two clear negatives on society ; but the more urgent question -- the one that would actually influence the practice -- is the impact on the kids themselves ..
First , you have a class problem .
On the one hand , it sounds easy to criticize this practice as the social engineering of the rich .
But , on the other hand , if the other parents around you are doing it , how can you not do it yourself ?
Would you willingly put your kid at a theoretical disadvantage when you have the means to not do that ?
It 's similar to the universal healthcare counter - argument : can you force a group of people to accept worse healthcare than they are getting now ?
To accept it for their kids ?
And this puts pressure on less affluent but aspiring parents to do the same -- the difference being that their five year olds wo n't be in private preschools , they 'll be in daycares .
They will , in effect , get one less year of " education " than the rich kids .
What they hope will be a competitive advantage may be a disadvantage .
In other words , they ' might be screwed either way .
As I say to everyone who will listen , which is no one , you can't blame the rich for doing it , and you can't blame the poor for wanting to riot .
Second , one might ask why this is happening to boys more than girls .
It 's obvious to anyone who has ever seen a boy that they appear , as compared to a similarly aged girl , completely retarded .
So it makes sense that affluent parents -- any parents -- who have the option , will redshirt their five year old boy and hope he gets another year of maturity under his belt so that -- and this is my point -- he can keep up with the girls .
So the problem is n't simply that boys mature slower than girls , it is that they are required to perform the same exact skills at the same exact time .
Any surprise boys hate school more , " ADHD " is more prevalent , etc ?
And there is more anxiety and thus pressure about the potential ineptitude of sons than daughters .
What 's interesting and upsetting about the discussion of redshirting is that it is phrased in terms of class differences , which are the consequence ; and not gender differences , which are a source .
The problem is n't redshirting , the problem is the school .
You expect your five year old boy to read like a girl ?
And when he does n't -- what ?
Hates reading ?
Hates girls ?
Third , you have the problem of the parents themselves who are looking for every advantage to give their kids because they do n't know what else to do , they can't judge what 's valuable or not .
So they look around at other kids and parents , and compete .
They do n't know what the point of an education is , so they say " get into a good college . "
That 's the goal of 18 + years of education .
That single outcome .
For what ?
They pretend that they have to do these things because the other kids do have these advantages , but they have no faith in the kids themselves -- that their outcome will be largely independent of what college they go to or even if they go to college .
College is , in a word , a scam ; everything that promotes that goal is therefore doubly so .
I 'm a doctor -- no one has ever asked where I went to college ; no one has ever asked how I did in high school chemistry .
You can argue these things were important then , to get into medical school , but they really were n't .
Getting
Bs instead of As may have meant I went to a different school , but not that I would n't have been a doctor , or a good one , or a bad one .
And since my real education did n't come from the schools anyway , it 's moot .
I wonder , and I have not studied this , if one positive consequence of redshirting is that studies that show American students are dumber in math than other international kids may be bunk , since those studies compare kids of similar ages , not similar grades .
Our 15 year olds may simply be in an earlier grade .
This may also explain why the education gap disappears in college .
I 'm tempted to conclue that the problem of redshirting is analogous to abortion : instead of trying to convince people it is a good or bad thing , we should just try to eliminate the need for it .

The failure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , setting in motion the biggest government bailout / takeover in U.S. history , brings a grim sense of fulfillment to competent economists .
After all , what did people expect , that water would flow uphill forever ?
This financial mega-mess is the same sort of event as the collapse of the USSR ’s centrally planned economy , another economically unworkable Rube Goldberg apparatus that was kept going , more or less badly , for decades before it fell apart completely .
Along the way , of course , famous ( yet actually unsound ) economists assured the world that everything was working out splendidly .
As late as 1989 , when the pillars were crumbling on all sides of the temple , Nobel Prize winner Paul A. Samuelson informed readers of his widely used textbook , “ The Soviet economy is proof that . . . a socialist command economy can function and even thrive . ”
In the future , we will see a similar breakdown of the U.S. government ’s Social Security system , with its ill - fated pension system and its even more inauspicious Medicare system of financing health care for the elderly .
These government schemes are fighting a losing battle against demographic realities , the laws of economics , and the rules of arithmetic .
The question is not whether they will fail , but when — and then how the government that can no longer sustain them in their previous Ponzi - scheme form will alter them to salvage what little can be salvaged with minimal damage to the government itself .
Our political economy is rife with such catastrophes in waiting , yet the public always seems startled , and outraged , when the day of reckoning can no longer be deferred , and another apartment collapses in the state ’s Hotel of Impossible Promises , loading onto the taxpayers more visibly the burden of sheltering the previous occupants .
Each of these time bombs has at least one element in common : it promises current benefits , often seemingly without cost ; but if it must acknowledge a substantial cost , it places that burden somewhere in the distant future , where it will be borne by somebody else .
From the standpoint of society in general , every such scheme is a species of eating the seed corn .
It satisfies the public ’s appetite to consume something for nothing right now , with no thought for the morrow .
It represents the height of irresponsibility by permitting people to live higher today than they can truly afford , financing this profligacy by borrowing recklessly and by taxing politically weak and ill - organized people in order to shower benefits on politically strong and well - organized special interests .
Call it democracy in action or utterly corrupt governance ; they are the same thing .
The architecture of the Hotel of Impossible Promises is not arcane .
All competent economists understand these things .
Ludwig von Mises explained as early as 1920 why a centrally planned economy could not work as a rational system of allocating resources .
The reasons why Social Security , especially its Medicare component , and many other such government programs contain the seeds of their own destruction have been explained time and again .
Are the politicians who construct these structures really such idiots that they cannot understand the logic of what they are doing ?
Not at all .
But they are not striving to create economically viable institutions that serve the general public interest ; they are feathering their own electoral nests in the only way they can in the context of our political institutions .
As H. L. Mencken explained back in 1940 , the politicians “ will all promise every man , woman and child in the country whatever he , she or it wants .
They ’ll all be roving the land looking for chances to make the rich poor , to remedy the irremediable , to succor the unsuccorable , to unscramble the unscrambleable , to dephlogisticate the undephlogisticable , ” because they understand that “ votes are collared under democracy , not by talking sense but by talking nonsense . ”
And are members of the public so dense that they will fall for such promises ?
Yes .
Moreover , they are greedy , impatient , and immoral , because the present benefits they hope to gain via politics , however unsustainable in the long run , come entirely at the expense of the taxpayers from whom the government extorts its revenues .
“ Politics , under democracy , ” Mencken wrote more than 80 years ago , “ resolves itself into impossible alternatives .
Whatever the label on the parties , or the war cries issuing from the demagogues who lead them , the practical choice is between the plutocracy on the one side and a rabble of preposterous impossibilists on the other . ”
And in a declaration even apter now than it was at the time , he concluded that what democracy “ needs beyond everything is a party of liberty . ”
The trouble is , however , that now , even more than then , the American people have little interest in liberty .
Instead , they want the impossible : home ownership for those who cannot afford homes , credit for those who are not creditworthy , old - age pensions for those who have not saved , health care for those who make no attempt to keep themselves healthy , and college educations for those who lack the wit to finish high school .
Moreover , they want it now , and they want somebody else to pay for it .
If you think that Fannie and Freddie ’s bust is a big deal , just wait until Medicare comes crashing down .
Then , the wailing and gnashing of teeth will be truly unbearable .
As that day rapidly approaches , however , you ’ll notice that the politicians are doing utterly nothing to forestall it .

8 Inauspicious Early Roles for Famous Actors Oct. 17 by Brady Sullivan
Celebrities do not rise overnight .
Well at least not real ones .
The girls from the Hills and the now infamous Joe the Plumber may have gotten famous extremely quickly for apparently no reason , but most actual celebrities have to work tirelessly over years to get where they are now .
That is why some of today 's best actors have filmographies filled with some less than stellar film choices .
The best , of course , are the ones who acted in projects that have no resemblance to anything they do today .
Here are 8 of the best .
8- Laurence Fishburne - " Pee Wee 's Playhouse "
These days Laurence is known primarily for offering horrible actors a blue or red pill , but back before he was the too cool for school Morpheus he appeared on Pee Wee 's Playhouse as the , well , somewhat less cool Cowboy Curtis .
With long black curls flowing from his oversized cowboy hat and an " only in the 80's " pastel splattered cowboy outfit , as Cowboy Curtis Laurence Fishburne managed to make the cowboy from the Village People look like John Wayne and Clint Eastwood rolled up into one .
And the crowd he hung out with sure was different .
I do n't remember Chairy or Jambi the Genie ever dodging bullets in slow motion .
7- Johnny Depp- " Nightmare on Elm Street "
Johnny Depp has evolved from a teen heartthrob to an enigmatic actor and then finally to his current position of bona - fide movie star .
But before all that he was just a struggling actor like everyone else trying to break into Hollywood .
That 's why he signed on to play one of the helpless victims of Freddy Krueger in Nightmare on Elm Street , a role that takes only a little more talent than being an actor in a herpes treatment commercial .
At least we can all probably look forward to Johnny Depp returning to the franchise in 2021 when Tim Burton reboots the series and of course cats Johnny as a quirky Freddy Krueger .
6- Leslie Nielsen - Everything Before " Airplane ! "
Leslie Nielsen really broke into the comedy scene in 1980 with Airplane !
And with it formed the type of role he would play for the rest of his life in parody movies .
But he was actually a very active actor from 1950 on .
So what the hell was Leslie doing for 30 years ?
Turns out he was actually a legitimate actor for the first three decades of his career , appearing in westerns , dramas , and even sci - fi films ( a genre he should have mercifully parted ways with before 2001 : A Space Travesty , which was in fact an actual travesty ) .
Thank goodness Leslie came to his senses and kicked this serious acting nonsense to the ditch and embraced a late career as a professional idiot .
The movies he's in now , like the Scary Movie franchise , may be a perversion of the kind of parody movies that used to actually be good , but at least he 's sticking with what he does best .
5- Jennifer Aniston - " Leprechaun "
Before she got paid millions upon millions of dollars to dance around in a fountain on Friends , Jennifer Aniston was a young , good looking actress with limited acting ability .
You know what that means : horror movie time !
Yes , Jennifer became a part of the long Hollywood tradition of casting hot young women as the victim of whatever monster or killer is terrorizing this particular film .
Unfortunately for Jennifer she chose Leprechaun , a punch line even as far as bad horror movies go .
At least other actresses tend to have big scary guys with chainsaws or knives for hands to run from .
Instead poor Jennifer had to run from a diminutive folk creature obsessed with getting his pot of gold back and easily distracted by any pair of shoes lobbed his way , which he instinctively had to shine .
Yes , that 's actually in the movie .
4- Mos Def- " The Cosby Mysteries "
Successful rapper and actor Mos Def may not seem like the kind of guy you 'd expect to pal around with Bill Cosby , who has made it very clear how much he hates the raps , but believe it or not he did indeed get his start on Bill Cosby 's show .
What 's that , you do n't remember him ?
Maybe that 's because he worked on the Cosby show that nobody remembers .
It was called The Cosby Mysteries , and it only lasted a season .
To show exactly how little sense this show made , Bill Cosby , the star of The Cosby Mysteries , played a guy named Guy Hanks .
That 's right , he was n't even named Cosby !
As though we were going to suspend our disbelief and accept him as anything but a sweater wearing , Jell - O pudding loving comedian who just so happens to solve mysteries this time around .
3- Bill Maher - " Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death "
These days Bill Maher is one of the best known political comedians , and particularly known for not being afraid to take on big issues with a funny yet educated tone .
On his show Real Time and in his new movie Religious , there is seldom an issue that comes up which Bill does n't have an opinion on and that he wo n't share quite openly , even if it pisses a lot of people off .
But back in the 80's he was just a regular old comic actor looking for work , which landed him in this movie with such a long title I 'm not even going to type it out again .
He plays a misogynistic , horny , hard - partying adventurer who leads an expectation into the dreaded avocado jungle .
Take out the adventurer and you'd have a lot of people 's opinion of Bill today .
2- Billy Bob Thornton - " Chopper Chicks in Zombietown "
In case you thought Armageddon was the most embarrassing blemish on Billy Bob 's career , worry not , because Chopper Chicks in Zombietown takes the cake for that by the title alone .
Brought to you by Troma entertainment , the cult production company that has produced such classics as The Toxic Avenger and Tales from the Crapper , Chopper Chicks in Zombietown is , as you might have guessed , a movie that features hot chicks , motorcycles and zombies .
Wait a second , what was I thinking ?
This movie is way better than Armageddon .
It could actually be the best thing Billy Bob has ever done .
More motorcycles and zombies Billy Bob !
1- Benicio Del Toro- " Big Top Pee Wee "
Benicio is known as one of those actors who is oddly attractive to women .
By normal standards he would be considered ugly , but somehow his exotic name and movie star status cancel that out and makes the ladies crazy about him .
This was not the case early in his career when he showed up in Big Top Pee Wee as the Dog Faced Boy , complete with slathered on prosthetic make - up .
It would n't be fair to call Benicio Del Toro dog faced , but it was a rather inspired casting choice .
And no wonder he gets so many high profile acting gigs these days -- including a return to the canine persuasion in upcoming remake of The Wolf Man.
Big Top Pee
Wee on your resume is a ticket into any movie you wanna be in .
Well unless you 're Paul Reubens , but that whole masturbating in a movie theater thing really messes up the equation .

The following is reprinted from Bathroom Reader Plunges Into History Again Hate all that newfangled technology ?
Someone may just call you a Luddite .
The origin of the term dates back to the dawn of the Industrial Revolution .
Here 's how the whole thing got started :
It all started with the weavers .
For centuries , the weavers and lace makers of Nottingham , England , were some of the most respected artisans in the world .
But the invention of the power loom and other machines , which produced fabric much more quickly and cheaply than the hand - weavers , put them out of business .
Just to survive , a lot of them started working for miserly wages at the factories that produced cheap and inferior cloth they hated .
But they simmered with rage at the factory owners who appropriated their life 's work - and the machines that helped them do it .
WHOOPS !
All of the sudden , factory looms started to break down .
At first , just a couple .
Then a few more .
When asked what had happened , the workers would just shrug and attribute the damage to the mythical Ned Ludd .
In fact , the disgruntled ex-workers were already meeting in private to plot their revenge .
In the early months of 1811 , they began sending menacing letters , signed by General Ned Ludd , to Nottingham factory owners , warning of dire consequences if factory conditions and wages did n't improve .
Some of the bolder Luddites showed up in person to make their demands .
Intimidated , most factory owners complied .
Those who did n't found their expensive machines smashed , by the dozens , in after - hours Luddite attacks .
THE POWDER KEG IGNITES
The rebellion leaked to nearby British regions .
The first Luddites had been strictly nonviolent , venting their anger only on the hated machines .
But in Yorkshire , the owner of Rawfolds Mill , aware of worker unrest at his factory , had prepared for an attack on April 11 , 1812 , by hiring private guards .
Two men were killed in the clash .
Seven days later , the Luddites killed a mill owner in the region , William Horsfall .
The violence did n't end there .
On April 20 , an angry mob of thousands attacked Burton 's Mill in Manchester .
Like the Rawfolds mill owner , Burton knew trouble was coming and had hired private guards who fired on the crowd and killed three men .
The furious Luddites dispersed , returning the following day and burning down Burton 's house .
In clashes with the military ( who rushed into the fray ) and Burton 's guards , a total of 10 men were killed .
THE UPRISING COOLS DOWN A police crackdown ensued .
Scores of leaders and rank - and - file Luddites were arrested and tried for their crimes .
A lot of men were hanged ; others were imprisoned or exiled to Australia , which put an effective end of the immediate uprising .
There were further sporadic outbreaks of violence , but by 1817 the Luddite movement ceased to be active in Britain .
Of course , the Luddites were right all along : the hated machines were making their jobs obsolete .
These days , only a tiny fraction of the world 's cloth is made by hand .
And machines make almost every article that is found in the modern home , from shoes to electronics to furniture .
“ Religion must die for mankind to live . ”
So concludes Bill Maher in his new documentary Religulous , in which he travels the world interviewing religious zealots in an attempt to alert humanity to the apocalypse - ushering absurdities of their beliefs .
On the one hand , the film , directed by Larry Charles of Borat fame , is a super - funny and much - needed intervention for a world increasingly beholden to religious fundamentalism .
The problem is that Maher purports to show that all organized religion , not just fundamentalism , is “ detrimental to the progress of humanity ” and he falls short .
“ I get this criticism a lot , ” Maher told The New York Times .
“ It ’s a pet peeve of mine , because I ’m confronted with this notion that ‘ Oh yes , you only go after the extremists , and by doing that you make religion look silly . ’” But , Maher counters , “ Anyone who ’s religious is extremist . ”
While such a black - and - white view of faith may infuriate some , I ’d be happy to hear Maher out .
But by the time he exhorts moderate religious people to realize that their solace comes at a “ terrible price , ” the film ’s seconds away from the credits .
He ’s had so much fun eviscerating easy targets like an actor portraying Jesus at a holy land theme park that he fails to prove his more interesting thesis : that moderate religious people enable the intolerance and violence perpetrated by their more fundamentalist fellow believers .
It seems Maher ’s two primary goals for the film – to be funny and to actually convince people to abandon religion – are often at odds with each other .
I have no doubt that sometime atheists such as myself will find Maher shriek - out - loud hilarious , but it is unlikely that his film is going to change the minds of any committed believers .
( Actually , it ’s probably more likely to inspire galvanizing rage in the Palin - loving portion of the electorate just weeks before the election . )
For instance , Maher somehow gets an ex-gay minister to agree to an interview and the two men actually end up having an interesting conversation .
Of course , Maher ca n’t help himself and when hugged by the “ formerly ” gay man asks him if he got a hard - on .
I ’ll admit it – I laughed .
But any minds
Maher might have actually managed to pry open with this exchange were probably firmly slammed shut again thanks to the boner comment .
The truth is , Maher is preaching to the choir and the choir may be rolling on the floor , but their amusement will have no affect on the majority of people in this country that firmly , unapologetically , believe in God .
He is so very right that the 16 percent of Americans that are not affiliated with any organized religion need to come out of the closet and take back their fair share of the political process .
Hopefully he ’ll inspire some of his fellow travelers .
But what Religulous wo n’t do is convince believers because as any evangelist knows , pissing people off does not generally lead to conversion .
But Maher has also said the film ’s goal is to start a conversation and , in this regard , he seems to have succeeded .
It ’s high time someone vocally challenged an America in which , as Maher has pointed out , once “ you say the word ‘ faith , ’ the debate is over — no matter what incredibly nonsensical , destructive , ridiculous tenet comes out of your mouth . ”
People of faith should be held accountable for their beliefs , especially when they insert these beliefs into public life .
Beliefnet.com – which Maher has parodied with his Disbeliefnet.com – wisely does n’t dismiss Religulous ( actually it ’s crawling with ads for the film ) but instead implores its readers to “ prove Maher wrong ” on its discussion boards by explaining “ how faith , or your spiritual practices , has made you a better person or your world a better place . ”
If Maher ca n’t succeed in converting extremists to agnosticism , perhaps his film can at least bring moderate religious voices more prominently into the discussion .
Interestingly , many of these more moderate voices are offering up the “ spiritual , but not religious ” stance as a rebuttal to Maher .
As Heretic_for_Christ puts it : “ Of course religion is bad .
God is real to me as a spiritual presence in my life , but religion is a man-made construct based on the preposterous notion that a set of ancient writings – akin to a printout of Beliefnet postings – is the holy and infallible word of God . ”
For the record , Maher says he has “ no problem with spirituality . ”
What I think he fails to understand is that many people who belong to organized religious groups actually view themselves as spiritual rather than religious , probably because they associate religion with the same kind of bigotry and violence that Maher does .
Actually 40 % of Americans use this phrase to describe themselves , according to a 2007 Gallup poll .
Meaning , perhaps , that they do n’t take the stories of their particular faith literally and do n’t just subscribe to whatever nonsense is coming from the pulpit .
There ’s a difference between official doctrine and how the majority of people live their faith on a day - to - day basis .
And Maher paves over this difference .
Sure , a small proportion of Christians , Muslims , and Jews take their holy texts as literal word - for - word instructions and thus find it hard to coexist with others .
But as the Onion A.V. Club ’s Noel Murray so wisely points out , Maher is n’t “ quite fearless enough to interview or lay into the multitudes of moderately devout folks who use their religion as a cultural signifier and a way to make a difference in their communities . ”
I have a sense that Maher is aware of this but he knows that a film parsing out the differences between various groups of believers would not be as provocative or as funny as a sweeping condemnation of all of them .
( Well , Western ones at least .
There ’s no mention of Eastern religious traditions in the film ) .
Obviously , a sober PBS - style treatment of the subject would not inspire the kind of widespread discussion of the role of faith in Western culture and politics that “ Religuous ” will .
So , yeah , the film is perhaps unfair in lumping moderate religious folks with extremists ( though if Maher wants to make a sequel proving the validity of this claim , I ’ll watch ) .
But by doing so , he provokes the majority of Americans to think critically about what they believe and how it impacts our world .
The best thing that Religulous could do is inspire more moderate religious folks to assert their claim on the word religious , wresting it free from the stranglehold of misguided extremists .

It is n’t often that irony hits this close to home , but the revelations in the Washington Post that McCain ’s campaign is giving out prizes to people who spam political blogs explains some strange things that have been happening to Political Irony.com over the last month .
You can see it for yourself , on McCain ’s official site .
They even give you handy talking points and tell you which blogs you should spam , conveniently dividing them into Liberal , Conservative , Moderate , and Other .
Heck , you do n’t even have to think to participate !
For each verified comment you post , you get “ points ” that can be redeemed for prizes , much like a frequent flier or frequent buyer program .
It is n’t that I get much spam — I guess my site is n’t big enough to warrant being on the robo - list that tells the ditto - heads which blogs to inundate with irrelevant drivel .
The bigger thing I have noticed is that suddenly ( on July 20th to be exact ) anti-McCain stories from Political Irony that were submitted to news aggregators like Digg , Reddit , and others were getting immediately voted down .
Suppressed , if you will .
The Washington Post article does n’t talk about this tactic , but it makes sense .
Voting down good news about your opponents or bad news about yourself is much easier than getting people to actually write things .
Besides , as the WaPo article points out , Astroturf campaigning ( making things appear to be grass roots when they are n’t ) can fail because “ germaneness ” is an issue .
People who post random talking points to blogs for “ points ” are often just ignored .
But if McCain supporters are suddenly crawling over blogs and aggregators looking for posts to comment on , of course they are going to be voting down posts they do n’t like .
It works like this .
When a story on Political Irony ( or other site ) gets submitted to a news aggregator like Digg , people vote it up or down .
Only stories that get enough votes appear on the front page and get lots of viewers .
These sites have a queue of new stories , but most people do n’t look at the new stories , they only look at the front page .
So a very small number of people can exercise quite a bit of control over what makes it to the front page , especially if they are “ motivated ” enough .
And since many people on the Internet depend on aggregators to tell them what ’s interesting , they will never see these censored stories .
And the censorship works — I had a dramatic ( and continuing ) loss of new traffic to the site ( although I ’m very grateful that loyal repeat readers kept coming ) .
How dramatic ?
The seven days leading up to July 19 had a total of 156,944 unique visitors , but the seven days after July 20th had only 10,304 unique visitors — a greater than 15 x drop that happened at the same time that McCain instituted his robo - spam program .
I ’m not a commercial site that depends on page views for money — I do this for fun and do n’t run any ads — but that kind of drop would be fatal to someone who was trying to make a living at this .
This is a huge concern to me .
Since the mainstream media has been completely bought out by large corporations who do n’t hesitate to exercise editorial control over the news , many of us hope the Internet will provide a needed alternative voice for news .
It will be very sad if it turns out that all someone needs to do is give away points and prizes to get people to suppress stories on the Internet that they do n’t like .
UPDATE : I ’m not the only blogger who has been bitten by the McCain “ bury brigade ” .
UPDATE 2 : Electoral - vote makes the point that this program means that “ McCain , even at 71 , is finally getting the hang of how to use the Internet . ”
Maybe so , but at least Obama does n’t have to bribe people to get them to blog for him .

NSF workshop on eChemistry : New Models for Scholarly Communication in Chemistry
Many scholarly communities have embraced new web - based models for disseminating the results of their research .
These models include open access to formal publications and " gray literature " , access to primary data and the tools to manipulate and visualize that data , interactive peer review , and integration with on - line discussion tools such as blogs and wikis .
According to their advocates these new models make the scholarly process more transparent and substantially improve the opportunities for examination , re-use , and enhancement of new results .
This workshop will focus on Chemists who have generally been indifferent or resistant to these web - based models and to open access .
By and large they continue to publish results in journals to which access is restricted to subscribers and reuse is limited by copyright .
This lack of interest may have a number of origins including the different funding methods available to chemistry , the prevalence of industry participation and associated opportunities for profit from results , concerns about confidentiality and privacy , the possibility of longer term use of the data by their originators , or other aspects of the social and political organization of research in chemistry .
The workshop will bring together experts from the chemistry , information science , open access , and science and technology studies communities to examine the multiple factors that influence adoption of new scholarly communication models .
The outcomes of the workshop will be reported in a white paper that will be made publicly available via this web site .
The report will provide funding agencies , including the National Science Foundation and the JISC in the UK , with suggestions for targeted research programs that further examine the issues discussed at the workshop and that improve the communication and dissemination mechanisms that underlie chemistry scholarship ( and internet - based scholarship in general ) .
There are no facts in science - only measurement embedded within assumptions .

I recently attended anin Washington ( Oct 23 - 24 , 2008 ) .
The group consisted of about a dozen members , including publishers , social scientists , librarians and chemists .
For background , this was the mandate : Although the final report will be made publicly available in a few months , the presentation materials are not .
After some discussion , I was permitted to liveblog the meeting under the Chatham house rule
Of course individual participants may share their own presentations - here is mine .
I can also share the scenario of the research process Jane Hunter typed up based on discussions from our sub - group between her , Jeremy Frey and myself .
My position statement and my main contribution to the workshop revolved around Open Notebook Science and its role in making the scientific process better through transparency .
This is an extension of a statement I made a year ago on the importance of replacing trust with proof .
There are properties that have been determined so many times by different researchers and different techniques that we can treat a narrow range of values by consensus as if they were absolute facts .
An example would be considering the boiling point of methanol at 1 atm to be 65C within one degree of accuracy .
For most purposes that will suffice , as long as we understand the source of our confidence .
The problem arises when we treat rarely measured properties as facts simply because they are printed in peer - reviewed articles or tables in books .
We teach our students not to trust numbers in Wikipedia but have no problem if they can cite a reference in a peer - reviewed journal , even without thoroughly analyzing the experimental sections .
We delude ourselves into thinking that we can appreciate our uncertainty of the value of a property simply by taking multiple measurements , taking an average and reporting standard deviation .
That is actually a useful thing to do if we remember that we are measuring random errors and completely ignoring systematic errors , which are possibly very common in infrequently measured properties .
What is the solubility of 4 - chlorobenzaldehyde in chloroform ?
UsefulChem experiment EXP208 reports it to be 0.07 molar .
It was measured only once but I think duplicate runs would have come out pretty close to that .
It might have slipped under the radar if it had not been measured in parallel with other chemically similar aromatic aldehydes with values all much greater than 1 molar .
It just did n't make sense so we looked at the conditions reported in the experiment and the boiling points of all the compounds - this one had the lowest value ( 214 C at 1 atm ) .
The pressure had not been recorded during the course of the experiment but when empty the Speed - Vac could go as low as 0.1
Torr , which would reduce the boiling point close to room temperature .
The next most volatile compound in this group was 2,6 - dichlorobenzaldehyde .
It was calculated by ChemSpider to be 239C at 1 atm , which is reasonable based on the 4 - chloro analog .
But here 's an interesting twist - the reported boiling point is 165C on this MSDS sheet .
It should be simple enough to see if that is an error by clicking through to the lab notebook page that generated that MSDS sheet ... oh wait ...
MSDS sheets do n't require proof , just this handy disclaimer : " " It also looks mighty trustworthy : " " .
I 'm not knocking Oxford - this is standard practice for the flow of chemical information in the current culture .
The bottom line is that 2,6 - dichlorobenzaldehyde did n't evaporate off - we get a value of 3.4 M in chloroform .
Now is it possible that some of it evaporated under the conditions of that experiment ?
Maybe but it is my call that we 're going to use that number for now as a good enough approximation for our model .
It is possible that your application might have a different requirement .
At least you have the information available in the Open Lab Notebook to make the call .
The solubility of 4 - chlorobenzaldehyde in chloroform was measured again , this time monitoring the pressure and minimizing time on the Speed - Vac .
The pressure varied over the course of the evaporation , making it impossible to neatly summarize in the experimental section of a paper .
The measurement was done in duplicate in EXP209 and comes out at 3.61 molar with a standard deviation of 0.02 .
That is n't a fact but a good enough number under these circumstances to pretend it is and use it for our model .
We 'll see how it plays out when we have different researchers and use different techniques
ONE hundred and sixty five years ago , a Scottish businessman set out his plans for a newspaper .
James Wilson 's starting point was “ a melancholy reflection ” : “ while wealth and capital have been rapidly increasing ” and science and art “ working the most surprising miracles ” , all classes of people were marked “ by characters of uncertainty and insecurity ” .
Wilson 's solution was freedom .
He committed his venture to the struggle not just against the protectionist corn laws but against attempts to raise up “ barriers to intercourse , jealousies , animosities and heartburnings between individuals and classes in this country , and again between this country and all others ” .
Ever since , The Economist has been on the side of economic liberty .
Now economic liberty is under attack and capitalism , the system which embodies it , is at bay .
This week Britain , the birthplace of modern privatisation , nationalised much of its banking industry ; meanwhile , amid talk of the end of the Thatcher - Reagan era , the American government has promised to put $ 250 billion into its banks .
Other governments are re-regulating their financial systems .
Asians point out that the West appears to be moving towards their more dirigiste model : “ The teachers have some problems , ” a Chinese leader recently said .
Interventionists are in full cry : “ Self - regulation is finished , ” claims France 's Nicolas Sarkozy .
“ Laissez - faire is finished . ”
Not all criticisms are that unsubtle ( the more pointed ones focus on increasing the state 's role only in finance ) , but all the signs are pointing in the same direction : a larger role for the state , and a smaller and more constrained private sector .
This newspaper hopes profoundly that this will not happen .
Over the past century and a half capitalism has proved its worth for billions of people .
The parts of the world where it has flourished have prospered ; the parts where it has shrivelled have suffered .
Capitalism has always engendered crises , and always will .
The world should use the latest one , devastating though it is , to learn how to manage it better .
Extreme measures in the defence of liberty
In the short term defending capitalism means , paradoxically , state intervention .
There is a justifiable sense of outrage among voters and business people ( and indeed economic liberals ) that $ 2.5 trillion of taxpayers ' money now has to be spent on a highly rewarded industry .
But the global bail - out is pragmatic , not ideological .
When François Mitterrand nationalised France 's banks in 1981 he did so because he thought the state would run them better .
This time governments are buying banks ( or shares in them ) because they believe , rightly , that public capital is needed to keep credit flowing .
Intervening to prevent banking crises from hurting the real economy has a strong pedigree .
Wilson 's son- in - law , Walter Bagehot , recommended that the Bank of England lend generously ( but at a penalty rate ) to illiquid banks ( but not to insolvent ones ) .
In modern times governments of every political stripe have had to step in .
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher oversaw the rescues of Continental Illinois and Johnson Matthey .
In the 1990s the Finns and Swedes nationalised banks — and privatised them again later .
This rescue is on a different scale .
Yet the justification is the same : the costs of not intervening look larger .
If confidence and credit continue to dry up , a near - certain recession will become a depression , a calamity for everybody .
Even if it staves off disaster , the bail - out will cause huge problems .
It creates moral hazard : such a visible safety net encourages risky behaviour .
It may also politicise lending .
Governments will need to minimise these risks .
They should avoid rewarding the bosses and shareholders of the rescued banks .
They must not steer loans to politically important sectors .
And they should run the banks on a commercial basis with the explicit aim of getting out of the banking business as quickly as possible ( and at a profit ) .
From the taxpayer 's point of view , it might make sense to limit dividend payments to other shareholders until the government 's preference shares have been paid off .
But governments need to avoid populist gestures .
Banning bonuses , for instance , would drive good people out of companies that badly need them .
The politicians all claim they understand this .
Of course , they have no intention of revisiting Mitterrand 's mistakes , of trying to run the banks themselves , or of taking stakes elsewhere .
Yet already voices ( including Lady Thatcher 's Tory heirs ) are pushing to limit executive pay .
It will be a brave president who goes to Detroit and explains why the 45,000 well - paid folk at Morgan Stanley should get $ 10 billion of taxpayers ' money , but the 266,000 people at General Motors should not .
Brave too would be any politician who proposed deregulation as a solution to a public - sector problem .
Smoot - Hawley in the rear mirror
Given this , it is inevitable that the line between governments and markets will in the short term move towards the former .
The public sector and its debt will take up a bigger portion of the economy in many countries .
But in the longer term a lot depends on how blame for this catastrophe is allocated .
This is where an important intellectual battle could and should be won .
Capitalism 's defenders need to deal with two sorts of criticism .
One has much more substance than the other .
The weaker , populist argument is that Anglo - Saxon capitalism has failed .
Critics claim that the “ Washington consensus ” of deregulation and privatisation , preached condescendingly by America and Britain to benighted governments around the world , has actually brought the world economy to the brink of disaster .
If this notion continues to gain ground , politicians from Beijing to Berlin will feel justified in resisting moves to free up the movement of goods and services within and between their economies .
Arguments for market solutions in , for instance , health and education will be made with less conviction , and dismissed with a reference to Wall Street 's fate .
In fact , far from failing , the overall lowering of “ barriers to intercourse ” over the past 25 years has delivered wealth and freedom on a dramatic scale .
Hundreds of millions of people have been dragged out of absolute poverty .
Even allowing for the credit crunch , this decade may well see the fastest growth in global income per person in history .
The free movement of non-financial goods and services should not be dragged into the argument — as they were , to disastrous effect , in the 1930s .
A second group of critics focuses on deregulation in finance , rather than the economy as a whole .
This case has much more merit .
Finance needs regulation .
It has always been prone to panics , crashes and bubbles ( in Victorian times this newspaper was moaning about railway stocks , not house prices ) .
Because the rest of the economy cannot work without it , governments have always been heavily involved .
Without doubt , modern finance has been found seriously wanting .
Some banks seemed to assume that markets would be constantly liquid .
Risky behaviour garnered huge rewards ; caution was punished .
Even the best bankers took crazy risks .
For instance , by the end of last year Goldman Sachs , by no means the most daring , had $ 1 trillion of assets teetering atop $ 43 billion of equity .
Lack of regulation encouraged this gambling ( see article ) .
Financial innovation in derivatives soared ahead of the rule - setters .
Somehow the world ended up with $ 62 trillion - worth of credit - default swaps ( CDSs ) , none of them traded on exchanges .
Not even the most liberal libertarian could imagine that was sensible .
Yet the failures of modern finance cannot be blamed on deregulation alone .
After all , the American mortgage market is one of the most regulated parts of finance anywhere : dominated by two government sponsored agencies , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and guided by congressional schemes to increase home - ownership .
The macro economic condition that set up the crisis stemmed in part from policy choices : the Federal Reserve ignored the housing bubble and kept short - term interest rates too low for too long .
The emerging world 's determination to accumulate reserves , especially China 's decision to hold down its exchange rate , sent a wash of capital into America .
There was something of a perfect storm in which policy mistakes combined with Wall Street 's excesses .
Heavy regulation would not inoculate the world against future crises .
Two of the worst in recent times , in Japan and South Korea , occurred in highly rule - bound systems .
What 's needed is not more government but better government .
In some areas , that means more rules .
Capital requirements need to be revamped so that banks accumulate more reserves during the good times .
More often it simply means different rules : central banks need to take asset prices more into account in their decisions .
But there are plenty of examples where regulation could be counter - productive : a permanent ban on short - selling , for instance , would make markets more volatile .
Indeed , history suggests that a prejudice against more rules is a good idea .
Too often they have unintended consequences , helping to create the next disaster .
And capitalism , eventually , corrects itself .
After a crisis investors ( and for that matter regulators ) seldom make exactly the same mistake twice .
There are , for instance , already plans for clearing houses for CDSs .
Turning back the incoming tide
Sadly another lesson of history is that in politics economic reason does not always prevail — especially when the best - case scenario for most countries is a short recession .
“ Barriers to intercourse , jealousies , animosities and heartburnings ” loom .
But it need not be so .
If the bail - outs are well handled , taxpayers could end up profiting from their reluctant investment in the banks .
If regulators learn from this crisis , they could manage finance better in the future .
If the worst is avoided , the healthy popular hostility to a strong state that normally pervades democracies should reassert itself .
Capitalism is at bay , but those who believe in it must fight for it .
For all its flaws , it is the best economic system man has invented yet .
Robotics expert builds android twin to study the soul Nick Cargo and David Edwards
Published : Wednesday November 26 , 2008
Print This Email This A Japanese inventor 's latest creation is a robot double of himself .
Dr. Hiroshi Ishiguro tells CNN's Tokyo correspondent Kyung Lah that he sees his creation , dubbed the Geminoid , partly as an opportunity to have a presence when not actually present , essentially being in two places at once , and also as a chance to study human behavior along with furthering his knowledge of androids .
" At first you may feel strange about the android , " Ishiguro told Reuters .
" However , once you are drawn into a conversation , you will forget every difference and feel totally comfortable to speak with it and look it in the eyes . "
The Geminoid , controlled remotely by Ishiguro with mouth sensors and a microphone , has over 50 sensors and motors concealed beneath its skin , with compressed air pumped through its body to simulate breathing .
Ishiguro , professor of robotics at Osaka University and director of its Intelligent Robotics Laboratory , unveiled an earlier model , known as Repliee Q1 Expo , in 2005 .
" Repliee Q1 Expo is not like any robot you will have seen before , at least outside of science - fiction movies , " noted BBC News .
Having come about during a partnership with Tokyo robotics and entertainment firm Kokoro , it was modeled after a Japanese newscaster .
" I have developed many robots before , " Ishiguro said , " but I soon realized the importance of its appearance .
A human - like appearance gives a robot a strong feeling of presence . "
In time , he added , the time it would take for a person to realize such a creation was a machine and not a human , could go from a few seconds to , perhaps , ten minutes .
" Consciously , it is easy to see that she is an android , but unconsciously , we react to the android as if she were a woman . "
" If I could have one at the university , and one at ATR , " Ishiguro quipped , " I would just do all my work from a hot - springs resort . "

Convicted of 7 felonies , Stevens now claims he was n't convicted " I have not been convicted of anything . "
Ted Stevens Senator Ted Stevens , a former U.S. Attorney , must not remember the definition of conviction from law school .
Today , at the first - and - only Senate debate , Stevens told Alaskans that , " I 've not been convicted yet . "
However , Stevens seems to be missing the point of the month long trial he just went through .
Stevens can say he has n't been sentenced yet or he can say he plans to appeal his conviction .
But clearly a jury of 12 people did in fact convict Stevens on seven felony counts .
Thus , Stevens became a convicted felon on Monday .
" It is astonishing that Senator Stevens is lying to Alaska voters saying he has n't been convicted , " said Bethany Lesser , spokeswoman for the Alaska Democratic Party .
" Maybe he thinks if he says it enough Alaskans will believe him .
Stevens acts like he 's above the law .
Alaskans expect Stevens to answer tough questions and take responsibility for his actions .
Stevens was too close to special interests and got himself into this situation .
He needs to deal with the consequences for his bad judgment . "
The Alaska and national media sure think Stevens has been convicted : Anchorage Daily News : " A federal jury on Monday convicted U.S. Sen .
Ted Stevens on all seven counts of lying on his financial disclosures , a crippling blow not just to his election chances next week but to his legacy as Alaska 's longest serving and most accomplished living politician . "
[ Stevens guilty : ' It 's not over yet ' he says , 10/27/08 ]
Fairbanks News Miner : " A jury convicted Stevens , 84 , of seven felony counts Monday for his failure to report gifts and home renovations made by former VECO oilfield services company head Bill Allen .
Stevens maintained that he believed his reporting was accurate and complete . "
[ Stevens tells Fairbanksans he needs their trust and support , 10/30/08 ]
Associated Press : " A senator since 1968 , Stevens faces re-election next week as a convicted felon . "
[ McCain Says Alaska Sen . Ted Stevens Should Quit , 10/28/08 ]
Washington Post : " Sen . Ted Stevens , one of Congress 's most powerful Republicans , was convicted yesterday of lying on financial disclosure forms to conceal his receipt of gifts and expensive renovation to his house just eight days before he faces voters in a tight reelection contest . "
[ Stevens Found Guilty on 7 Counts , 10/28/08 ]
New York Times : " The jury of District of Columbia residents convicted Mr. Stevens , 84 , on all seven felony counts he faced in connection with charges that he knowingly failed to list on Senate disclosure forms the receipt of some $ 250,000 in gifts and services used to renovate his home in Girdwood , Alaska . "
[ Alaska Senator Is Guilty Over His Failures To Disclose Gifts , 10/27/08 ]
" Senator Stevens ' trial ended with seven felony convictions , and Alaskans deserve better .
Alaskans deserve a Senator they can be proud of , a Senator who puts Alaska 's needs above those of special interests , " Lesser added .

I think this was a deliberate attempt to disgrace Sarah Palin after McCain lost .
It was also done by the NeoCons on his staff ( after all , who other than NeoCons would have worked for him ) .
They probably assumed that they were doing both McCain and other Republicans a service by attempting to disgrace a Conservative like Sarah Palin .
Actually , they have only angered and enthused the supporters of which I am one - Major !

Republicans in general , IF they rediscover their ‘ nads ought to make an example of that puke Carl Cameron who gleefully leaped into the ‘ Trashing Palin Festival ’ on FOX and make it known that he is persona non grata at ANY GOP function , that NO interviews will be granted to him , that he will wo n’t even be allowed to float in the punch bowl , he ’ll have to stink in a little pile outside , looking in .
Now if Carl were to name his sources and identify who his fellow pukes are who were so eager to trash Governor Palin , maybe we might start getting somewhere .

You know , this stuff ( and more * ) would provide an excellent opportunity for McCain to blast the MSM , without doing the “ woe is me , we ca n’t win because of the MSM ” complaint .
Instead , he can be the knight that he was too much of in the campaign , but here he can be outraged at a smear , and it ’d be appropriate to be so .
I was just reading on another thread , that Newsweek reports Palin supposedly would n’t appear at a rally with John Sununu , because he ’s pro choice — the problem with that being that “ John Sununu has a 100 percent pro-life rating from the National Right to Life Committee . ”

Mr Brumby , who supported the legislation when it was passed in the lower house , spoke to reporters after the vote was passed 23 - 17 in the Legislative Council this morning .
" We 'll now have in place in Victoria legislation that will take abortion out of the criminal code , '' Mr Brumby said .
" So I am pleased to see the result .
It was a strong vote in the lower house , it 's a comfortable majority in the upper house . ''

The Wall Street bailout and the threat of dictatorship
Bill Van Auken ( Socialist Equality Party vice presidential candidate )
2 October 2008
Recriminations have continued to reverberate internationally over the vote in the US House of Representatives Monday to reject a $ 700 billion bailout package for the Wall Street banks .
Much of the opposition in the 228 - to - 205 vote to defeat the bailout was attributed to representatives -- Democratic and Republican alike -- who face tight races for their seats in November and fear being tarred by their opponents as shills for Wall Street who handed over hundreds of billions in taxpayers ’ money to the CEOs and speculators who are responsible for the crisis .
In this sense , the overwhelming hostility of ordinary working people toward this massive transfer of public resources to the super - rich found its expression , highly distorted as it was , in the measure ’s temporary demise .
What is the lesson drawn by much of the political establishment , as reflected in media commentary ?
That the American government is too susceptible to the will of the people to respond as required to the demands of finance capital .
This is the theme sounded in a number of commentaries , some of them penned by individuals with significant ties to ruling circles .
Representative of this ideological trend is a column in Wednesday ’s Washington Post by Michael Gerson , George W. Bush ’s former chief speechwriter and senior advisor , who is currently a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations .
Entitled “ Too Small for a Big Crisis , ” the piece portrays a dysfunctional Congress .
Gerson begins by characterizing the vote with a lurid historical metaphor .
“ The Bastille of establishment opinion has been stormed and taken , at least temporarily , ” he writes .
“ But the revolution has irresponsibility in its soul . ”
He notes that the vote came despite the overarching unanimity within the ruling elite in support of the bailout .
“ [ S ] eldom has America ’s governing elite been more united in response to a national challenge , ” he writes , with the administration , the leadership of both major parties and both the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates all supporting the bailout proposal .
After apportioning blame between “ partisan ” Democrats and Republicans wedded to “ ideological purity , ” Gerson gets to the heart of his concerns .
“ Though some compromise may eventually be passed , ” he declares , “ it is now clear that American political elites have lost the ability to quickly respond to a national challenge by imposing their collective will .
What once seemed like politics as usual now seems more like the crisis of the Articles of Confederation - - a weak government populated by small men .
And this must be more frightening to a world dependent on American stability than any bank failure . ”
Gerson ’s second historical analogy drawn from the age of the great bourgeois revolutions is as potted as the first .
The crisis of the Articles of Confederation gave rise to the House of Representatives and the US Constitution that created it .
Neither was crafted with the aim of allowing “ political elites ” to quickly impose their “ collective will . ”
The Constitution ’s Article 1 created Congress as the first branch of the US government , meant to most closely reflect the will of the people .
This was true , in particular , of the House , with its members subject to popular election every two years .
Those who drafted the Constitution envisioned the body as a bastion against tyranny , endowing it with the power to oust presidents through impeachment and the exclusive ability to initiate legislation raising revenues , thus enabling it to exert decisive power over the national purse .
Of course , such principles and powers have been steadily eroded over the course of many decades , with the consolidation of ever - greater power in the hands of an imperial presidency .
Over the last eight years , this process has accelerated dramatically , with Congress accepting the imposition of a president installed in office by means of electoral fraud and the diktat of a Republican majority on the US Supreme Court , then rubber - stamping a criminal war and collaborating in sweeping attacks on basic democratic rights .
Those who fill the House seats are indeed “ small ” men and women , dominated by concerns for their political careers and subservient to the big business interests that control both major parties .
Yet , to the extent that these miserable politicians are still influenced even in the most limited manner by mass sentiments that run counter to the interests of America ’s corporate and financial rulers , the present set - up is deemed to have become intolerable .
“ This is dangerous , ” writes Thomas Friedman , the senior foreign policy columnist for the New York Times , in a column published Wednesday .
“ We have House members , many of whom I suspect can’t balance their own checkbooks , rejecting a complex rescue package because some voters , whom I fear also do n’t understand , swamped them with phone calls .
I appreciate the popular anger against Wall Street , but you ca n’t deal with this crisis this way . ”
In short , the opposition of the majority of the American people cannot be allowed to stand in the way of a “ complex rescue package ” designed by “ experts ” like Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , Goldman Sachs ’s former CEO , for the purpose of bailing out his colleagues on Wall Street and rescuing the fat portfolios of individuals like Friedman .
George Will , the Washington Post ’s pompous right - wing columnist , had a few choice words of advice : “ Congress should disconnect from a public that cannot be blamed for being more furious about than comprehending this opaque debacle . ”
So much for the “ House of the People . ”
Across the Atlantic , where furor reigned in financial circles over the bailout ’s defeat , media reaction was even more blunt .
The Times of London carried a prominent column entitled “ Congress is the Best Advert for Dictatorship . ”
“ The most flattering reading of the turmoil in Congress this week has been that this is democracy in action , ” wrote columnist Camilla Cavendish Wednesday .
“ Personally , I have never felt more attracted to benign dictatorship . ”
This provocative language , drawing the logical conclusion of the anti-democratic sentiments being expressed more widely , ultimately expresses the objective ramifications of the economic and social crisis that is eating away at US and world capitalism .
The crisis is being utilized to effect an ever more immense concentration of economic power that is incompatible with political democracy .
Three banking behemoths -- Citigroup , Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase -- are gobbling up their failing competitors and now control fully a third of US bank deposits .
At the same time , the crisis is intensifying the social inequality that pervades every aspect of life in America , a country where the top 1 percent has more wealth than the bottom 90 percent combined .
Layoffs and foreclosures are mounting , while workers are suffering sharp cuts in real wages .
It is under these conditions that the ruling elite is attempting to ram through the greatest transfer of wealth to the financial oligarchy in history .
These intense social antagonisms cannot be contained within America ’s existing political set - up .
The furor over the vote in the House serves as a warning that capitalism in crisis will inevitably move toward new forms of rule capable of defending the economic dictatorship of finance capital by means of an open political dictatorship against the working class .
This threat cannot be confronted within the framework of the existing two - party system .
It demands an irrevocable break with the Democratic Party and the organization of a new , independent political movement of the working class fighting for the socialist reorganization of society .
This is the alternative advanced by the Socialist Equality Party and its candidates in the US presidential election , Jerry White for president and myself for vice president .

Hulk Hogan and Linda Bollea Drama Continues
This could be classified as the dumbest story of the day we are sure ... but , andare back at it and this time it has to do with a Rolls Royce and Hulks fears that Linda 's 19 year old boy toywill drive it and wreck it .
As part of their divorce proceedings , it had been decided that the couples Rolls - Royce would stay in storage until their shared marital assets were divided up .
Linda must feel differently about the ruling because Hulk and his lawyer got word that Bollea called to have the car prepped to be driven .
What does that mean ?
A wash , gas ?
The problem is that the insurance that is taken out on the car is " woefully inadequate " and the Hulk is concerned that if his ex's 19 year old boyfriend takes the car for a joy ride the car could be put at risk .
He 's right .
Look what happened to his son Nick Hogan , who was just released from jail after he used bad judgment in a fast car and wound up causing great bodily harm to John Graziano , who is now permanently disabled .
Stick to your guns Hulk .
It 's got the making of disaster written all over it .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Swiss adventurer Yves Rossy flew from England to France Friday propelled by a jetpack strapped to his back -- the first person to cross the English Channel in such a way .
Rossy , a pilot who normally flies an Airbus airliner , crossed the 22 miles between Calais and Dover at speeds of up to 120 mph in 13 minutes , his spokesman said .
When the white cliffs of Dover came into view , he opened a blue and yellow parachute and drifted down in light winds to land in a British field where he was mobbed by well - wishers .
“ Everything was perfect , ” he said afterwards .
“ I showed that it is possible to fly a little bit like a bird . ”
Rossy traced the route of French aviator Louis Bleriot , who became the first person to fly across the Channel in an aircraft in 1909 .
The Swiss pilot was propelled by four kerosene - burning jet turbines attached to a wing on his back .
He ignited the jets inside a plane before jumping out more than 8,000 feet above ground .
After a period of free fall he opened the wing and soared across the water .
With no steering controls , the only way to change direction was like a bird , moving his head and back .
Slideshow ( 11 images )
The 49 - year - old Rossy , who calls himself “ Fusion Man , ” told the BBC the most tense moment was when he jumped from the aircraft “ because I did have many problems during exits before . ”
But this time he made a perfect exit and quickly set the correct course by aiming for the cliffs of Dover .
Rossy usually flies a Swiss International A320 Airbus between Zurich and Heathrow and he develop the jet - propelled device himself .
The wing , which spans eight feet , is made of lightweight carbon composite and weighs about 55 kg ( 120 lb ) including fuel .
He postponed the flight twice this week due to poor weather and wore a flameproof suit to help him withstand the jet exhaust around his legs .
His future plans included flying over the Grand Canyon , taking off from a standing position on the ground and performing acrobatics .
THE CHOICE you 'll have , " said Barack Obama during last week 's debate , as he told voters what to expect if John McCain 's health - insurance proposal becomes law , " is having your employer no longer provide you healthcare .
" Do n't take my word for it , " he added .
" The US Chamber of Commerce , which generally does n't support a lot of Democrats , said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer - based healthcare system . "
If only .
An end to employer - based health insurance is exactly what the American healthcare market needs .
Far from being a calamity , it would represent a giant step toward ending the current system 's worst distortions : skyrocketing premiums , lack of insurance portability , widespread ignorance of medical prices , and overconsumption of health services .
With more than 90 percent of private healthcare plans in the United States obtained through employers , it might seem unnatural to get health insurance any other way .
But what 's unnatural is the link between healthcare and employment .
After all , we do n't rely on employers for auto , homeowners , or life insurance .
Those policies we buy in an open market , where numerous insurers and agents compete for our business .
Health insurance is different only because of an idiosyncrasy in the tax code dating back 60 years - a good example , to quote Milton Friedman , of how one bad government policy leads to another .
During World War II , federal wage controls barred employers from raising their workers ' salaries , but said nothing about fringe benefits .
So firms competing for employees at government - restricted wages began offering medical insurance to sweeten employment offers .
Even sweeter was that employers could deduct those benefits as business expenses , yet employees did n't have to report them as taxable income .
For a while the IRS resisted that interpretation , but Congress eventually enshrined the tax - exempt status of employer - based medical insurance in law .
Result : a radical shift in the way Americans paid for medical care .
With health benefits tax - free if they were employer - supplied , tens of millions of Americans were soon signing up for medical insurance through work .
As tax rates rose , so did the incentive to keep expanding health benefits .
No longer was medical insurance reserved for major expenditures like surgery or hospitalization .
Americans who would never think of using auto insurance to cover tune - ups and oil changes grew accustomed to having their medical insurer pay for yearly physicals , prescriptions , and other routine expenses .
We thus ended up with a healthcare system in which the vast majority of bills are covered by a third party .
With someone else picking up the tab , Americans got used to consuming medical care without regard to price or value .
After all , if it was covered by insurance , why not go to the emergency room for a simple sore throat ?
Why not get the name - brand drug instead of a generic ?
Unconstrained by consumer cost - consciousness , healthcare spending has soared , even as overall inflation has remained fairly low .
Nevertheless , Americans know almost nothing about the costs of their medical care .
( Quick quiz :
What does your local hospital charge for an MRI scan ?
To deliver a baby ?
To set a broken arm ? )
When patients think someone else is paying most of their healthcare costs , they feel little pressure to learn what those costs actually are - and providers feel little pressure to compete on price .
So prices keep rising , which makes insurance more expensive , which makes Americans ever - more worried about losing their insurance - and ever - more dependent on the benefits provided by their employer .
De-linking medical insurance from employment is the key to reforming healthcare in the United States .
McCain proposes to accomplish that by taking the tax deduction away from employers and giving it to employees .
With a $ 5,000 refundable healthcare tax credit , Americans would have a strong inducement to buy their own , more affordable , insurance , rather than relying on their employer 's plan .
As millions of empowered consumers began focusing on price , price competition would flourish .
And as employers ' healthcare costs declined , most of the savings would return to employees as higher wages .
For 60 - plus years , a misguided tax preference for employer - sponsored health insurance has distorted America 's healthcare market .
The price of that distortion has been paid in higher costs , fewer choices , and mounting anxiety .
The solution is to restore market forces by fixing the tax code , and liberating Americans from an employer - based system that has made everything worse .

Probably the most common problems with COM Interopt in .NET applications is deployment and versioning .
Currently developers have to include " Primary Interopt Assemblies " , which in the case of applications like Office be a megabyte or larger .
With .NET 4 that will no longer be an issue .
COM Type Embedding allows fragments of interfaces to be compiled into the assemblies that need them .
Only the interfaces and methods actually used by the program are included , drastically reducing the overall size of the application .
To keep the VTables accurate , gap commands are included in the assembly 's IL as placeholders .
These indicate how many method slots are to be skipped .
Since COM does n't allow methods to change location in published interfaces , this will allow support for both forward and backwards versioning .
Another issue this addresses is compiling an application against a newer version , say Word 2007 , when the end user may have Word 2003 .
Checking to see if a method actually exists in the runtime version will have be done in user code , otherwise an access violation will occur .
But so long as only backwards compatible methods are used , there should be no other issues .
The use of this will be controlled via a compiler flag .
It will default to off for old projects and on for new ones .
In the rare event that COM Type Embedding wo n't work for a given COM interface , a compiler error will occur recommending the flag be turned off .
Two related features are Type Equivalence and Managed Type Embedding .
These allows types in different assemblies to be treated as being the same type at runtime .
This is crucial for scenarios where multiple libraries are pulling in the same COM interfaces .
There are strict rules on this .
First of all , all types have to be tagged with a shared GUID so they can be matched up .
This is n't an issue with COM , since they are tagged anyways , but it will have to be explicitly applied to managed types .
Regular classes cannot be shared via Type Embedding and Equivalence due to the possibility of differing implementations .
Types that can be shared include interfaces , enumerations , delegates , and simple structures .
These features are planned for VB and C#. Developers using C++/CLI normally access COM objects via their header files and Microsoft does not currently plan to offer it for them .

SAO PAULO , Brazil - A stock exchange trader has shot himself on the trading floor in Brazil .
Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock exchange says the 36 - year - old man shot himself in the chest a couple of hours before markets closed in South America 's biggest city .
The Bovespa statement says Paulo Sergio Silva was taken to a hospital , but his condition was not immediately available .
Former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott ( R - Miss . ) has been busy since he left Congress at the end of last year , swiftly demonstrating the value of a former lawmaker to various industries seeking access on Capitol Hill .
First Lott joined with former Sen. John Breaux ( D - La. ) to open a bipartisan lobbying firm , and most recently he accepted a position on the board of the North American arm of the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company ( EADS ) .
“ Senator Lott has been out of the Senate less than a year , and he ’s already showing how a spin through Washington ’s revolving door can enrich a former senator , ” CRP ’s executive director , Sheila Krumholz , told the Associated Press .
During the first half of this year , the Breaux Lott Leadership Group banked $ 3.1 million from its client roster , which includes AT&T , the Association of American Railroads and energy company Plains Exploration & Production .
EADS , which has spent $ 2.7 million this year on its efforts to influence lawmakers , does not appear to have hired Lott ’s lobbying shop .
As a member of Congress , Lott collected $ 164,000 from the defense sector from 1989 until he resigned .
Defense company Northrop Grumman , which partnered with EADS in March to win a giant defense contract over Boeing , gave Lott more money than all but seven other donors , at $ 38,000 .
Northrop Grumman has paid the Breaux Lott Leadership Group $ 200,000 this year to lobby on its behalf .
By leaving Congress before his term was up , Lott was able to dodge new ethics rules requiring senators to wait two years before lobbying .

NOVEMBER 17 -- Undaunted by a concrete wall separating their respective cellblocks , male and female inmates took advantage of a design flaw in an Indiana jail to engage in late - night sexual trysts .
The Greene County inmates -- three men and three women -- pried open metal security tiles in the ceiling of their respective dormitory - style housing units to gain access to the adjoining cellblock , according to a probable cause affidavit filed in Circuit Court .
A copy of that detail - packed , and entertaining , affidavit can be found here .
They were able to get into the lockup next door because the concrete wall separating the spaces did not continue to the building 's roof .
As first reported by the Bloomfield Free Press , a blind spot in the Greene County jail 's security camera system kept officials from quickly spotting the illicit excursions , which began two months ago .
The six inmates , pictured in these mug shots , were charged today with felony escape .
Investigators learned of the ceiling hijinks after conducting a search of the cellblocks last month .
During that shakedown , the November 14 affidavit notes , investigators found letters in the female dormitory indicating that inmates ' were getting through the ceiling area , and making contact with each other .
This contact appears to include sexual activity . '
The first female inmate approached by a sheriff 's investigator was asked ' if she knew why I might want to talk to her , ' wrote Detective George Dallaire .
The woman , who was not charged , ' asked if it had anything to do with the girls going through the ceiling . ' ( 6 pages )

Brad , it looks like Charlene Davis in MO may have inadvertently announced she is committing a crime , and perhaps a conspiracy .
In today 's NY Times there is this :
Indiana , Nevada , North Carolina and Ohio seem to be improperly using Social Security data to verify registration applications for new voters .
And in a Yahoo posted AP story , Charlene Davis is reported to have said this : " I do n't even know the entire scope of it because registrations are coming in so heavy , " Davis said .
" We have identified about 100 duplicates , and probably 280 addresses that do n't exist , people who have driver 's license numbers that wo n't verify or Social Security numbers that wo n't verify .
Some have no address at all . "
Maybe the next Attorney General is going to have to devote a whole task force to prosecuting Republican disenfranchisers .

STEALING THE VOTES OF AMERICANS IS OUTRAGEOUS !!!
Acorn 's voter fraud registration must be investigated .
Also , Obama 's involvement must be investigated .
With the increasing number of anti-American racists and crooks surrounding Obama , we must insure that he does not steal this election .
We must also investigate the legitimacy of Obama 's foreign and domestic campaign contributions .

I would n't surprise me if Republicans are behind the faulty voter registrations in ACORN to create a scandal .
It 's right out of the Karl Rove playbook .
And it 's funny how Republicans are NOW concerned about unfair elections , but not when the last two elections had rampant evidence of election fraud .
Republicans strip voters of their rights with caging , purging , blackbox voting machines , etc .

Well , for what it is worth , it is nice to finally see what it is that made Charlene take such Draconian measures when she had me arrested this past August .
I knew I had tripped into something but not exactly what it was .
Now , I know .
It was her year to pull the trigger in Missouri .

Is Debbie Democrat onto something ?
That Anderson Cooper show on CNN has been broadcasting a very negative report on ACORN .
There really were a bunch of bogus registration forms .
Are Republicans and double - agent Democrats behind engineering a rationale to disenfranchise voters , and get mainstream media support in this ?
John McCain badmouthed ACORN in a stump speech .
The Obama campaign and Democratic Party would be well - advised to pull their heads out of the sand and respond to that .
Anyone who believes in democracy of whatever party and Barack Obama and his team need to wake up and emerge from the mists of denial .
They need to finally direct attention to election fraud and rigging in its various manifestations , point Anderson Cooper ( appearances can be deceiving , but he at least comes across as less blatantly fascist than many others ) and others in that direction of electronic election rigging .
Like John Kerry before him , Barack Obama will be in for a rude awakening when John McCain and Sarah Palin win the presidency via " surprise " ( wink , wink , nudge , nudge ) election results .
Again , the media talking heads , scholars , and experts , will rationalize this and make things up as they go along to explain statistically impossible results , as they have done in previous elections .
Inspirational speakers charismatic evangelists will use the McCain presidency story as an underdog come - from - behind win .

Since when do you even need a Social Security number to vote ?
Am I wrong on this ?
If you can prove you are a U.S. Citizen and not a convicted felon , what else do you need to be able to vote ?
Might as well tattoo your Social Slave Number on your arm .
This what Bush , McShame , and all of their pals would like to do , but not to their friends in the " elite " of course .
The U.S. is bankrupt and they know it .
The primary asset left is us .
Why do you think EVERYONE wants your SSN although on my old SSN card it clearly states for retirement purposes only , not to be used for identification ?
Colin Powell accidentally blurted out the truth on TV :
The reason the SSN is so important to the feds is they can track you with it .

The " october surprise " this year is the economy / liquidity crisis .
Repugs are scared .
They know McCain is going to lose to Obama , the only valid tactic they can think of is to put the country into full panic mode , hence Bush 's " be scared " announcements .
Maybe they think voters will somehow magically believe that Repugnant fiscal conservative policies ( cough bullshit cough ) will lure voters in November .
Or at least thats the LOGIC they will tout when the election is stolen again in 2008 .
2000 - Bush would be irreparably harmed by a recount of FL .
2004 - Evangelicals came out in force ( yeah right ) .
2008 - People were scared of the economy and think McCain 's deregulation policies will fix the economy ( yeah right ) .

The " voter fraud " meme has only one rational purpose , since it has no counterpart in or really any material connection with reality .
It exists solely as a " balance " for the SCUM to propagandize to mute , defeat , or marginalize the Dim criticism ( WELL , NOT " Dims " per se , they 're too chickenshit to actually level substantive accusations , and leave it to folks like Palalst ) of proven Puke tactics of Election Fraud .

Just keep right on registering voters .
There will always be a few registrations in any batch that are not legit .
Whether it 's acorn or anyone else .
Thats just statistics .
More important since the reg .
deadlines are approaching , get people to the polls in Nov . !!
I will be renting a van to drive folks in redding , Ca. to vote .
It wont cost me much more than $ 50.00 incl. gas .
By the way , illegitimate registration usually does not become a vote fraud .
They are two different thing .
When someone is paid to register people they have incentive to pad their numbers for more $ .
But lets face it .
If they collect names from graveyards , these people will not be voting so there wont be voter fraud .
Remember , two different issues .
Mickey Mouse and Richard Nixon wo n't be voting either , but there is a good chance the person who registered them will get paid for the registration .

This is how to fix voting fraud once and for all : Disney World makes your ticket - card instantly , by coding your info onto the card 's black stripe ( like your hotel room key ) .
When you enter the park , you slide your card through the cardreader and place your index fingerprint into a scanner .
You may only enter the turnstile one time !
The exit turnstile at WDW makes a count to ensure the same number of people are going out .
If this has been done at Disney World for many years , it proves that the technology is available to use for fair voting practices ...
Ballots could be programmed on your card to read / scan at the exit turnstile , therefore giving a running total of votes and ensuring each vote is true and counted for each candidate , on a Wall Street - type ticker that everyone can see .
This eliminates duplicate voting , Diebold et.al. , and the need for exit - polling , as well .

Brad , thanks so much for the coverage of the nonsense in Jackson County .
It 's really a mess .
Last week I heard they had half as many registered voters as they had in 2004 , then yesterday I heard there were twice as many .
So I do n't think anyone knows what 's going on or what a mess it is going to be on Nov 4th .
And of course our local media is ignoring this .
Grr .

Karl Rove behind ACORN fraud
As a child , Karl Rove was told the fable of “ The boy who cried wolf . ”
When asked if he knew what the moral of the story was , young Karl replied , “ Yes !
Never tell the same lie twice . ”
In keeping to that lesson , and knowing that no candidate he has supported could ever win on merit alone , Rove has practiced a life - long philosophy of deception , prevarication , distraction and newspeak .
From planting bugs in his own office , to leaking false stories to make the national press look bad , to plain old voter suppression , Rove has run an ugly and effective campaign against the truth .
Fortunately , Rove ’s own bad press has been catching up with him , such as in the scandal surrounding the firing of eight U. S. attorneys .
David C. Iglesias of New Mexico lost his job in December 2005 after he declined to prosecute a voter - fraud case against ACORN , which had been registering large numbers of voters in the state 's low - income and largely minority neighborhoods in 2004 .
Prominent New Mexico Republicans , including U.S. Senator Pete Domenici , had repeatedly complained to chief White House political strategist Karl Rove about Iglesias ' failure to bring voter - fraud indictments .
Once Iglesias said he could n't prove a case against ACORN , his days were numbered .
ACORN became a target because of its successful voter - registration work .
As the 2004 election approached , then - Attorney - General John Ashcroft launched a broad initiative to crack down on supposed voter fraud in battleground states , including Florida , Missouri , Ohio and New Mexico , where ACORN was making headway registering voters .
In all of those states , Republicans filed suits against ACORN for voter fraud , and , in every case , ACORN was exonerated .
Seeing that that strategy has not been gaining enough of a foothold , Rove has unleashed a new campaign that would make a cowbird or cuckoo proud .
The Brown - headed Cowbird and the Cuckoo are well known for the practice of laying eggs in the nests of other species .
The host mother is tricked into raising the chick as one of her own .
Because the parasitic bird is usually larger and stronger , it takes most of the food the mother brings , starving out the other chicks .
In other words , since Rove could not beat ACORN with outside pressure , his lackeys have been planted inside ACORN .
There , they have gone wild with multiple registrations , fake names , dead applicants , and simply paying homeless people to register .
( By the way , homeless people can vote .
Paying them to do so is illegal . )
The endgame in all of this is two - fold .
First ,
Rove hopes to clog the system with so many bad registrations , that there will be a multitude of legitimate voters who will never make the final cut .
And second , the issues being raised by Republicans regarding ACORN are being used as a smokescreen for what they are doing behind the scenes to suppress Democratic voter turnout .
Using foreclosure lists to try to prevent people from voting ; saying a person cannot vote without a government - approved photo identification ; being kept from voting because you have an unpaid parking ticket , are behind on your child support , have a felony conviction or have filed for bankruptcy ; illegally purging voters from the qualified voter list , and sending out absentee ballot applications to Democrats with the wrong return address .
These tactics are the lowest of the low , but it is rig ht up Karl Rove ’s alley .
This might not be his last gasp , but the American voter can certainly make him crawl back into the slime - hole for much longer .
We won in 2006 , but not with as large of a margin if Rove and his attack dogs had not muddled up the works .
This year we need to not just win , but win by such an overwhelming majority that these deviant behaviors will be purged from our national consciousness .
We need to make them think twice before ever raising their ugly faces from the mud again .
As The Donald would say , “ Rove , you ’re fired ! ”

Pictured : Daredevil kayakers take the plunge down Britain 's tallest dam in death - defying white - knuckle ride
Scroll down to the end to watch the amazing video ...
Thrill seekers would probably agree that this fast - flowing spillway is much more fun - and terrifying - than your average theme park log flume .
At 300ft tall and almost 1,150ft long , the Llyn Brianne Dam near Llandovery , Midwales , is the tallest dam in the UK .
These breathtaking shots show a group of brave kayakers taking their lives in their hands as they launch themselves down the spillway , being propelled to speeds of around 40 mph .
At 300ft tall and almost 1,150ft long , the Llyn Brianne Dam near Llandovery , mid-Wales , is the tallest dam in the UK
The man -made dam , situated in the headwaters of Wales 's River Tywi , was constructed in the late 1960s and early 1970s to regulate the flow into the river .
The dam is a crushed and larger rock clay - filled dam with all the material used being obtained in the area itself .
Brave :
A kayaker , pictured on the crest of the dam , can reach speeds of up to 40 mph as they launch themselves down the spillway
The spillway of the dam is a notable tourist attraction when the reservoir is spilling .
In 1996 the reservoir spillway was increased by one metre in height and a hydro- electric generating station was added at the base of the dam , which has a gradient of 1:3:6 .

Idaho Vandals Cheerleaders Show Too Much ( Photos )
The good citizens of Moscow , Idaho have been quite vocal about the athletic uniforms of one of their college sports teams and the cheerleading squad at the University of Idaho .
A month ago they rose up in protest over a UI logo that was sewn onto the butt of Vandals players football pants .
The offending patch was promptly removed .
Now the folks in the stands have taken their own stand against what they collectively consider the skimpy and inappropriate uniforms of the Idaho Vandals cheerleading squad .
The cute two piece uni features a halter top and skirt ensemble and was said to have caused some of the squad members to be flashing more than their team spirit .
It has been likened to what the NFL cheerleaders wear and got the boot just one month into the school year .
Dean of Student Affairs , Bruce Pitman , said that they were sensitive to community pressure , although he did admit that some fans loved the uniforms .
The girls tried wearing black volleyball shorts and football jersey tops but that was only a temporary nod to the crowd .
The athletic director , Rob Spears , has spent $ 4,200 to purchase new uniforms that will arrive in time for the October 4th game .
They are said to feature a less revealing halter top and a skirt that is 6 " longer .
Added note : one of our readers pointed out that Idaho has a Mormon population that represents 20 % of the religious community of the state .
Things are starting to make more sense .
The viewer told us that cheerleaders at their school had to wear long sleeved turtleneck shirts and to - the - knees biker shorts under their uniforms .
Amazing but true .
Go Vandals !

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) -
The risks of inaction over climate change far outweigh the turmoil of the global financial crisis , a leading climate change expert said on Monday , while calling for new fiscal spending tailored to low carbon growth .
Climate change economist Nicholas Stern walks past the Toronto Stock Exchange ticker showing a quote for oil producer Husky Energy after a news conference at the Toronto Stock Exchange in Toronto , February 19 , 2007 .
REUTERS / J.P.
Moczulski
“ The risk consequences of ignoring climate change will be very much bigger than the consequences of ignoring risks in the financial system , ” said Nicholas Stern , a former British Treasury economist , who released a seminal report in 2006 that said inaction on emissions blamed for global warming could cause economic pain equal to the Great Depression .
“ That ’s a very important lesson , tackle risk early , ” Stern told a climate and carbon conference in Hong Kong .
As countries around the world move from deploying monetary and financial stabilization measures , to boosting fiscal spending to mend real economies , Stern said the opportunity was there to bring about a new , greener , carbon - reducing world order .
“ The lesson that we can draw out from this recession , is that you can boost demand in the best way possible by focusing on low carbon growth in future , ” Stern said , including greater public spending on mass public transport , energy and green technologies .
Stern ’s warning comes on the heels of last week ’s Asia - Europe or ASEM meeting in Beijing , where China indicated in talks it was committed to seeking a climate change pact in vital end - game talks in Copenhagen at the end of next year .
Leaders at the summit also urged countries not to use global economic upheaval as a reason for delaying a deal .
Partly as a result of the darkening global economic outlook , Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi recently warned that 10 other EU nations backed his efforts to block an EU climate plan , prompting further doubts over European action on global warming .
Yet Stern remained optimistic , saying while talks would be “ very tense ” the likelihood of a deal in Copenhagen to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2050 remained “ very high . ”
Any deal would have to iron out differences between the United States , historically the largest greenhouse gas emitter , and rapidly developing countries like China , which by some accounts has surpassed the United States on emissions .
China , with its bulging output of carbon dioxide , the main greenhouse gas behind global warming , was singled out by Stern along with the U.S. as pivotal in the talks , with the next U.S. president likely to be much more proactive than George W. Bush .
“ The U.S. and China will be the key leaders for a global deal .
Either one of them could kill it , and I do n’t think either one of them will kill it . ”
Fresh from a trip to China , Stern said China ’s next national economic blueprint or five - year plan would acknowledge its key role to stave off a big rise in global temperatures , the melting of ice - caps and destructive rises in sea levels the world over .
“ I think we ’ll see the 12th five - year plan focus on low carbon growth , ” he said .
McCain's ' Real - ly Stupid ' America Sarah Palin may be wrong about the existence of a “ real ” America where people are decent and patriotic – and a “ fake ” America where they ’re not .
But John McCain ’s election chances now appear to hinge on the existence of a “ real - ly stupid ” America .

Printer friendly Since mid-summer , the McCain campaign has devolved into silly arguments mixed with guilt - by - association smears : Barack Obama is a celebrity like Paris Hilton ; Obama had a passing connection to a violent Vietnam War-era radical , William Ayers ; Obama once represented the grassroots group , ACORN ; Obama spoke at a party for a Palestinian - American who has criticized Israel ; Obama is a “ socialist ” and a “ redistributionist ” because he favors a progressive income tax .
The sad fact is that McCain , who once disdained the politics of smear and distraction , has become its chief practitioner , joined by his running mate , Sarah Palin , who seems to have no constraints on what ugly or dangerous words come out of her mouth .
Despite the risks already surrounding the first major - party African - American nominee , Palin fired up her angry crowds by accusing Obama of “ palling around with terrorists , ” a reference to his limited association with Ayers .
Some of her supporters responded by calling Obama a “ traitor ” and yelling “ kill him . ”
More recently , McCain and Palin have linked Obama to a Middle East scholar at Columbia University named Rashid Khalidi , whom – like Ayers – they depict as a “ radical , ” but with the extra advantage of him having an Arab name .
" It seems that there is yet another radical professor from the neighborhood who spent a lot of time with Barack Obama going back several years , " Palin told an excited rally in Bowling Green , Ohio , on Oct. 29 .
" This is important , ” she instructed her fans before identifying Khalidi – whose name she mispronounced as “ Kha - lah - di ” – and saying : “ in addition to being a political ally of Barack Obama , he 's a former spokesperson for the Palestinian Liberation Organization . "
A chorus of angry boos followed .
Later , when asked about her new attempt at guilt - by - association , Palin insisted it was n’t “ negative campaigning , ” it was just calling someone out on his record .
However , Khalidi denies he was ever a PLO spokesman and it turned out his research organization received grants from a Republican international organization that had Sen.
McCain on its board .
Khalidi , who was born in New York and graduated from Yale , advised a Palestinian negotiating team during peace talks in the early 1990s that were sponsored by George H.W. Bush ’s administration .
This latest McCain - Palin smear was even too much for the Washington Post ’s neoconservative editorial writers , who said they disagree with Khalidi ’s criticism of Israel policies toward Palestinians but nevertheless called the GOP campaign tactic “ condemnable – especially during a campaign in which Arab ancestry has been the subject of insults . ”
When the Post asked Khalidi if he wished to comment on his sudden notoriety brought about by the McCain - Palin campaign , he responded via e-mail that “ I will stick to my policy of letting this idiot wind blow over . ”

An Idiocy Gust Another gust of that idiocy has been McCain ’s endless embrace of “ Joe the Plumber , ” a 34 - year - old Ohio man named Joe Wurzelbacher .
Wurzelbacher is n’t even a licensed plumber , but – since the third presidential debate – he has become McCain ’s symbol of an American everyman , someone whom the 72 - year - old McCain has called “ my role model . ”
Wurzelbacher launched his strange rise to national stardom by chatting along a rope line with Barack Obama about his tax proposals , specifically the plan to lower taxes on middle - class Americans and raise them on people earning more than $ 250,000 .
Wurzelbacher said he was considering buying his boss ’ company , which he thought might make slightly more than $ 250,000 and thus might see a rise in taxes under Obama ’s plan .
Obama responded by noting that any tax increase in that case would be slight and reiterated his contention that his tax plan would help America ’s embattled middle class in that it would “ spread the wealth . ”
Since then , Obama has noted that the vast majority of small businesses do n’t clear $ 250,000 and almost no plumbers do .
Nothing in the Obama - Wurzelbacher exchange was very remarkable .
In effect , Obama was reiterating the century - old case for a progressive income tax that assesses higher rates on the well - to - do than on those with modest incomes .
It was a concept famously advocated by John McCain ’s Republican hero , President Theodore Roosevelt , who in his New Nationalism speech of 1910 sounded far more radical than Barack Obama .
“ The really big fortune , the swollen fortune , by the mere fact of its size , acquires qualities which differentiate it in kind as well as in degree from what is possessed by men of relatively small means , ” Roosevelt said .
“ Therefore , I believe in a graduated income tax on big fortunes , and in another tax which is far more easily collected and far more effective , a graduated inheritance tax on big fortunes , properly safeguarded against evasion , and increasing rapidly in amount with the size of the estate . ”
However , McCain – apparently swapping his old role model ( Teddy Roosevelt ) for his new one ( Joe Wurzelbacher ) – accused Obama of “ socialism ” because of his support for rolling back tax cuts for the rich that were passed in the early days of George W. Bush ’s presidency ( and which McCain initially opposed ) .
Finally , Traction
In the final days of the campaign , McCain believes he has found traction by labeling Obama the “ redistributionist - in- chief . ”
McCain ’s argument , however , makes no real sense .
As Colin Powell noted in criticizing the tone of McCain ’s campaign , all taxation is about redistribution of money , usually toward projects that benefit the larger community , such as road construction or schools .
Since the days of the Cold War , the federal government has used taxes to redistribute trillions of dollars from citizens to what President Dwight Eisenhower labeled the “ military - industrial complex , ” which has been a bastion for conservative Republicans .
Ironically , too , the American tax structure has historically redistributed wealth from more liberal and Democratic states ( with higher income levels , like Connecticut ) to more conservative and Republican states ( with more poor people , like Mississippi ) .
The ironies continue , since one of the most “ socialistic ” states in the country is Alaska , where Gov. Palin has raised taxes on oil companies so she can send bigger checks to Alaska residents .
Also , many of McCain ’s supporters who most vociferously denounce Obama ’s tax plan are people like Wurzelbacher who live on a modest middle - class salary and would benefit from Obama ’s tax plans compared with McCain’s .
This " redistribution " debate also plays out against the backdrop of the Bush administration 's tax and economic policies that have resulted in a dramatic redistribution of the nation ’s wealth to the highest - income categories , creating income disparities not seen since the late 1920s right before the stock market crash and the Great Depression .
Yet , John McCain and his advisers apparently have latched on to a final hope : that enough voters wo n’t do the math about tax plans or carefully evaluate the guilt - by - association smears before they go to the polls , that they ’ll just vote their gut reactions to scary words , like “ socialism ” and “ Kha - lah - di . ”
The McCain - Palin political calculation is based on a lowest - common - denominator judgment about the American people .

First we had Janet Folger writing us a letter from prison in 2010 and delivering newscasts from early 2009 and now , via Good as You , it looks like Focus on the Family has gotten its hands on whatever time - travelling device Folger has invented in orded to send back their own 16 - page warning letter [ PDF ] from the years 2012 :
Dear friends , I can hardly sing “ The Star Spangled Banner ” any more .
When I hear the words , O say , does that star spangled banner yet wave
O ’er the land of the free and the home of the brave ?
I get tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat .
Now in October of 2012 , after seeing what has happened in the last four years , I do n’t think I can still answer , “ Yes , ” to that question .
We are not “ the land of the free and the home of the brave . ”
Many of our freedoms have been taken away by a liberal Supreme Court and a majority of Democrats in both the House and the Senate , and hardly any brave citizen dares to resist the new government policies any more .
The 2008 election was closer than anybody expected , but Barack Obama still won .
Many Christians voted for Obama – younger evangelicals actually provided him with the needed margin to defeat John McCain – but they did n’t think he would really follow through on the far left policies that had marked his entire previous career .
They were wrong .
Once left - leaning Justices took over the Supreme Court , Focus reports , gay marriage and abortion were mandated , the Boy Scouts were forced to disband , Christian schools were shut down and homeschoolers fled the country , religious speech was drastically curtailed and conservative radio was forced off the air , the Pledge of Allegiance was ruled unconstitutional , guns were taken away , pornography was rampant , taxes had sky - rocketed , Christian publishers had all gone out of business , Bush adminstration officials were targeted and imprisoned , and terrorists were constantly unleashing attacks on American soil .
And it was all the fault of those Christians who had voted for Obama :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Monday the road for the U.S. in Iraq has been " harder , longer , and more difficult than I personally imagined " and warned that despite some recent progress , success in Iraq is " not a sure thing . "
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says Iraq has seen a " hopeful but fragile turn of events . "
She made those comments at a packed auditorium at the State Department to salute a top general and a top diplomat .
She honored Gen. David Petraeus and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker with the highest award the State Department gives : The Distinguished Persons Award .
Rice said there has been progress in Iraq , with the economy " springing back to life " and displaced Iraqis returning home .
She added that al Qaeda is weaker and the Iraqi government is playing a more effective role .
Rice called it a " hopeful but fragile turn of events " but said success in Iraq is " not a sure thing . "
Before presenting the award to Petraeus , Rice praised his work in Iraq , calling him an " intellectual warrior and a warrior intellectual . "
Petraeus , she said , successfully implemented counter - insurgency ideas and negotiated patiently with Iraqi leaders .
Petraeus was promoted to head the U.S. Central Command in the Middle East .
His former deputy , Gen. Ray Odierno , took his place in Iraq .
Rice called Crocker a " lion of America 's foreign service . "
Under his leadership in Iraq , she says , the provincial reconstruction teams expanded and he has been instrumental in pushing Iraqi leaders and neighbors to make choices .
Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte presented Crocker with his award .
Both joined the ceremony by video conference from Baghdad .

Democrats ' gloom deepens
The Democrats are poised on the brink of victory .
And they can not stand it .
The news is too good .
Something has to go wrong .
On Saturday , Charlie Cook , an independent analyst and author of the Cook Report , wrote : “ This election is n’t over , but it is looking very bad for Republicans — and seems to be getting worse . ”

This plunged the Democrats into a deep gloom .
Good news is always bad news for them .
On Monday , CNN ’s John King announced : “ Most top [ people ] in the McCain campaign now believe New Mexico and Iowa are gone , that Barack Obama will win New Mexico and Iowa .
They are now off the dream list of the McCain campaign .
More interestingly , most top people inside the McCain campaign think Colorado is gone . ”
Democratic pessimism deepened when , that same day , Chris Cillizza and Shailagh Murray wrote in The Washington Post : “ In the 13 battleground states that require voters to register by party , there are nearly 1.5 million more Democrats than at this time in 2004 .
The comparable Republican numbers , by contrast , have fallen by 61,000 during that time .
Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by more than 3.3 million in these same 13 battleground states , roughly double the edge — 1.8 million — they enjoyed over the GOP four years ago . ”
Can it get worse for the Democrats ?
Yes !
On Tuesday , The Associated Press wrote : “ Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama spent $ 87.5 million last month and began October with nearly $ 134 million in the bank .
The numbers illustrate his vast financial advantage over John McCain , his Republican rival , in the final stretch of the contest .
McCain ended September with $ 47 million in the bank . ”
The story went on to note that Obama “ spent $ 65 million in advertising in September to McCain ’s $ 22 million .
In October , he has outspent McCain 4 - to - 1 in advertising . ”
Awful news .
Obama has a money problem .
And you know what it is ?
He might run out of time to spend all the money he has !
Election Day might come and go before Obama can spend the $ 5 million a day he is now raising .
( If this does happen , I suggest he borrow a page from Oprah and buy everyone in America a Pontiac .
Just as a gesture . )
Obama himself has reacted to the dismal drumbeat of good news .
At a fundraising concert in Manhattan last Thursday featuring Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel , Obama got up and said : “ Do n’t underestimate the capacity of Democrats to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory .
Do n’t underestimate our ability to screw it up . ”
Which is the prevailing mood in the top echelons of the Democratic Party right now .
The McCain campaign cannot possibly be as hapless as it looks , party leaders feel .
It is lulling the Democrats into complacency .
The Republicans have to have an October surprise , because the Republicans always have an October surprise .
Besides , the robocalls could work .
Never underestimate the power of the robocalls .
Because people really like getting robocalls , right ?
You are at home , it is dinnertime ( which is when they call you because they figure you are at home then ) , and you are either trying to relax or get the kids fed , and the phone rings and it is this recorded voice saying : “ I ’m calling for John McCain and the RNC because you need to know that Barack Obama has worked with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers . ”
And does that make you feel more or less positive about John McCain ?
Does it persuade you that McCain has a plan to save the economy ?
Or to help you pay your mortgage ?
Or that he has a steady hand on the tiller ?
For the robocalls to be effective , the Republicans would need Bill Ayers to plant bombs today and not when Barack Obama was 8 years old .
They need Ayers to plant bombs in key states right now with stickers on them that say : “ I am Barack Obama , and I endorse this bomb . ”
But McCain may have found his October surprise after all .
In Bensalem , Pa. , on Tuesday , McCain said : “ Now , I ’m not dumb enough to get mixed up in a World Series between swing states .
But I think I may have detected a little pattern with Sen. Obama .
It ’s pretty simple , really .
When he ’s campaigning in Philadelphia , he roots for the Phillies , and when he ’s campaigning in Tampa Bay , he ‘ shows love ’ to the Rays . ”
And rumors are now flying that McCain has proof that when Obama was in the second grade he once ate paste .
The Democrats are fearful of all this .
The Democrats are always fearful .
“ We have been on the precipice of victory before , ” Dan Pfeiffer , an Obama spokesman , told me .
“ You have never seen a more superstitious campaign than ours .
We do not talk about victory . ”
Talk about it , no .
Plan for it , yes .
Music Practice Boosts IQ And Visual Skills Also - Study
A Harvard - based study led by Drs. Gottfried Schlaug and Ellen Winner and published in PLoS ONE has found that children who study a musical instrument for at least three years outperform children with no instrumental training on tests measuring verbal ability and visual pattern completion , skills not normally associated with music , along with tests of auditory discrimination and finger dexterity , which are traditionally skills honed by the study of a musical instrument .
41 eight - to eleven - year - olds who had studied either piano or a string instrument for a minimum of three years were compared to 18 children who had no instrumental training .
Children in both groups spent 30 - 40 minutes per week in general music classes at school , but those in the instrumental group also received private lessons learning an instrument ( averaging 45 minutes per week ) and spent additional time practicing at home .
While it is no surprise that the young musicians scored significantly higher than those in the control group on two skills closely related to their music training ( auditory discrimination and finger dexterity ) , the more surprising result was that they also scored higher in two skills that appear unrelated to music — verbal ability ( as measured by a vocabulary IQ test ) and visual pattern completion ( as measured by the Raven 's Progressive Matrices ) .
The longer and more intensely the child had studied his or her instrument , the better he or she scored on these tests .
Studying an instrument thus seems to bring benefits in areas beyond those that are specifically targeted by music instruction , but that is not the end of the story .
Although this research sheds light on the question of whether connections between music and other , unrelated skills do exist , more studies examining the causal relationships between instrumental music training , practice intensity , and cognitive enhancements are needed .

A pink elephant is any claim on attention that ’s ignored instead of addressed .
Try not thinking of pink elephants , and you ’ll find that it ’s virtually impossible for a simple reason : you have to think of them in order to process the instruction .
The more you ignoring something , the more attention it occupies , or as the old saying goes , “ What you resist , you ’re stuck with . ”
The key to overcoming distractions is to face them , not ignore them .
Pink elephants come in all shapes and sizes .
They can be animal , vegetable , mineral or existential .
In daily life , they take the form of things like :
Chewing gingerly to avoid going to the dentist
“ Shoulds ” like , “ I should look into setting up an IRA ” or “ I should wake up now ”
Leaving non-current paperwork on a desk without tossing or filing it
Looking at an email and thinking , “ Hmmm ” — then moving on to the next one
Staying with a tolerably uninteresting career to avoid changing to a more passionate one
They can range from the sublime to the ridiculous , but the effect is the same : censorship attracts attention .
Trading one distraction for another
Ignoring pink elephants has two side effects .
First , we go numb to our environment .
We ca n’t desensitize ourselves to things selectively .
Input is input , and once the habit of ignoring input gains traction , it generalizes .
All “ paperwork ” becomes an annoyance , and the content of what ’s in the paperwork becomes irrelevant .
Junk mail that could tossed instantly sits around for hours or days , and begins to have as much psychic weight as the contract underneath it .
The second side effect is more insidious .
We ca n’t unthink a thought , but we can preempt it by preoccupying ourselves with another one .
Why else would it take 10 minutes to agree on where to go for lunch ?
A crutch activity will take exactly as long as the time we need to avoid thinking about something that matters .
It ’s a simple matter of trading one distraction for another .
Not all distractions are crutch activities .
On the contrary , if something is on you mind , but you have n’t defined what it is and what you ’re going to do about it , it ’s a distraction .
Estate planning that “ should ” be done but never seems to be urgent is a distraction .
That funny sound your car makes that may or may not warrant a trip to the mechanic is a distraction .
A single throughput
It ’s more efficient to think about something once than to not - think about it multiple times .
Developing the habit of single - handling takes discipline , but once it ’s ingrained you ’ll have a reference point for executing tasks with a minimum of effort .
“ Handling ” in this context can mean either doing the next action or defining the next action .
If it takes more than two minutes ( or longer if you ’re not otherwise engaged ) , write it down .
If something is likely to claim your attention in the future , capture it now rather than hoping it will resurface if it ’s important .
It probably will resurface , but not at the appropriate time and place .
You do n’t want to keep not - thinking about picking up the birthday cake after work when you ’re at work .
You ’ll have less focus available for work , and your attempts to ignore the unwritten reminders will be successful — when you ’re driving home .
Affirming negation
There ’s a subtle but critical difference between not deciding to do something and deciding not to do something .
Looking at a piece of junk mail on your desk repeatedly and ignoring it constantly requires a small amount of background processing — your brain knows that sooner or later , you ’re going to have to throw it out .
You have not decided to read it , so the next action is n’t implicit .
On the other hand , if you ’ve explicitly decided not to read it , you ’ll immediately throw it out .
The distraction of one open loop as trivial as junk mail is small , but as open loops multiply , the background noise increases .
From a cognitive standpoint , ignoring 10 small things can be more distracting that ignoring one big thing .
To keep mental static to a minimum , collect all distractions , however big or small , and process them into an external system you trust .
Another strategy for making decisions is to defer them .
You proactively decide now to decide later .
Maybe you need a key piece of information that wo n’t be available until next week , or maybe you ’re just to busy putting out a fire to think about everything that needs to be taken into consideration .
Instead of simply ignoring the issue , proactively narrow down the time or information necessary to make the decision .
If the decision depends on an external outcome , write down a reminder on your calendar for the date of that outcome ( or use your Waiting For list ) .
If you ’re too overwhelmed at the moment to focus on a complex decision , replace the usual knee - jerk “ I ’ll think about it later ” with the question , “ When will I have time to think about this ? ” — and answer then question with a scheduled action like “ Mind map estate planning ” or “ Call law firm . ”
By turning each problem into a physical action , you ’ll always be able to follow the bouncing ball , or at least know that it ’s in motion .

Technorati Tags : GTD , Productivity , Overcoming Distractions
By Leo Babauta
I ’ve written about motivation a bunch of times before here on Zen Habits , but the more I learn about it , the more I realize that motivation is n’t that complicated .
Sure , there are numerous tips that can help , numerous tactics and strategies I ’ve used with success .
But it really all boils down to two things .
And those two things are so deceptively simple that you might decide to stop reading after I name them : 1 ) make things enjoyable and 2 ) use positive public pressure .
But read on for more on how to use those two things to motivate yourself for any goal .
It ’s Motivation , Not Discipline
First let ’s back up a little bit .
A number of readers have emailed me about sticking to their goals — anything from exercise and eating right to being organized and productive to creating new habits — and have said they simply lack the discipline to stick with things for very long .
But what is discipline , really ?
It ’s mostly an illusion , in my experience .
When people say that someone has “ discipline ” , as I ’ve written about before , they really mean he has the motivation to stick to something .
In a previous post I used the example of someone in the military , a typical case of somone who is said to have discipline .
This military man might get up super early , fix his bed neatly , go on an early - morning run , do a bunch of other exercises , and generally do a disciplined job throughout the day .
But is that just because he ’s disciplined ?
I think it ’s mostly because he ’s in a situation where there ’s public pressure ( both positive and negative ) to do all of the things listed above .
If he does n’t do them , he might get yelled at or demerited or look bad in front of his peers .
If he does do them , he ’s an exemplary soldier .
There ’s also the fact that after awhile , these things become pleasurable for him .
He gets a sense of satisfaction out of staying in shape and keeping things neat .
He enjoys the early morning .
He feels good about being conscientious about his job .
So in the end , it ’s not some vague quality ( “ discipline ” ) that allows him to stick to these habits , but rather the two secrets of motivation : positive public pressure and enjoyment .
What I Learned From My Experiences
Over the last few years , I ’ve been experimenting with achieving various goals — from waking early to exercising to eliminating my debt and living frugally and simply and more .
And what I ’ve learned has repeatedly taught me that these two key motivation principles are all you need .
I ’ve learned other things as well , but the more I stick to my goals , the more I realize that it ’s these two themes that keep repeatedly surfacing .
It ’s almost eerie , actually .
Just a few goals as illustration :
Marathon .
Right now I ’m training for my third marathon , in Honolulu this December .
As I ’ve stuck with the toughest marathon plan I ’ve ever undertaken ( last week my longer runs were 12 and 20 miles , and this week I ’m doing 2 runs of 14 miles ) , I ’ve marveled at my ability to keep at it .
But it ’s not hard to figure out why : I ’ve publicly committed to doing this marathon — on this blog , on Twitter , and on Train For Humanity , where I ’m raising money for humanitarian causes through my training ( sponsor me here ! ) .
In addition to that , I ’m really enjoying all the running !

Blogging .
I ’ve now been blogging for almost two years ( I started in January 2007 ) , making Zen Habits one of the longest - running projects I ’ve ever stuck with .
I ’ve worked on many projects before , but they are usually completed within a year , if not within a few weeks or months .
Anything longer is usually intimidating to me .
But it has n’t taken discipline to stick with blogging , not at all .
It ’s something I really enjoy , and there ’s the added bonus of positive public pressure ( that ’s you , the readers ) that has motivated me to stick with it .

Writing a book .
A couple months ago , I finished the manuscript for my book , The Power of Less , that ’s coming out at the end of this year .
I will admit that I had some trouble writing this book , with the demands of publishing a blog ( two blogs actually ) , training for my second marathon in March , and preparing for my wedding in June .
I was n’t always following my own advice ( although in my defense I learned to segregate the different goals so I only concentrated on one at a time ) .
But I did get the book done with both forms of motivation — pressure from my publisher to turn in the manuscript , and the enjoyment I got from writing the book once I was able to clear away distractions and focus on the writing .
I could go into many more examples of how I used these two forms of motivation , but you get the idea .
Now let ’s take a look at each one and how you can use them to your advantage .
Positive Public Pressure
While pressure is often seen as a bad thing ( “ I ’m under too much pressure ! ” ) , if used properly it can actually be a good thing .
It ’s important that pressure not be applied in too negative a way and too high an intensity .
Keep things positive and at a manageable intensity , and things will move along nicely .
Some examples of how to use positive public pressure to motivate yourself :
Tell all your co-workers you ’re going to achieve a goal ( “ No sugary snacks this week ! ” or “ I ’m going to keep my email inbox completely empty ” ) and report to them regularly on your progress .
Email your family and friends and tell them about your goal and ask them to keep you accountable .
Email them regular updates , and tell them about your progress when you see them .
Post your goal on your blog and post regular updates .
It ’s important that you not just post the goal but also stay accountable with the updates .
Encourage people to ask you about your goal if you do n’t report your progress .
Join an online forum related to your goal — I ’ve done this when I quit smoking and also when I started running .
Introduce yourself , make friends , tell them about your goal , ask for help when you need it , and report your successes and failures .
Write a regular column in a publication on your goal .
I did this when I ran my first marathon , for my local newspaper .
It created a lot of positive public pressure — everywhere I went , people would say , “ Hey , you ’re that marathon guy !
How ’s the running going ? ”
Of course , not everyone can write a column for a newspaper , but you could do it for a group blog or a newsletter or some other type of publication .
Post your goal and a chart of your progress up in your office or other public place .
Post pictures of yourself each day .
One guy did this and created a video of his progress — it was amazing to watch .
You get the idea .
I ’m sure you can come up with some ideas of your own .
Enjoy Your Goal Activity
You can motivate yourself to do something you do n’t like to do , using positive public pressure as motivation .
But if you really do n’t enjoy it , you ’ll only be able to keep it up for so long .
And even if you could do it for months and years … is that something you ’d want to do ?
If you do n’t enjoy it , why do it for very long ?
But , you might say , what if it ’s something I really want to achieve but I do n’t enjoy it ?
There are ways to find enjoyment in most things — the key is to focus on the enjoyable parts .
Focus on the positive .
Here are some ways to use this motivational principle to your advantage :
Having trouble motivating yourself to write for your blog ?
Look for topics that excite you .
If you find things that you ’re passionate about , writing becomes easy .
Having trouble with a dissertation for graduate school ?
Maybe you ’re not as passionate about the topic as you thought you were .
Re-examine your dissertation topic and see if you can either re-energize yourself about it or find a new topic you can get excited about .
Having a hard time exercising ?
Find exercise that ’s fun for you .
If you do n’t like running , try soccer or basketball or rowing .
If you do n’t like to lift weights , try doing some primal workouts where you flip logs and jump through tires .
Go hiking .
Walk with friends and talk the whole time .
Is eating healthy a challenge for you ?
Find healthy foods you love .
Experiment with new recipes and have fun testing them out .
Is training for a marathon tough ?
Learn to enjoy the quiet of the early morning , the contemplative nature of running , or the beautiful nature that surrounds you .
Or play some songs that pump you up .
Or listen to interesting audiobooks as you run .
Find the enjoyable parts of any activity , and focus on those .
In time , you can really learn to love something .
Or , switch to something you love more and stick to that .
These two principles , especially when used together , can be powerful motivators .
In fact , in most cases , they ’re all the motivation I ever need .
Look at Joe Biden 's face and listen to the inflection in his voice when he learns that the McCain campaign is distributing talking points linking Barack Obama to Osama bin Laden .
" Virginia GOP Chairman Jeffrey M. Fredericks was quoted by Time magazine as telling campaign volunteers to draw connections between Obama and Osama bin Laden . "
" I do n't believe it … I can't believe it , " Biden said .
" I 'm surprised John McCain has n't gone down and whacked the guy with his fist .
I mean , I do n't think there 's a prejudiced bone in John McCain 's body .
But that kind of stuff is really off the wall .
I refuse to let myself believe John McCain has anything to do with any of that . "
Joe Biden 's personal affection for John McCain blinds him from the reality of the campaign that 's being waged .
Fredericks is n't a low - level volunteer spouting off at the mouth ; he 's the Virginia state GOP Chairman .
And it 's not like McCain does n't know what 's going on .
When asked specifically about it Monday on a local Virginia TV station , he refused to condemn the remarks , instead saying he would " have to look at the context . "
Are you kidding ?
How is it possible to contextualize a connection between Barack Obama and Osama bin Laden ?
Open your eyes , Joe : This is the campaign John McCain has chosen to run .
He 's willing to win at all costs , even if that means viciously smearing Obama with the same people who viciously smeared him back in 2000 .
The honorable McCain has left the building .
Country first my ass .
Recently , I thought about two seemingly different topics which turn out to form a fruitful combination .
One thing I have been thinking about a lot is how to model functional - logic programming in Haskell without using impure features to ensure call - time choice semantics of lazy computations .
The other thing is how to integrate constraint solving in a purely functional setting , to improve the performance of test - case generation .
It turns out that a framework for constrained monadic computations is enough to express call - time choice in non-deterministic lazy computations .
We can add constraint solving to any instance of the MonadPlus type class and , hence , reuse existing instances of this class to model lazy functional - logic programming in pure Haskell .
This post discusses how to add constraints to any instance of MonadPlus .
How to use a constraint monad to model functional - logic programming will be explained elsewhere .
A module implementing the ideas described in this post is available as plain literate Haskell file and in a marked - up version for online reference .
You can access the most recent version of the module using git by fetching my git repository .
Default implementation of MonadPlus
Let ’s start with a simple instance of MonadPlus that implements every operation but ( >>= ) with a constructor :
data MP a = Return a | MZero | MPlus ( MP a ) ( MP a ) instance Monad MP where return = Return Return x >>= f = f x MZero >>= _ = MZero MPlus x y >>= f = MPlus ( x >>= f ) ( y >>= f ) instance MonadPlus MP where mzero = MZero mplus = MPlus
Guards and Constraint Stores
We want to be able to guard monadic computations with constraints .
Specifically , we ’d like to have an additional operation
guarded :: Constraint -> m a -> m a
that asserts a given constraint in a given computation .
In order to not fix the type of constraints we make it an associated type synonym of a type class for constraint stores .
So the actual type of guarded is
guarded :: Constraint cs -> m a -> m a
where cs is a constraint store .
Constraint stores are instances of the class CStore declaring an associated type of constraints and an operation for asserting a constraint in a monad .
class MonadPlus ( Solver cs ) => ConstraintStore cs where type Constraint cs type Solver cs :: * -> * assert :: Constraint cs -> cs ->
Solver cs cs
A constraint store has an associated solver monad which must be an instance of MonadPlus and assert may fail ( i.e. yield mzero ) if the constraint is inconsistent or branch ( i.e. call mplus ) to split the given constraint into different alternatives .
Constraint Monads and an Instance
The type class for constraint monads is parameterized by a constraint store .
Apart from guarded it provides an operation solution that returns pairs of results and constraint stores in the solver monad of the constraint store .
class ( MonadPlus m , CStore ( Store m ) ) =>
MonadC m where type Store m guarded :: Constraint cs -> m a -> m a solution :: m a -> Store m ->
Solver ( Store m ) ( a , Store m )
We wo n’t look at specific constraint stores but simply assume that we have an instance available .
Let ’s try to make the datatype MP an instance of MonadC .
Following the original design , we can simply add an additional constructor Guarded to the data - type declaration .
data CStore cs => MP cs a = ... | Guarded ( Constraint cs ) ( MP cs a )
Before implementing the new operations of MonadC , we need to extend the implementation of ( >>= ) .
instance Monad ( MP cs ) where ...
Guarded c x >>= f = Guarded c ( x >>= f )
That was easy !
Note that no constraint store is threaded through the computation like in a state monad — the constraints are simply left untouched by the implementation of ( >>= ) .
Now , we can make the extended version of MP an instance of MonadC .
The operation guarded is implemented with the corresponding constructor .
The interesting part is the implementation of solution .
instance CStore cs => MonadC ( MP cs ) where type Store ( MP cs ) = cs guarded = Guarded solution ( Return x ) cs = return ( x , cs ) solution MZero _ = mzero solution ( MPlus x y ) cs = solution x cs `mplus` solution y cs solution ( Guarded c x ) cs = assert c cs >>= solution x
The constraint store is threaded through the computation of solution and constraints are asserted on the fly .
An application of assert may fail or branch leading to additional non-determinism and failure compared to the original structure of the computation .
The solutions of a constrained computation are returned in the solver monad of the constraint store which can be an arbitrary instance of MonadPlus — possibly , but not necessarily MP .
Generalization
We have successfully defined an instance of a constraint monad by extending the underlying data type with a constructor for guarded computations .
We can do the same for other instances of MonadPlus .
However , it seems unfortunate to be forced to do the same work over and over again .
For many instances of MonadPlus — like the list monad — it is not even possible to extend the data type , because we cannot change the module where it is implemented .
Hence , we would prefer being able to add constraints to every MonadPlus instance at once without having to change their underlying representation .
How can we do this ?
We need a monad transformer !
We will not exactly define a monad transformer but something very similar .
Instead of transforming an arbitrary instance of MonadPlus , we transform the solver monad of a constraint store — which can be an arbitrary instance of MonadPlus .
We define a data type Constr that is parameterized by a constraint store as follows .
newtype Constr cs a = Constr { runConstr :: Solver cs ( Constrained cs a ) } data Constrained cs a = Lifted a | Guarded ( Constraint cs ) ( Constr cs a )
Stare at these definitions for a minute and then cut the knots in your brain .
The type ( Constr cs ) adds constraints to the monad ( Solver cs ) for any constraint store cs .
Remember the original definition of the data type MP ?
Apart from the newtype constructor Constr that wo n’t be present at run time , values of type ( Constr cs a ) will have a mixture of MPlus and Guarded constructors as inner nodes just like the extended version of MP if MP is the solver monad of cs !
Additionally , we need to add Lifted constructors to returned values and Return constructors around guarded values to satisfy the type checker .
Transforming Monads
If cs is a constraint store , then ( Constr cs ) is a monad .
We only need to define return and ( >>= ) which is a bit tricky because of the interleaved types but no magic .
instance CStore cs => Monad ( Constr cs ) where return = Constr . return .
Lifted x >>= f = Constr ( runConstr x >>= bind ) where bind ( Lifted a ) = runConstr ( f a ) bind ( Guarded c y ) = return ( Guarded c ( y >>= f ) )
Just like previously , when extending MP , we leave the Guarded constructor untouched and simply descend into it ’s argument .
( Constr cs ) is also an instance of MonadPlus .
The instance definition is straight forward — we only wrap and unwrap newtype constructors and reuse the operations of the solver monad .
instance CStore cs => MonadPlus ( Constr cs ) where mzero = Constr mzero x `mplus` y = Constr ( runConstr x `mplus` runConstr y )
The interesting part of the instance definition for MonadC is again the implementation of the operation solution .
instance CStore cs => MonadC ( Constr cs ) where guarded c x = Constr ( return ( Guarded c x ) ) solution x cs = runConstr x >>= solve where solve ( Lifted a ) = return ( a , cs ) solve ( Guarded c y ) = assert c cs >>= solution y
Apart from translating between the interleaved types it resembles the original definition for the extended version of MP .
With these definitions , we get the functionality that we have implemented for MP for free for every instance of MonadPlus that is used as solver monad in a constraint store .
With the ideas described in this post , we can add arbitrary constraints to arbitrary instances of MonadPlus .
As mentioned above , this enables us to express lazy non-deterministic computations with call - time choice semantics reusing existing instances of MonadPlus .
But that is a different story .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - FBI officials defended on Monday the scientific evidence linking a U.S. Army scientist who committed suicide to the deadly 2001 anthrax attacks , but acknowledged missteps occurred early in its investigation .
Bruce Ivins , seen in this photograph taken during an award ceremony at a Pentagon ceremony March 14 , 2003 .
REUTERS / USAMRIID / Handout ( UNITED STATES )
The FBI marched out a panel of outside scientific experts in an effort to end lingering doubts on whether Dr. Bruce Ivins was solely responsible for the attacks that killed five people and shook a nation already reeling from the September 11 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington .
In briefings first for scientific journals and then for the news media , the FBI laid out what one official described as a “ body of powerful evidence ” after nearly seven years of investigation on the origin of the anthrax sent through the U.S. mail system and on the alleged perpetrator .
The FBI earlier this month released federal court documents that outlined its case against Ivins , a researcher and an anthrax expert at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases or USAMRIID in Maryland .
Ivins killed himself late last month just as prosecutors prepared to charge him with murder for committing the attacks .
His attorney has said he was innocent .
Several prominent scientists have questioned the FBI ’s case against Ivins and the scientific backing for it .
“ I want to see the data .
I want to see the valid scientific links made , ” said Dr. C. J. Peters , a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston , who worked at USAMRIID until 1990 .
“ The FBI needs to explain why it zeroed in on Ivins , how he could have made the anthrax mailed to lawmakers and the media , and how he ( or anyone else ) could have pulled off the attacks , acting alone , ” Richard Spertzel , former head of the biological weapons section of the United Nations Special Commission and a member of the Iraq Survey Group , wrote in a commentary earlier this month in the Wall Street Journal .
Critics have questioned the evidence against Ivins , partly because FBI investigators mistakenly focused for years on another scientist at Fort Detrick , Steven Hatfill .
Hatfill was never charged and the government agreed in June to pay him $ 5.85 million to settle a lawsuit .
Many of the questions at the briefing focused on the early part of the investigation in February 2002 , when Ivins submitted an anthrax sample from his lab , but did not follow the proper protocol .
The FBI then destroyed that sample .
“ Obviously , looking at it in hindsight , we would do things differently today , ” FBI Assistant Director Vahid Majidi said when asked whether the FBI should have kept the sample .
“ Were we perfect ?
Absolutely not .
We ’ve had missteps .
Those are the lessons learned . ”
FBI Laboratory Director D. Christian
Hassell said of the sample , “ In hindsight , it would have been useful to have saved it . ”
The FBI discovered several years later through genetic testing that the first sample was a unique strain of anthrax , like the strain used in the attacks .
“ The anthrax probe helped to found the field of bioforensics , ” said James Burans , associate lab director at the National Bioforensics Analysis Center at the Department of Homeland Security .
FBI officials said some of the initial sample provided by Ivins had been kept by one of the outside scientists used by the FBI .
Majidi said the FBI had turned to Ivins , a microbiologist who had been working on an anthrax vaccine , for help in developing the protocol or procedures for the providing of the anthrax samples .
Majidi said he doubted the FBI will ever be able to satisfy all of its critics with their suspicions about the case , saying it will be like the conspiracy theories that still exist over the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy .

Jamie Spears Named Britney 's Permanent Conservator
Los Angeles Court Commissionerhas namedpermanent conservator of his daughters affairs , and he and attorneywere named permanent co-conservators ofestate .
The men will be in control of her business affairs and career opportunities .
Samuel Ingham , Brit 's court appointed lawyer , said that he had spoken to the celebrity on several occasions and that she did not object to her father being named permanent conservator .
She will likely have greater access to her sons because the court considers permanent conservatorship a safety net .
This latest development in Britney 's life does not mean that this will be forever .
The status will remain in place until Spears is deemed ready to take back control .
In many cases it is just a formality to avoid having to renew a temporary status over and over again .
Either way , good for Britney for knowing that she is not ready to take over control of her affairs .

The political landscape in Washington , DC , is undergoing a dramatic shift as the Democratic tide rolls in , and , after eight years of drug war status quo under the Republicans , drug reformers are now hoping the change in administrations will lead to positive changes in federal drug policies .
As with every other aspect of federal policy , groups interested in criminal justice and drug policy reform are coming out of the woodwork with their own recommendations for Obama and the Democratic Congress .
This week , we will look at some of those proposals and attempt to assess the prospects for real change .
The White House

Eliminate the crack cocaine sentencing disparity
Improve and expand the federal " safety valve "
Create a sunset provision on existing and new mandatory minimums

Support racial impact statements as a means of reducing unwarranted sentencing disparities
Support analysis of racial and ethnic disparity in the federal justice system
Add a federal public defender as an ex officio member of the United States Sentencing Commission
One of the most comprehensive criminal justice reform proposals , of which drug - related reform is only a small part , comes from a nonpartisan consortium of organizations and individuals coordinated by the Constitution Project , including groups such as the Sentencing Project Families Against Mandatory Minimums ( FAMM ) , and the Open Society Policy Center .
The set of proposals , Smart on Crime : Recommendations for the Next Administration and Congress , includes the following recommendations :
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) has also issued a set of recommendations , Actions for Restoring America : How to Begin Repairing the Damage to Freedom in America Under Bush , which include some drug reform provisions :
Crack / Powder Sentencing :
The attorney general should revise the US Attorneys '
Manual to require that crack offenses are charged as " cocaine " and not " cocaine base , " effectively resulting in elimination of the disparity .
Medical Marijuana :
Halt the use of Justice Department funds to arrest and prosecute medical marijuana users in states with current laws permitting access to physician - supervised medical marijuana .
In particular , the US Attorney general should update the US Attorneys ' Manual to de-prioritize the arrest and prosecution of medical marijuana users in medical marijuana states .
There is currently no regulation in place to be amended or repealed ; there is , of course , a federal statutory scheme that prohibits marijuana use unless pursuant to approved research .
But US
Attorneys have broad charging discretion in determining what types of cases to prosecute , and with drugs , what threshold amounts that will trigger prosecution .
The US Attorneys ' Manual contains guidelines promulgated by the Attorney general and followed by US Attorneys and their assistants .
The DEA Administrator should grant Lyle Craker 's application for a Schedule I license to produce research - grade medical marijuana for use in DEA - and FDA - approved studies .
This would only require DEA to approve the current recommendation of its own Administrative Law Judge .
All relevant agencies should stop denying the existence of medical uses of marijuana -- as nearly one - third of states have done by enacting laws -- and therefore , under existing legal criteria , reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule V .
Issue an executive order stating that , " No veteran shall be denied care solely on the basis of using marijuana for medical purposes in compliance with state law . "
Although there are many known instances of veterans being denied care as a result of medical marijuana use , we have not been able to identify a specific regulation that mandates or authorizes this policy .
Federal Racial Profiling : Issue an executive order prohibiting racial profiling by federal officers and banning law enforcement practices that disproportionately target people for investigation and enforcement based on race , ethnicity , national origin , sex or religion .
Include in the order a mandate that federal agencies collect data on hit rates for stops and searches , and that such data be disaggregated by group .
DOJ should issue guidelines regarding the use of race by federal law enforcement agencies .
The new guidelines should clarify that federal law enforcement officials may not use race , ethnicity , religion , national origin , or sex to any degree , except that officers may rely on these factors in a specific suspect description as they would any noticeable characteristic of a subject .
Looking to the south , the Latin America Working Group , a coalition of nonprofit groups , has issued a petition urging Obama " to build a just policy towards Latin America and the Caribbean that unites us with our neighbors . "
Included in its proposals are :
Actively work for peace in Colombia .
In a war that threatens to go on indefinitely , the immense suffering of the civilian population demands that the United States takes risks to achieve peace .
If the United States is to actively support peace , it must stop endlessly bankrolling war and help bring an end to the hemisphere 's worst humanitarian crisis .
Get serious -- and smart -- about drug policy .
Our current drug policy is n't only expensive and ineffective , it 's also inhumane .
Instead of continuing a failed approach that brings soldiers into Latin America 's streets and fields , we must invest in alternative development projects in the Andes and drug treatment and prevention here at home .
The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ( NORML ) has some suggestions as well .
As NORML 's Paul Armentano wrote last week on Alternet :
President Obama must uphold his campaign promise to cease the federal arrest and prosecution of ( state ) law - abiding medical cannabis patients and dispensaries by appointing leaders at the US Drug Enforcement Administration , the US Department of Justice , and the US Attorney General 's office who will respect the will of the voters in the thirteen states that have legalized the physician - supervised use of medicinal marijuana .
President Obama should use the power of the bully pulpit to reframe the drug policy debate from one of criminal policy to one of public health .
Obama can stimulate this change by appointing directors to the Office of National Drug Control Policy who possess professional backgrounds in public health , addiction , and treatment rather than in law enforcement .
President Obama should follow up on statements he made earlier in his career in favor of marijuana decriminalization by establishing a bi-partisan presidential commission to review the budgetary , social , and health costs associated with federal marijuana prohibition , and to make progressive recommendations for future policy changes .
Clearly , the drug reform community and its allies see the change of administrations as an opportunity to advance the cause .
The question is how receptive will the Obama administration and the Democratic Congress be to drug reform efforts .
" We 've examined Obama 's record and his statements , and 90 % of it is good , " said David Borden , executive director of StoptheDrugWar.org ( publisher of this newsletter ) .
" But we do n't know what he intends to do in office .
There is an enormous amount of good he can do , " Borden said , mentioning opening up funding for needle exchange programs , US Attorney appointments , and stopping DEA raids on medical marijuana providers .
" Will Obama make some attempt to actualize the progressive drug reform positions he has taken ?
He has a lot on his plate , and drug policy reform has tended to be the first thing dropped by left - leaning politicians . "
There will be some early indicators of administration interest in drug reform , said Bill Piper , national affairs director for the Drug Policy Alliance .
" We will be watching to see if he issues an executive order stopping the DEA raids ; that would be a huge sign , " he said .
" He could also repeal the needle exchange funding ban .
The congressional ban would still be in place , but that would show some great leadership .
If they started taking on drug policy issues in the first 100 days , that would be a great sign , but I do n't think people should expect that .
There are many other issues , and it 's going to take awhile just to clean up Bush 's mess .
I 'm optimistic , but I do n't expect big changes to come quickly . "
" We are hoping to see a new direction , " said Nkechi Taifa , senior policy analyst for civil and criminal justice reform for the Open Society Policy Center .
" We could n't have a better scenario with the incoming vice president having sponsored the one - to - one crack / powder bill in the Senate and the incoming president being a sponsor .
And we have a situation in Congress , and particularly in the Senate , where there is bipartisan interest in sentencing reform .
Both sides of the aisle want some sort of movement on this , it 's been studied and vetted , and now Congress needs to do the right thing .
It 's time to get smart on crime , and this is not a radical agenda .
As far as I 'm concerned , fixing the crack / powder disparity is the compromise , and elimination of mandatory minimums is what really needs to be on the agenda . "
" With the Smart on Crime proposals , we tried to focus on what was feasible , " said the Sentencing Project 's Kara Gotsch .
" These are items where we think we are likely to get support , where the community has demonstrated support , or where there has been legislation proposed to deal with these issues .
It prioritizes the issues we think are most likely to move , and crack sentencing reform is on that list . "
The marijuana reform groups are more narrowly focused , of course , but they , too are looking for positive change .
" Obama has made it very clear on the campaign trail that he disagrees with the use of federal agencies to undo medical marijuana laws in states that have passed them , " said Dan Bernath , a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project .
" He has vowed to stop that .
Obama seems to be someone who values facts and reasoned decision - making .
If he applies that to marijuana policy , that could be a good thing " .
While the list of possible drug reforms is long and varied , it is also notable for what has not been included .
Only NORML even mentions marijuana decriminalization , and no one is talking about ending the drug war -- only making it a bit kinder and gentler .
The L - word remains unutterable .
" While we 're optimistic about reducing the harms of prohibition , legalization is not something that I think they will take on , " said Piper .
" But any movement toward drug reform is good .
If we can begin to shift to a more health - oriented approach , that will change how Americans think about this issue and create a space where regulation can be discussed in a a rational manner .
Now , because of our moralist criminal justice framework , it is difficult to have a sane discussion about legalization . "
" We did n't talk that much about legalization , " said Gotsch in reference to the Smart on Crime proposals .
" A lot of organizations involved have more ambitious goals , but that would n't get the kind of reaction we want .
There just is n't the political support yet for legalization , even of marijuana . "
" We should be talking about legalization , yes , " said StoptheDrugWar.org 's Borden , " but should we be talking about it in communications to the new president who has shown no sign of supporting it ?
Not necessarily .
We must push the envelope , but if we push it too far in lobbying communications to national leadership , we risk losing their attention . "
" I do think it would be a mistake to blend that kind of caution into ideological caution over what we are willing to talk about at all , " Borden continued .
" I think we should be talking about legalization , it 's just a question of when and where , " he argued .
Talking legalization is premature , said Eric Sterling , formerly counsel to the US House Judiciary Committee and now president of the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation .
" What we are not yet doing as a movement is building upon our successes , " he said .
" We just saw medical marijuana win overwhelmingly in Michigan and decriminalization in Massachusetts , but the nation 's commentariat has not picked up on it , and our movement has not been sufficiently aggressive in getting those votes translated into the political discourse .
We have n't broken out of the making fun phase of marijuana policy yet . "
Sterling pointed in particular to the medical marijuana issue .
" Everyone recognizes that the state - federal conflict on medical marijuana is a major impediment , and we have 26 senators representing medical marijuana states , but not a single senator has introduced a medical marijuana bill , " he said .
" It 's an obvious area for legislative activity in the Senate , but it has n't happened .
This suggests that we as a movement still lack the political muscle even on something as uncontroversial as the medical use of marijuana . "
Even the apparent obvious targets for reform , such as the crack / powder sentencing disparity , are going to require a lot of work , said Sterling .
" It will continue to be a struggle , " he said .
" The best crack bill was Biden 's , cosponsored by Obama and Clinton , but I 'm not sure who is going to pick that up this year .
The sentencing reform community continues to struggle to frame the issue as effective law enforcement , and I think it 's only on those terms that we can win . "
Reformers also face the reality that the politics of crime continues to be a sensitive issue for the majority Democrats , Sterling said .
" Crime is an issue members are frightened about , and it's an area where Republicans traditionally feel they have the upper ground .
The Democrats are going to be reluctant to open themselves up to attack in areas where there is not a strong political upside .
On many issues , Congress acts when there is a clear universe of allies who will benefit and who are pushing for action .
I do n't know if we are there yet . "
Change is the mantra of the Obama administration , and change is what the drug reform community is hoping for .
Now , the community must act to ensure that change happens , and that the right changes happen .
The path into bankruptcy is now rougher , the path out is steeper , and the change could hardly come at a more difficult time for many US consumers .
An overhaul of the bankruptcy code - which takes effect Monday - means that Americans will face higher fees and higher burdens of proof before having any debts wiped clean in court .
The law aims to encourage more responsible behavior by a debt - drenched nation , and to rein in abuses of bankruptcy protection .
The motive is laudable , many say .
But the new law also creates additional burdens for many Americans at a time of rising pocketbook challenges .
Energy prices have surged .
Interest rates are rising .
Credit - card firms are boosting rates for high - risk customers while raising minimum payments .
And a trend of rising home values , which has helped sustain consumer spending , may be slowing .
" If that goes ... you 've got a very combustible situation , " says Brad Stroh , who heads Freedom Financial Network in San Mateo , Calif .
" We think the fourth quarter could be very , very difficult for the American consumer . "
Consumer spending now drives more than two - thirds of US economic activity , and an era of low interest rates has helped borrowers do much of that spending .
Now the climate appears to be shifting .
Even as the price of goods accelerates , so is the price of borrowing .
At the same time , the hurdles for people who get into financial trouble just got higher .
By making bankruptcy tougher , the new law affects more than 1 million people annually who typically face a combination of debt and dire straits , such as illness , a job loss , or divorce .
" In some ways it 's going to affect everyone who files for bankruptcy , because the cost is going to go up , " says Deborah Thorne , an Ohio University sociologist who has researched bankruptcy .
Lawyers may charge another $ 500 or so because of new paperwork requirements .
And the government 's fee for a Chapter 7 filing is now $ 274 , up from $ 209 .
But the law 's main impact is targeted toward those with reasonably strong incomes .
Its core feature is a means test , designed to steer more of these people toward Chapter 13 bankruptcy ( in which they pay what they can to creditors over a five - year period ) rather than Chapter 7 ( which quickly eliminates many debts ) .
Between the means test and higher bankruptcy fees , the result could be to discourage some people from filing for protection from creditors .
The ranks of those " underground " - struggling to avoid creditors and get by - could grow .
Others would achieve greater financial discipline , in or out of court .
Here 's how the new system compares with the old :
Until now , the system relied strongly on a judge 's discretion .
Petitions for Chapter 7 could be accepted or rejected , but there was no standard means test .
The new system has a multistep test for entering Chapter 7 .
First , the filer 's family income over the past six months is considered .
If it 's below the state median , Chapter 7 is available .
If it 's higher than the median , the court will examine the filer 's ability to pay debts .
The judge considers whether , after allowing for living expenses , the filer can pay at least $ 100 a month to creditors - and whether within five years the total payments can reach either $ 10,000 or 25 percent of unsecured debts ( such as credit cards ) .
If so , the door to Chapter 7 slams shut .
Probably .
The law also provides for extraordinary circumstances to qualify people for Chapter 7 protection .
A severe illness is one example .
Another is hurricane Katrina .
Storm victims are being given some extra leeway .
Some data suggest that 15 percent of Chapter 7 filers may be above the median income in the states where they live , says Nathalie Martin , a scholar at the American Bankruptcy Institute in Washington .
But it may be only about 5 percent , she reckons , who actually get bumped out of Chapter 7 by the new law .
Still , for those affected , the shift is significant .
If they file under Chapter 13 , a judge will determine how much of their income they can use for living costs - a budget now based on formulas developed by the Internal Revenue Service .
The rest will go to creditors , generally for a five - year period .
It can be a grueling financial workout , judging by the two - thirds dropout rate of debtors who try to navigate Chapter 13 .
Creditors , including the bank - card industry , lobbied for years to get the new law through Congress .
But in the end , America 's bankruptcy woes are partly the making of lenders themselves , some observers say .
Lenders aggressively market everything from credit cards to interest - only home loans , and bankruptcy rates have risen in proportion with consumer debt .
" Bankruptcy filings were up , but nowhere near as much as credit - card profits , " Brad Botis , an Alabama bankruptcy attorney , said Friday as he raced to help people rushing to file before the law took effect .
The legal change comes alongside voluntary steps by the industry to crack down on delinquent payers .
In the past year , it has become common for consumers to see interest rates rise on all of their cards if they miss a payment on one , for example .
Another change , forced on consumers by the federal government , will test borrowers ' wherewithal starting this winter .
New rules require sizable minimum - payment hikes , to make sure each monthly payment covers at least 1 percent of the balance on a card .
" The end goal is a good one " - to help people avoid years of debt buildup , says Mr. Stroh , whose firm tries to help people avoid bankruptcy .
" The unfortunate consequence is that some people living month to month are suddenly in serious trouble . "
Key provisions of the new bankruptcy law
• The law 's centerpiece is a means test , intended to force more bankruptcy filers to pay what they can to creditors ( Chapter 13 status ) , rather than allowing them to wipe out debt quickly ( Chapter 7 status ) .
• People must get credit counseling before filing , a move that may help some avoid bankruptcy .
