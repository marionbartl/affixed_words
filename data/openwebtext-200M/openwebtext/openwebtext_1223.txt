5 Introduction
Well - known international athletes have successfully competed barefoot , most notably Zola Budd - Pieterse from South Africa and the late Abebe Bikila from Ethiopia .
Running in bare feet in long distance events is evidently not a barrier to performance at the highest levels .
Indeed , in this review I will show that wearing running shoes probably reduces performance and increases the risk of injury .
I became interested in research on barefoot running when I noticed that a reasonably high proportion of runners compete in bare feet during cross-country races in Queensland , Australia .
I have based the review on articles I found containing the words barefoot and running in Medline , SportDiscus , and in Web publications .
I found several original research reports on the occurrence and mechanisms of acute and chronic injuries in unshod and shod populations , and a few reports on the energy cost of running with and without shoes ( including an unpublished thesis ) .
Two authors provided recommendations for adapting to barefoot running .
I also found informal websites devoted to barefoot running and barefoot living .
There are apparently no published controlled trials of the effects of running in bare feet on simulated or real competitive performance , nor any surveys on the reasons why people do not compete barefoot .
Injuries
Where barefoot and shod populations co-exist , as in Haiti , injury rates of the lower extremity are substantially higher in the shod population ( Robbins and Hanna , 1987 ) .
Furthermore , running - related chronic injuries to bone and connective tissue in the legs are rare in developing countries , where most people are habitually barefooted ( Robbins and Hanna , 1987 ) .
This association between injury and wearing shoes is consistent with the possibility that wearing shoes increases the risk of injury , but other explanations for the association are possible ; for example , in developing countries barefoot runners may be too poor to seek medical attention , shod runners may wear shoes because they have problems running barefoot , and shod runners may wear bad shoes , wear shoes incorrectly , and cover more miles .
Prospective studies and randomized controlled trials of barefoot and shod running would resolve this uncertainty .
Studies of rates of injury in barefoot and shod runners in developed countries are non-existent , presumably because barefoot runners are a rarity .
However , there have been several studies implicating footwear in the etiology of injuries in runners .
I have grouped these as studies of acute injuries ( resulting from an accident during running ) and chronic injuries ( resulting from continual exposure to running ) .
Acute Injuries
Ankle sprains are the most frequently reported acute sports injury , and 90 - 95 % of these are inversion injuries causing partial or complete rupture of the anterior talofibular ligament and occasionally of the calcaneofibular ligament ( Robbins et al. , 1995 ; Stacoff et al. , 1996 ) .
It is claimed that footwear increases the risk of such sprains , either by decreasing awareness of foot position provided by feedback from plantar cutaneous mechanoreceptors in direct contact with the ground ( Robbins et al. , 1995 ) , or by increasing the leverage arm and consequently the twisting torque around the sub - talar joint during a stumble ( Stacoff et al. , 1996 ) .
Siff and Verkhoshansky ( 1999 , p.452 ) reported that running shoes always reduce proprioceptive and tactile sensitivity , and that using bare feet on the high - density chip - foam mats in gyms preserves proprioceptive sensitivity .
Robbins et al. ( 1989 ) considered that behaviors induced by plantar tactile sensations offer improved balance during movement , which may explain the preference of many gymnasts and dancers for performing barefoot .
The skin on the plantar surface ( sole ) of the foot is more resistant to the inflammatory effects of abrasion than skin on other parts of the body ( Robbins et al. , 1993 ) , but stones , glass , nails or needles can still cause bruising or puncture wounds even when the plantar skin is thickened by adaptation to barefoot running .
Extremes in temperature can also cause discomfort , blistering or chill blains .
Running shoes therefore will play an important role in protection on some courses and in some weather conditions .
Chronic Injuries
One of the most common chronic injuries in runners is planter fasciitis , or an inflammation of the ligament running along the sole of the foot .
There is some evidence that the normally unyielding plantar fascia acts as the support for the medial longitudinal arch , and that strain on the proximal fascial attachment during foot strike leads to plantar fasciitis ( Robbins and Hanna , 1987 ) .
Barefoot running may induce an adaptation that transfers the impact to the yielding musculature , thus sparing the fascia and accounting for the low incidence of plantar fasciitis in barefoot populations ( Robbins and Hanna , 1987 ) .
Chronic ailments such as shin splints , ilio-tibial band syndrome and peri-patellar pain are attributed variously to excessive pronation , supination , and shock loading of the limbs ( Siff and Verkhoshansky , 1999 , p.451 ) .
When running barefoot on hard surfaces , the runner compensates for the lack of cushioning underfoot by plantar - flexing the foot at contact , thus giving a softer landing ( Frederick , 1986 ) .
Barefoot runners also land mid-foot , increasing the work of the foot 's soft tissue support structures , thereby increasing their strength and possibly reducing the risk of injury ( Yessis 2000 , p.124 ) .
Wearers of expensive running shoes that were promoted as correcting pronation or providing more cushioning experienced a greater prevalence of these running - related injuries than wearers of less expensive shoes ( Robbins and Gouw , 1991 ) .
In another study , expensive athletic shoes accounted for more than twice as many injuries as cheaper shoes , a fact that prompted Robbins and Waked ( 1997 ) to suggest that deceptive advertising of athletic footwear ( e.g. , " cushioning impact " ) may represent a public health hazard .
Anthony ( 1987 ) reported that running shoes should be considered protective devices ( from dangerous or painful objects ) rather than corrective devices , as their capacity for shock absorption and control of over - pronation is limited .
The modern running shoe and footwear generally reduce sensory feedback , apparently without diminishing injury - inducing impact–a process Robbins and Gouw ( 1991 ) described as the " perceptual illusion " of athletic footwear .
A resulting false sense of security may contribute to the risk of injury ( Robbins and Gouw , 1991 ) .
Yessis ( 2000 , p.122 ) reasoned that once the natural foot structures are weakened by long - term footwear use , people have to rely on the external support of the footwear , but the support does not match that provided by a well functioning foot .
Runners with diminished or absent sensation in the soles of the feet are particularly vulnerable to damage or infection when barefoot .
Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus and may result in the loss of protective sensations in the feet .
Barefoot locomotion is therefore not recommended in this population ( Hafner and Burg , 1999 ) .
Indeed , proper footwear is essential and should be emphasized for individuals with peripheral neuropathy ( ACSM / ADA , 1999 ; ACSM , 2000 ) .
Economy Wearing shoes increases the energy cost of running .
Burkett et al. ( 1985 ) found that oxygen consumption during running increased as the amount of mass they added to the foot increased ; shoes and orthotics representing 1 % of body mass increased oxygen consumption by 3.1 % .
Flaherty ( 1994 ) found that oxygen consumption during running at 12 km/h was 4.7 % higher in shoes of mass ~ 700 g per pair than in bare feet .
An increase in oxygen consumption of ~ 4 % is of little importance to the recreational runner , but the competitive athlete would notice a major effect on running speed .
The increase in oxygen consumption with running shoes could have several causes .
An obvious possibility is the energy cost of continually accelerating and decelerating the mass of the shoe with each stride .
Another possibility is the external work done in compressing and flexing the sole and in rotating the sole against the ground -- up to 13 % of the work done in walking , according to Webb et al. ( 1988 ) .
Frederick ( 1986 ) reported that oxygen consumption increased substantially with thicker shoe inserts during treadmill running .
Not surprisingly , materials used for cushioning in shoes absorb energy , and stiff midsoles should produce a 2 % saving of energy compared with standard midsoles ( Stefanyshyn and Nigg , 2000 ) .
Finally , shoes probably compromise the ability of the lower limb to act like a spring .
With bare feet , the limb returns ~ 70 % of the energy stored in it , but with running shoes the return is considerably less ( Yessis , 2000 , p.123 ) .
Adapting to Barefoot Running
Thirty minutes of daily barefoot locomotion is a recommended starting point to allow thickening of the sole of the foot and adaptation of muscles and ligaments ( Robbins et al. , 1993 ) .
Begin by walking barefoot at every reasonable opportunity then progress to jogging , gradually increasing the intensity and duration ( Yessis 2000 , p.124 ) .
After 3 - 4 weeks , the plantar skin eventually becomes robust and allows longer periods of barefoot running at higher average velocities ( Robbins et al. , 1993 ) .
To facilitate adaptation , perform progressive strengthening exercises for the foot and ankle , including foot inversion , toe flexion , and walking on the balls of the feet .
Barefoot locomotion on uneven surfaces will also help stimulate the plantar surface and provide increased sensory feedback ( Yessis 2000 , p.125 ) .
Conclusions •
Running in shoes appears to increase the risk of ankle sprains , either by decreasing awareness of foot position or by increasing the twisting torque on the ankle during a stumble .
•
Running in shoes appears to increase the risk of plantar fasciitis and other chronic injuries of the lower limb by modifying the transfer of shock to muscles and supporting structures .
•
Running in bare feet reduces oxygen consumption by a few percent .
Competitive running performance should therefore improve by a similar amount , but there has been no published research comparing the effect of barefoot and shod running on simulated or real competitive running performance .
•
Research is needed to establish why runners choose not to run barefoot .
Concern about puncture wounds , bruising , thermal injury , and overuse injury during the adaptation period are possibilities .
•
Running shoes play an important protective role on some courses , in extreme weather conditions , and with certain pathologies of the lower limb .

The right - wing demonstrators have gathered here on the fringe of a long - lost empire , near the border with Slovakia , the banks of the Danube , along rusting train tracks that stretch northwest to Vienna .
They wear wraparound sunglasses , leather vests and combat boots ; and they knot around their necks the red and white striped flags reminiscent of Hungary ’s pro-Nazi party of the 1930s and ‘ 40s .
“ Take your guns in your hands , ” rasps a singer .
“ This is the last fight we ’re going to win .
Endurance . ”
And then : “ I may have big boots .
You may throw a stone at me .
But this is still my country , this is where my cradle lay . ”
Advertisement
The crowd has gathered in the September sunshine for the main attraction , Gabor Vona , a charismatic young nationalist who heads Hungary ’s newest , fastest growing and most controversial political party -- and founded its affiliated militia .
Vona steps out of a minivan , a slight young man with a few shoots of gray in a crop of dark hair .
A passing driver leans furiously on his car horn , and the young woman in the passenger seat shows Vona her middle finger as they careen past .
Vona blinks and turns away with indifference .
He ’s ready to face his fans .
“ You should know that Hungarian policy may change in the very near future , ” he tells them .
“ Everyone knows that for the past 20 years we kept silent and bowed down , but this will change . ”
Vona is riding high these days .
His radically nationalistic party , Jobbik , picked up nearly 15 % of the Hungarian vote in June elections for the European Union parliament .
The Hungarian Guard , the paramilitary organization founded by Vona and his party and distinguished by its Nazi - like iconography and menacing marches through Roma , or Gypsy , areas , is locked in conflict with police and courts .
Advertisement
But if anything , the Hungarian Guard ’s clashes with authorities appear to be feeding Jobbik ’s popularity among a disgruntled populace .
Jobbik is quickly gathering strength by galvanizing all manner of conservative Hungarians , especially the young and rural .
Analysts say its popularity hinges on its antagonism toward the Roma minority , and party leaders ’ incessant talk of “ Gypsy crime . ”
The party ’s rhetoric paints a picture of an isolated Hungarian people and a neutered , ineffective police force at the mercy of robbing , violent Roma .
The rise to prominence of Jobbik and its Hungarian Guard has come in tandem with a spate of ruthless attacks on Roma , including children .
Analysts say this is no coincidence .
They also blame Jobbik for spreading thinly coded anti-Semitism and unsubtle hearkening back to Hungary ’s Nazi past .
Originating as a small student movement in 2002 , Jobbik has moved quickly from the extremist fringes into the mainstream -- or perhaps has managed to drag some of mainstream Hungary to the fringes .
As the party continued to grow , Vona founded the Hungarian Guard in 2007 .
Advertisement
Jobbik is poised to take on even greater power in next year ’s national parliamentary elections .
Analysts attribute its popularity to a mix of factors : rising economic difficulties , growing distaste for the political elite of both the left and right and a widespread sense that the government has failed to deal effectively with crime and ethnic tensions .
“ Jobbik intends to change the shy , cowardly Hungarian policy , ” Vona says , finishing with a salute : “ God give us . . . ”
” . . . a brighter future ! ” the crowd roars in reply .
This too has the ring of a resurrected Nazi call and response .
Advertisement
For all the retro symbolism , Jobbik is a distinctly modern organization .
There are websites , YouTube videos and a vast array of nationalistic merchandise , such as T - shirts depicting clawed hands grabbing at chunks of formerly Hungarian land in a nod to the territory lost at the end of World War I .
“ Now in Budapest , you see these young people wearing the Hungarian Guard logo and the Jobbik scarf , ” said Peter Kreko , an analyst with the Budapest - based Political Capital think tank .
“ The main threat is that , even those who do n’t agree with their ideology , they catch them also by creating this fashion trend . ”
Zoltan Kiszelly , another political scientist in Budapest , agreed .
“ Ten years ago teenagers had Che Guevara on their shirts , ” he said .
“ Now they have Greater Hungary . ”
Advertisement
Young people are particularly attracted to nationalism , he said , because their expectations are clashing painfully with the reality of a country hammered by financial crisis .
“ It ’s a generation of disappointed people , ” Kiszelly said .
“ Everybody attended university and now they ’re starting life , and they say , ‘ I have no connections .
I have no chance to enter the system .
So I have to blow up the system . ’ ”
Riding a wave of popular discontent , Vona and the other party leaders tell people they are poised between two looming menaces : Gypsies from within , and globalization from the wider world .
They keenly sense the shifting demographics as Roma become a larger minority within Hungary .
In convincing Hungarians that they are at war to protect their way of life , no tactic has been more successful than the deployment of the Hungarian Guard .
Police are too overwhelmed to deal with crime in rural areas , analysts say .
Into the vacuum surged the Hungarian Guard , announcing that they would protect their countrymen against the criminal Roma .
Advertisement
Ask the people who turned out to hear Vona speak and you ’ll be told that the guard is delivering a crucial warning to the Roma .
“ If you behave properly , Gypsies will understand not to bother you , ” said Andras Lipovics , a young Jobbik supporter with combat boots , head shaved and arms swathed in tattoos .
“ It was there , it was building , and now the levees have broken , ” said Gergely Romsics of the Hungarian Institute of International Affairs .
“ I ’m not saying they ’re Nazis , but they ’re using the same strategy as the Nazis : creating a parallel paramilitary which is more efficient than the government itself . ”
Paused on the roadside after the demonstration , Vona gripes that Hungarians are “ second - or third - class citizens ” in their own country .
Advertisement
“ If a Gypsy is killed , then the whole government is represented at the funeral , ” he says .
“ But if a Hungarian is killed by a Gypsy , there is deep silence .
“ We ’re gaining popularity because we have unity between our words and our actions . ”
Budapest ’s appeals court this summer upheld the banning of the Hungarian Guard on grounds that it created a climate of discrimination and fear .
But both the party and its paramilitary refused to bow to the court ’s ruling , and have continued to hold public gatherings .
Advertisement
Vona scoffs that his party was “ preparing to govern , ” and boasts that lawmakers from the party would go to parliament dressed in Hungarian Guard uniforms .
Gaining status as an outlaw organization may be working in favor of Jobbik .
Opinion polls track a growth in the party ’s popularity since the Hungarian Guard demonstrations were dispersed by police , Kreko said .
“ It ’s a warning that , unfortunately , public opinion has moved toward a more radical position , ” he said .
“ It shows people tolerate clashes with police by this so - called party of order . ”

NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Boney D and Rabbit come from rough parts of Brooklyn , places that could be unfavorably compared to the Wild West .
You would n't expect that they 'd escape their environments at a rugged 25 - acre ranch in nearby Queens , riding horses and hanging out with cowboys .
" I 've seen a guy get shot dead , point [ blank ] range , right in front of me -- dropped him , boom , " D'vonte " Boney D " Jemmott , 15 , said of the neighborhood where he grew up .
" I 've seen dudes get beat up , chased home , all sorts of things .
I 've seen all sorts of different drugs being ran around .
" If I was n't down here , " he said , " I 'd probably be involved with things like that -- robbing people , probably hurting people -- because I 've seen a lot of that stuff done around my way . "
Jemmott 's mother has been taking him to Cedar Lane Stables since he was a toddler .
The Federation of Black Cowboys , founded in 1994 , has called Cedar Lane home since 1998 .
A white post - and - rail fence separates the property and its three dozen horses from the 18 - wheelers , dump trucks and commuter traffic at the intersection of Linden Boulevard and Conduit Avenue .
A red , wooden sign at the stable 's entrance advertises " reins & things " at Debbie 's Western Boutique .
Mallards and chubby white geese populate a murky creek on the north side of the property , and a wide wooden bridge takes you to the riding ring and stables , many of which have been converted from metal shipping containers .
" [ The kids ] love it , Texas in Queens .
This is like an oasis in the middle of the city , " said cowgirl Heather Bradley , whom the children call " Ma . "
Paris " Rabbit " Parrish , 20 , has ridden with the black cowboys since he was 8 years old .
He remembers when he and his mother were driving on Linden Boulevard and first saw Jessie Lee " Captain " Wise , one of the federation 's 11 founders , riding his horse .
" I was like , ' Mama , mama , look , it 's a cowboy ! '
And I 've always wanted to be a cowboy .
I watched Westerns .
So we pull over , and we talked to him , and he told me to come on down to the stable , " Parrish said as he rode a thick black mare , Beauty , across the backside of the property .
" Ever since I was at the stable , it 's been like I was at home , paradise . "
Like Jemmott , Parrish said his neighborhood is rife with gangs and narcotics -- he 's witnessed drug transactions in front of the school near his house -- and he 's confident he would n't be entering college soon without the guidance of the local cowpokes .
" I think I 'd be probably in jail or with a gang somewhere because it was hard for me to stay out of trouble , " he said .
Keeping youngsters away from gangs , guns and drugs is a top federation priority , said President Stencil " Doctor D " Stokes , a foreboding man who can crack a bullwhip with such prowess , it sounds like a shot from a small - caliber pistol .
Stokes would never use the whip on anyone , he assured , but it helps get the kids ' attention .
" They see the Bloods .
They see the Crips .
All they see is violence , " the school bus driver said , bullwhip in hand and Stetson tilted back .
" They can come here at night without worrying about getting shot . "
Though the federation has mentored a child who went on to become a veterinarian and another who is a New York mounted police officer , Stokes said he does n't have unrealistic expectations of the children , because the primary goal is to keep them safe .
" Everybody can not be an A student .
We understand that , but if you 're a C student , be a damned good C student , " he said .
Education is a staple at the stables , according to Warren " Black Red " Small , who said that taking care of a horse is a lot like taking care of yourself .
Youngsters are n't allowed to ride until they first learn how to groom the animals , clean their hooves , saddle and bridle them and , yes , muck their stalls .
A retired peace officer for the state court system , Small said the federation also teaches children about " the forgotten black West " because it 's important that kids know the role African - Americans played in taming the Wild West .
Buckaroos such as Gene Autry , Roy Rogers and Hopalong Cassidy too often dominate popular cowboy lore , Stokes added , explaining , " I 'm not a racist man , but they was n't the first . "
The federation teaches youngsters about Bill Pickett , who invented steer wrestling , and the pugnacious " Stagecoach " Mary Fields , whose nickname was derived from her reliability in delivering mail across an ornery Montana frontier .
The stories help kids ascertain their own identities , Small said .
" History , for all people , is a necessary part of their evolution and their growing process , " he said .
Also necessary , said the group 's first female inductee , Kesha " Babygirl " Morse , is " working with kids to find a balance for them between the macho man stuff and being a gentleman . "
Thousands of kids have come through the stables via various school programs and community functions since 1998 , Small said .
About 25 to 30 of those , such as Jemmott and Parrish , have moseyed back for mentoring .
Like any nonprofit , the federation survives off donations .
Major corporations have donated to the cause , and co-founder Jessie Lee Wise has tapped his own excavating business to help with upkeep and construction at the stables .
But times are hard , said Eric " Little Red " Jackson , and the cowboys could sorely use a sponsor to continue their work .
Several stables are in disrepair , and the federation 's future museum is presently a dilapidated trailer containing photos , animal hides and a hodgepodge of memorabilia and artifacts .
Jemmott said he knows plenty of kids his age who also could use some work , peers wrapped up in drugs and violence who " have nothing going for them now . "
" I 'm glad I did n't get involved in any of that activity , " he said .
" Couple more years , if they 're not incarcerated , they 're going to be in the dirt .
I want to prosper in life .
I just do n't want to be a statistic or a product of my environment . "
AT&T 's government lobbying has a long and fairly sordid history .
Before taking you inside our investigation of AT&T 's recent anti-net neutrality lobbying ( and the charges of " astroturfing " being thrown around ) , let 's take a stroll down memory lane .
It was 1976 , and a House subcommittee was considering a bill called the Consumer Communications Reform Act .
The proposed law , heavily backed by AT&T , would have made the then monopoly even more of one by effectively declaring its long distance system America 's " official " service .
The bill clearly targeted a competitor : MCI 's new microwave tower network , just being rolled out across the country .
For days , Capitol Hill had been deluged by workers , priests , police chiefs , mayors , and anybody else Ma Bell could round up to support the legislation .
Then Representative Tim Wirth of Colorado walked into the hearing room .
He saw that it was packed with people .
Wirth asked the first panelist , an AT&T executive , to identify his colleagues .
Five minutes later the man was still reading out names .
" Will everyone associated with AT&T just stand up ? " an exasperated Wirth finally asked .
The entire room rose .
Everyone started laughing .
As it was then , so it is now .
It should be no surprise to anyone that , as the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) proposes new net neutrality rules , AT&T Senior Vice President Jim Cicconi has sent out a e-mail to the company 's entire managerial staff urging them to deluge the FCC 's new discussion site with anti-net neutrality comments .
The memo includes recommended talking points :
" The ' net neutrality ' rules as reported will jeopardize the very goals supported by the Obama administration that every American have access to high - speed Internet services no matter where they live or their economic circumstance , " Cicconi warns .
" That goal can't be met with rules that halt private investment in broadband infrastructure .
And the jobs associated with that investment will be lost at a time when the country can least afford it . "
Fair enough ; AT&T does n't like the idea of network neutrality rules .
But the company has long been accused of going well beyond such overt lobbying .
It 's also said to be a master at creating fake grassroots enthusiasm — so - called " astroturf " campaigns — often using small minority and civil rights groups as pawns in its government affairs chess game .
Those charges are now being made once again , and Ars investigated the issue .
Avoiding tentative conclusions
Jobs , jobs , jobs .
That was the line in 1976 , and that 's the line being toed by everybody from state Attorneys General to town council selectmen .
If there 's one thing that both the pre- and post - breakup AT&T is good at , it 's corralling huge numbers of people — workers , politicians , non-profits , ministers , whoever — into carrying the telco's water on the latest hot topic , and the telco is n't adverse to spreading lots of scratch around in return .
Take those 72 Democratic representatives who wrote to the FCC last week urging the FCC " to avoid tentative conclusions " on net neutrality " which favor government regulation . "
A Washington Post analysis says that all but two of them took a combined $ 180,000 in AT&T campaign contribution money , plus plenty more from Comcast and Verizon .
And that 's just the beginning of the money trail .
To appreciate the vast influence that AT&T , Comcast , and Verizon enjoy , check out the AT&T Foundation 's 2007 tax returns as an example : it has pages and pages of non-profits , charities , support groups , and community centers that receive hundreds of thousands of dollars in telco largesse .
Thumbing through the return , it 's easy to come to simple , " follow - the - money " conclusions about some of the filings which the FCC is now receiving .
Take the go - slow on net neutrality commentary filed in late September by the Hispanic Technology and Telecommunications Partnership ( HTTP ) and 19 other civil rights groups .
Their statement warns that net neutrality policies could inhibit investment and " leave disenfranchised communities further behind . "
The coalition describes themselves as having a common purpose , serving communities " that are among the most severely impacted by a lack of access to technology . "
And indeed the list includes signers from venerable organizations like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) and the League of United Latin American Citizens ( LULAC ) .
But the groups signing the letter have something else in common : financial support from AT&T ( and sometimes Verizon and Comcast ) .
These advocates do n't hide this .
For example , the website of one of the signers , the Japanese American Citizens League , says " Website made possible by the generous sponsorship of AT&T . "
100 Black Men lists AT&T as a " partner " and " sponsor " of the group .
AT&T Foundation 's 2007 tax returns show that 100 Black Men received $ 100,000 that year and $ 75,000 in 2006 .
Similarly , the NAACP , which also signed the statement , lists AT&T and Verizon on its Centennial Event sponsors page .
LULAC 's website indicates that it received a $ 1.5 million Technology Access Grant from AT&T .
Comcast Foundation 's records indicate that it gave the LULAC Institute $ 60,000 in 2007 .
And in 2006 the AT&T Foundation gave LULAC numerous grants to support computer education centers across the United States .
And some of these groups have even more direct ties to the telcos .
The Asian American Justice Center 's Advisory Council includes Anne H. Chow , listed as " AT&T Chair " on the group 's website .
In 2006 , AT&T identified her as a senior vice president for the company .
Her AAJC bio says that Chow " played a key role in the AT&T / SBC merger with overall responsibility for the Sales and Marketing integration planning effort . "
Wrong side of the divide
But when we spoke with HTTP 's Sylvia Aguilera , it was obvious that there was more than money doing the talking here .
We asked her straight out if AT&T or one of the other big ISPs put her group up to writing the letter .
No , she replied , it was she who had initiated the action .
HTTP 's worries about net neutrality stem from concerns that the policy could slow down investment in ISP rollout , she explained , an area where many Latinos are finding jobs .
We also asked AT&T whether they had a hand in the statement , but received no reply .
Ironically , while pro-neutrality activists see astroturf in all this , Aguilera sees something similar in the net neutrality movement .
An HTTP analysis calls it " dominated by mainstream consumer advocates and the technology and telecommunications policy elite , groups that are least familiar and least equipped to discuss the perspectives of communities on the wrong side of the digital divide . "
We asked Aguilera which groups she was talking about .
She would n't say .
But before you jump on that comment , consider the subject from the viewpoint of a blue - collar Latino , black , or white worker .
Where would you have the best chance at finding employment -- getting a staff position at everybody 's favorite pro-neutrality company , Google , or supporting last mile lines for AT&T ?
This kind of perception gap is not unique to net neutrality , either .
In 2004 , the Center for Public Integrity issued a report contending that many of the civil rights and women 's advocacy groups who signed statements against " a la carte " cable programming , then supported by then FCC Chair Kevin Martin , received donations from the cable industry .
( A la carte is the notion that consumers should be able to buy cable channels on an individual basis . )
The mentioned groups were quite upset with the report ( especially when Martin cited it at an Aspen Institute Forum ) because regardless of who they took money from , they sincerely thought that a la carte would make it harder for minority programmers to generate advertising revenue on cable platforms ( few people would subscribe to tiny , minority - oriented channels , but they might watch occasional shows if the network was included in a broader cable package ) .
Similarly , the HTTP coalition takes exception to suggestions that its perspectives are telco - driven , even if some of its members do take telco money .
A recent commentary by Art Brodsky of Public Knowldge did n't mention the HTTP group , but it did note that on the net neutrality question , many minority advocates , " for whatever reason — whether they believe what the Big Telecom companies tell them or not , " appear to " land on policies that hurt their constituencies . "
Brodsky 's statement also wondered whether an upcoming anti-net neutrality ad signed by some of these groups is being directed towards Mignon Clyburn , the FCC 's newest Democrat and an African - American woman .
Aguilera quickly published an indignant response to this post , denying the Clyburn suggestion .
" We take genuine exception to the manner in which the author dismisses minorities ' opinions as naively misinformed , " she declared , the statement co-signed by NAACP Vice President Hilary O. Shelton .
And so net neutrality activists face a big challenge : convincing a wider range of stakeholders that uncertain new reforms will not jeopardize their stake in the present system .
It is in those anxieties that AT&T and company find allies .
Do you have an estimate ?
Still , while money does n't explain everything , it does n't explain nothing , either .
For instance , media reform group Free Press pointed out to us the curious case of the Arkansas Retired Seniors Coalition .
The group filed a letter ( PDF ) with the FCC that opposed network neutrality ... but forgot to strip out the " XYZ organization " and replace the text with its own name .
( Cue ageist " senior moment " joke here . )
We 've highlighted the odd text below :
The group appears to have left no discernible traces on the Internet , and no website could be found .
Yet it cares enough about network neutrality to send a letter to DC that just happens to look like a template ?
It 's unclear who was behind the letter , but it certainly looks like evidence of anti-neutrality forces rounding up an odd collection of allies on this issue .
So can net neutrality boosters overcome AT&T 's counter - offensive ?
Absolutely ... and in some of the same ways .
Forty local grassroots groups just submitted a letter to the FCC supporting the agency 's net neutrality proposals .
The signers include the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights in Oakland , California , and La Asamblea de Derechos Civiles ( Assembly of Civil Rights ) of Minneapolis , Minnesota .
The incumbent ISPs have deep pockets and decades of experience at this sort of fight , but there 's always a possibility that lobbying too aggressively will backfire .
That 's what happened in 1976 .
In his wonderful history of the breakup of AT&T , The Deal of the Century , Steve Coll describes the moment when the Consumer Communications Reform
Act fell flat on its face .
None other than the Chair of AT&T , legendary executive John deButts , was testifying on its behalf at a hearing .
Then Congressman Wirth interrupted his speech .
" Do you have an estimate , " Wirth angrily asked , " of what your lobbying activities for 1976 on this bill have cost ? "
About $ 600,000 , deButts claimed .
" Have you gotten the kind of support and sponsorship you would like ? " the Congressman continued .
" Frankly , can you tell me how many people AT&T has working full time on this legislation ? "
" I have no idea , sir , but it is very few , very few , " deButts baldly replied .
The hearing audience again howled with laughter , but this time against AT&T , not with it .
deButts ' answer killed the bill .
" By swinging too hard , " Coll observed , " the AT&T chairman had missed everything and had hurled himself out of the ring . "
It 's a mistake that AT&T might well make again as the FCC , backed by a solid pro-net neutrality majority , solicits comments from the public on its Internet non-discrimination proposals .
BUENOS AIRES --
When celebrity psychoanalyst Gabriel Rolón picked up the phone , the man on the line said he was holding a loaded gun and was ready to blow his brains out .
Mr. Rolón was recently recounting the incident , which took place several years ago , to a rapt audience of his fans here in Argentina , the nation with more psychologists per capita than any other .
Mr. Rolón said he told the caller to come right by his office -- but added , " Please do n't bring the revolver . "
When the caller laughed , Mr. Rolón says , he thought ...
Whether the nation faces a doctor shortage is a matter of debate .
But a new study suggests there are already fewer doctors practicing than had been estimated , because of a lag in reporting retirements .
The new study , published in the Oct. 21 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association , estimates that the United States has 788,000 active doctors  65,000 fewer than calculations have suggested .
The doctor work force is also younger than previously estimated , with a greater proportion of doctors in their 20s and 30s and fewer who are 65 and older .
By 2020 , there will be 957,000 physicians , the new estimates show , rather than the 1.05 million previously projected .
Only 9 percent will be 65 or older , or half as many as had been predicted .
The new analysis used census data to make projections .
“ From 2005 to 2020 , we project a 20 to 22 percent growth in the number of physicians , ” said the paper ’s lead author , Douglas O. Staiger , a Dartmouth economist .
“ But because you start with a lower number , you end up with a lower number in the future  with 9 percent fewer physicians by 2020 . ”
Listening to the media heavy breathers — a bipartisan group ranging from Gore Vidal to Glenn Beck — one gets the distinct impression that our democracy has become flabby and distracted , trundling toward a socialist ( to be used interchangeably with communist or Tsarist ) or fascist ( to be used interchangeably with Nazi ) future .
For every absurdity emanating from the Bush White House , there existed a blogger , pundit , or politician ready to compare it to the " Night of the Long Knives " ; every power grab from the Obamaites foreshadows an American Lubyanka .
In the United States , such nonsense could be corrected without the aid of turgid academic books explaining late 19th century revolutionary movements in Imperial Russia or the collapse of Weimar democracy .
The comparisons would be embarrassing to anyone who has watched films such as The Lives of Others , Katyn , or The Soviet Story .
( Hollywood , incidentally , has yet to produce more than a handful decent anti-communist films ; we have ceded this responsibility to those who actually suffered under the Soviet boot heel . )
I often wonder what the Germans think of these media - induced Nazi - Red panics .
It is , after all , the country that perfected the most genocidal form of fascism , only to be replaced , in half of the country , with the brutal Moscow - directed ( but distinctly indigenous ) form of East German communism .
In a country that can be accused of periodically backsliding into old ideological habits ( specifically , a rose - colored view of its recent communist past ) , the hyperventilating politician warning of resurgent fascism or communism is rare .
In last week 's Bundestag elections , the Left Party , heir to the East German state communist party and still stocked with representatives of the old dictatorship , managed an impressive 12 percent of the vote .
Distressing , say pundits inhabiting the sensible enclaves of the German left , but nothing to get too alarmed about .
Indeed , despite the current global economic downturn , which countless American pundits suggested would be a boon for European socialist parties , it is now a coalition of Angela Merkel 's right - of - center Christian Democrats ( CDU ) and Guido Westerwelle 's libertarian - leaning Free Democrats ( FDP ) running the show in Berlin .
The Social Democrats — utterly bereft of new ideas — suffered their greatest defeat since the Weimar Republic .
Our comrades on the American left , beating the drum for a type of social democracy in retreat across Europe , insist that this is nothing to worry about .
At the popular left - wing blog Obsidian Wings , readers are informed that " Merkel 's coalition would be considered fairly liberal Democrats on America 's political spectrum . "
Blogger Matt Yglesias declares that his are " right - of - center views relative to German politics , " but also writes that by voting for the FDP / CDU coalition , voters in Germany could be diagnosed as suffering from false consciousness by " underestimating the extent of the economic problems it 's facing . "
In The New Yorker , Hendrik Hertzberg explained that German conservatives were n't at all like the troglodyte American variety — German conservatives all support the welfare state and are rather civilized when it comes to social policy .
Well , not exactly .
On the continuum of ideology , the German right is surely less conservative than the American right .
But the Western European right has successfully chipped away at the welfare state in the last 25 years , with every country lowering tax rates , deregulating labor markets , and forcing the privatization of state companies .
The story of the welfare state in the past quarter century is one of contraction , not expansion .
So what to make of Westerwelle , Germany 's new foreign minister and influential coalition partner ?
The Daily Telegraph called him an " arch - Thatcherite , " a politician who recently declared that the deeply entrenched German labor unions are a " plague on our country . "
The Independent grumbled that he was " a man obsesssed with tax cuts , " excoriating the German welfare safety net as " pay for laziness . "
Westerwelle told supporters that " there is no such thing as democratic socialism ; it 's like talking about a vegetarian abattoir . "
Der Spiegel succinctly described the FDP 's politics as advocating " open markets , less stringent hiring and firing rules , an effective competition policy , help for small enterprises and , most importantly , lower and simpler taxes . "
But American liberals want you to know that , because Westerwelle is openly gay and the CDU ( but not its Bavarian partner , the CSU ) have gradually toned down the social conservatism , victories for the European right are much the same as victories for mainstream American liberalism .
Yet this is a narrow definition of what it means to be " of the right " in Western Europe .
Of course , most of the right - wing parties in Germany accept the existence of the welfare state — it is popular ; once people start receiving benefits , like long state - mandated vacations , it is difficult to take them away — though most privately wish for even greater cuts .
( There is a reason that one always finds young members of Swedish , English , Norwegian , and German right - wing parties in Washington , DC , attending training seminars put on by conservative groups like the Leadership Institute . )
Nor would I expect Yglesias , Hertzberg , and other American liberals to deem Irving Kristol , the godfather of neoconservatism , a fellow traveler for his embrace of the so - called conservative welfare state .
And what about Germany 's far right parties ?
Do American liberals accpet them as fundamentally liberal " in an American context " ?
Set aside the semi-literate grumblings about the mongrelization of the fatherland ; parties of the extreme right in Europe are almost uniformly in love with the welfare state , dubious of free markets , and fanatically opposed to American foreign policy .
Indeed , a look through the suggested reading page on the website of Junge Freiheit , a far - right newspaper popular with the NPD crowd , one will find books by Noam Chomsky , Arundhati Roy , and Chalmers Johnson .
But there is much more to Germany 's rightward swing than economics .
In a paper reprinted in Der Spiegel , American liberal academics Matt Browne , Ruy Teixiera , and John Halpin offered a bland diagnosis of what ails European social democracy and provided this bafflingly vague remedy : " If social democratic parties are to recover , then they must move to a new phase of progressive governance . "
Curiously missing from their account of the SPD collapse — and missing from most liberal analyses — is any mention of immigration , a subject constantly raised in private conversation but approached with extreme caution by mainstream parties .
( On a trip to Europe last month , I witnessed countless discussions about immigration policy and heard frequent mentions of Christopher Caldwell 's controversial new book on Muslim immigration . )
Social democratic parties in Western Europe are widely seen as unserious on immigration , offering platitudes about the benefits of multicultural society instead of addressing the growing problems of the urban immigrant underclass .
A 2006 poll in Germany found that a staggering 60 percent of respondents thought Islam was " incompatible with Western democracy . "
Or consider the case of Wolfgang Clement , a Social Democrat who served as former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder 's economy minister .
In an advertisement in the right - leaning tabloid Bild , Clement announced that he was voting for Westerwelle 's Free Democrats — a rejection of the economic populism of the German left .
It is doubtless a concern of moderate German voters that the SPD will , in the interest of survival , drop their long - standing resistance to working with the extremists in the post - communist Left Party .
Now that she has been liberated from her " grand coalition " with the opposition socialists , Merkel , and her new ally Westerwelle , have a chance to rein in powerful labor unions , slash punitive taxes on both individuals and businesses , and deregulate an overregulated labor market .
If American fans of European social democracy believe this is in line with their own agenda , we should welcome them to the libertarian side .

Jewish World Review Nov. 3 , 2009 / 16 Mar - Cheshvan 5770 A Society that Venerates Lawyers More than Doctors By Dennis Prager
http://www.JewishWorldReview.com |
Those of us who are not true believers in expanded government are certain of the following :
If the 1,990 - page House Health Care Bill becomes law , the average American will receive worse health care , American physicians will decline in status and income , American medical innovation will dramatically slow down and pharmaceutical discoveries will decline in number and quality .
And , of course , the economy of the United States will deteriorate , perhaps permanently .
However , we are also certain that there is one American group that will thrive — trial lawyers .
The very existence of a 1,990 - page law guarantees years of , if not more or less permanent , lawsuits .
And the law actually specifies that states that do not limit attorneys ' fees in cases of medical malpractice shall be financially rewarded .
What we are seeing here , therefore , is something unprecedented in our history :
Many trial lawyers will earn as much as most physicians , and fewer and fewer physicians will earn as much as successful trial lawyers .
Nothing better illustrates the reorientation — indeed , the transformation — of values that will take place if the Democrats ' health care legislation is passed .
Thanks to trial lawyer / Democratic influence , for decades , we have been moving in the direction of litigation - based society .
But with a Democratic health care bill , the movement will accelerate exponentially .
Much of our money , our innovation , our creativity and our ingenuity will gravitate from medicine to law .
Young people who wish to make a good living — and even talk themselves into believing that they are also doing good for society — will opt for trial law over medicine .
As far back as memory goes for living Americans , a young person who wished to do well , as well as do good in life , would likely choose medicine as a profession if he were bright enough and willing to put in the great number of hours necessary .
In the last generation , many of the brightest chose finance — as it turned out , another often unproductive and often destructive arena — to make a lot of money while believing that they , too , were doing a lot of good for society .
With the financial professions in trouble and in some disrepute , and medicine being financially and socially devalued — doctors are increasingly called " health care providers " ( along with nurses , physician 's assistants , lab technicians , etc. ; they 're all the same ) — law , especially trial law , will be seen as offering the most opportunities for making a great deal of money .
No rational person argues that society does n't need law or lawyers , or that all lawyers , even trial lawyers , do no good .
That is certainly not what is being argued here .
But it does say something about a society when those who sue physicians and hospitals make as much or more money than those who heal disease .
It says something about a society when it glorifies and rewards those who litigate while it demonizes and punishes those who produce the drugs and devices that keep its citizens alive and well .
This is part of the upside - down world the left is bequeathing to us and our children in the name of health care " reform . "

The Democratic spin is that the Republicans have moved much too far to the right .
This is true in a sense .
But remember , Democratic smarties said the same thing before Ronald Reagan was elected and before Newt and Republicans won in 1994 .
I agree with some things Paul says , and disagree with others , but the truth of the matter , politically , is that his agenda has moved center stage and his people are highly motivated and this is a serious movement that is underestimated and misunderstood by Washington insiders .
What Democrats need to do is forget the PR and forget the spin and do what they were elected to do in 2006 and 2008 .
They should fight for a progressive populist agenda that takes on the powerful interests that have given us this Gilded Age , interests that a majority of Americans from the political left and independent center are both against .
But for now , for today , my take is forget the smarties and forget the smoothies , because the real winner of the 2009 elections is the gentleman from Texas , Mr. Ron Paul .
Some events attract rafts of conspiracy theories
By Arran Frood
Conspiracy theorists have used the internet to co-ordinate increasingly slick attacks on the accepted versions of events , but now a group of scientists and sceptics has decided it 's time to organise and fight back .
Conspiracy theories are pervasive and popular .
A poll for the Scripps Howard media organisation in 2006 suggested 36 % of Americans suspected government involvement or deliberate inaction in the 9/11 attacks , and belief in a Kennedy conspiracy ran at 40 % in the same poll .
FIVE CONSPIRACY THEORIES World Trade Center : Destroyed by controlled explosions or using thermate Pentagon :
Hit by missile rather than airliner Princess Diana : Murdered rather than being killed by reckless driving on part of Henri Paul Apollo 11 : Moon landings never took place , were staged on Earth JFK : Lee Harvey Oswald not acting alone , part of underworld or wider conspiracy A decade after Princess Diana 's death , one survey found a fifth of Britons believed she was murdered .
And to millions across the world , 2009 's Apollo Moon landing 40th anniversary was a hollow sham because we have never been there .
Conspiracy theories predate the internet but the web has provided a fast , accessible platform for groups to unite , gather research and disseminate information without even meeting or leaving their houses .
While many people find them harmless fun , others believe there is a darker truth - that conspiracy theories are rewriting history , warping the present and altering the future .
Enough is enough they say - it 's time to fight back .
Isolated sceptics
Enter the sceptics with the gathering of The Amazing Meeting ( TAM ) in London , the first of the conferences outside the US .
A fundraising offshoot of the non-profit James Randi Educational Foundation ( JREF ) , TAM London saw scientists , writers and comedians target conspiracy theories - and their close cousins pseudoscience and medical quackery - in front of an audience loosely allied by their desire for more rational , critical thinking .
" A lot of sceptics feel very isolated , " says psychologist and magician Prof Richard Wiseman .
" It 's not a popular position to be saying ' Father Christmas does not exist ' so it motivates people and acts as a springboard for people to see what we 're up to . "
Many conspiracy theorists believed the government was complicit in 9/11
This brand of scepticism is not new .
The movement was first galvanised in the early 80s when spoon - benders like Uri Geller claimed not to be magicians , but to really have paranormal powers .
It was an age that saw a test of Geller 's abilities make its way into the prestigious journal Nature .
The internet era has changed everything .
The web - only film Loose Change , which questions the findings of the 9/11 commission , had already been viewed 10 million times by May 2006 .
It has had a massive impact .
But the sceptics are also using the internet to organise loose networks of informal meetings .
In one theory the Pentagon was hit by a missile not a plane However , using the same medium to fight back is not easy , as British investigative journalist Jon Ronson found when he posted on the British 9/11 Truth Campaign website .
Abused and ridiculed , his integrity was questioned because he is Jewish .
" When I found myself being attacked by 9/11 conspiracy theorists I found the sceptical community very supportive , " says Ronson .
" When believers turn on you it is horrible .
I 've stopped engaging with them because it 's like prodding a snake . "
Ronson has spent a lifetime lifting the lid on the unusual .
He is about to come to greater prominence after being portrayed by Ewan McGregor in the upcoming film , The Men who Stare at Goats , also starring George Clooney .
Ronson 's book of the same name revealed that the US operated a secret army of psychic spies in the 1970s and 80s .
But the sceptics movement is not just about tackling conspiracy theorists who spread their message by independent means on the internet ; there is also a drive to tackle bad reporting of science in the mainstream media .
Direct access Dr Ben Goldacre 's Bad Science website has served as a conduit for those who want to help counter the ceaseless torrent of articles pushed out by snake oil sellers , lazy journalists and badly behaved editors .
He has been the leading critic of the media 's treatment of the MMR scare .
His solution is to bypass conventional routes to the public .
" Mainstream media has repeatedly shown itself to be worse than useless in reporting science and health in many , many fields , " says Goldacre .
" Scientists should communicate directly with the public via blogs . "
These sceptics can garner a good deal of public support .
David Aaronovitch has given popular talks to accompany his anti-conspiracy theory book , Voodoo Histories .
Goldacre speaks at contemporary music festivals .
Glenn
Hill , son of one of the fairy hoaxers , addressed the sceptics And TAM London 's 600 seats - at £ 175 a pop - were snapped up in 52 minutes - despite sceptics ' high priest James Randi not attending due to ill health .
Instead , Randi addressed an enraptured audience via video link like a general before battle , telling delegates that " it was n't easy to get people out of beliefs in the woo - woo world " .
Randi's foundation was established in 1996 to help debunk paranormal and pseudoscientific claims , but his Paranormal Challenge prize dates back to 1964 when the sceptic offered $ 1,000 to anyone who could prove the paranormal was real .
Donations swelled the booty to more than a million dollars , but no applicants have passed the preliminary test .
The energy at events like TAM London is tangible , but are sceptics just preaching to the choir and can their success be measured ?
JREF president Dr Phil Plait cites the myth that an egg laid on the first day of spring will stand on one end .
Plait says that 10 years ago half of his audience had heard of the story - now that figure is less than 10 % , which he says is down to using the web to disseminate articles that prove the claim is nonsense .
" Legends do die , " he says .
Then there is the image or branding problem .
Not all delegates like the term " sceptic " because it has negative , " anti " connotations , similar to the way atheists are defined by something they do n't believe in .
As a result , some delegates prefer to call themselves rationalists , free thinkers or Brights .
" Out there in the audience is the next generation of bloggers and media professionals , " Plait says .
But even if the word is spread , will conspiracy theory believers ever listen ?
Adam Savage , presenter of the television programme Mythbusters , which uses science to challenge urban legends , is not overly optimistic .
He says he does n't know of any conversions following his Emmy - nominated programme that tested Moon hoax theories .
" They want to believe desperately that someone is in charge , " he says .
" Even if it is someone who is working against us . "

I am a confirmed sceptic and a firm believer in Hanlon 's Razor : " Never attribute to malice , that which can be adequately explained by stupidity . "
Nick , Sheffield , UK I really despair at the way everybody has to be lumped into polar opposite pigeon holes .
I firmly believe SOME of the so - called conspiracy theories in your article are true , but it seems if I speak out about them , I 'm also declaring a firm belief in spiritualism and homeopathy ( " conspiracy theories - and their close cousins pseudoscience and medical quackery " ) .
I certainly do n't believe ALL the conspiracy theories on this page .
Why should I then have to be herded into a convenient holding pen with a loose grouping of not only genuine truth - seekers , but also various assorted nutters too ?
If any of the popular " conspiracy theories " do have a basis in fact , those who have something to hide will be delighted at this blanket ridiculing of healthy scepticism .
Nick Hughes , Bushey , UK
So I guess you 're also including the " House Select Committee on Assassinations " who in 1970 concluded that " The committee believes , on the basis of the evidence available to it , that President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy .
The committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy . "
This was a three - year investigation carried out by the US Government .
Those loony conspiracy nuts .
Rob Leather , Manchester , UK Part of the problem - and something that often makes conspiracists impossible to convert - is that whilst science offers a rationalist approach supported by quantification and measurement , many people want to add a sixth sense of intuition .
Like a gambler whose addiction is reinforced by sporadic wins , some addictive conspiracists hang on to all of their beliefs because occasionally one is proved to have some merit .
On top of this we live in a world where " experts " can be seen to get it wrong - experts tell us that people are great artists , when " we the people " think they are talentless self - publicists ; experts tell us " war is justified " when " we the people " have our doubts .
Unfortunately , some people take this a step too far and believe that the same applies to science and rational knowledge , and that like some real - world matrix we are all being deluded and defrauded by a malevolent " Them " .
Power to the Brights , I say , but do n't hold your breath .
Kevin Friery , Portsmouth UK
Some conspiracy theorists are plain nuts , but the ability and right to question what is commonly taught is extremely important .
To assert that all conspiracy theories are bunk is the same as saying " believe what you are told " .
Surely this is dangerous thinking ?
Darrell , Blackpool Human beings are not clever or together enough to organise massive conspiracies .
Tiny conspiracies involving 2 - 3 people ' in - the - know ' : yes .
Large conspiracies : no .
Pete , Lincoln , UK
No rational person can fully believe what politicians say ; their lack of full disclosure leaves room for these theories .
Many years after " big events " that occurred in the past the truth is revealed that show that governments either lied or withheld vital facts from the public .
For example the British government always denied that there was any official investigation into UFOs but we know know that was untrue .
Bo Tsang , Wallasey , Wirral I have a friend that does not believe there has been a flu outbreak - it's a conspiracy between government and drugs companies .
What can you say ?
Peter Bird , Manchester , UK Conspiracy theories are excellent entertainment , a great exercise in letting your imagination run wild .
However , reality usually dictates that at the heart of these theories you 'll actually find cock - ups and frantic blame - evasion , the latter being responsible for the cries of " they 're hiding the truth from us " .
Yes , often they are , but almost always because someone cocked - up .
Nick Rowe , Nottm , UK " They want to believe desperately that someone is in charge , " he says .
" Even if it is someone who is working against us . "
That final comment from the article says it all .
Conspiracy theorists always strike me as being slightly loopy and very easily persuaded that ridiculous theories without any scrap of evidence or logic must be true - and they 'll argue it with anyone who does not also believe in the " truth " .
It 's an extreme form of religion and uses the same thought process that used to result in " witches " being burned at the stake .

So from now until we finally make a Compiz 0.9.0 beta release I will be doing some short blog posts on what the differences between Compiz 0.8 and Compiz 0.9 are for both users and developers .
Compiz 0.9 is a complete re-thinking of Compiz 0.8 .
It ’s like KDE4 was to KDE3 .
Totally new frameworks .
Totally new buildsystem .
Totally new API .
It ’s supposed to clear the ground from major architectural flaws that were in older versions of compiz to make development far easier and faster even for future version of compiz .
So without further ado , here starts the series :
Plugin Plugins ( or Plugin Plugin Plugins or Plugin … Plugins )
One of the main problems with the 0.8 compiz series was that it was not easy to extend plugins and it was not easy to make library plugins .
You could expose functions to other plugins from within your own plugin but it only just sort - of worked and there were all kinds of problems that needed to be overcome for it to work with a lot of unclean code that was essentially redundant , made the whole thing unstable and wasted a lot of time .
It ’s not quite as simple as importing some plugin as a lib then calling it ’s functions , rather it had to do awkward function maps that were inserted as what looked like new plugins that other plugins then accessed with a special number then had to rely on the function map being correct and nothing moving around then had to call functions indirectly .
Compiz 0.9 , with it ’s object oriented design , strives to fix a lot of the problems associated with this .
To understand this , we classify any plugin that works with other plugins into 2 categories :
Extension plugins
These plugins exist soley to extend the functionality of other plugins .
For example , cubeaddon extends cube directly by hooking it ’s functions as does scaleaddon extending scale .
Animationaddon extends animation by working with animation ’s internal animation manager to add new animations .
It ’s a one - to - one relationship between plugins .
Getting both these methods to work is complicated enough , for the former you need to handle internal functions being hooked by other plugins and for the latter you need more function maps to explain to other plugins how to add more objects to their plugins .
Compiz 0.9 has an Object Oriented design .
This makes sense considering that we are working with all sorts of real things evident to the user , windows , screens , outputs , animations , plugins etc etc .
It ’s not like everything is a copy of a copy of a copy .
This has large benefits because it means that a lot of the code to manage objects is already there and you do n’t need to worry trying to tell other plugins exactly how to add objects to a queue .
You just provide a base class their object derives from and that does all the work .
As for the former case , there is now far more control over how functions are hooked .
Library Plugins
Library plugins are plugins that are loaded into compiz but do n’t actually do anything on their own , rather they just provide functionality that other plugins can use .
An example of this is the text plugin or the mousepoll plugin .
The whole purpose of these library plugins is to provide functionality to other plugins that would otherwise be very similar code that is duplicated again and again .
It also allows some kind of consistency .
Library plugins in Compiz 0.9 now provide real objects to other plugins rather than just function tables to manage internal variables .
This means that you can take some text , render it and draw it in a few lines of code rather than having to go through a whole bunch of internal functions to make it work .
The plugin only needs to be loaded for some context settings bits and pieces .
Lots of functionality will be collected into library plugins for use by all plugins because they are now really easy to write .
For example , we already have a compiz - toolbox plugin which performs miscellaneous functions used by a lot of the switcher plugins and both staticswitcher and switcher now use that plugin rather than duplicating lots of code .
It means that any plugin now that will be similar to switcher and staticswither can just use those functions rather than having to understand any potentially confusing internal code .
The end result
Things are organised much better
Tricks that certain plugins do can be expose to other plugins rather than having to rewrite them
Extension interfaces are now easy to write
Two years ago , the prospect of Garmin launching their own phone was rather awesome .
After repeated delays , interest wavered amongst the tech - loving public and last month , the Garmin Nuvifone launched to limited excitement .
Sure … commercials for the phone running on AT&T ’s service are everywhere , but … does anyone care ?
Garmin missed their window of opportunity .
And last week , when Google announced that Android 2.0 includes a free full - featured turn - by - turn navigation solution called Google Navigation , that window of opportunity SLAMMED shut .
For over a year , Garmin has been promising an Android Phone in their Nuvifone lineup .
In their 3rd Quarter Earnings Call ( PDF link ) , the company confirmed their plans to launch an Android Phone :
That wo n’t happen until 2010 , by which point we can assume a few other Android 2.0 devices will be readily available .
So when they DO launch an Android Nuvifone … will anyone care ?
I think plenty of people WILL care .
Garmin DOES have the industry leading navigation software / service .
But there is a reason their stock plummeted when Google Navigation was announced – far , FAR fewer people will care .
Garmin might offer more features , a cleaner UI , more reliability and so - on and so - forth … but Google will continuously be working to improve their product and trust me – it WILL be continually improved .
It ’s already pretty darn good .
And free .
Not to mention you can pretty much guarantee Google Navigation will have tighter integration with your Android Phone .
Garmin ’s mobile phone plans have seemed too little too late for two years .
When they launch their first Android Phone in 2010 , the same will be true .
They ’ve lost a step … they ’re playing catchup … and they need something to help catapult them back to the top .
The slide above seems to show their Android Phone will be unveiled in 2010 but just a few few weeks ago a Garmin representative said they would announced the phone this year .
My guess ?
Another delay .
At one point in time , Android could have been that “ thing ” to help them catch up , but now even THAT has lost its luster .
And with every delay it only gets worse .
Enough of the plans , upcoming announcements , promised products , etc … they need something NOW .
So what the heck can Garmin do to regain our attention ?
And when / if Garmin launches their Android Phone next year , will you care ?

The ‘ Copenhagen Diagnosis ‘ , a report by 26 scientists from around the world was released today .
The report is intended as an update to the IPCC 2007 Working Group 1 report .
Like the IPCC report , everything in the Copenhagen Diagnosis is from the peer - reviewed literature , so there is nothing really new .
But the report summarizes and highlights those studies , published since the ( 2006 ) close - off date for the IPCC report , that the authors deemed most relevant to the negotiations in Copenhagen ( COP15 ) next month .
This report was written for policy - makers , stakeholders , the media and the broader public , and has been sent to each and every one of the COP15 negotiating teams throughout the world .
Among the points summarized in the report are that :
The ice sheets are both losing mass ( and hence contributing to sea level rise ) .
This was not certain at the time of the IPCC report .
Arctic sea ice has declined faster than projected by IPCC .
Greenhouse gas concentrations have continued to track the upper bounds of IPCC projections .
Observed global temperature changes remain entirely in accord with IPCC projections , i.e. an anthropogenic warming trend of about 0.2 ºC per decade with superimposed short - term natural variability .
Sea level has risen more than 5 centimeters over the past 15 years , about 80 % higher than IPCC projections from 2001 .
Perhaps most importantly , the report articulates a much clearer picture of what has to happen if the world wants to keep future warming within the reasonable threshold ( 2°C ) that the European Union and the G8 nations have already agreed to in principle .
The full report is available at www.copenhagendiagnosis.org.
Three of us at RealClimate are co-authors so we ca n’t offer an independent review of the report here .
We welcome discussion in the comments section though .
But read the report first before commenting , please .
Liberal MPP Kuldip Kular , who was involved in an accident in Brampton that sent a pedestrian to hospital with minor injuries , will be charged with leaving the scene of an accident , police say .
Const . J. P. Valade of Peel police said Sunday evening that Kular , who has represented Bramalea - Gore - Malton since 2003 , will get a summons in the next few days .
" The substance of the charge is that he did n't provide the information he is legally required to in such an event , " said Valade .
According to police , Kular was driving about 7 p.m. Friday when he struck a 39 - year - old man at Torbram Rd. and Bovaird Dr .
The pedestrian had the right of way , they said .
Witnesses told investigators they saw the driver get out of a silver sedan and speak to the victim before taking off , leaving the pedestrian with a cut on his forearm and bruises all over his body .
" On Friday evening an incident occurred while I was driving to my Brampton home , " Kular , 60 , said later in a statement to the Star .
" While no charges have been laid as a result of this incident , I have and will continue to cooperate with police . "
However , Const .
Valade confirmed Sunday that a charge will be laid under the Highway Traffic Act .
The probe is in its early stages , he said , and " it 's very possible another charge could be laid " – either a traffic or criminal charge .
A source close to Kular said it was raining at the time and the MPP believes the man slipped and fell .
" He does n't believe that he hit him , " the insider said .
" He stopped his car , got out and helped him up .
When he saw he had a cut , he asked if he wanted him to call an ambulance .
The guy said he was fine and went off on his way . "
When Kular got home that night , family members said investigators had stopped by .
The MPP was at a police station for two hours on Saturday , the insider said .
" They did n't charge him with anything , " the source said .
Because failing to remain at the scene of an accident is n't a criminal offence , Kular will be issued a traffic ticket with a court date , police said .
If found guilty , he faces a fine .
Earlier this summer , former Liberal attorney general Michael Bryant was charged with criminal negligence causing death and dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death after a cyclist was struck by a car and dragged along Bloor St .
Kular , a doctor by profession , is the parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Health and Long - Term Care and serves on several government committees .
One of Kular 's friends said he was shocked to hear the allegations .
" He 's a friendly , courteous man .
It seems very unlikely of him leaving a pedestrian if the person was hurt , if that is what happened , " said friend Vijay Sharma .

Kular 's house in Brampton was dark Sunday evening , and calls to the home went unanswered .
Officials in Premier Dalton McGuinty 's office said they could not comment on the incident , and it is unclear whether Kular will face any consequences in the Legislature .
In December 1999 , rookie Liberal MPP Claudette Boyer was asked to step down as opposition critic for francophone affairs after she was charged with four criminal offences , including obstructing police .
McGuinty removed her from his caucus in 2001 after she pleaded guilty .
Similarly , New Democratic Party MPP Drummond
White had to sit as an Independent in 1994 after he was charged with assault .
The charges were later dismissed and he was allowed back into the NDP caucus .
Kular is popular among his riding 's large South Asian population and easily won re-election in 2007 by nearly 6,000 votes .
The married father of four has maintained a part - time medical practice because , he says , he does n't want to add to the doctor shortage .
That decision has drawn flak from his critics , who accuse him of being a " part - time MPP . "
In 1993 , he pleaded guilty to professional misconduct and was reprimanded by the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons for poor record keeping and improperly prescribing Tylenol 3 .
His clinic was later inspected by the college and received favourable reviews , he told the Star in 2003 .
In 2008 , he championed a private member 's bill to ban single - use water bottles , which was defeated .

Roman Polanski agreed to pay the victim in his child - sex case at least $ 500,000 as part of a civil settlement , but then failed to live up to the terms of the agreement , according to court filings reviewed Friday .
The documents leave open the question of whether the fugitive filmmaker has ever paid the money he promised in the confidential 1993 settlement with Samantha Geimer , but a change in her approach to Polanski in subsequent years suggests they may have resolved the issue .
In 1996 , she was still trying to get the funds and even attempted to garnish his pay from movie studios .
By the following year , she had stopped asking for court help to get paid and wrote a letter to a judge in support of Polanski returning to the United States and settling his criminal case without spending more time behind bars .
“ It has long been my personal opinion that he be allowed to do so , ” she wrote to Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Larry P. Fidler on May 28 , 1997 .
“ It is also my opinion as the victim of this crime that the 42 days he has already served is excessive . ”

Media outlets requested access to the archived file from Geimer ’s 1988 civil suit this week after Swiss police apprehended Polanski in connection with the three - decade - old Los Angeles criminal case .
The documents were provided to reporters in a downtown courthouse Friday .
Geimer , who in recent years has been an outspoken proponent of dropping the charges against Polanski , has acknowledged reaching a civil settlement with him .
The complete terms of the 1993 agreement remain unknown , but some details -- including the half - million - dollar payout -- are contained in filings arising from her efforts in the mid-1990s to compel Polanski , who was living in France , to live up to the deal they struck .
Geimer was 13 in 1977 when she told police that Polanski had raped and sodomized her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson ’s Mulholland Drive home .
Polanski , then 43 , pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor , but left the country before sentencing .
A decade later , Geimer filed suit against him , using the pseudonym “ Jane Doe ” and seeking unspecified financial damages for , among other things , sexual assault , false imprisonment , seduction of a minor and intentional infliction of emotional distress .
Polanski initially fought the claim .
But after Polanski was deposed in Paris in 1993 , the sides began settlement discussions , records show .
Advertisement
The deal they hammered out called , in part , for Polanski to pay Geimer $ 500,000 with interest no later than Oct. 11 , 1995 , according to filings by her attorney .
The deadline came and went with no check from Polanski , her attorneys alleged in court documents .
A court ordered a formal judgment against Polanski for the amount plus interest -- just over $ 600,000 .
The following year , her attorneys enlisted the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department in an attempt to garnish money intended for Polanski from movie studios , his agent and the Screen Actors Guild , the records show .
The case file does not reveal how the issue was resolved .
The final document filed in the case bears an August 1996 stamp and has the director still owing Geimer $ 604,416 .
The file hints at other elements of the settlement .
A document written by Geimer ’s lawyer refers to a life insurance policy Polanski was to buy .
And a note on an order signed by a judge the day after the settlement was finalized suggests a more complex financial arrangement than the $ 500,000 payment .
The note read “ 250,000 + 500,000 + maybe 500,000 " followed by the words “ settled ” and “ confidential . ”
Attorneys for Geimer and Polanski did not return calls seeking comment .
The judge who wrote the order is now retired and said he does not recall the details of the case .
Tapes and transcripts of the proceedings have been destroyed , court officials said .

Geimer has said she believes Polanski was mistreated by the court system and has suffered enough for his crime .
In 2003 , when the director was nominated for an Academy Award , she wrote an opinion piece for The Times saying the criminal case should not stand in the way of his attending the ceremony .
He ended up winning best director for “ The Pianist . ”
When the filmmaker asked a judge last year to dismiss the entire case because of alleged judicial and prosecutorial misconduct , Geimer said she welcomed an opportunity to finally end the case .
“ It ’s been a long time , ” she said .
“ I do n’t wish for him to be held to further punishment or consequences . ”

" Yes I was n't wearing any clothes but I was alone , in my own home and just got out of bed .
It was dark and I had no idea anyone was outside looking in at me , " he said .
American Sign Language ( ASL ) , the sign language used by the deaf community throughout most of North America , has a rich vocabulary of terms , which include profanity .
Within deaf culture , there is a distinction drawn between signs used to curse versus signs that are used to describe sexual acts .
In usage , signs to describe detailed sexual behavior are highly taboo due to their graphic nature .
As for the signs themselves , some signs do overlap , but they may also vary according to usage .
For example , the sign for " shit " when used to curse is different from the sign for " shit " when used to describe the bodily function or the fecal matter .
Examples [ edit ]
The back of dominant open b- handshape flipped out under chin literally means " so what ? "
Using a middle finger as the ' classic ' flipping of the bird has a different meaning .
In the 1980s , the myth was made that the b-handshape flipped under the chin was a sign of saying " Fuck you " .
Some linguists contend that when the middle finger is used directionally , and pointed at someone or something , it becomes a sign .
Another common sign for " fuck " uses an " FK " abbreviation , signed with an f - handshape changing to a k - handshape , which is referred to as a " loan sign " .
A " loan sign " is when a fingerspelled word is modified to leave out letters , form a specific shape , or move in a specific direction to become an actual sign ( 1 ) .
[ citation needed ]
" Whore , " " slut , " or " prostitute " is signed by waving an open hand on the side of the chin front to back ( fingers cupped in a c form , but thumb out ) .
The hand passes below and to the side of the chin twice .
More commonly , the back of the " B " hand brushes the cheek , twice .
[ citation needed ]
" Dick " is a " d " handshape tapping the nose .
[ citation needed ]
The thumb / index finger side of a b - handshape struck against the chin means " bitch " ( contact point is the side of the index finger ) .
" Bastard " can be produced by doing the same sign but locating it on the forehead .
The sign for " bitch " is often confused for the English sign " be " or the sign " breakfast . " [ citation needed ]
Touching the p-handshape middle finger to the nose tip then bringing it out to " F " ( done with one hand ) means " piss off " , or , literally , " PENIS FUCK " .
This sign creates the meaning of " piss off " by combining the sign for " penis / piss " and abbreviating " O - F - F " by using simply one " F " . [ citation needed ]
" Fuck " as a sexual connotation is signed by taking two v-shaped hands and tapping them twice ( dominant hand on top ) to emulate two people 's legs .
This sign also means " sex . "
The diction is determined by non-manual markers .
This sign is often confused for " gender " .
[ citation needed ]
If you are trying to use the word " fuck " as in " fuck you " , you can sign it by holding your middle finger towards someone and then pointing it at them .
Holding a d- handshape in front of the body with the index finger pointing somewhat forward and to the left and the palm pointing somewhat down , then shoving the hand quickly down and to the right in an arc as if condemning someone to hell signifies " damn "
The sign properly ends pointing mostly down and off to the right a bit .
Doing this sign with an " H " means " hell " .
[ citation needed ]
A common misconception is the sign for " bullshit . "
Signed with both arms held out , elbows bent , and folded in front of the signer with the dominant forearm on top , the dominant hand mimics a pair of horns with the index and pinkie finger .
The non -dominant hand mimics the " business end " with flapping fingers .
This sign is not considered part of ASL .
It is however part of New Zealand Sign Language . [ 1 ]
The correct sign in ASL is performed with both the pointer and pinkie finger being extended and thrusting the hand forward to signify " bullshit " .
An alternative is to make a " C " around your nose , rotate the " C " , and then close your hand in a fist and face your palm to your nose .
These signs are , however , not used as jokes .
To sign the equivalent of a joking " that 's BS , " you simply sign the letters B - S. [ citation needed ]

The well - known OK gesture , when held with the thumb on top at the level of the chest means " asshole " , as seen in the film Mr. Holland 's Opus .
Asshole can also be signed by tapping an A on the side of the head twice .
Also , by rocking " F " sign downward from the wrist , twice .

The common sign for the noun " shit " is the thumbs - up signal with one hand , the other hand grasping the thumb and pulling upwards .
The exclamation " shit " is signed by jamming the thumb of the dominant hand , on top , into a fist on the other hand . [ citation needed ]

Stripping the Gurus :
Sex , Violence , Abuse and Enlightenment * by Geoffrey D. Falk
Armed with wit , insight , and truly astonishing research , Geoffrey Falk utterly demolishes the notion of the enlightened guru who can lead devotees to nirvana .
This entertaining and yet deadly serious book should be read by everyone pursuing or thinking of pursuing the path of guru devotion .
 John Horgan , author of Rational Mysticism
Stripping the Gurus is superbone of the best books of its kind I have ever read .
The research is meticulous , the writing engaging , and the overall thesis : devastatingly true .
A stellar book .
 Dr. David C. Lane , California State University
This gripping and disturbing book should be read by anyone who finds themself revering a spiritual teacher .
 Susan Blackmore , author of The Meme Machine
Geoffrey Falk 's delightful but disturbing unmasking of religious prophets and preachers who command a vast following is a welcome contribution to the literature on the gurus and god-men of all religions .
 Dr. Narasingha P. Sil , Western Oregon University
No one involved in contemporary spirituality can afford to ignore this book .
It exposes the darker side of modern spiritual movements , those embarrassing sometime vicious or criminal reports which the leaders of these movements prefer to hide .
With wit and humility , and without abandoning the verities of religion , Falk has provided a corrective critique of groups that peddle enlightenment and transcendence .
A must !

These are typical of the " wizened sages " to whom otherwise - sensible people give their devotion and unquestioning obedience , surrendering their independence , willpower , and life 's savings in the hope of realizing for themselves the same " enlightenment " as they ascribe to the " perfect , God-realized " master .
Why ?
Is it for being emotionally vulnerable and " brainwashed , " as the " anti-cultists " assert ?
Or for being " willingly psychologically seduced , " as the apologists unsympathetically counter , confident that they themselves are " too smart " to ever fall into the same trap ?
Or have devotees simply walked , with naïvely open hearts and thirsty souls , into inherent dynamics of power and obedience which have showed themselves in classic psychological studies from Milgram to Zimbardo , and to which each one of us is susceptible every day of our lives ?
Like the proud " Rude Boy " Cohen allegedly said , with a laugh , in response to the nervous breakdown of one of his devoted followers : " It could happen to any one of you . "

Iraq and the sarin gas of spin :
An extraordinary eyewitness account of the regiments of spin doctors sent to Baghdad
In the pre-dawn darkness of an April morning in 2003 an American C- 130 Hercules transporter made a forced zig - zag descent through a potentially hostile sky and came to a screeching halt in an arc of armoured vehicles at Baghdad international airport .
On board – as well as me – was a human cargo of the first civilian administrators in post - Saddam Iraq led by Jay Garner , a retired US Army General .
It was nine days after a statue of Saddam Hussein had been pulled down in Firdos Square , an event staged for the cameras at the nearby international media village .
Looking around in the gloom of the Hercules ’s hold I noted about 50 officials from the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Affairs ( ORHA ) and realised that a disproportionate number were spin doctors – not specialists in relief , reconstruction and sustainable development .
Front Line : Stephen Claypole with a young local boy in front of a tank in Iraq
They were not going to do much to overhaul Iraq ’s creaking power stations .
But the reality was that they were in control .
There was Larry Di Rita , one of the right - hand men of US Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld and later Pentagon chief spokesman ; Margaret Tutwiler , a former State Department spokesman and Republican campaigner who helped to end the 2000 Florida recount impasse in George W. Bush ’s favour ; Dan Senor , a former White House assistant Press secretary ; Emily Hands , a Downing Street Press officer ; and Charles Heatly , a young Arabic - speaking British diplomat who was acting as a pair of eyes and ears for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) .
Forget the oxygen of publicity .
This was about the sarin gas of spin and ‘ information operations ’ .
It came to me that just as the Spanish - American War in 1898 had been a newspaper proprietors ’ war , the invasion of Iraq was a spin doctors ’ war .
Last week , the Chilcot Inquiry began and already there have been revelations about the way the decision to go to war was made .
But I also think the way the war itself was presented from Baghdad should be an essential part of the inquiry ’s brief .
Just a few weeks before I landed in Baghdad , I had been hiking across the South Downs near Brighton when Tim Cross , a British Major - General , came through on my mobile .
He was a deputy to Jay Garner and an outstanding specialist in relief operations .
‘ We are worried about the “ media piece ” [ a military term for media relations ] at ORHA , ’ said Maj - Gen Cross .
‘ Can you drop everything and join us ? ’
Within a few days I had become a sub-contractor to a Pentagon contractor , a huge defence and technology company called SAIC – known in Washington for its agility in winning large government contracts .
I was assigned to the Iraqi Media Network whose mission was to set up TV and radio channels and a newspaper .
To begin with , I was asked to help out on what the Americans call ‘ public affairs ’ .
The ‘ media piece ’ was in a poor state .
Jay Garner , a fine but limited American who got more things right than his brainy successor Paul Bremer , had been given no training in making TV appearances .
The Pentagon was already micro-managing him to oblivion .
Several other people were sent urgently to help out with the ‘ media piece ’ and in a few days I was shunted to one side by the contingent from the White House , the Pentagon , No10 and the FCO .
ORHA was already doomed before it arrived in Saddam ’s foul - smelling Republican Palace in Baghdad – later the epicentre of the Green Zone – where black rats and sand fleas outnumbered the civilian administrators .
Apart from a reasonably effective non-governmental organisation ( NGO ) clearance centre and a contingent of US Army Corps of Engineers , there was not much to put behind the reconstruction effort .
Drifting around the vast Republican Palace with its marble walls and kitsch chandeliers , I saw and heard a lot of things .
The most revealing of all were the Secret Video Teleconferences ( SIVITS ) where Donald Rumsfeld with his popping eyes , Paul Wolfowitz , the author of the Iraq Strategy , and occasionally George W. Bush appeared on large screens to lower the morale of ORHA staff .
I did not have security clearance to sit in on these conferences – but in a large echoing palace with few doors nothing remained secret for long .
For some weeks Washington was convinced that it could spin its way out of its abject failure to tackle the issue of nation - building .
The SIVITS often returned to this theme .
Jay Garner was accused – not to his face – of failing to relate to the Iraqi people .
This was a bit difficult given that the US Forces had knocked down virtually every TV and radio transmitter in the country .
In one SIVIT a giant brain at the Pentagon suggested that former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani should become the temporary Mayor of Baghdad .
Another wondered whether Florida - style garbage collection could be brought to the streets of Baghdad .
On the British side , nobody appeared to be firmly in charge in London .
Alastair Campbell seemed to be the most frequent caller , speaking from time to time with Tim Cross , Jay Garner and Emily Hands .
The FCO was , I think , holding itself back like the cavalry until No10 really needed it .
As things drifted , there was talk of the British taking on half the oversight roles at the Iraqi ministries .
That quickly ended when John Sawers , the former No10 foreign policy adviser , arrived .
I shared a stale croissant or two with him in the mess hall at the Republican Palace and it was clear that the UK was on the way out of Iraq as soon as it could be achieved .
Sawers was very discreet , as you would expect of a future head of MI6 , but his body language showed that he was truly appalled at what was going on in Baghdad .
Six years on I still agonise , like many others , about how our country got into Iraq without robust contingency plans for the aftermath of the invasion and a clear exit strategy .
Earlier this year , I offered myself as a witness to the Chilcot Inquiry .
I thought I might be able to contribute significant insights into what went wrong with Tony Blair ’s Iraq adventure .
Although a relatively minor player , I am one of the few people in the UK who has not rehearsed his / her evidence over and over again in the four previous Iraq inquiries , engaged in Civil Service backside covering , finger pointing , memoirs , off - the - record briefings , academic discussions and the other by - products of spin .
I got a snotty reply from the Iraq Inquiry in July , ending : ‘ Please note that it will be at the discretion of the Inquiry as to whom they invite as witnesses and the Inquiry team will contact you in due course if they wish to do so .
I hope you find this useful . ’
No !
Nevertheless , I hope that Chilcot manages to unearth the truth about Iraq .
It was a spin doctors ’ invasion , but the bombs and the bullets were real .
Now the voices of the dead – brave soldiers and civilians – cry out to be heard .

There are many , many laws having nothing to do with government that are useful to know because they tell you something about how the universe works .
There are Newton 's laws of motion , the laws of thermodynamics , Boyle 's Law , Heisenberg 's Uncertainty Principle , among many .
Most of these laws have been known for a long time , but it was n't until a mere 19 years ago that Godwin 's Law was written .
If you 've ever been involved in a discussion on Usenet , or have been following politics in the past decade or so , you 've probably encountered Godwin 's Law .
While Godwin's Law is , alas , as true today as it was then , it seems unfortunate that there are n't more widely accepted axioms to help us geeks define the characteristics of our world .
To that end , then , here are 10 geeky laws ( axioms ) that should exist , but do n't ... at least , they did n't until now :
1. Munroe 's Law : A person in a geeky argument who can quote xkcd to support his position automatically wins the argument .
This law supersedes Godwin , so that even if the quote is about Hitler , the quoter still wins .
2. Lucas 's Law :
There is no movie so beloved that a " special edition , " prequel or sequel cannot trample and forever stain its memory .
3. Tolkien and Rowling 's Law :
No reasonably faithful movie adaptation of a book will ever be quite as good as the book it adapts .
Thus great movie adaptations can only be made out of truly amazing books .
__4 . Somers and McCarthy's Law : __There is no dangerous unscientific theory so preposterous that no celebrity will espouse and advocate it .
5. Jobs's Law :
No matter how well last year 's cool tech gadget still works , it will seem utterly inadequate the moment the new version comes out .
6. Savage and Hyneman 's Law : Blowing stuff up is fun .
Blowing stuff up in the name of science is AWESOME .
__7. Starbucks ' and Peet's Law : __C 8 H 10 N 4 O 2 , better known as caffeine , is the most wonderful chemical compound known to humankind .
If the field of chemistry had never identified or produced a single other useful compound , caffeine alone would be justification enough for its existence .
8. Wilbur 's Law : Bacon makes everything better .
9. Comic Book Guy's Law :
There is no detail of a movie too brief or inconsequential to become the subject of an hours - long diatribe .
10 . The Unified Geek Theory :
At present , the President of the United States , the wealthiest person in the United States , and the most trusted newscaster in the United States are all geeks .
At the same time , movies based on comic book characters are routinely taking in hundreds of millions of dollars .
The only reasonable conclusion is :
We 've won !
Got any good ones we missed ?
Please list them in the comments .
Forget a jobless recovery .
The economy may be entering a recovery with job losses .
Third - quarter estimates this week are expected to show that the economy grew for the first time since the quarter ending in June 2008 .
Despite the estimated 3 percent expansion and a stock market that has been on a tear since March , hundreds of thousands of people are still being laid off each month .
Eight million jobs have been lost nationwide since the recession began two years ago , and by some measures workers face the worst job market since the Depression .
The average laid - off worker has been without a job for 61/2 months , a post - World War II record .
Many of those workers will never recover financially .
California 's hole , deepened by a state budget mess and volatile tax system , is far worse : Unemployment is at
12.2 percent , third highest in the nation ; and adding discouraged and part - time workers puts it over 20 percent .
" It 's not even a jobless recovery ; it 's a recovery with more job losses , " said UCLA economist Lee Ohanian .
" The idea of having essentially no net job creation after a remarkably severe recession is a real pathology for the U.S. economy . "
' Painfully weak ' job growth
Top White House economist Christina Romer of UC Berkeley told Congress on Thursday that employment growth could remain " painfully weak " through next year , and that the largest effect from the $ 787 billion stimulus enacted in February , mainly aid to states , is past .
By mid-2010 , she said , the stimulus will no longer contribute to growth .
Alarms are ringing at the White House and in Congress .
But with a mind - boggling $ 1.4 trillion deficit this year , Democrats have used up their bullets .
The word stimulus has such a bad connotation that the term has been banished from new efforts to goose the economy and help workers , such as extending unemployment benefits , sending $ 250 checks to seniors and a program the White House announced to help small businesses get loans .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - San Francisco , and top House Democrats met for four hours with economists Wednesday , amid criticism from the left that the stimulus was poorly targeted on jobs .
Calls have mounted for a tax credit to hire workers , much like one tried three decades ago during the Carter administration , but there is little appetite in Congress or the administration for more stimulus spending .
Romer and Vice President Joe Biden 's economist , Jared Bernstein , cited high deficits in downplaying calls for a new stimulus .
" Remember , stimulus by definition is temporary , " Bernstein said .
" In the interest of fiscal rectitude , we need to ramp the spending down no later than necessary . "
Even under optimistic assumptions , it could take seven straight years of solid growth just to get employment back to where it was before the downturn , a Rutgers University analysis found .
Almost no one is expecting job growth to roar back , given its anemic increase in the last decade , when the economy generated on average 1 million jobs a year , less than half as many as during the booms of the 1980s and 1990s .
Median income actually fell more than $ 2,000 over the decade .
Employment mystery
Economists are puzzled as to why job growth has slowed , citing everything from higher health care costs , to higher productivity , to Chinese currency manipulation .
" The answer is , we do n't know , " said Tim Bartik , a liberal economist with the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Michigan who is proposing a tax credit for employers who hire new workers .
At a cost of $ 21,000 per job created , he said , a tax credit is far cheaper than the average $ 112,000 cost of each job created by the stimulus , as calculated by the administration .
Michael Boskin , former top economist in the George H.W. Bush administration , favors a cut in payroll taxes .
He said the current stimulus has been " marginally effective at best , and at immense expense , " describing it as mainly a " patchwork of wish lists for various constituencies . "
University of Maryland economist Peter Morici said the administration 's efforts to restore growth by directing spending to such things as alternative energy are too expensive for the number of jobs created and ignore larger problems in the economy .
' 70s French model
" If we 're going to have 1970s French policies , we 're going to have 1970s French unemployment , " Morici said , referring to government direction of investment that many people blamed for chronically high unemployment in Europe .
The rapidly weakening dollar should boost exports and reduce imports , helping U.S. producers , but because China keeps its currency , the yuan , artificially pegged to the dollar , U.S. competitiveness against China will not improve .
" You can't grow with a huge trade deficit , " Morici said .
" If you do n't revalue the Chinese yuan against the dollar you can't get out of this mess , and if you do n't do something about oil imports you can't get out of this mess .
Industrial policies wo n't fix it . "

Humble people , christianists .
Some more humility : Huh , what ?
You say something ?
Oh .
Yeah , sure , you can say whatever nonsense you want , it 's a free country ( unless you want to get married to the person you love and a christianist finds some hare - brained reason , like matching genitals , to object to ) .
But you can't force me to listen to it .
Or take it seriously .
Humble people , christianists .
Catch that ?
" Pro-life : versus " pro-abortion " which , unlike " pro-life , " is an " ideology . "
Now , readers of this blog , being normal , realize that it is christianists who are the ones who 've actively encouraged unwanted pregnancies as well as abortions that could have been avoided through proper prophylactic pedagogy , which they enthusiastically oppose .
And you , intelligent readers , also understand that we are the ones who are genuinely pro-life , not criminals like Charles Colson .
But that 's not what 's meant in the Manifesto , of course .
And it's no accident that this particular language is employed here .
I 'll give Colson and his BFFs this much : they never make the rhetorical mistake of comparing their opponents to a bunch of mushrooms after a spring rain .
To Colson et al , liberals do n't remotely resemble a verdant forest after a drizzle : we 're baby - killers .
There 's no way to misunderstand them .
Am I suggesting we call the people who wrote and signed this nonsensical Manifesto something akin to " baby - killer ? "
Of course not !
Two lies do not make a truth .
No .
Instead I think we should simply and accurately describe them .
For example , " a felon and his like - minded accomplices " will do quite nicely in the current context .***
Ever more humility : That 's why the signers of this statement have been so vociferous in denouncing the Bush / Cheney regime for dramatically increasing hunger in America by 13 million citizens in the last year of their reign alone .
They did denounce them , did n't they ?
That 's why they , to a person , oppose the death penalty .
Right ?
Well , no .
These guys **** are talking about carrying fetuses without brains to term for no other reason than ... I can't figure it out , like God wants women to suffer through childbirth to carry dead babies to term ?
And they 're also talking about Schiavo : they 're proud of what they did ( and well they should be ) .
The President and many in Congress favor the expansion of embryo - research to include the taxpayer funding of so - called " therapeutic cloning . "
This would result in the industrial mass production of human embryos to be killed for the purpose of producing genetically customized stem cell lines and tissues .
At the other end of life , an increasingly powerful movement to promote assisted suicide and " voluntary " euthanasia threatens the lives of vulnerable elderly and disabled persons .
Eugenic notions such as the doctrine of lebensunwertes Leben ( " life unworthy of life " ) were first advanced in the 1920s by intellectuals in the elite salons of America and Europe .
Long buried in ignominy after the horrors of the mid-20th century , they have returned from the grave .
The only difference is that now the doctrines of the eugenicists are dressed up in the language of " liberty , " " autonomy , " and " choice . "
Of course this is bullshit , anyone sane will agree , and the distortions and poor associations between different pseud0 - facts make for incoherence , if you try to make actual sense of it .
So what is this about ?
Why is this weird passage in the Christianist Manifesto ?
Instead , consider the following :

Get it ?
No ?
Ok , let 's spell it out .
Check out what this passage contains : The President and many in Congress ... Industrial mass production ... human ... to be killed ... assisted suicide ...

Long buried in ignominy after the horrors of the mid-20th century , they have returned from the grave .
In other words , Colson and his cronies are saying Obama is Hitler and Democrats are Nazis .
They 're planning a Holocaust for Christians .
Disagree that that is the intent ?
Perhaps you think the gratuitous use of the German was just an accident , or mere intellectual posturing .
Or that it 's just a coincidence that the phrase " The President and many in Congress " occurs so close to " Industrial mass production " as well as the word " human " and the phrase " to be killed . "
Focus carefully on the .

If you really think this is just some kind of random half - baked nonsense , just boiler - plate , then - and I mean this very sincerely - you do n't know the first thing about how language works in modern American political discourse .
And so , you will be satisfied with a liberal rhetoric that counters this disgusting demagoguery with something as unfocused and ineffective as spring rain and mushrooms .
And nasty creeps like Colson , Donohue , and their ilk will continue to have regular access to sitting presidents .
And no , I will not get over it .*****

Some observers I spoke to at AU 's annual meeting believe that the Advisory Council is not what it appears to be on its face .
By appointing , they said , a broad spectrum of people who hate each others ' guts , Obama seems to be encouraging gridlock on faith - based initiatives rather than a smooth flow of funding .
Perhaps : after all , Obama is a very astute politician , and there is more than one way to prevent the government from funding Colson - approved boondoggles .
But AU leaders were emphatic in denouncing the very notion of the advisory council , insisting it represented an ominous expansion .

I 'd like to leave you with one more excerpt , however .
I thought about giving you the spectacle of Colson , et al , deploring births out of wedlock , which they did n't do , and did n't do it ever so convincingly , when Sarah Palin was parading her pregnant - out - of - wedlock daughter around .

前編では，音声信号処理の歴史，話速変換の基礎技術，圧縮オーディオを高音質化する技術などについて解説した．今回は，小型スピーカの低音再生やバーチャル・サラウンド，自動音場補正の技術と，それらの実装方法について解説する． （編集部）
>>> 前編の記事はこちら
4． 小型スピーカでも低音再生を可能にする低音域拡張
ここ数年，テレビの薄型化が急速に進んできました．見た目にもデザイン性の高い薄型テレビですが，内蔵スピーカに関していえば，その形状やサイズに対する制約がますます大きくなっています．薄型テレビでは，従来のブラウン管テレビのように側面に大きなスピーカを配置できないため，より小型のスピーカがパネルの横側や下側に沿うように配置されているのが一般的です．また，携帯プレーヤのヘッドホンや携帯電話，ノート・パソコンなどでは，さらに小さなスピーカが用いられます．
しかし，このような口径の小さなスピーカでは物理的に波長の長い低音を再現することが困難です．例えば，デスクトップ・パソコンで用いられるような典型的な小型スピーカでは，再生可能帯域の下限が200Hz前後にあります（図10）．実際に，これより下の帯域に入るようなドラムや太鼓，ベースなどの低音が再生できず，物足りなさを感じることが多いと思います．そこで，こうした小型スピーカでも低域を再現する手段として，人間の錯覚を利用した方法（7）が知られています．
スピーカの口径は5cmほどで，帯域の加減は200Hz程度．
● 錯覚を用いた低域拡張の原理
錯覚というと目の錯覚が一般的で，同じ長さの線に長短を感じたり，存在しない模様が見えたりする効果がよく知られています．人間の脳は耳に関しても錯覚を起こします．
低域拡張アルゴリズムで用いられる耳の錯覚とは，「ある基音の整数倍の周波数の音を同時に聴くと，その基音が実際には鳴っていなくても聴こえるように知覚する」というものです（図11）．
ある基音（100Hz）の整数倍の周波数（200Hz，300Hz，400Hz，500Hz）の音を同時に聴くと，その基音が実際には鳴っていなくても聴こえるように錯覚する．
例えば図10の特性を持つスピーカで100Hzの音を出そうとしても，小さな音しか出ません．また，イコライザなどで周波数特性を持ち上げられるのも，たかだか200Hz近辺まででしょう．そこで，代わりに100Hzの整数倍の高調波である200Hz，300Hz，400Hzなどの音を発生すると，耳の錯覚によってあたかも100Hzの基音が鳴っているように感じられるのです．
ここでのポイントは，100Hzの代わりに発生された高調波は図10のスピーカでも十分に再現可能な点です．このように耳の錯覚を利用することで，スピーカの見かけ上の帯域を拡張できます．実際に錯覚の効果を検証してみると，2次，3次，4次の高調波が最も影響が大きく，このうちのどれが欠けても効果が弱まることが分かります．
● 低域拡張のための高調波の生成法
低域拡張のアルゴリズムは，薄型テレビや携帯機器で用いられるような固定小数点DSPを対象に開発されました．こうした固定小数点DSPでの開発で常に気を遣うのは，各計算におけるオーバフローです．オーバフローを避けるには，ある範囲の入力信号を与えたときに，計算途中および出力信号がどの範囲に収まるかをあらかじめ知っておく必要があります．FIRやIIRなどのフィルタ処理においては，インパルス応答の1ノルム（FIRではフィルタ係数の絶対値和）を考えることによってこの範囲を知ることができます．
さて，低域拡張に用いられる高調波生成法の一つに，入力信号の絶対値とクリッピングを用いた方法があります．この方法はフーリエ変換の文脈では広く知られた事実に基づいています．単一周波数の正弦波を入力した場合，その絶対値をとることで偶数倍の高調波が発生し，また，ある任意のレベルでクリッピングを行うことで奇数次の高調波が発生することを利用しています（図12）．
それぞれ偶数次，基数次の高調波が発生する．クリッピング・レベルを適切に設定することによって両者のレベルをそろえる．
ただし，絶対値処理は非常に単純ですが，クリッピングについてはそれを行うレベルによって発生する各高調波のレベルが変動します．そのためクリッピング・レベルを入力信号に合わせて適切に設定し，所望の高調波レベルを得る必要があります．この点さえ工夫すれば，これらの絶対値とクリッピングは処理が単純であるだけでなく，その出力範囲が入力範囲を超えることはありません．あらかじめ出力信号の範囲を知ることができるという点で，固定小数点DSPに適した方法といえます．
● 低音域拡張 をDSP に実装するためのヒント
図13に今回の低域拡張アルゴリズムのブロック図を示します．このアルゴリズムは音声信号処理用の高精度固定小数点DSPであるTI社製「 TAS3108」（図14）に実装されています．図13のブロック図で最初の二つのフィルタ（HPFおよびLPF1）は，高調波生成の対象となる低域信号成分を抽出するためのものです．しかし，これらフィルタのカットオフ周波数は，対象となるスピーカによっては50Hzなどとかなり低域になり，フィルタ係数やフィルタ計算自体に高い精度が求められます．
前段のHPFでは今回のアルゴリズムを用いても再現できない低周波成分を取り除く．次段のLPF1で対象となる低域周波数成分を抽出し，倍音発生器で錯覚を誘導する倍音を生成する．ここでの出力はまだノイズのような音になってお，り続くLPF2で整形することにより低音に知覚する信号となる．最後にEQフィルタで低域を強調し，スピーカに出力する．
一方 ，TAS3108はアキュムレータ型のDSPで，アキュムレータに76ビット，データに48ビット，係数に28ビットの幅を持っています．このビット幅によって超低域にカットオフ周波数を持つフィルタであっても，精度を損なうことなく演算が可能です．また，このDSPは135MHz動作で，48kHz/2チャネルの場合，1入力サンプルに対して1400クロックの処理を行えます．これに対し今回の低域拡張アルゴリズムは74サイクルの演算量で動作します．図15に100Hz正弦波入力時の出力例を示します．
TAS3xxxはアキュムレータ型のDSPコアを内蔵する．アキュムレータ，データ，係数のビット幅はそれぞれ76，48．28ビットで，音声信号処理に十分な精度を提供する．また，乗算器は48ビット×28ビットの乗算を1クロックで実行する．実際のDSPコアにはシフタ，絶対値，対数などの算術演算のほｋ，6k程度のディレイ・ラインなども持つ．
TAS3108に100Hzの正弦波を入力したときの実際の出力スペクトル．100zの整数倍の高調波が出ていることが分かる．
I do n't know a single progressive that wants to see conservative Democrat Bill Owens in Congress .
He 's likely to turn out to be as disappointing as Scott Murphy , a businessman we were assured believes in Democratic values .
Murphy 's voting record puts him so far at the bottom of the barrel that there 's a Republican , Louisiana 's Rodney Alexander , voting more consistently with Nancy Pelosi than he does -- and only one Democrat , neo-Confederate Blue Dog Parker Griffith of Alabama , voting in a more reactionary way .
On the other hand , all the Democrats I know are enjoying the spectacle of a high - profile Republican civil war pitting the surging teabagger end of the GOP -- including Glenn Beck , Sarah Palin , Michele Bachmann , Rush Limbaugh , Mike Pence , Dick Armey , Rick Santorum , Todd Tiahrt -- against a limp Republican Party Establishment that includes Scozzafava supporters John Boehner , Eric Cantor , Lindsey Graham , Pete Sessions , John McCain , Susan Collins , Ginny Brown - Waite , Thaddeus McCotter , Newt Gingrich , and Peter King .
Many Republicans -- from Tom Price and Mitt Romney to Tim Pawlenty -- are curled up in balls under their respective beds , avoiding taking a stand .
With the GOP having abdicated its messaging in favor of Hate Talk Radio and TV hosts -- from Limbaugh , Beck , Hannity , Coulter and O'Reilly to Savage , Ingraham and whatever kook crawls out of the woodwork to call Obama Hitler , the party is now stuck with a pack of jackals more interested in goosing ratings points and ad revenues by being controversial than in doing anything that will help the Republican Party start to recover from its own ratings problems -- only 19 % of Americans trust the GOP and only 20 % of voters consider themselves Republicans .
Financially , the party of Big Business , Greed and Selfishness , is having no problem raising money for congressional candidates for next year 's midterms .
But the specter of loads of primaries between mainstream conservatives and neo - fascist teabaggers is an absolute joy to watch .
Even higher profile than the Scozzafava - Hoffman brouhaha in upstate New York -- which appears to be leading to the election of a Democrat in that district for the first time since the U.S. Civil War -- is the U.S. Senate race in Florida .
Once considered a shoe - in for Gov. Charlie Crist , the NRSC and the Inside the Beltway Establishment is catatonic as far right extremist Marco Rubio wipes Crist out in every single GOP straw poll in every single Florida county .
Rubio has captured the soul of the Florida Republican Party and is looking like he has a shot at the impossible -- capturing the Republican nomination , the effective of which will be to give an otherwise hopeless and mediocre Democrat a chance to take a red seat .
Several Blue Dogs and other conservative Democrats have all but abandoned the electoral coalitions that helped get them into office and have pursued conservative voters by spending most of their time on the Republican side of the aisle .
Quasi -Democrats like Glenn Nye ( VA ) , Bill Foster ( IL ) , Zack Space ( OH ) , Parker Griffith ( AL ) , Harry Mitchell ( AZ ) , Walt Minnick ( ID ) and Ann Kirkpatrick ( AZ ) are all weak candidates who have been following the Don Cazayoux formula towards political extinction .
If any of these reactionaries winds up in Congress in 2011 it will be because of the intra-party Republican bloodletting that often puts crazed teabaggers at the throats of mainstream conservatives .
Two wealthy businessmen , Scott Rigell and Ben Loyola , are spending over to a million dollars in a primary battle that is benefiting only Blue Dog Glenn Nye .
In the suburbs west of Chicago where Denny Hastert once ruled supreme his son Ethan was once considered the perfect candidate to take out conservative Democrat Bill Foster .
Now it looks like Hastert will be lucky if he beats a right - wing state Senator , Randy Hultgren .
Similarly two extremist loons in Alabama , Les Phillip and Mo Brooks , each considered a 3rd or 4th tier candidate , is hoping to knock out the other to get a shot at supremely unpopular Blue Dog Parker Griffith .
In California two far right Vietnamese - American Republicans , Van Tran and Quang Pham are pouring money into beating each other up while Blue Dog Loretta Sanchez looks more and more untouchable by the day .
And in the U.S. Senate race against Barbara Boxer , extremist Assemblyman Chuck DeVore , is fighting it out with failed corporatist Carly Fiorina for the relatively worthless Republican nomination .
Fiorina will likely spend several million dollars from her Hewlett Packard severence pacakge to defeat the teabaggers .
Tim Pawlenty , a full time GOP presidential candidate , ignoring Minnesota 's problems completely , first passed on endorsing anyone in the NY - 23 congressional race -- I mean who in upstate NY ever heard of Tim Pawlenty or cares who he thinks their representative should be ( as long as it is n't himself ) ?-- and today came out , limply , for the third party candidate against Republican Dede Scozzafava .
The NRCC , which has already put almost $ 850,000 into the campaign on Scozzafava 's behalf , still believes she can win and one insider has told friends that there is a lot of fuming that a " pack of self - serving Benedict Arnolds are fucking over this party " to make points with Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity .

The Nightmare of Deficit Spending , Devaluation , and Hyperinflation in Weimar Germany .
This was a time of bizarre parallels : amazing riches coinciding with terrible poverty , mass quantities of money coinciding with a shortage of money , mania and hysteria coinciding with mass depression , frenzied freedom coinciding with the rise of dictatorship .
There is no better historical incident to illustrate what inflation does to society : it turns everything upside down .
And the circumstances surrounding how it all occurred are eerily similar to our own today .
Hillary Clinton , the US Secretary of State , was forced into an awkward diplomatic pirouette yesterday , insisting to Arab foreign ministers that Washington had not capitulated to Israel 's continuing hunger for new Jewish settlements even if statements she had made 24 hours earlier seemed to imply exactly that .
Arab anger had flared after Mrs Clinton departed from the script of President Barack Obama at the weekend , suggesting that the Palestinians should agree to resume peace talks without preconditions , including that Israel first stop all settlement construction in the West Bank .
She appeared to endorse the offer by the Prime Minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , to institute merely a limited suspension of construction in some areas .
While not backtracking entirely , Mrs Clinton attempted in Morocco last night to massage those remarks .
Saying that Israel had expressed to her " a willingness to restrain settlement activity , " she added : " This offer falls far short of what our preference would be , but if it is acted upon , it will be an unprecedented restriction on settlements and would have a significant and meaningful effect on restraining their growth . "

Mrs Clinton , who travelled from Israel to meetings in Marrakesh , also offered fulsome praise to the Palestinian President , Mahmoud Abbas , for taking steps to meet Israel 's demands , notably for increased security , and said that " Israel should reciprocate " .
Fears are growing on the Arab side that Washington is going soft on Israel out of an overwhelming desire to get talks started again .
In the summer , Mr Obama plainly demanded that Israel cease all settlement construction to allow peace talks to go forward .
Mrs Clinton 's words , spoken while in Israel on Sunday , prompted a particularly stark warning in Marrakesh from Amr Moussa , secretary general of the Arab League .
" I am telling you that all of us , including Saudi Arabia , including Egypt , are deeply disappointed ... with the fact that Israel can get away with anything without any firm stand that this cannot be done , " he said .
" The Palestinians say that a viable state for their people will not be possible with more settlements . "
2009 -11-23
On 12 August , 2009 , a Rocky Mountain Bank employee sent sensitive information to the wrong GMail address .
The tale of how the problem was ultimately resolved is a bit long , sordid , and painful to read .
A court order was issued to have Google shut down the recipient 's email account long enough to delete the missent message from Google 's servers , and Google was eventually allowed by the court to reactivate the unfortunate user 's email account .
The missent email itself , it turns out , was never actually viewed by anyone before being deleted .
CNET writer Elinor Mills asked :
should the person who registered the e-mail address lose access to the account or have items deleted without his or her permission , particularly through no fault of their own ?
what recourse would the bank have if the data had been sent via regular mail to the wrong address ?
These are important questions that lead to the very heart of the matter — the availability of privacy technologies , the implementation of good privacy protection policies , and the way most of the world is failing at both tasks .
Given the easy availability of privacy technologies such as OpenPGP that can be used to prevent problems exactly like this , the only excuses that come to mind for such issues ever arising are laziness , ignorance , and incompetence .
Why do banks , utility companies , and other organizations that offer online services that deal in sensitive data not have adequate security policies in place to guard against these problems ?
Why do they not at least allow users to opt- in for secure messaging via standardized privacy technologies ?
Why does the Chase Online site for JP Morgan Chase Bank not allow its customers to limit communications containing sensitive information so that they will only occur over secure channels ?
If your organization ever sends any sensitive information via plain text email ( or , worse , unencrypted Webpage ) , it is not serious enough about privacy .
Even if they are sent to the correct person , there is always the possibility that someone else eavesdropping on the network might be able to capture that sensitive data — and , conversely , even if you think you 're safe because both ends of the communication are secure , your bank might have an employee who will send an email to the wrong address .
Banks and other institutions that regularly deal with sensitive financial data , or equivalently private information , should take a number of simple steps to ensure the privacy of their customers , all of which are solved by the capabilities of public key encryption protocols such as OpenPGP :
They should stamp all emails with verifiable cryptographic signatures , so the legitimate emails can be differentiated from spam and phishing emails that spoof the source address or otherwise pretend to be something they are not .
They should ensure that customers cannot set up access to sensitive data without either doing so in person or making use of some out - of - band , second factor authentication mechanism .
They should ensure that customers never need to worry that any sensitive data will ever be sent — or requested — via unsecured channels such as unencrypted email .
I understand that many end users are not quite technically savvy enough to be able to make use of the cryptographic tools that already exist , but we have a chicken and egg problem here .
Someone needs to start pushing things toward a better way of doing things so that others can follow .
Part of the problem is that , for the majority of users , securing their communications is far from " second nature " .
Many of them do not even understand that plain text email is not entirely private or secure , especially when that email is stored on a third party 's servers .
Still , some of us are fully aware of the implications of using plain text email , and a step in the right direction would be for organizations like our banks to offer at least an option to require all communications concerning sensitive data ( anything but unpersonalized mass mailings , in other words ) to be delivered only via secured channels .
I should be able to click checkboxes at my bank 's Website saying " Always Digitally Sign Emails " and " Always Encrypt Emails " , ideally with an option I can check that says " Use OpenPGP Public Key Encryption " .
Go ahead and set it under an " Advanced " tab — I promise I wo n't be offended .
Call that the opt - in advanced security option .
The default , opt - out basic security option should be that plain text emails will only tell me to go to my bank 's encrypted Website and log in to receive a critically important message .
The information would then still be encrypted , and while both verification and the security of the encryption might be slightly less certain , it would be a lot better than sending plain text emails with sensitive information in them for anyone with a packet sniffer to read .
Make the " Use Unsecured Email " option opt- in , with plenty of disclaimers to let people know just how stupid it would be to turn off all the secure communications options .
To be fair to Chase , it does do some things correctly that many other banks do not .
For instance , when signing up for a user ID at the Chase Online site , it gives you three options for out - of - band verification that you are who you say you are — an SMS text message sent to your cellphone if that is the number they have on file for you , a voice call to the telephone they have on file for you , or an email to the address they have on file for you , in each case to provide you with a one - time password to complete the sign - up process .
None of these options encrypts the communication , but I suppose we should be happy with baby steps for now .

Syria was among the last countries in the Middle East to introduce the Internet .
On February 24 , 1996 , the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment ( STE ) received permission from the prime minister ’s office to do so , and to serve as the body responsible for the Country Top - Level Domain Code ( sy . ) .
Two weeks later , STE signed an agreement with the Syrian Computer Society ( SCS ) , headed by the country ’s future president , Bashar al - Asad , to connect governmental institutions to the Internet in order to conduct an initial evaluation .
The result was a decision to move forward , for the following declared reasons :
1. the Internet made an enormous wealth of information and services accessible to students and researchers ;
2. it was an important venue for commercial publicity and trade ;
3. Syrian institutions could employ the Internet to promote Syria ’s cultural , archaeological and historical heritage and thus advance the tourism industry ;
4. Syria ’s positions and rights on vital political issues could be advanced , thus countering the “ mistaken positions , lies , and distorted views of Syria which appear on Internet sites supported by international Zionism . ” [ 1 ]
Eighteen months later , on November 17 , 1997 , Syria began linking up 150
selected government bodies to the Internet .
At the beginning of 1999 , accessibility was extended to the broader public , and included e-mail , surfing and file transfer ( FTP ) capabilities within the country itself .
In its approach to the Internet , the Syrian regime , like other governments in the region , seeks to counter material critical of it that is widely available on - line , while insuring that technological innovation in the country is managed with great care in order to fend off unwanted cultural and political penetration and thus maintain tight control over the population .
Hence , the authorities agreed to make the Internet accessible only after confirming that they had the ability to control and monitor its content .
Adding to the limitations on Syrian users were the high costs of purchasing a computer and connecting to the Internet , and the country ’s inferior communications infrastructure .
To be sure , Internet usage has expanded since the beginning of the decade by no less than 12,000 ( ! ) % , partly because the costs for doing so have been reduced , and partly because of the strong desire for access among Syria ’s relatively educated population .
However , the regime has made it clear that control over access will remain in force , and that some sites would remain blocked , in line with “ country 's traditions and habits ” [ 2 ]
Hence , only 16.4 % of the population currently uses the Internet .
Moreover , the restrictions imposed on them by the authorities render Syria , in the words of ‘ Reporters Without Borders ’ , among the “ Internet ’s enemies ” .
[ 3 ]
Syrian authorities block websites containing material on human rights , freedom of speech , Syrian opposition organizations and Syria ’s Kurdish minority , as well as pornographic and Israeli sites .
In recent years , they also began to block international social networking sites , in light of their considerable popularity in the country .
In 2007 , Syria was even termed the “ largest prison in the Middle East ” for Internet users and bloggers [ 4 ] ( as well as one of the 10 worst countries to be a blogger in 2009 ) .
[ 5 ]
Indeed , bloggers often serve lengthy prison sentences and are hounded by the authorities in a variety of ways for their activities .
From the opposite direction , there are Western internet companies which prevent access by Syrian citizens to some of their services .
For example , in April 2009 , the business - oriented social networking ‘ Linked In ’ blocked access from Syria , but quickly relented following protests by users , which were expressed through Twitter , among other means .
Linked
In explained its initial action as a human error .
But internet firms such as ‘ Google ’ and ‘ Sun ’ routinely prevent Syrian users from using some of their services , in line with US government restrictions on supplying goods and services to the country .
Notwithstanding these limitations , the penetration of the Internet and the spread of social networking sites in Syria has created an important tool to disseminate information within the country and beyond .
Users have often found ways to bypass the authorities ’ strictures limiting the freedom of expression and organized activities through the formation of on - line pressure groups which address social and economic issues facing the country .
The social networking site ‘ Facebook ’ , which operates in scores of languages , including , of course , Arabic , is especially popular in Syria .
The Syrian government ’s recent campaign against Facebook and call to boycott it has brought the issue of social networking sites onto the public stage .
The matter surfaced following a decision by Facebook ’s management to view the Golan Heights as part of Israel , registering users from Israeli settlements there as residents of Israel , and not as residents of Syria , as had been done previously .
It was even reported that Syria would block the site entirely .
In fact , access had already been hindered for two years , both directly and via proxy sites which make it possible to use Facebook anonymously . [ 6 ]
The restrictions on social networking sites were designed to try and prevent Internet users from maintaining contact with one another , whether within the country or beyond .
Indeed , it should be noted that on - line connections had been established in the past between Israeli and Syrian residents through Facebook proxy sites .
Facebook includes hundreds of Syria - related groups , whose participants , both in - country and outside of Syria , number from the very few to thousands .
They cover the gamut of subjects : tourism , business , technology , art and music , sports and student life .
These sites also enable users to organize on - line protests , sometimes with considerable effect .
For example , the rape of a teenage girl prompted a public discussion regarding the sexual exploitation of children , thanks to an on - line campaign involving thousands of people .
An on - line campaign against a draft law dealing with matters of personal status appears to have been decisive in the government ’s decision to abandon the proposed statute .
Other on - line battles have included one advocating the lifting of all on - line restrictions , for which a personal appeal was even made to Syrian president Bashar al - Asad ; and a call by local bloggers to boycott suppliers of cellular phones over matters of price , quality and service .
In addition , Syrian Facebook users have organized on behalf of local bloggers who were imprisoned for their activities .
‘ You Tube ’ is also employed by Syrians seeking to promote causes which are opposed to official policies .
For example , clips documenting the repression of Syria ’s Kurdish minority have been uploaded to the site .
In response , it was reported in August 2007 that the site was blocked by the authorities because it contained a clip which showed the dress of the president ’s wife flapping in the breeze during an official state function .
Similarly , in May 2008 , it was reported that access to the Arabic - language Wikipedia site was blocked by all internet service - providers in the country , without explanation , but in February 2009 the restriction was removed , an unprecedented step .
On - line social networks in Syria serve as a tool for organizing pressure groups , something which simply cannot be done in daily life , owing to the regime ’s heavy - handed oversight and repression .
These networks provide further tangible evidence of the strength of the Internet not just as a tool to transmit information within extremely restricted political environments but also to create a basis for social change in these countries .
As such , they constitute a direct challenge to highly centralized authoritarian regimes such as Syria .
This challenge can only grow in the years ahead , as the Internet inevitably expands its reach in the country .

The Venture Bros. is one of those shows I do n’t really laugh out loud at until the third or forth time I watch an episode .
It is n’t because the jokes are n’t hilarious the first time , it ’s just that there is so much awesome compressed into every moment I do n’t have time to laugh .
“ Twenty Years to Midnight ” is one of the few exclusions : the Grand Galactic Inquisitor ’s ridiculous interjections still make me tear up from laughing so hard .
My larger point is that there is so much going on in any given episode , some stuff can get lost in the mix .
One long narrative thread that gets drawn from the first episode of season 2 all the way to the end of season 3 is that the boys , Hank and Dean , can be cloned when they die .
Their beds record their memories , so the clones have almost no memory break between death and waking up the next morning .
A classic ethical problem of cloning technology has always been “ would the clone be a new person or the same one ? ”
There are two versions of the answer to the metaphysical / ontological aspect of this question : the religious and the secular answers .
In the religious version , the answer is that the soul cannot continue on , despite the “ memories ” being implanted in the new cloned substrate .
Basically this results in a soulless zombie thing that is not the same person .
So the answer is no .
In the secular version , the answer is that the original person really did die , so his or her consciousness is no longer continuous , meaning he or she is gone .
The clone , despite having the same memories and not perceiving a gap in time , thus having a contiguous conscious experience , is still a different person .
Again , we come to the answer of no .
Normally , this would be a bit of a problem , as The Venture Bros. is a show watched by nerds who undoubtedly would have figured out this conundrum and become upset that their favorite characters were now , well , not the same as the ones from the first season ( despite that the Hank and Dean from the first season were also clones , but nerds are good at cherry picking when we ’re being cranky ) .
But , you see , thanks to the metaphysical footwork of Dr. Orpheus , the Venture ’s necromancer neighbor , getting into an argument with Venture , we ’re presented with a strange workaround to the problem of a clones ’ consciousness .
Orpheus , guilt - ridden that he was a terrible babysitter and let the boys die , seeks to find their souls in the underworld .
After a failed search , he realizes the boys ’ souls are “ trapped ” in a machine .
Dr. Venture starts arguing with Orpheus that the mumbo- jumbo about “ souls ” and “ resurrection ” is no different from using clone slugs and recorded memories .
The strange implication of all of this is , when we accept the rules of the Venture world for a moment , are actually forced to agree with Venture in that Orpheus detects the souls of the boys in the computer storing their memories .
Thus , the resolution that Jason Publick and Doc Hammer come up with is : your soul is your memories , can be stored for future usage and ultimately put into a new body .
The religious and secular problems are overcome .
Ok ok , I know this is n’t exactly a rigorous philosophical or theological examination of the implications of clones with implanted memories .
I think Moon probably does a better job of handling that than The Venture Bros .
But it is the only effort I ’ve seen to combine the secular and religious argument and , in the process , reverse the conclusion of both .
Oh , and it means we get the “ aborted clone desperate to live up to the original ” episode to boot .
Everybody wins .

DUESSELDORF / BERLIN ( Reuters ) - General Motors GM.UL has paid back a loan from Germany and slightly lowered its target for job cuts at struggling European unit Opel .
Nick Reilly , interim head of General Motor 's European business , speaks to media in Duesseldorf , November 24 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Ina Fassbender
Nick Reilly , the boss brought in from GM ’s thriving Asian operations to help revamp Opel , told reporters in Duesseldorf on Tuesday that his plans now call for cutting 9,000 to 9,500 jobs at Opel and British sister brand Vauxhall .
GM will present that plan to Opel 's labor leaders on Wednesday , having decided not to sell Opel to auto parts maker Magna International MGa.TO and Russian lender Sberbank SBER03 .MM , who said they would cut 10,000 jobs .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , whose government had supported GM ’s plan to sell Opel to Magna , said on Tuesday that GM had also paid back the last of a 1.5 billion euro bridge loan it had made available to Opel .
“ I can tell you that the last funds for Opel have been paid back by General Motors , ” Merkel said .
“ I expect at least a thank you letter from General Motors in a few years . ”
“ German taxpayers have not lost a single cent on the entire Opel operation , ” she said .
The U.S. automaker , which has been bailed out by the U.S. government , is revamping operations worldwide but reassured German workers over its immediate plans .
“ Bochum remains an important site for us , in the future as well , ” Reilly said , referring to Opel ’s plant in western Germany .
He said last week that it was too soon to say whether any plants would be closed .
“ We ’ll try not to do it but we still do n’t know how we ’re going to carry out the production cuts , ” Reilly said during a visit to Spain , where Opel ’s largest factory is located .
GM has provided scant details on its 3.3 billion euros ( $ 4.92 billion ) rescue plan for Opel and European officials are set to discuss possible aid on December 4 .
The automaker , which emerged from bankruptcy in July , muddied the waters in the debate over whether it should get state aid when its third - quarter results revealed it had nearly $ 43 billion in cash at the end of September .
Germany -- home to over half of Opel ’s 50,000 staff -- has given mixed signals on aid since GM ’s U - turn on the Magna deal .
EU Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen said on Monday that without state aid the revamp could not work .
GM ’s Reilly had traveled to Brussels to meet officials including Verheugen , Kris Peeters , the premier of Flanders , where Opel also has a plant , and EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes .
“ General Motors made one point very clear , 100 percent clear , the restructuring plan could only be achieved when European member states with Opel plants give some financial help , ” said Verheugen .
TUSTIN – The Auld Dubliner Irish Pub filled an 8 - foot - tall glass with 430 gallons of Guinness stout on Saturday , trying to getting into , what else , the Guinness Book of World Records .
The pub ’s owners had the stout poured as about 400 people crowded into the restaurant and onto the patio to watch as the cup filled .
The glass alone weighs 900 pounds , Auld Dubliner co-owner David Copley said .
The stout alone weighs 2,772 pounds , said co-owner Eric Johnson after the full glass had been weighed .
“ It ’s incredible .
It was worth being a part of , ” said Tustin resident Randy Barnes , who was at the Auld Dubliner with friend Todd Fisher .
The glass will be on display for the next three months , but Johnson said they ’re planning to drink the stout by 2 a.m. Sunday .
“ We dipped our glasses in , and we have a pump , ” Johnson said .
“ We ’re going to drink it . ”
The glass will then tour the other Auld Dubliners , in Orange , Long Beach , Riverside , Olympic Valley and Mammoth Lakes , Peoria and Tuscon , Ariz. , Henderson , Nev. , and Bolingbrook , Ill .
Copley said the idea came about while watching an award given for making the world ’s largest Irish coffee .
He and Johnson decided they ’d do the largest Guinness pour , he said .
“ Guinness seemed the obvious choice .
We ’re an Irish pub and Guinness is synonymous with Ireland , ” Copley said .
Shannon Rozar , of Orange , said she came to the event because she ’s Irish and enjoys drinking Guinness .
“ We ’re major Guinness fans , ” said David Anton of Orange .
“ It seemed like a good way to pass the afternoon . ”
The cup , made by Ontario - based California Quality Plastics , was acrylic so it would n’t break .
The band Craic House performed as the audience watched Guinness pour from two spouts .
The restaurant sold T - shirts and glasses of Guinness to commemorate the moment .
The proceeds benefit the Orange County Fallen Fireman ’s Fund .
The Auld Dubliner is trying the break the record set in February 2008 by Harry Caray ’s Italian Steakhouse in Chicago .
Harry Caray ’s created a 4 - foot - tall , hexagonal , 100 - gallon glass with a handle and spigot for serving .
That glass weighed about 1,000 pounds when filled .
The largest tankard of beer , according to the Guinness World Records Web site , was filled in Poznan , Poland , in March 2007 .
The bronze tankard was 17 - feet , 8 - inches tall and was filled with 1,760 gallons of Lech .
It 's open season on comedians yet again .
Except this season is lasting all year .
The latest standup in the firing line is Jimmy Carr , who has the tabloids fulminating over a joke he told at the 2,500 - seater Manchester Apollo on his current Rapier Wit tour : " Say what you like about these servicemen amputees from Iraq and Afghanistan , but we 're going to have a fucking good Paralympic team in 2012 . "
Reports suggest that there were no mass protests at the gig , but afterwards the usual platoon of politicians and compliant interviewees were marched out to call for Carr 's court martial .
Patrick Mercer , Conservative MP , said : " This man 's career should end right now .
There are certain subjects you just can't make fun of and one of those is the sacrifice of our troops – especially this close to Remembrance Sunday . "
Carr has dropped the gag and apologised .
While his apology is understandable , I wish Carr had kept a dignified silence .
It was a good joke , and a defensible one , not least because it had a political subtext .
Carr was not mocking war heroes , but underlining the horrific injuries of young soldiers on the frontline .
And I 'm bored of these red top witch - hunts that pluck a line out of an act – and often out of context – and try to whip up controversy .
Take comedian Stewart Lee , who this summer was doorstepped by the press over a routine in which he imagined the violent death of Top Gear 's Richard Hammond .
Has no one at the Mail heard of satire ?
Since Sachsgate , the press is quicker than ever to smell blood and a possible circulation boost .
Yet even before Ross and Brand , comedians offered easy pickings to lazy hacks .
Ricky Gervais was in trouble for making light of prostitute murders and Billy Connolly was hauled across the tabloid coals for joking about hostage Ken Bigley .
I was at gigs where both gags were told , and while they did not get particularly big laughs , there were hardly outraged howls .
It was the media – well - skilled at taking offence on other people 's behalf – that fanned the flames .
Carr , of course , has already had his own mini-Sachsgate , when the BBC apologised for a joke he told on Radio 4's Loose Ends .
That joke was broadcast – as was Frankie Boyle 's recent crack about Olympic gold medallist Rebecca Adlington ; the amputee joke was told at a live show .
Surely anyone who buys a ticket for a Jimmy Carr performance knows what they are going to get ?
He 's hardly your regular family entertainer .
His repertoire variously takes in rape , blow jobs , anal sex , erectile dysfunction and domestic violence .
And surely most battle - hardened soldiers are thick - skinned enough to laugh at a joke like this ?
Certainly , the comments on the online forums that are the cyberspace equivalent of the barracks suggest that most soldiers have heard harsher gags – and told them too .
After all , if the tabloids think they can have a negative effect on a comedian 's career by going after them , they 're wrong .
Look at the comedians mentioned above , they do n't seem to be struggling professionally .
In fact , compare their careers to the brilliant yet uncontroversial comedian Milton Jones , who never tells cruel jokes and rarely pops up on the box .
If he could swap the clean - cut shtick for something sicker , and get the tabloids annoyed , maybe he could fill the Manchester Apollo too .
Audi will take on Peugeot and Acura at Petit Le Mans next month as it gears up to try to win back its 24 Hours of Le Mans crown in 2010 .
The German manufacturer has finally confirmed its plans to take part in the penultimate round of the American Le Mans Series at Road Atlanta on Sept. 26 .
The announcement follows two months of uncertainty about Audi 's plans for the R15 TDI in the wake of its defeat by Peugeot at Le Mans in June .
Audi Sport boss Wolfgang Ullrich explained that a return to Petit for a 10th consecutive run marked “ the first part of our preparations for the 2010 Le Mans 24 Hours . ”
“ We want to use it as an opportunity for our engineers to learn even more about the R15 TDi in direct competition with strong rivals , ” he said .
“ A lot of things can be simulated on test rigs and in testing , but nothing can replace the experience gathered in actual racing events . ”
The two Joest - run R15s will be driven by Allan McNish and Rinaldo Capello , and Lucas Luhr and Marco Werner .
They will bid to maintain Audi 's perfect record at Petit .
Petit Le Mans is likely to be the last time that the R15 races in its current form .
Revised 2010 regulations set to be announced soon are expected to force Audi to modify the controversial front end of the car .
The Le Mans organizer finally conceded that there will be rule changes that affect the Audi when it announced the broad principles of its 2010 rulebook last week .
The organizer revealed changes that will require modifications to the rear end of all prototypes , further tweaking the balance of performance between petrol - and diesel - engine LMP1 cars .

WASHINGTON  The Treasury Department said on Sunday that its scaled - down program to help banks unload their troubled mortgages and mortgage securities would begin operating at full strength by the end of this month , more than a year after Congress authorized $ 700 billion for that purpose .
Treasury officials said that five out of the nine money - management firms it selected to buy up unwanted mortgage - backed securities had raised the minimum amount of money from private investors  $ 500 million each  to qualify for matching investments and loans from the federal government .
Administration officials said they expected the remaining four firms to complete their financing by the end of this month .
Three of the biggest investment firms 
BlackRock , a group led by the Wellington Management Company and a group led by AllianceBernstein  closed deals for private financing totaling about $ 1.9 billion .
Two other firms , Invesco and the TCW Group , lined up their private investors last week .

The national average price gasoline has remained relatively flat over the past week – as it has for nearly a month – however , the 12 month price increase continues to soar .
The national average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline now stands at $ 2.64 per gallon , up from $ 2.63 last week , but down from $ 2.65 last month .
Â
With the holidays right around the corner , this holding pattern is a welcome sight to many consumers .
Unfortunately , despite having hit a recent plateau , today ’s price is nearly 40 % higher than the $ 1.89 it was just one year ago , thanks to both a supposed ( albeit weak ) economic recovery and oil prices that have climbed 60 % over the same 12 months .
Alaska ( $ 3.32 ) , Washington DC ( $ 3.30 ) , and Hawaii ( $ 3.22 ) are the only locations across the United States with an average price of gas in excess of $ 3 per gallon .
Â
Twelve states are reporting average gas prices below $ 2.50 per gallon , with Colorado the lowest at $ 2.45 .
While I certainly do n’t know exactly where gasoline prices are headed , the rapidly declining dollar and improving short - term economic outlook suggest that we ’ll see another spike in prices relatively soon .
In both responses , Dr. Volkow said , the gasping for oxygen and the wolfing down of something you would ordinarily spurn , the dopamine pathways of the brain are at full throttle .
“ The whole brain is of one mindset , ” she said .
“ The intense drive to get you out of a state of deprivation and keep you alive . ”

Dopamine is also part of the brain ’s salience filter , its get - a - load - of - this device .
“ You ca n’t pay attention to everything , but you want to be adept as an organism at recognizing things that are novel , ” Dr. Volkow said .
“ You might not notice a fly in the room , but if that fly was fluorescent , your dopamine cells would fire . ”
In addition , our dopamine - driven salience detector will focus on familiar objects that we have imbued with high value , both positive and negative : objects we want and objects we fear .
If we love chocolate , our dopamine neurons will most likely start to fire at the sight of a pert little chocolate bean lying on the counter .
But if we fear cockroaches , those same neurons may fire even harder when we notice that the “ bean ” has six legs .
The pleasurable taste of chocolate per se , however , or the anxiety of cockroach phobia , may well be the handiwork of other signaling molecules , like opiates or stress hormones .
Dopamine simply makes a relevant object almost impossible to ignore .
Should the brain want to ignore what it might otherwise notice , dopamine must be muzzled .
Reporting recently in Nature Neuroscience , Regina M. Sullivan of New York University Medical Center , Gordon A. Barr of Children ’s Hospital of Philadelphia and their colleagues found that , whereas rats older than 12 days would quickly develop an aversion to any odors that were paired with a mild electric shock , young rats would perversely show a preference for such odors if their mothers were nearby when the tutorial jolt was delivered .
The researchers traced that infantile Candide spirit to a suppression of dopamine activity in the amygdala , where fear memories are born .
Infant rats know their mother by smell , Dr. Sullivan explained , and they must not learn to avoid her , for even an abusive caretaker is better than none .
Large as its impact may be , dopamine is a compact molecule , built of 22 atoms , with the characteristic nitrogenous amine knob at one end .
( Dopamine , by the way , takes its name from its chemical composition , and has nothing to do with the word dope  as in heroin or other recreational drugs  which is thought to derive from the Dutch term for stew . )
The dopamine production corps is tiny as well .
Fewer than 1 percent of all neurons generate the neurotransmitter , most of them in midbrain structures like the substantia nigra , which helps control movement ; it is the degradation of this population of dopamine cells that results in the tremors and other symptoms of Parkinson ’s disease .
There is also dopamine activity higher up , in the prefrontal cortex parked right behind the forehead , that great executive brain where storylines are written , impulses controlled and excuses contrived .
An impoverishment of prefrontal dopamine is thought to contribute to schizophrenia .
( An elementary proposition is a truth - function of itself . )

WASHINGTON  The Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday revoked the licenses of two Northwest Airlines pilots who flew 150 miles beyond their destination last week when they were distracted by a cockpit discussion of airline policy .
The men have 10 days to appeal , the agency said .
The F.A.A. took unusually swift action against the two pilots , Capt .
Timothy B. Cheney and First Officer Richard I. Cole .
In its emergency order revoking the licenses , the F.A.A. said the crew had been out of radio contact for 91 minutes and flown 150 miles past the intended destination .
The agency cited “ failing to comply with air traffic control instructions and clearances and operating carelessly and recklessly . ”
The order said : “ You operated Northwest 188 in a reckless manner that endangered the lives and property of others .
You engaged in conduct that put your passengers and your crew in serious jeopardy .
You have demonstrated your lack of regard for or inability to adhere to your responsibilities to exercise the highest standard of care , judgment , skill and responsibility . ”

With the newest DNA sequencing technology starting to reach the market , we 're seeing a bit of a bifurcation .
Some of the methods can do long reads , covering hundreds of bases , and provide data that 's appropriate for assembling a genome that 's never been sequenced before .
Others produce lots of shorter reads , which can only be aligned to a genome that we know the sequence of already .
What good is repeating a completed genome ?
Potentially quite a lot , if that genome happens to be human and , more particularly , yours , since it can provide information on medically relevant issues like disease risks and drug efficacy .
The goal here is to make this so cheap that sequencing a person 's genome could be routine .
A big step in that direction may have been taken by a company called Complete Genomics , which describes the methods it used to sequence three human genomes in a paper that will be released by Science today .
The system described in the paper combines some clever variants of well known molecular biology techniques to read massive amounts of DNA fragments that are , in total , about 65 bases long .
But , because the materials used for the reactions are so common , even the enzymes can be purchased cheaply .
That allows Complete Genomics to bring an entire human genome in while spending less than $ 5,000 on materials .
All that , plus an error rate of less than one base in 100,000 .
For comparison , the completion of Jim Watson 's genome , done just a few years ago , is estimated to have cost $ 20 million .
Building DNA " nanoballs "
Both our introduction to DNA sequencing and our tutorial on DNA ligation will be invaluable for understanding the technique .
There are a lot of subtleties to it , but the basic outlines are n't actually that hard to follow .
The first steps in preparing the DNA for sequencing involve linking short stretches of DNA with a series of known primers in a small circle .
The authors start by taking a complete genome , and using ultrasound to fragment the DNA into linear pieces that , on average , are about 450 base pairs long .
These are ligated to a known stretch of DNA , amplified by PCR , and then looped into a circle by ligating the ends of the PCR products .
Now , they 've got a known bit of DNA that they can start sequencing from linked to their unknown genomic DNA .
Here 's where the clever bit starts .
The company 's technique can only sequence a short distance from primer sites , so they simply insert a few more known sequences a short distance away from the one they ligated in place .
There are a number of proteins , called restriction enzymes , that cut DNA at known sequences .
A subset of these ( which I 'd previously considered pretty useless ) do n't cut at the sequence they recognize , but at a very specific distance away from the recognition sequence .
So , the authors include recognition sequences for an enzyme called Acu I in their insert , and use it to open their loop about a dozen bases away .
This lets them ligate in an additional sequence precisely 13 base pairs from the first .
They then repeat the process in the opposite direction , bringing the DNA circles up to 3 inserts .
With that , they switch to EcoP15 I , and add a fourth and final insert , closing a circle that now has four pieces of known sequence separated by two 13 and two 26 base long inserts of genomic DNA .
DNA ligase is used to close the human genomic DNA into a loop that incorporates DNA with a known sequence .
That sequence directs a restriction enzyme to open the loop , allowing a different known sequence to be inserted .
By repeating this process , a small loop with four known sequences is created .
Rolling circles
At this point , however , the process has left us with a big mix of single molecules to work with .
Sequencing one , or even a few , DNA molecules is always challenging because of the signal - to - noise issue : with fewer molecules , you get less signal , and errors creep in when that signal gets swamped by noise .
So , the authors amplify their single molecules using a process called rolling circle replication .
If you recall from our first installment , a polymerase supplied with a primer and some nucleotides will start copying the DNA until it runs off the end of a linear piece .
But here , we 're dealing with a circular piece — there 's no end to run off — and the polymerase will quickly loop around to where it started , running into the double - stranded DNA that it had recently produced .
At this point , most polymerases will stop .
Most , but not all .
Some viruses have polymerases that will simply separate the two strands of DNA , and keep copying away , going around the loop until they run out of nucleotides to add ( it 's a great way to make lots of viruses quickly ) .
In the hands of Complete Genomics , rolling circle replication gets them lots of copies of their sequences of interest , making sure that they can pick the signal out of the noise .
In rolling circle replication , the DNA polymerase runs around a circular piece of DNA , displacing its previous work , and producing many copies of the original circle , linked together as a single molecule .
Even more importantly , all these copies are chemically linked together ; there 's no need to do anything special to ensure that they 're all physically kept in proximity .
The authors call these structures " DNA nanoballs . "
They distribute them on a plate etched using photolithography ( the DNA sticks to places that are etched ) in order to separate them sufficiently for imaging .
Sequencing by ligation
So far , we 've discussed using DNA polymerase for sequencing reactions , but it's also possible to perform sequencing using DNA ligases , a technique pioneered by ABI 's SOLiD technique .
The idea is that a specific enzyme , T4 DNA ligase , will link two neighboring pieces of DNA , but only if they 're base paired properly .
So , the reaction will work when the sequence matches perfectly , but even a single mismatch will cause it to fail , or at least will be very inefficient in comparison .
It 's possible to use this sort of proofreading activity to identify sequences .
So , given a mix of DNA fragments and a primer , ligase will preferentially link the one that precisely matches the sequence next to the primer .
This preference extends for about six bases past the site at which the link is being made ; beyond that , mismatches are tolerated .
In theory , it should be possible to label every possible combination of five bases , and see which one gets ligated .
But there are over 1,000 possible five base sequences , and we simply do n't have the ability to identify 1,000 different labels .
So , the trick to sequencing by ligation is to only query a single base at a time using four labels .
That can be accomplished by synthesizing different sets of DNA fragments , where each set contains each of the potential 1,000 + five base sequences .
In the first set , every fragment that starts with A gets a yellow fluorescent label , ones that start with T get a red one , and so on .
In the next set , the yellow label gets put on the fragments with an A in the second position , red for ones with T at that location , etc .
A set of DNA fragments where different molecules contain each of the possible bases in each location ( represented by an N ) .
For Set 1 , any fragment that starts with an A gets a yellow label , T gets a red , etc .
For the next set , the same applies to the second base — five sets are need to cover all five bases .
You can then use these sets to work your way down the sequence one base at a time .
Given set one , the ligase will incorporate any fragments that match perfectly .
Once the reaction mix is washed away , the fluorescent signal will identify the base at position one .
The ligated DNA can then be stripped off the DNA nanoballs , and a new primer and fragment set 2 added , allowing the next base to be read .
Given a primer and the first set of labeled DNA fragments , DNA ligase will preferentially link those fragments that are exact matches to the sequence .
When the excess fragments are washed away , a fluorescent signal can be read .
The newly ligated DNA can then be removed , allowing the process to be repeated with the next set of fragments .
There are four separate pieces of genomic DNA present , and it 's possible to read five bases in both directions from the inserts , so it 's possible to produce 40 bases of sequence in total just using this method .
Complete genomics lives up to its name
It 's not entirely clear , but some of the language in the paper suggests that the authors attempted to build a human genome using these 40 base reads , and failed .
So they extended each read by five more bases by adding an additional step , namely ligating on an unlabeled five - base fragment before performing the labeled ligation .
This gets them 10 bases in each direction from each insert .
Accounting for overlap within some of the inserts , this nets them a total of 66 bases from each DNA nanoball .
But , because each of these nanoballs was so small , it 's possible to do massive amounts of sequencing in parallel , simply by washing different solutions across the surface they were stuck to .
The authors were able to get anywhere from 45 - to 87 - fold coverage of the genome — meaning that , on average , each base in the genome had been sequenced 45 or 87 times , respectively .
That 's just an average , of course , as chance will ensure that some sequences are under - or overrepresented .
Still , given an algorithm designed to work with these specific results and the reference human genome sequence , Complete Genomics was able to get excellent coverage of the genome .
On average , small differences between genomes appear about once every thousand bases , so the error rate of the technique becomes rather important ; you want to identify the real differences , and not get sidetracked by spurious ones .
The authors calculate their false positive rate at only one for every 100,000 kilobases .
We talked with the Broad Institute 's Co-director of Genome Sequencing , Chad Nusbaum about the technique in September .
He 's seen some preliminary data from Complete Genomics , along with a draft of the paper , and described himself as " very optimistic about what we 'll be able to do with their data . "
Right now , however , it 's clear that Complete Genomics is a work in progress .
The authors indicate they tweaked some of their reaction conditions between genomes two and three , which improved the evenness of their coverage , so there may be further improvements possible .
There are some indications in the text that the process is n't fully automated yet , so there may still be some stumbling blocks there .
Finally , it 's important to emphasize that we do n't ( yet ) know how to assemble a genome sequence from 66 base fragments , so the technique will only work when there 's a high - quality reference sequence to tell us where each of these fragments belong .
But , really , none of that should detract from the eye - popping $ 4400 dollar figure , which is the cost of the chemicals and enzymes consumed during the process .
That does n't cover all the facilities and personnel costs but , once this thing is automated , I 'd expect that a complete genome will be less than $ 10,000 , possibly significantly less .

It ’s impressive that we were able to not only find seven , but actually choose the top seven most controversial and divisive aspects of Infinity Ward ’s landmark shooter .
They managed to bait everyone , from Fox News to PC gamers to the entire country of Russia , with both justified and balls - out moronic decisions .
Story - wise , Modern Warfare 2 ’s themes are a bit schizophrenic .
The game sometimes takes a neutral stance on war and corrupt politics , sometimes implies criticism , and occasionally forgets about everything except the fact that explosions are neat and OMG headshot !
It ’s always been tough for games to make poignant , topical observations and remain fun , but the effect can be a soupy mess of entertainment , relevance , irrelevance , and pretention .
Drop in multiple technical and PR failures , and the concoction is a shoo - in for gaming ’s “ most controversial ” list ( though still well under GTA and Carmageddon ) .

Keith and Eugene Robinson had the same reaction I did to watching members of Congress out there calling for something close to the overthrow of our government .
I agree completely with Eugene Robinson — it was frankly appalling .
Fellow patriots , go tell your congressman you ‘re not going to eat this rotten stinking fish that is Pelosi health care !
We are going to put a stop sign in front of her steamroller of socialism .
Go to it , Patriots !
REP .
PAUL BROUN , GEORGIA : Who will kill this bill ?
You will !
You will !
And we must .
The Constitution of the United States starts with three very powerful words : “ We , the people . ”
And we the people are speaking .
Nancy Pelosi , listen .
OLBERMANN : Press conference ?
The geniuses at the Republican study committee trying to rebrand today ‘s event not as a protest , nor a rally , but as a press conference .
Urging
House staffers in an e-mail last night to please make sure your boss does not turn this event a rally .
BACHMANN : You feel so good right now , and we , the members of Congress that are gathered on these steps for this press conference , are so honored that you are here .
BACHMANN : It was Thomas Jefferson who said — a revolution every now and then is a good thing .
What do you think ?
Lee Fang of ThinkProgress.org taking these photographs of a sign that reads “ National Socialist Health Care , Dachau , Germany , 1945 , ” superimposed over the horrific images of the corpses from Dachau .
Other signs are slightly less shameful but many in no way related to health care .
Congressman Bachmann staging what she tried to claim was a spontaneous meet - up of opponents to health care reform , in 25 buses paid for by the AstroTurf group Americans for Prosperity , could be considered spontaneous .
An estimated 4,000 people today answering Ms. Bachmann ‘s call , bringing with them on those buses , not just their misunderstanding of health care reform but also their hatred of President Obama , as well as pure hatred , period .
Our fifth story on the COUNTDOWN :
As if that were not bad enough , Ms. Bachmann today joined by the House minority leader as well as countless other GOP representatives .
This orgy of veiled threat and not so veiled racism of white power minority rule now fully the province of the Republican Party .
Welcome to the coup !
An elected Republican official today is leading a protest on the west steps of the Capitol that compared health care reform to Nazi death camps and encouraged mindless harassment of and possibly violence against the government .
Not tea baggers anymore , not demagogic commentators , an actual congresswoman inciting a hateful rebellion against the rule of law and order .
Her name is Michele Bachmann .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
OLBERMANN : That man is a doctor .
And someone has an appointment to see him .
At least Congressman Broun knows how the Constitution starts .
The Republicans ‘ top dog can‘t even cite the correct document .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
BOEHNER : I ‘m going to stand with you and all freedom - loving Americans against this bill .
This is my copy of the Constitution .
And I ‘m going to stand here with our Founding Fathers , who wrote in the preamble , “ We hold these truths to be self - evident that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . ”
( END VIDEO CLIP )
OLBERMANN : If Minority Leader Boehner had read his prop copy of the Constitution , perhaps he‘d know that he was actually quoting the Declaration of Independence — or maybe he thinks that ‘s the same thing as the Constitution .
Which might explain the Republican health care bill Minority Leader Boehner ‘s office having falsely claimed that that bill , once it was finally revealed , would cover millions more Americans than the Democrats ‘ bill would .
In fact , it would cover fewer millions Americans , making the nation ‘s health care crisis that much worse .
The Congressional Budget Office in its analysis of the bill , determining that the Republicans would leave will 52 million Americans uninsured .
Right now , there are 46 million in this country without coverage — which means under the Republican plan , 6 million more Americans would become uninsured .
And the GOP ‘s bills impact on the deficit ?
It would be $ 36 million worse than the impact of the Democratic bill .
Time now to call on our own Eugene Robinson , associate editor and Pulitzer Prize - winning columnist of “ The Washington Post . ”
Gene , good evening .
ROBINSON : Good evening , Keith .
OLBERMANN : Today , we saw a member of Congress encouraging harassment of the government , fomenting — her word was revolution .
And her behavior was sanctioned by her colleagues , the Republican leadership of the House of Representatives .
And I recall that during the previous administration , if you disagreed with policy and just said it , let alone staged some sort of protest with banners and references to the Second World War , you immediately got branded a traitor .
There seems to have been some kind of a shift of terminology in these times .
ROBINSON : Right .
Your recollection is correct .
I think it was more of a shift of party and control of the White House , and both houses of Congress .
And I think that the outrage that was displayed at criticism of the president of the time of war a few years ago was situational .
And it seems to no longer apply when a certain party is no longer in charge .
OLBERMANN : Yes .
Did the wars end ?
Did I miss that ?
Did I not get the memo ?
ROBINSON : You know , I missed the memo if they did .
The wars — the wars did not end .
And it really was quite a spectacle .
I mean , this was an elected congresswoman who presumably was sent here to make laws , out there doing this ridiculous — what do they call it — a press conference ?
I ‘d love to know the media organizations that all those people represented who were out there bused in by the Astroturf group .
It was a— it was frankly appalling .
But that ‘s Michele Bachmann .
OLBERMANN : But it ‘s always been appalling and it ‘s always been Michele Bachmann , and I do n‘t think she has any idea of what she ‘s doing truly and its possible impact .
But today was when the Republicans say , “ We own this . ”
There is racism in here .
There is bigotry .
There ‘s refusal to acknowledge the outcome of an election that was a pretty clear - cut decision .
There is a misunderstanding of a vital health care issue .
There are a lot of things going on here .
But they ‘re being stoked up into a rage and this was not — correct me if I ‘m wrong about this — but this was the day the Republican Party said , “ Yes , we ‘ll take this .
We ‘ll run on this .
We ‘ll become the party of hate . ”
ROBINSON : Well , it seems to me that they gave up any pretense of deniability today .
When you have the minority leader out there joining the protest , the rally , whatever it was , with this horrific and frankly disgusting imagery that attended it , I — there is a certain amount of ownership that they take .
And I think this is something that should be remembered .
These are video clips that should be kept and should be played .
OLBERMANN : On an associated point with this , how did the organizers of this not realize , you know what ?
We had better get somehow , even if we‘ll have to pay them to show up , some black faces , some brown faces , some Asian people , or somebody in this crowd , other than the crowd that we‘ve seen at every piece of videotape that looked like — that looked exactly the same .
This is otherwise going to look like a pro-apartheid rally in South Africa 35 or 40 years ago .
ROBINSON : Well , now , this is going to sound tendentious , Keith .
OLBERMANN : All right .
ROBINSON : But I went to the Republican National Convention last year , and you did not see many minorities there .
And it — look , this is a — this is a party that has been more and more hostile to minorities , to Latinos , to African - Americans .
It certainly perceived that way and this did n‘t help that image at all .
That — you know , that seems to be the hand they ‘ve decided to play .
OLBERMANN : It ‘s terrifying .
Gene Robinson of MSNBC and “ The Washington Post ” — as always , great thanks , Gene .
ROBINSON : Good to talk to you .
The original intention of this article was simply to inform people about stevia , a great natural sweetener that I 've recently become a fan of .
It has neither calories nor carbohydrates , is suitable for diabetics , and does n't cause tooth decay .
Information about something that can deliver all of that makes enough of a story in itself , but a little research into the history of stevia uncovered quite a bit of intrigue that I was n't aware of when I first chose this topic .
In the name of keeping the public ignorant about stevia businesses have been raided , books have been destroyed , and laws have been created making it illegal to tell consumers that a product is sweetened with stevia .
What is this herb and why do n't the powers that be want you to know about it ?
Stevia rebaudiana is an herb that has been used for centuries by the Guarani Indians of Paraguay both as a sweetener and as medicine .
It was " discovered " by Dr. Moises Santiago Bertoni , the director of the College of Agriculture in Asuncion , who was exploring the jungles of Paraguay .
He first heard of the herb in 1887 , and encountered a live plant for the first time in 1903 .
He later said of this herb , " the sweetening power of kaa he-e [ the native name for the stevia plant ] is so superior to sugar that there is no need to wait for the results of analyses and cultures to affirm its economic advantage ... the simplest test proves it . "
In 1908 the first stevia crop was harvested , and plantations began to spring up .
In a memo written in the 1920s , American Trade Commissioner George S. Brady said he was " desirous of seeing it placed before any American companies liable to be interested , as it is very probable that it will be of great commercial importance . "
If its " commercial importance " was so great , why did stevia never catch on ?
A 1913 memo from the official public scientific laboratory in Hamburg , Germany may hold a clue where it states , " specimens received are of the well - known plant which alarmed sugar producers some years ago . "
In 1960s Japan , there was a popular movement against adding chemicals such as artificial sweeteners to food .
Manufacturers there were on the lookout for a natural alternative to sugar , and stevia was introduced to the Japanese market in 1970 .
It is currently used in many products there ( including cola , desserts , and gum ) and makes up 40 % of the Japanese sweetener market .
Stevia is about 300 times sweeter than sugar in its natural state , and much more so when processed .
Its medicinal uses include regulating blood sugar , preventing hypertension , treatment of skin disorders , and prevention of tooth decay .
Other studies show that it is a natural antibacterial and antiviral agent as well .
Stevia is actually good for you !
On top of that , it is calorie and carbohydrate free .
Stevia is a great sweetener choice for diabetics , those watching their weight , and anyone interested in maintaining their health .
So why have n't most people heard of it ?
In the late 1980s an " anonymous firm " lodged a " trade complaint " with the FDA about stevia when it started to surface in the United States .
One company using stevia was the Celestial Seasonings herbal tea company .
They were ordered by the FDA to stop producing tea " adulterated " with stevia .
Traditional Medicinals , another tea company , had their inventory of stevia teas confiscated during an unexpected FDA raid and were told the tea would be burned .
Why did the government treat stevia like a controlled substance ?
FDA documents call stevia a " dangerous food additive " even though the safety of stevia has been widely tested for many years by scientists in Japan .
The FDA will not reveal who made the " trade complaint " ( despite the Freedom of Information Act ) though many suspect that it was the makers of the artificial sweetener Aspartame ( aka " Nutrasweet " ) trying to fend off competition , as the artificial sweetener is very profitable .
Was the government protecting the health of its citizens or that of big business ?
If that is n't bizarre enough , the FDA also ordered a Texas - based distributor of stevia supplements to destroy three books on the subject .
They were told that an inspector would be coming to oversee the destruction of these materials !
This spurred outrage from the media , the ACLU , and members of the public who heard about the attempted censorship and the FDA decided not to go through with it .
The FDA was willing to violate the first amendment ( with a good old fashioned book burning ) to keep stevia under wraps !
An interesting contrast : while no one in Japan has complained about any stevia related health problems for the past thirty years , over 75 % of food additive related complaints in the US are about Aspartame , which is supposedly safe .
In 1995 the FDA reversed their decision to ban stevia , but only halfway .
Stevia can now be sold as a " nutritional supplement " but not as a sweetener in the United States .
This is also the case in the European Union , and the World Health Organization is pressuring other countries to follow suit .
Essentially , this means you can find it at many stores in the vitamin department , but the label can't tell you what the product is actually for .
As absurd as this is , the good news is that stevia is available for those who know about it .
It is generally carried in health food stores and there are many retailers online as well .
Stevia is available in several forms , including concentrated powders and liquid extracts .
Read labels to see what other ingredients you are getting , as some contain fillers and / or alcohol .
I generally use stevia in its natural form , either fresh , dried , or powdered .
Like other natural sweeteners such as honey and maple syrup , stevia has its own special flavor and does not taste exactly like sugar .
You may not like the way it tastes in coffee , but find it great with tea .
Unlike artificial sweeteners , it does n't break down with heat , so you can learn to cook with it too .
I hope you find stevia to be as wonderful of an herb as I do , and that the FDA comes to its senses soon !

As I was leaving the little state of Kerala recently I had to pass through a brief passport check by two Indian soldiers at the airport ’s entrance doors .
Glancing at my California address in the document , the Indian Army soldier smiled at me with a mocking twinkle in his eyes .
“ So , California – Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , eh? The Terminator ! ” he laughed .
Since I ’d already spent 10 weeks in this land of 100 percent literacy and a highly politicized populace , this blatant teasing did not surprise me – just perhaps irked me a little bit .
“ Yes , ” I retorted , “ his muscles are in here , ” pointing to my head , to the glee of this warrior of airport security and his comrade - in - arms .
I did not begrudge their fun – they ’ve certainly earned their political superiority .
Kerala ’s leaders have muscles in their bodies , and brains in their heads !
Shocking as it may be to most Americans , this little corner of India has a free , well - educated , equitable and relatively well - off society – all on one - seventieth of the average U.S. income .
This has been achieved largely thanks to the hard work of the Communists .
Red hammer - and - sickle flags abound !
Here ’s how they did it .
Stretching along the Indian Ocean , Kerala is a densely populated state on the southwest shore of India , way south of Mumbai and almost touching the very tip of the subcontinent , across from the island nation of Sri Lanka .
Kerala ( pronounced KER - a - la ) is a land covered with coconut trees , dotted with tea and spice plantations , and dominated by mountains on its eastern edge , which drop down westward to the Indian Ocean , creating a huge alluvial plain of rivers , canals and inland seas – the Backwaters so loved by the tourists !
I recently spent two - and - a - half months there and three weeks in the rest of India for comparison .
Nowhere in Kerala can one find the huge income gaps , social unrest and deep levels of poverty found in the rest of India .
To call Kerala a socialist state is by - and - large an accurate description .
Indian independence from British colonialism came in 1947 , with state elections in distant Kerala organized in 1957 .
By all accounts , these electoral processes have been free , fair and democratic since their beginnings more than 50 years ago .
It was in 1957 that the Communist Party of India ’s leader in Kerala was voted in as chief minister of the state government , to the displeasure of the West , and of the centrist national government in New Delhi .
The initial victory of the Left in the late ’ 50s was firmly rooted in reality : the beginnings of largely successful land reform ; strides toward free , universal education ; a growing public health system ; burgeoning workers ’ and peasants ’ cooperatives ; militant trade unions ; a vibrant women ’s movement ; and a frontal assault on the gross inequities of the caste system .
Today Kerala votes for its state and municipal governments every five years , with the Left Democratic Front ( a coalition of parties with the CPI - M and CPI at its core ) vying with the United Democratic Front ( also a coalition , but led by the nation ’s dominant political group , the Congress Party of the Nehru dynasty ) .
Power has seesawed between the two Fronts for the past several decades , with a “ now we want a change ” attitude amongst the electorate every five years , shifting control from the left to the center and back again , but never to the right !
This highly democratic system has its sometimes humorous and frustrating drawbacks , with one Front starting projects and programs while in power , only to see them stalled and defunded when the other Front gains control and replaces them with a different agenda five years later .
I was reminded of this as I scrambled around piles of bricks every time I walked down the main street of the small - scale , spread - out capital of Trivandrum ( one Front had started a road - widening project , then the other halted work on it ! ) .
There is sometimes literally a “ demo- a - day ” in Trivandrum .
Every group and faction expresses itself without hesitation in Kerala !
The prolific labor unions hold frequent strikes , as when I first visited in 2001 and stood on the narrow , crumbling ferry dock in Fort Kochi , watching the smiling members of the Muslim Boat Worker ’s Union bob in the water , wearing life jackets and holding signs .
They were demonstrating for a new dock .
Not a bad thing .
Sometime between my ’01 visit and my return in the fall of 2007 , they got the new dock , to the benefit of workers and passengers alike .
India has 17 languages , and the one spoken in Kerala is Malayalam ( a palindrome by the way ! ) .
Thus the inhabitants are more accurately called Malayali , rather than “ Keralites . ”
Hindus make up about 60 percent of the population of 35 million , Muslims 20 percent and Christians 20 percent .
While the rest of India is too often plagued by “ communalism ” ( frequently violent conflicts between religious or ethnic groups ) , Kerala is distinctly peaceful .
Mercifully , it has also been spared the horrible terrorist attacks of the past – and present – occurring elsewhere in the country .
To be fair to the rest of India , and the Developing World , Kerala has enjoyed certain advantages , both historic and recent , which have greatly enhanced its social and economic equality .
Kerala has a history of progressive maharajas who instituted free , universal education .
Women have generally had better status , due to an ancient system of matrilineal inheritance of property among some family clans .
British colonialism largely overlooked out - of - the - way Kerala , and the Portuguese , who arrived first , left some positives , such as Catholic - style social service programs and schools .
Today Malayalis often work abroad due to their higher educational and skill levels ( the Persian Gulf states and even the San Jose area have lots ! ) , and the money sent home greatly enhances the living standards of the whole state .
Some Westerners find Kerala ’s particular brand of politics to be rather naïve and “ cute . ”
Certainly I had to laugh when I met someone named “ Stalin ” ( there tends to be a reluctance to let go of an uncritical admiration of Soviet - style communism ) .
Isolated as they are , this can be excused ; besides , Kerala ’s implementation of Marxism and Leninism has been completely democratic and free – i.e. socialism at its best .
Most importantly , nothing can take away from the hard work and remarkable achievements of this verdant land of socially conscious citizens .
China Humbly Launches Serial Production of Stolen Russian Fighter Jets
China has launched the serial production of J - 10 , J - 11 and FC - 1 fighter jets , which are rip - offs of Russia ’s Su-27/30 and MiG - 29 aircraft .
The nation intends to build and sell not less than 1,200 planes at the prices which will be much lower than those of the Russian planes .
China Humbly Launches Serial Production of Stolen Russian Fighter Jets
The report is not the news for the Russian defense industry .
In 2003 , China refused to prolong the license for the production of Su-27CK planes and started working on the construction of its own jet – a copy of the Russian analogue .
China will put competitive pressure on Russia on the market of spare parts too .
Beijing plans to challenge Russia on its traditional defense industry markets and become the maker of inexpensive and efficient air materiel .
Malaysian military officials have already expressed their readiness to cooperate with China at this point .
A senior official of Malaysia ’s Air Force said that his nation was going to purchase a batch of spare parts to Russian fighter jets from China .
Malaysia ’s Royal Air Force has 18 Russian - made Su-30MKM aircraft .
Their technical servicing is the corner stone of Russia ’s entire arms export .
There were a number of serious incidents when Russian manufacturers could not execute their contracts with delivering spare parts to Malaysia .
Malaysia had to refuse from the exploitation of MiG - 29 planes .
The promised technical center in India was never materialized either .
Russia has delivered 76 Su - 27 fighter jets to China since 1992 .
In 1995 Moscow granted a license to Beijing to assemble 200 more of those planes .
As a result , Russia ’s renowned Su - 27 fighter jet was “ cloned ” in China as J - 11 .
Russia was originally delivering spare parts to China , but Beijing refused to prolong the license in 2003 .
By 2008 , China had designed its only analogues of the Russian engine , radar and other equipment .
Chain started the licensed and non-licensed production of analogues of Soviet planes a long time ago .
The nation ’s J - 6 and J - 7 fighters were created on the base of MiG - 10 and MiG - 21 .
H - 6 bombers were copied from Tu - 16 ; Y - 5 , Y - 7 and Y - 8 are rip - offs of Russia ’s An - 2 , An - 24 and An - 12 .
The military cooperation between Russia and China has had a 62 - percent reduction since 2007 .
There are practically no new contracts between the two countries .
The Pentagon traditionally evaluated China ’s defense technologies in its recent report about the level of the nation ’s defense power .
US officials believe that China ’s level of technological development in the defense industry was much lower than that of the United States .
Nevertheless , the Pentagon acknowledged that China ’s defense budget was growing faster than the nation ’s economy .
China is going to start the production of large vessels and develop a new generation of arms and military hardware for its navy .
Priority will be paid to the construction of superships , a new type of submarines , supersonic jets , missiles and other arms .
After 2020 , Beijing plans to build two nuclear - powered aircraft - carriers in addition to two other conventional vessels which are going to be launched in 2015 .
When it happens , China will establish control over the entire western part of the Pacific Ocean .

Dutch police have arrested two people at Amsterdam 's Schiphol airport for allegedly having hidden three kilograms of cocaine in sandwiches , authorities said .
Inspectors found the drugs last week in 33 sandwiches in the luggage of the two , a 30 - year - old man from Suriname and a Dutch woman , aged 56 .
" With the unpacking of the sandwiches ... it transpired that they were not fit for consumption , " a military police statement said .
" They were filled with about 100 grams of cocaine each . "

As America drops its demand for a total freeze on the building of Israeli settlements in the West Bank , angry Palestinians say there is no scope for resuming talks
Illustration by Peter Schrank
FIVE months after Barack Obama went to Cairo and persuaded most of the Arab world , in a ringing declaration of even - handedness , that he would face down Israel in his quest for a Palestinian state , American policy seems to have run into the sand .
The American president 's mediating hand is weaker , his charisma damagingly faded .
From the Palestinian and Arab point of view , his administration — after grandly setting out to force the Jewish state to stop the building of Jewish settlements on Palestinian land as an early token of good faith , intended to bring Israelis and Palestinians back to negotiation — has meekly capitulated to Israel .
The upshot is that hopes for an early resumption of talks between the main protagonists seem to have been dashed .
Indeed , no one seems to know how they can be restarted .
The mood among moderates on both sides is as glum as ever .
Mr Obama 's secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , made matters worse by actually praising Israel 's prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , for promising merely to “ restrain ” Israel 's building rather than stop it altogether , as he was first asked to do .
Previously Mrs Clinton had insisted that stop meant stop .
There should be no “ organic growth ” of existing settlements and no exceptions for projects under way .
Nor did she specifically exempt East Jerusalem , which Palestinians view as their future capital but which many Israelis see as theirs alone .
And she had earlier castigated Israel for demolishing Palestinian houses in the city 's eastern part .
Now , in Israel on October 31st , she changed her tune , seeming to acquiesce in Mr Netanyahu 's refusal to meet those earlier American demands and congratulating the prime minister on his “ unprecedented ” offer to build at a slower rate than before .
Mr Netanyahu 's case is that being “ prepared to adopt a policy of restraint on the existing settlements ” is indeed a concession .
No new settlements would be started , no extra Palestinian land appropriated for expansion .
But some 3,000 housing units already commissioned must , he said , be completed .
Building must go on in East Jerusalem , he has repeatedly said , as it cannot be part of a Palestinian state .
Mrs Clinton later awkwardly backpedalled , assuring the Palestinians that she still considered all settlements “ illegitimate ” , while pleading with them to resume talks .
That seems unlikely .
A storm of abuse raged in the Palestinian and Arab press .
Mr Obama , it was widely deduced , had caved in after his own ratings in Israel had slumped , according to some Israeli polls , to as low as 4 % .
Mahmoud Abbas , the head of the Fatah party who presides over the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank , expressed extreme disappointment — and continued to insist that talks could not resume until there was a full building freeze .
Among Palestinians at large , Mr Abbas has been derided for putting his faith in the new American administration .
Hamas , the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza Strip , the smaller of the two main parts of a future Palestinian state , mocked him for ever thinking that Mr Obama could change American policy towards the Middle East .
Last month he called a general and presidential election for January 24th .
But with opinion polls showing his popularity diving , on November 5th he said he would not stand for re-election .
Hamas , in any event , said it would refuse to take part in the polls .
Mr Abbas , it seems , has been forced to acknowledge that his authority — and his ability to grapple with the Israelis in negotiations if they had resumed — has been eviscerated .
Besides , even if talks did start again , no agreement would stick without the acquiescence of Hamas , which won the last Palestinian election , in 2006 , and is still strong enough to kibosh any deal done without it .
Yet discussions between the two rival groups , under the aegis of the Egyptians , have been stuttering along for more than a year without getting anywhere .
Mr Netanyahu , on the other hand , was cock - a- hoop .
The right - wing and religious ministers who make up the bulk of his coalition government can scarcely believe his luck .
The prime minister is riding high in the Israeli people 's esteem .
Building work is proceeding apace in many of the settlements .
He looks as if he has emerged unscathed from a brush with a hostile American president .
Mr Obama is being criticised , even by Israelis and Americans on the left , for making demands of Mr Netanyahu that he should have known would never be met .
Some say the president should himself fly to Israel to address the Israeli people directly with a game - changing plan of his own .
But no one , least of all in Washington , seems to know what that might be .
Il nostro mondo è permeato di oscuri messaggi massonici ?
Numerose persone sono convinte che la nostra società è guidata da misteriose e segretissime logge massoniche che sfruttano qualsiasi occasione per lanciare messaggi occulti destinati ai propri affiliati o a quelli di altre sette o a condizionare il nostro pensiero in via subliminale .
Prima di esaminare qualcuna di queste curiose convinzioni , cerchiamo di chiarire il senso della parola Massoneria .
Cos’è la Massoneria , e chi sono i Massoni ?
Considerato che le logge massoniche sono un segreto di Pulcinella , al punto che alcune hanno persino il sito Web , vediamo che descrizione danno di sé stesse .
CHI SIAMO – “ La Massoneria è una delle più antiche e secolari società di uomini che hanno cari i valori morali e spirituali …
L’essenziale qualificazione per essere ammessi in Massoneria è di credere nell ’ Essere Supremo , in Dio , senza discriminazioni per il credo religioso professato …
La Massoneria ha tre grandi principii : amore fraterno , carità e verità ” .
Questo riporta il sito Internet della Gran Loggia Regolare degli Antichi , Liberi e Accettati Muratori d’Italia , che – badate bene – è l’ “ Unica Obbedienza Massonica Italiana Riconosciuta dalla Gran Loggia Unita d’Inghilterra ” .
Non molto diversamente , sul sito Grande Oriente d’Italia l eggiamo : “ La Massoneria del Grande Oriente d’Italia di Palazzo Giustiniani è un Ordine iniziatico i cui membri operano per l’elevazione morale e spirituale dell ’ uomo e dell ’umana famiglia .
La natura della Massoneria e delle sue istituzioni è umanitaria , filosofica e morale .
Essa lascia a ciascuno dei suoi membri la scelta e la responsabilità delle proprie opinioni religiose , ma nessuno può essere ammesso in Massoneria se prima non abbia dichiarato esplicitamente di credere nell ’ Essere Supremo ” .
Sono davvero parecchie , in Italia e nel mondo , le logge massoniche presenti sul Web , e ci sono anche numerose riviste , scritte e online , come Pietre .
Come si diventa Massoni ?
Ogni loggia ha le sue regole di ammissione , ma non vengono pubblicate , segno che generalmente l’affiliazione avviene per conoscenza diretta e approvazione da parte degli “ organi sociali ” della setta .
Di certo sappiamo chi non può far parte della Massoneria : le donne .
Il Grande Oriente , ad esempio , spiega : “ I Massoni hanno stima , rispetto e considerazione per le donne .
Tuttavia , essendo la Massoneria l’erede della Tradizione Muratoria operativa , non le ammette nell ’ Ordine ” .
SEGRETI ? – Tanto basta a concludere che i Massoni saranno pure segreti , occulti e potenti… ma sono letteralmente e intrinsecamente sfigati .
A parte i requisiti formali ( credere nell ’ Essere Supremo , prestare giuramento , forse andare in giro con un cero acceso … ) di fatto la Massoneria è un insieme di associazioni , non segrete ( la legge italiana vieta categoricamente le società segrete ) ma sicuramente molto riservate che in fin dei conti si discostano poco da lobby , gruppi di potere e circoli riservati i quali senza tanti fronzoli assolvono direttamente o indirettamente alla funzione di esercitare pressioni , convogliare favori , scambiare cortesie e tutto quello che possiamo immaginare .
A dirla tutta , qualsiasi partito politico , in fondo , è una specie di loggia .
Basta sostituire l‘Essere Supremo con il segretario del partito e il gioco è fatto .
In altre parole , una loggia Massonica può essere innocua come un dopolavoro ferroviario o potente come una lobby di banchieri , non è la forma dell ’associazione a determinarne potere e forza ma il numero , la qualità e la volontà dei suoi associati .
La P2 di Licio Gelli , ad esempio , avrebbe potuto essere tranquillamente costituita nelle forme di un’associazione culturale anziché di una loggia massonica , e non sarebbe stata diversamente potente o pericolosa .
ORGANIGRAMMA – Però l’aria di mistero che circonda la Massoneria , le sue antiche tradizioni e la simbologia inquietante fanno il loro effetto e contribuiscono a mitizzarla e a diffondere teorie che la vogliono capace di controllare i destini dell ’umanità .
I sostenitori di queste teorie puntano il dito sui messaggi simbolici della Massoneria , vere e proprie tracce ( secondo loro ) della sua onnipresenza .
Ecco quindi che il biscione del logo di Canale 5 rappresenta il simbolo massonico del serpente , mentre il numero 5 rappresenta il pentacolo ; la parola Mediaset è l’unione tra Media ( informazione mediatica ) e Set ( Satana ) per cui significa “ informazione di Satana ” ; il triangolo con l’occhio che sovrasta piramide tronca sulla banconota da un dollaro rappresenta l’Essere Supremo massonico ; il Pentagono , simbolo militare degli Stati Uniti , è un evidente richiamo al pentacolo ; un compasso e una squadra disegnati su un fumetto di Topolino dimostrano che la Walt Disney è una casa produttrice massonica ( e del resto , il Gran Mogol delle Giovani Marmotte non è altro che il Gran Maestro delle logge massoniche ) ; persino Prezzemolo , il pupazzo simbolo di Gardaland , sarebbe un perfido drago massonico .
NUMERI ! – La verità è che ciascuno dei loghi citati ha una precisa ragion d’essere , che non c’entra affatto con la Massoneria .
Ad esempio il biscione è un simbolo storico e tradizionale della città di Milano .
La piramide della banconota da un dollaro è fatta di 13 file di mattoni che rappresentano i primi 13 Stati americani , l’occhio iscritto nel triangolo è il simbolo di Dio che benedice la nascita degli Stati Uniti ( c’è infatti l ’iscrizione “ Annuit Coeptis ” che significa appunto questo ) , compassi e squadre appaiono nei fumetti di Walt Disney esattamente quando servono a rappresentare comuni oggetti sui tavoli di disegno e di progettazione , e Set o Seth è un dio egizio che non ha nulla a che spartire con Satana .
In effetti la teoria dei simboli massonici fa un assortito minestrone tra una serie di fatti , miti e leggende molto diversi tra loro : pesca dal mito degli Illuminati , dalla storia della Massoneria , dalle culture dell ’antico Egitto e delle popolazioni latino - americane , dalle religioni , dall ’alchimia , dal sanatismo , dalle crociate , dalla numerologia , dai tarocchi e dall ’ astrologia … riconducendo tutto e tutti a una simbologia massonica di pura fantasia .
Così qualsiasi numero , qualsiasi cifra , qualsiasi figura geometrica e qualsiasi animale finisce per avere un significato massonico .
Il numero 1 è l’essere supremo , il numero 2 rappresenta l’unione tra due triangoli equilateri ossia la stella a sei punte , il numero 3 indica la trinità divina e il triangolo … e così via .
In realtà , se consideriamo la Massoneria dal punto di vista storico e tradizionale , prendendo a riferimento la sua nascita nella forma della Gran Loggia di Inghilterra , nel 1717 , notiamo che il suo simbolo è quello del compasso e della squadra .
Difatti la massoneria affonda le sue radici nelle confraternite dei muratori , ossia di quelle maestranze che lavoravano alla costruzione di edifici , templi , chiese , luoghi di culto .
I muratori si distinguevano in apprendisti , compagni d’arte e maestri .
Si trattava di persone esperte , stimate e rispettate , che custodivano gelosamente i segreti della progettazione edile .
Al compasso e alla squadra si sono affiancati nel tempo pochi altri simboli : la croce cavalleresca , il Sole , la Luna , il triangolo equilatero , le foglie di acacia .
Alcuni sono molto comuni , e pertanto non ha senso accostarli arbitrariamente alla Massoneria , mentre le foglie di acacia sono legate alla tradizione di Hiram , l’architetto che progettò il tempio di Gerusalemme .
Tutto il resto , numeri , teschi e animali compresi , sono forzature e libere interpretazioni che con la Massoneria , antica e moderna , c’entrano poco o nulla .

The Boss : But did he get any training ?
Almost half of UK workers say they have left a job because of bad management .
Forty - nine per cent say that under less drastic circumstances , they would rather take a pay cut than work for someone who made bad decisions .
The findings come in a survey from the Chartered Institute of Management , which says it is launching a campaign to improve standards among bosses .
It wants the government to make developing effective managers a national priority .
Bad accident
But the survey also found unhappiness among managers themselves .
Sixty - eight per cent said they had fallen into the role by chance .
And 40 % admitted they had not wanted the responsibility of managing people at all .
Very few have formal qualifications .
Ruth Spellman , CMI 's chief executive , said : " The figures reveal the depth of the crisis of confidence in UK management . "
She added that such bad management was taking an enormous toll on the UK economy - and on people 's well - being .
The organisation promotes what it calls the art and science of management and is pressing for action from the government to improve Britain 's performance in this area .
It has launched a Manifesto for a Better Managed Britain .
National Grid , the RSPCA and the giant professional services firm , PricewaterhouseCoopers , are among those who have put their names to it .
Some 100 new militia groups have formed since the election of President Barack Obama , says the Southern Poverty Law Center .
In a re-run of the phenomenon seen when President Bill Clinton took office , gun-rights advocates , libertarians , survivalists and others are forming militias as a symbol of their resistance to what they see as an administration that threatens to restrict their right to bear arms and expand government control over the lives of private citizens .

“ The truth is that these groups are popping up like mushrooms after a spring rain , ” said Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center , a social - justice group that has been tracking the rise of militias over the past year .
Potok ’s group put out a report earlier this year raising the alarm about the resurgence of armed militias .
Since then , he told CNN , the group has counted about 100 new groups formed across the country .
“ There really is this terrible fear mixed with fury about the idea that President Obama is somehow leading a socialistic takeover of America , ” Potok said .
A CNN news crew that visited the Southeast Michigan Volunteer Militia found a group that sees itself as a “ deterrent ” to any attempts to restrict gun use , and otherwise sees itself as a place to learn survival skills .
“ Just the simple fact that we are out here and we are doing this , will give somebody pause , will make them think twice , ” said militia member Michael Lackomar , who added that he thought Obama “ could be dangerous for the nation . ”

“ Anytime we get a Democratic president in the office , people become concerned , including myself , and we get a resurgence out here , ” said one militia member , identified only as Brian .
But CNN ’s Jim Acosta points out that gun control “ is unrealistic in many ways , because the Obama administration and the Democrats know that it would be political suicide for them to go after gun control measures .
Even the attorney general has indicated he wo n’t go back to the assault weapons ban enacted in the Clinton administration . ”
In its report from August , the Southern Poverty Law Center pointed out that the most recent wave of militia groups differs slightly from the wave seen under President Clinton in one respect .

“ A key difference this time is that the federal government — the entity that almost the entire radical right views as its primary enemy — is headed by a black man , ” the report states .
“ That , coupled with high levels of non-white immigration and a decline in the percentage of whites overall in America , has helped to racialize the Patriot movement , which in the past was not primarily motivated by race hate . ”

Plans to force internet service providers ( ISPs ) to disconnect suspected illegal downloaders have been roundly rejected in a new YouGov poll , the first time public opinion has been tested on the issue .
Nearly 70 % of those surveyed said someone suspected of illegal downloading should have a right to a trial in court before restrictions on internet use were imposed .
Only 16 % were in favour of automatic curbs based on accusations by copyright holders such as musicians , as is proposed by the business department .
ISPs such as TalkTalk and T - Mobile complain that the government 's proposals expect them to bear the costs of protecting a third party 's rights .
They warn that the move will not work because illegal filesharers can avoid detection by encrypting the traffic , or by hijacking someone else 's IP address or using their Wi -Fi network .
Ministers have insisted that disconnection is a last option and something on which they are consulting .
They are , however , facing a growing backlash , with an all - party motion urging a rethink of the policy on disconnection being led by Tom Watson , the former cabinet office minister responsible for digital inclusion .
Jim Killock , executive director of the Open Rights Group , the organisation that commissioned the YouGov poll , called the government 's plans extremist .
" This poll shows people rely on the internet , and an overwhelming majority think that access should only ever be withdrawn as the result of court action .
" Nearly a third would be much less likely to vote for a party that supports disconnection proposals .
" Clearly Lord Mandelson , the business secretary , is out of step with public opinion and should think again . "
The poll also found that among younger voters , the threat of internet disconnection for online copyright infringement might be a vote - changing issue .
Meanwhile the Conservative shadow culture secretary told the Financial Times a Tory government would scrap the proposed 50 p a month tax on all telephone lines , aimed at raising £ 150 m to £ 175 m a year to support rural broadband projects .
Jeremy
Hunt said it would be scrapped a " soon as possible " after the general election expected in May .
He said the party was also considering reversing government plans to force the BBC to share £ 130 m of the television licence fee with other broadcasters .
The poll found a third of UK citizens ( 31 % ) would be much less likely to vote for a party that supported internet disconnection for infringements .
A further 13 % would be a " little less likely " to vote for that party : in total , 44 % would be less likely to vote for a party that supported such a policy .
Nearly three quarters ( 73 % ) said if they were disconnected , they would find their ability to use vital commercial services , such as shopping and banking , completely disrupted or fairly harmed .
When asked to choose , respondents also supported the right to a trial before punishments are imposed .
A total of 68 % of respondents said that , if the Government 's proposals go ahead , a court should consider the evidence before restrictions were imposed , while only 16 % were in favour of automatic procedures based on accusations , as is currently proposed .
An inquiry into the issue by the all - party parliamentary communications group concluded last week that " much of the problem with illegal sharing of copyrighted material has been caused by the rightsholders , and the music industry in particular , being far too slow in getting their act together and making popular legal alternatives available " .
It added : " We do not believe that disconnecting end users is in the slightest bit consistent with policies that attempt to promote eGovernment , and we recommend that this approach to dealing with illegal filesharing should not be further considered . "
The commons motion tabled by Watson and others calls for users to be given the right to go to court before seeing their access to the internet is ended .
Sion Simon , the minister for the internet , insists the government will not allow arbitrary disconnection .
In an article in the Birmingham Post he explained : " As a first step , where rightsholders identify unlawful activity , ISPs will be obliged to notify accountholders that their account appears to have been used to infringe copyright .
" The infringer ( who may , for instance , be a child ) is very often not the accountholder ( perhaps a parent ) , who will often be quite unaware of what is happening .
For many people , a letter will be all it needs to put an instant stop to the offences .
" ISPs would also be obliged to keep anonymised records of the number of times individual subscribers are identified breaking the law .
" On production of a court order , that data could be used in targeted court action by rightsholders against those responsible for the most damaging breaches of copyright . "
He has stressed that only as a last resort government could require " Ofcom to demand that ISPs take technical measures against those people who repeatedly ignore the law .
That could mean capping the broadband speed or filesize someone can access " .
OAK RIDGE , Tenn . --
The Obama administration 's push to solve the nation 's energy problems , a massive federal program that rivals the Manhattan Project , is spurring a once - in - a- generation shift in U.S. science .

Fake blood , canned screams and plastic skeletons are fun , but if you want a real haunted house , turn to scientists .
To test whether it 's possible to artificially induce paranormal experiences — or , from a different perspective , to technologically summon a spirit — researchers at London 's Goldsmith College and architect Usman Haque designed a scientifically haunted room .
They were inspired by earlier studies in which test subjects reported contact with the phantasmic when exposed to electromagnetic fields and waves of infrasound .
This has n't just taken place in the laboratory .
Odd EMF fields have been recorded at reputedly haunted castles .
And geomagnetic flux caused by shifting tectonic plates reportedly produces surges in poltergeist sightings .
Meanwhile , infrasound waves below the level of human hearing have been linked to visitation .
Of course , ghosts — which 40 percent of the American public claim to believe in — are only one possible explanation .
Perhaps people feel something , and what they call " haunting " is their uniquely sensitive power of perception .
Maybe they 're just suggestible .
So Christopher French , head of Goldsmith 's Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit and editor of the Skeptic magazine , built the haunted room : a white , wood - frame canvas tent 9 feet in diameter , located in the front room of a London row house .
It was entirely featureless , but hidden speakers cast infrasound waves like those measured in supposedly - haunted Coventry Cathedral .
Other speakers projected sound waves that produced an electromagnetic frequency used in laboratory stimulation of paranormal feeling .
Each field 's range was focused in a different part of the room , and some areas were field - free .
If haunting indeed had a wavelength , then people would ostensibly report unusual experiences in the target areas .
Seventy - nine students , friends of Haque and other volunteers entered the room , which operated during the Fall of 2006 .
Their responses were published this May in Cortex — and respond they certainly did .
After spending less than an hour in the room , nearly three - quarters reported having more than three unusual feelings .
Just 6 percent felt nothing .
Among the common sensations were dizziness , tingling , disembodiment , dream - remembrance and " a presence . "
Several felt sexually aroused .
But there was a catch :
The sensations had nothing to do with where they were standing in the room .
When French 's team crunched the numbers , the only statistically significant association appeared in subjects who scored highly on a test of psychological predisposition to the sort of transcendental feelings generally experienced by epileptics with unstable temporal lobes .
There are a few different ways of looking at these results , said French .
" It might be that certain people are wired up in a particular way , and in the right environment , they actually are seeing something that 's objectively there , but others do n't have the ability to see , " he said .
But while that can't be ruled out , he thinks there 's a simpler explanation :
People tend to think about what they 're told to .
Asked to track strange feelings , they started noticing them .
And the participants ' response rates indeed followed what 's predicted by models of suggestible behavior .
" We did manage to build an artificially haunted room , but it was n't related to the environmental factors , but to suggestibility , " said French , who 'd hoped for a firmer result .
An EMF effect would have been exciting , and opened up new lines of investigation , he said .
Of course , French still acknowledged that out - of - lab paranormal experiences could be real , or that his experimental waveforms may have failed to replicate those found naturally .
He hopes to repleat the study using " a very different , very anomalous pattern of EMF activity " he recently recorded in Muncaster Castle , said to be one of the most haunted castles in the United Kingdom .
As for whether he'd felt anything inside the haunted room , French admitted that he had n't spent much time there .
" I went in and out when we were setting it up , but I did n't even make myself a pilot participant , " he said .
" Maybe I should have . "

One idea for motivating organizations to do a better job stemming rampant databreaches : give them tax incentives to do so .

How do we as a nation address the abysmal approach to IT security ?
Ã‚Â
Law makers have been wrestling with the idea of more regulations , but that may not be enough to encourage better security practices .
Ã‚Â
We already have several regulations that have not gotten us closer to the end zone .
Ã‚Â I ’m in favor of tax incentives for companies that demonstrate effective IT security practices , but this can not be done without the development of a well thought out approach .
Ã‚Â Critical success factors must be developed in the form of a concise set of performance measures based on standards .
The Department of Commerce has already charged the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) Computer Security Division to develop a set of special publications and guidelines called Federal Information Security Management Act ( FISMA ) .
These well thought out guidelines such as the Special Publication 800 - 53 provide federal government chief information security officers with a standardized approach to effective IT security .
Ã‚Â
Why ca n’t this same division be charged with creating the same standards for the private sector ?
The language in these guidance documents is so slanted toward the federal government that it ’s difficult to get corporate executives to see their value .
Ã‚Â
Also CEO ’s are cost cutting right now and implementing a program that may increase operating or capital expenses may not be appealing .
Ã‚Â
However , if the adoption of these security standards were tied to a tax incentive , perhaps the CEO would be willing to spend a few dollars to gain this compensation .

Overview
Marfan syndrome is an inherited disorder that affects connective tissue — the fibers that support and anchor your organs and other structures in your body .
Marfan syndrome most commonly affects the heart , eyes , blood vessels and skeleton .
People with Marfan syndrome are usually tall and thin with disproportionately long arms , legs , fingers and toes .
The damage caused by Marfan syndrome can be mild or severe .
If your aorta — the large blood vessel that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body — is affected , the condition can become life - threatening .
Treatment usually includes medications to keep your blood pressure low to reduce the strain on your aorta .
Regular monitoring to check for damage progression is vital .
Many people with Marfan syndrome eventually require preventive surgery to repair the aorta .
Marfan syndrome :
The importance of diagnosis and treatment
Symptoms
Finger length in Marfan syndrome Open pop -up dialog box Close Finger length in Marfan syndrome Finger length in Marfan syndrome People who have Marfan syndrome typically have especially long fingers .
It 's common for their thumbs to extend far beyond the edge of their hands when they make a fist .
Longer arms in Marfan syndrome Open pop-up dialog box Close Longer arms in Marfan syndrome Longer arms in Marfan syndrome
Your doctor may want to measure your arm span if he or she thinks you might have Marfan syndrome , a genetic disorder that causes people to have disproportionately long arms , legs and fingers .
The signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome vary greatly , even among members of the same family .
Some people experience only mild effects , but others develop life - threatening complications .
In most cases , the disease tends to worsen with age .
Marfan syndrome features may include :
Tall and slender build
Disproportionately long arms , legs and fingers
A breastbone that protrudes outward or dips inward
A high , arched palate and crowded teeth
Heart murmurs
Extreme nearsightedness
An abnormally curved spine
Flat feet
When to see a doctor
If you think that you or your child may have Marfan syndrome , talk to your doctor or pediatrician .
If your doctor suspects a problem , you 'll likely be referred to a specialist for further evaluation .
Causes
Marfan syndrome is caused by a defect in the gene that enables your body to produce a protein that helps give connective tissue its elasticity and strength .
Most people with Marfan syndrome inherit the abnormal gene from a parent who has the disorder .
Each child of an affected parent has a 50 - 50 chance of inheriting the defective gene .
In about 25 percent of the people who have Marfan syndrome , the abnormal gene does n't come from either parent .
In these cases , a new mutation develops spontaneously .
Risk factors
Marfan syndrome affects men and women equally and occurs among all races and ethnic groups .
Because it 's a genetic condition , the greatest risk factor for Marfan syndrome is having a parent with the disorder .
Complications
Aneurysm at aortic root Open pop -up dialog box Close Aneurysm at aortic root Aneurysm at aortic root
The pressure of blood leaving your heart can cause the wall of your aorta to bulge out , like a weak spot in a tire .
In people who have Marfan syndrome , this is most likely to happen at the aortic root — where the artery leaves your heart .
Aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection Open pop -up dialog box Close Aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection Aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection
An aortic aneurysm occurs when a weak spot in the wall of your aorta begins to bulge ( left ) .
This can occur anywhere in your aorta .
Having an aneurysm increases the risk of a tear in the lining of the aorta , shown in the image on the right .
Lens dislocation Open pop -up dialog box Close Lens dislocation Lens dislocation Some people who have Marfan syndrome may experience the dislocation of the lens in their eye .
Retinal detachment Open pop -up dialog box Close Retinal detachment Retinal detachment Retinal detachment describes an emergency situation in which a thin layer of tissue ( the retina ) at the back of the eye pulls away from the layer of blood vessels that provides it with oxygen and nutrients .
Retinal detachment is often accompanied by flashes and floaters in your vision .
Scoliosis Open pop -up dialog box Close Scoliosis Scoliosis Viewed from the side , the normal spine takes the form of an elongated S , the upper back bowing outward and the lower back curving slightly inward .
Viewed from behind though , the spine should appear as a straight line from the base of the neck to the tailbone .
Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine .
Chest abnormalities
Open pop -up dialog box Close Chest abnormalities Chest abnormalities Marfan syndrome can interfere with the normal development of the ribs , which can cause the breastbone to either protrude or appear sunken into the chest .
Because Marfan syndrome can affect almost any part of your body , it may cause a wide variety of complications .
Cardiovascular complications
The most dangerous complications of Marfan syndrome involve the heart and blood vessels .
Faulty connective tissue can weaken the aorta — the large artery that arises from the heart and supplies blood to the body .
Aortic aneurysm .
The pressure of blood leaving your heart can cause the wall of your aorta to bulge out , like a weak spot in a tire .

In people who have Marfan syndrome , this is most likely to happen at the aortic root — where the artery leaves your heart .
Aortic dissection .
The wall of the aorta is made up of layers .
Dissection occurs when a small tear in the innermost layer of the aorta 's wall allows blood to squeeze in between the inner and outer layers of the wall .
This can cause severe pain in the chest or back .
An aortic dissection weakens the vessel 's structure and can result in a rupture , which may be fatal .

Valve malformations .
People who have Marfan syndrome can have weaker tissue than normal in their heart valves .
This can produce stretching of the valve tissue and abnormal valve function .
When heart valves do n't work properly , your heart often has to work harder to compensate .
This can eventually lead to heart failure .
Eye complications
Eye complications may include :
Lens dislocation .
The focusing lens within your eye can move out of place if its supporting structures weaken .
The medical term for this problem is ectopia lentis , and it occurs in more than half the people who have Marfan syndrome .

Marfan syndrome also increases the risk of a detachment or tear in the retina , the light - sensitive tissue that lines the back wall of your eye .
Early - onset glaucoma or cataracts .
People who have Marfan syndrome tend to develop these eye problems at a younger age .
Glaucoma causes the pressure within the eye to increase , which can damage the optic nerve .
Cataracts are cloudy areas in the eye 's normally clear lens .
Skeletal complications
Marfan syndrome increases the risk of abnormal curves in the spine , such as scoliosis .
It can also interfere with the normal development of the ribs , which can cause the breastbone to either protrude or appear sunken into the chest .
Foot pain and low back pain are common with Marfan syndrome .
Complications of pregnancy
Marfan syndrome can weaken the walls of the aorta , the main artery that leaves the heart .
During pregnancy , a woman 's heart is pumping more blood than usual , and this can put extra stress on a woman 's aorta — which increases the risk of a deadly dissection or rupture .
A matrix norm on M n is said to be weakly unitarily - invariant if conjugating a matrix by a unitary U does not change the norm .
That is ,
Many commonly - used matrix norms are weakly unitarily - invariant , including the operator norm , Frobenius norm , numerical radius , Ky Fan norms and Schatten p-norms .
One might naturally wonder whether there are matrix norms that satisfy the slightly stronger property of similarity - invariance :
Upon first glance there does n’t seem to be any reason why this should n’t be possible — one can look for simple examples that cause problems , but you ’ll have trouble coming up with a matrix that causes problems if you restrict your attention to “ nice ” ( i.e. , normal ) matrices .
Nevertheless , we have the following lemma , which appeared as Exercise IV.4.1 in [ 1 ] :
Lemma ( No Similarity - Invariant Norm ) .
Let f : M n → R be a function satisfying f( SXS - 1 ) = f ( X ) for all X , S ∈ M n with S invertible .
Then f is not a norm .
If you ’re interested in the ( very short and elementary ) proof of this lemma , see the pdf attached below .
I would be greatly interested in seeing a proof of this fact that relies less on the structure of matrices themselves .
It seems as though there should be a more general result that characterizes when we can and can not find a norm on a given vector space that is invariant with respect to some given subgroup , or some such thing .
Would anyone care to enlighten me ?

Every once in a while , there ’s a news story about somebody who won millions in a lottery and ended up being miserable as a result .
I remember one from a few years ago that sounded like a Shakespearean tragedy .
It was about a Pennsylvania man , William “ Bud ” Post , who won $ 16 million in the state lottery .
After he won , people came out of the woodwork to try to con him and take advantage of him .
His brother hired a hit man to try to kill him , so he could inherit the money .
Over time , Bud ’s money was drained away by bad investments .
He got in trouble with the law for firing a shotgun at a debt collector and eventually went bankrupt .
He died at age 66 , after telling a reporter “ I was much happier when I was broke . ”
Somehow , such stories still do n’t make me NOT want to win the lottery .
Back in high school , I had a similar reaction to reading John Steinbeck ’s famous cautionary novel about sudden wealth , The Pearl .
The title of this tragic novel , first published on November 24 , 1947 , is thought to be inspired by a famous Bible quotation , Matthew 13:45 - 46 .
It ’s from one the parables of Jesus , in which he says :
“ Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man , seeking goodly pearls :
Who , when he had found one pearl of great price , went and sold all that he had , and bought it . ”
In Steinbeck ’s novel , The Pearl , the son of a poor , but relatively happy Mexican pearl diver is stung by a scorpion .
The pearl diver and his wife are too poor to pay a doctor for medical care and fear their son may die .
But then the man finds a large , valuable pearl that makes him “ wealthy . ”
This saves his son ’s life – in the short term .
But it also makes him a target of con men and thieves .
He gets in trouble with the law for killing one of them .
Then , he takes his wife and son on the run to escape retribution .
But in the end they are caught and the son is shot and killed .
The pearl that originally had such great value ends up having a great price .
In a previous post here , I noted that , as a snotty high school kid , I was n’t really moved by Thornton Wilder ’s novel The Bridge of San Luis Rey .
But today , as a 59 - year - old married man , father and grandfather , I am .
I can say the same thing about Steinbeck ’s novel The Pearl .
I definitely appreciate it more now .
But I ’d still kinda like to win the lottery .
UCLA researchers have discovered that a combination of drugs , electrical stimulation and regular exercise can enable paralyzed rats to walk and even run again while supporting their full weight on a treadmill .
Published Nov. 20 in the online edition of Nature Neuroscience , the findings suggest that the regeneration of severed nerve fibers is not required for paraplegic rats to learn to walk again .
The finding may hold implications for human rehabilitation after spinal cord injuries .
" The spinal cord contains nerve circuits that can generate rhythmic activity without input from the brain to drive the hind leg muscles in a way that resembles walking called ' stepping , ' " explained principal investigator Reggie Edgerton , a professor of neurobiology and physiological sciences at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .
" Previous studies have tried to tap into this circuitry to help victims of spinal cord injury , " he added .
" While other researchers have elicited similar leg movements in people with complete spinal injuries , they have not achieved full weight - bearing and sustained stepping as we have in our study . "
Edgerton 's team tested rats with complete spinal injuries that left no voluntary movement in their hind legs .
After setting the paralyzed rats on a moving treadmill belt , the scientists administered drugs that act on the neurotransmitter serotonin and applied low levels of electrical currents to the spinal cord below the point of injury .
The combination of stimulation and sensation derived from the rats ' limbs moving on a treadmill belt triggered the spinal rhythm - generating circuitry and prompted walking motion in the rats ' paralyzed hind legs .
Daily treadmill training over several weeks eventually enabled the rats to regain full weight - bearing walking , including backwards , sideways and at running speed .
However , the injury still interrupted the brain 's connection to the spinal cord - based rhythmic walking circuitry , leaving the rats unable to walk of their own accord .
Neuro - prosthetic devices may bridge human spinal cord injuries to some extent , however , so activating the spinal cord rhythmic circuitry as the UCLA team did may help in rehabilitation after spinal cord injuries .

The first 400 students and 74 faculty members began studies in September , even as construction crews labored to ready the multibillion - dollar campus .
In time , the university will be a small town of 20,000 , cloistered behind three layers of security , in isolated luxury on the banks of the Red Sea .
There will be a yacht club , a golf course , a movie theater ( there are no theaters allowed in the kingdom ) , a town center with fast food and shops  and there will be no rules against men and women working , studying and socializing together .
On campus , women do not have to cover up and wear the baggy black gown , called an abaya , mandatory everywhere else in Saudi Arabia .
Because of this , the university is in a rush , hoping to establish itself as a source of pride  and perhaps revenue  before conservative forces beyond its walls try to rein it in .
Not long after the lavish opening ceremony with thousands of guests and dozens of heads of state , a member of the Saudi Council of Senior Scholars , an official body appointed by the king , criticized the university .
Most of the uproar focused on his condemnation of “ mingling , ” which he called “ a great depravity . ”
But the critic , Sheik Saad al - Shathry , also called for the creation of a religious committee to ensure that the curriculum was consistent with Islam .
King Abdullah promptly , and with great effect , fired Sheik Shathry from the council .
But at the university , some staff members and students said they were wondering how long they had before the king decided , for political expediency , that he must bow to the nation ’s powerful religious forces .
Image Thuwal ’s university operates with its own set of social rules .
And what happens when the king is gone ?
He is 85 , and it appears that the next in line is not Crown Prince Sultan , who has been out of the country for months after cancer treatment , but the interior minister , Prince Naif , whose political base has been the nation ’s conservative religious community .

The FCC - powered feud between AT&T and Google over Google Voice just wo n't end .
In fact , it just keeps getting worse .
A quick recap : Apple and AT&T allegedly banned Google Voice from the iPhone .
Google called it anti-competitive .
The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) started asking questions .
Apple and AT&T denied that they rejected the app .
AT&T and Google started filing unhappy letters with the FCC .
Oh , and then they started sparring over phone sex lines .
Had enough ?
We have , but this battle is not going away anytime soon .
Today , AT&T fired back at Google in a new , 13 page letter outlining what AT&T considers Google 's hypocrisy , highlighting incidents of violating FCC rules and just all around based Google .
AT&T focused on the net neutrality debate , launching immediately into an attack against Google , claiming that it 's following a double - standard for openness .
It immediately rejects Google 's claims that Google Voice blocks calls to rural phones because of sex lines , but then quickly turns to " an even more important question : "
If the Commission is going to be a “ smart cop on the beat preserving a free and open Internet , ” then should n’t its “ beat ” necessarily cover the entire Internet neighborhood , including Google ?
Yes , AT&T wants the FCC to police the entire Internet .
Oh , it does n't end there .
Here 's one of our favorite quotes from the letter , where AT&T directly assaults Google 's " Do n't Be Evil " company motto :
Of course , as a company whose motto is “ do n’t be evil , ” Google should have no objection to abiding by the Internet Policy Statement and other net neutrality principles it advocates with respect to Google Voice and all of the Internet - based services , applications and content that it offers .
And as an agency committed to “ preserving a free and open Internet , ” the Commission should show no hesitation in ensuring its Internet principles are applied evenhandedly to the “ network providers , application and service providers , and content nproviders ” – including Google – who are expressly subject to them today .
As the Wall Street Journal aptly reported , however , the call blocking incident with Google Voice has exposed Google ’s true agenda for adulterating the Internet Policy Statement : “ The Internet giant wants cumbersome [ net neutrality ] rules applied to everyone — except Google . ”
In other words , Google wants the Commission to rig the game in its favor by rewriting the Commission ’s broadband principles to cover only broadband Internet access providers , while giving Google a free pass to discriminate against whatever calls , websites , applications or content it pleases .
If you want to read the whole thing , we 've embedded it below , but you get the point .
AT&T thinks Google is a hypocrite , Google thinks AT&T is anti-competitive , and the FCC is just in the middle of this crossfire .
Here 's the question we 're asking at this point : can someone please end this already ?
There has been lots of rhetoric but no solutions .
Someone needs to step up and make a compromise or a ruling before this thing gets driven any deeper into the mud .
When a runaway hot - air balloon reported to be carrying a six - year - old boy made headlines last week , many were surprised to find out it had all been a hoax .
Admitted the six - year - old boy on live television , “ We did this for a show . ”
Another hot - air balloon by the name of Lindsey Graham also made headlines last week by putting on a show of his own , as the South Carolina Senator held court at a town hall meeting , touting his conservative credentials before an angry crowd that was n’t buying it .
“ They ’re a political fringe group ” Graham said of his critics , “ I ’m the conservative in the room . ”
Is Graham a “ conservative ? ”
Are his detractors merely a political fringe ?
In a headline reading “ Graham aims to tackle ‘ radical ’ views , ” the Greenville News reports :
Political experts say a burgeoning group of right - wing activists long seen as the fringe of the party is growing in influence , fueled by economic fears and populist ire over Washington spending and magnified by the power of the Internet …
Whether they represent a vocal minority or the seeds of a serious election challenge for Graham remains to be seen , though at least one Republican consultant believes the state ’s senior senator has ‘ real problems ’ outside of just a raucous town hall meeting …
‘ If he were running right now , he ’d be in serious trouble , ’ said Dave Woodard , a Clemson University political science professor and former campaign manager for Graham who said he has Upstate polling to support his view .
Woodard ’s findings coincide with another story published in the Wall Street Journal the same day entitled “ Tea - Party Activists Complicate Republican Comeback Strategy ” in which the author Naftali Bendavid notes :
The rise of conservative ‘ tea party ’ activists around the country has created a dilemma for Republicans .
They are breathing life into the party ’s quest to regain power .
But they ’re also waging war on some candidates hand - picked by GOP leaders as the most likely to win… the tea-party movement appears aggressively nonpartisan , much like Ross Perot ’s supporters in 1992 .
‘ The tea -party movement , in my judgment , has proven to be very real , but it ’s precisely the fact that it ’s real that makes it difficult to take advantage of , ’ says Vin Weber , a former Minnesota congressman and now a top Republican strategist .
‘ They do n’t want to be co-opted by the Republican Party .
For his entire career , Graham ’s strategy for victory has been the same as his party ’s — dangle conservative - sounding rhetoric before easily duped constituents during an election year so that Republicans can be returned to Washington to do as much damage as the Democrats .
It ’s refreshing to learn that according to some experts , a growing number of grassroots conservatives are tired of being duped .

Not that establishment Republicans wo n’t stop trying .
Graham is a master of this long - standing Republican hoax , in which politicians will float their own hot - button , hot - air balloons , especially concerning social issues like gay marriage , abortion , and the 2nd amendment , but are actually far more concerned with the much more important business of spending trillions of dollars on needless “ bailouts ” and stimulus packages , even more needless trillions on unnecessary wars , collaborating with the Democrats to expand the domestic welfare state and appointing liberal justices to the Supreme Court .
Said Graham in Greenville last week , “ I ’ll put my record as a pro-life politician against anybody in this country …
I ’m a lifelong NRA member . ”
It should be noted that alleged , staunch pro-lifer and gun rights advocate Graham has done very little to actually overturn Roe vs .
Wade or federal gun laws , but has worked overtime to promote TARP , cap and trade , and amnesty for illegal aliens .
Perhaps an even better example of Graham ’s posturing was his bi-polar treatment of liberal Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor .
Said Graham at first “ When I look at her record , her ideology , I ’m deeply troubled . ”
The Daily Beast even ran the headline “ Lindsey Graham Attacks Sotomayor . ”
A few short weeks later , Graham became the sole Republican on the senate judiciary committee to confirm Sotomayor .
The biggest difference between the so - called “ balloon boy ” and Graham , is that the six - year - old finally admitted his disingenuousness .
Sheriff Jim Alderden , who worked on the runaway balloon case , rightly noted that the boy ’s family had “ put on a very good show for us , and we bought it . ”
Graham and his Republican Party have put on a show for years — millions of conservative voters have bought it — and yet the GOP still refuses to fess up .
Said Graham of his critics without the slightest hint of irony , “ The reason I can stand up there and smile confidently and tell them I disagree is I know that most people are with me . ”
Whether conservatives continue to buy Graham ’s hot - air is something only time will tell .
But rest assured that in the meantime , Lindsey Graham and similar self - described “ conservatives ” will never admit to their hoax — and worse — will insist that the same old Republican show must go on .
The economy and the stock market may be recovering from their swoon , but more homeowners than ever are having trouble making their monthly mortgage payments , according to figures released Thursday .
Nearly one in 10 homeowners with mortgages was at least one payment behind in the third quarter , the Mortgage Bankers Association said in its survey .
That translates into about five million households .
The delinquency figure , and a corresponding rise in the number of those losing their homes to foreclosure , was expected to be bad .
Nevertheless , the figures underlined the level of stress on a large segment of the country , a situation that could snuff out the modest recovery in home prices over the last few months and impede any economic rebound .
Unless foreclosure modification efforts begin succeeding on a permanent basis  which many analysts say they think is unlikely  millions more foreclosed homes will come to market .
As soldiers assembled at a ceremony in Afghanistan to send off the flag - draped casket carrying Canada 's latest fallen soldier , a report has surfaced saying the 23 - year - old tried to stay positive about the mission , even though he quietly considered it pointless .
Pte. Jonathan Couturier was killed when his vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb while returning from a mission in the volatile Panjwaii district , southwest of Kandahar city , on Thursday .
Eleven other soldiers suffered minor injuries in the attack .
Following his death , Couturier 's brother told a Quebec City newspaper that the young soldier considered the mission futile and questioned if anything was being accomplished in the war - torn country .
" That war over there , he found it a bit useless -- that they were wasting their time over there , " Nicolas Couturier told Le Soleil newspaper .
He said his brother always showed mixed emotion about his deployment .
" Let 's just say he would want to ( go ) , then he did n't want to .
When it 's your job , you do n't have a choice .
You accomplish a mission .
But when you leave , inside you , there 's something you hide , ( that ) you do n't really feel like going , " Couturier said .
More than 2,500 Canadian and international soldiers lined the tarmac at the Kandahar Airfield on Friday as Couturier 's casket was carried into a military aircraft bound for Canada .
Brig.- Gen. Jonathan Vance said Thursday that Couturier always had a great sense of humour and was like a " little brother " to some of the older soldiers .
" At the time of his death , Jonathan was returning from an operation designed to protect the population by removing insurgent command and control networks in the Panjwaii district , " said Vance , who is the commander of Task Force Kandahar .
" This meant capturing weapons and IED caches and preventing the movement of insurgents and weaponry into areas where innocent civilians might be harmed . "
Couturier , who was based in Valcartier , Que. , is the second Canadian soldier to be killed by a roadside bomb this week .
Pte. Patrick Lormand , 21 , was killed when his vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device in the Panjwaii district on Sunday .
The region , with its vast fields and farming compounds , has remained a Taliban bastion despite efforts to bring the area under control .
Four soldiers have now died in similar blasts this month .
On Sept. 6 , Maj. Yannick Pepin and Cpl. Jean - Francois
Drouin were also killed by a roadside bomb .
Since 2002 , 131 Canadian soldiers have died while serving in Afghanistan .

The How - To Geek is quickly wearing out the keyboard on his new Windows 7 laptop .
His geeky articles can be found daily here on Lifehacker , How - To Geek , and Twitter .
– Roger Martin is a former diplomat and leading environmentalist .
He is now Chairman of the Optimum Population Trust .
Any views expressed are his own –
I ’ve been an environmental campaigner for 20 years , and can confidently summarise all our problems as ‘ too many people consuming too much stuff . ’
But in all those worthy meetings about all those worthy green projects , I ’ve noticed that everyone talks about the stuff , like consuming less energy rather than providing more ; and no - one talks about the people , the number of consumers .
So in the last 10 years I ’ve been increasingly asking colleagues , ‘ Can you name a single environmental problem that would not be easier to solve with fewer people , and does n’t get harder –- and ultimately impossible –- to solve with ever more ? ’
No -one can .
Optimum Population Trust ( OPT ) Patron Sir David Attenborough recently said he too had never encountered such a problem .
Have you ?
Here ’s an interesting fact .
OPT ’s YouGov poll in June found , to my surprise and delight , that 70 % of us are already aware that population growth here causes serious environmental problems ; half of us would like a smaller UK population ( England is already the most crowded country in Europe ) ; and only 8 % of us actually want any more population growth at all .
So why is everyone so nervous of mentioning the P word ?
Why do our politicians try to “ reassure ” us that they , at least , are not worried by the prospect of our population rising by 20 more Birminghams in our lifetimes ?
OPT speaks , seemingly , for a silent majority .
Another fact — our planet is finite , it cannot support an infinite number of people , so population growth , caused by more births than deaths , will definitely stop one day .
And when it stops , it will be because of either fewer births or more deaths ( or some combination ) .
This will either by human , humane means –- contraception backed by policy which makes it readily available and encourages people to use it — or by the inhumane , natural means through which nature , as Darwin pointed out , has kept every other species in balance with its habitat for the last billion years or so –- famine , disease , and predation ( in our case war ) .
Which would you prefer ?
There is no third alternative of indefinite growth .
There is another fact which is very relevant to the climate change negotiations leading to the Copenhagen Summit in December .
I am trying hard to get at least this fact recognised in the summit communiqué :
All population growth increases the number of both carbon emitters ( much more in rich countries than in poor ) and future victims of climate change ( more in poor countries than rich ) and thus makes all the problems of “ mitigation ” ( reducing emissions ) and “ adaptation ” ( coping with a warmer world ) harder to solve .
Since the Kyoto Agreement was signed only 18 years ago , the number of emitters and victims has risen by some 1.3 billion people , and is still rising by 80 million per year , or 1.5 million per week , or 10,000 per hour .
But no - one ever mentions it .
Do n’t you find that a bit surreal ?
OPT ’s groundbreaking report published last month , “ Fewer Emitters , Lower Emissions , Less Cost ” proved that it makes economic sense , as well as climatic sense , to invest a modest proportion of the climate change funds in meeting the unmet need for family planning .
This would be nearly five times cheaper , per carbon ton saved , than putting it all into fancy green technology .
A person who never existed , and all their descendants for ever , has a carbon footprint of zero .
And finally there ’s the crying , shameful , humanitarian need which we go on ignoring , summarised poignantly by a devout woman , desperate for family planning , reported recently from the Philippines .
She said : “ If the Holy father could only experience for one hour what it ’s like to be six months pregnant in a Manila slum , with seven children to feed and no money to feed them , he would change the doctrine on contraception the very next minute ! ”
There are hundreds of millions like her .
As a UNICEF report said : “ Family planning could bring more benefits to more people at less cost than any other single technology now available to the human race ” .
San Franciscans have six more weeks before they 're required to toss their food scraps into green composting bins or face a fine - but apparently all the trash talk coming out of City Hall is already having an effect .
Just a few months ago , the city Department of the Environment was doling out five to 10 green composting bins a day ; now that number is up to 130 .
The amount of composted material coming out of San Francisco is up 15 percent over the past few months - now totaling 480 tons every day .
" There 's a real sense of urgency now , " said Jared Blumenfeld , director of the Environment Department .
" We never heard from these folks and , suddenly , they 're saying , ' How do you do it ? ' "
Each day , Blumenfeld 's department sends five or six people schooled in composting to apartment buildings , homes and businesses to show people how to get started - and to help them find the space for another bin in this tightly packed city .
In some particularly crowded neighborhoods like Chinatown , homeowners are already banding together to share a bin .
And eco-conscious tenants who were frustrated that their landlords did n't have composting bins on - site are now pointing to the law and getting their way , Blumenfeld said .
" It 's definitely achieving the intended results - people want to make sure they 're in compliance , " he said of the legislation proposed by Mayor Gavin Newsom and passed by the Board of Supervisors in June .
Starting Oct. 21 , every home and business in the city must have three separate color - coded bins for waste : black for trash , blue for recycling - and now green for composting .
Failure to sort trash initially will result in several warnings , but ultimately could lead to fines of up to $ 1,000 in egregious cases .
The city 's requirement - first of its kind in the nation - is part of a larger plan to have San Franciscans sending nothing to landfills or incinerators by 2020 .
City officials say the city currently diverts 72 percent of its waste .
San Franciscans ' food scraps are trucked by the company Recology to Vacaville , where they 're processed for 90 days .
Then , the scraps are sold to farms , vineyards and golf courses around the region .

Kathleen Inman , owner of Olivet Grange Vineyard and Inman Family Wines in Sonoma County , said that lately she has n't been able to buy all the composted material she needs because the facility can't produce it fast enough .
She said she 's excited that San Francisco will soon be producing more food scraps for her vines .
" When people come to my tasting room from San Francisco , I always ask them , ' Do you compost ? ' and if not , I tell them they need to , " she said .
Some of San Francisco 's most avid composters are restaurants .
For 10 years , garbage collection companies have given price breaks to restaurants that compost .
Now about 3,500 of the city 's 4,200 restaurants are participating .
In a circle - of - life kind of way , Inman sells her wine to Charles Phan , owner of Slanted Door and other restaurants in the city .
Phan has been composting for many years , and his restaurants ' scraps may wind up fertilizing Inman 's vines .
Phan said his restaurants divert about 85 percent of their waste away from landfills .
Pamela Mazzola , chef at Boulevard , has been composting at her home for decades - and for several years at her restaurant .
She said everyone " from the busboys up to the CEO " has been trained on sorting trash properly .
" I am the poster child for composting - that 's the only time anyone ever calls me , to talk about compost or garbage , " she said with a laugh .
Bob Shaffer , a composting consultant for Recology and a lifetime composter , said the city 's " extreme step " is essential , even if people elsewhere in the country view it as one of those only - in - San Francisco laws .
" I really believe in this program so if they 're out there on it , they 're out there in the right area , " he said .
Previews of IronPython for .NET 4 have been shipping along with VS 2010 , but that does not mean the two are tied together .
While Microsoft intends to launch IronPython for .NET 4 and Visual Studio 2010 on the same day , they will remain on separate development cycles for the foreseeable future .
IronPython for .NET 4 will be compatible with Python 2.6 .
There are currently no definite plans for supporting Python 3.1 .
Python 3.1 is a significant break from the 2.x series .
In addition to significant improvements over earlier versions of the language , it will remove many features that are no longer considered to be desirable .
This means Python 3.1 is not backwards compatible , which in turns has lead to a slow adoption for Python 3.1 .
The final version of IronPython for .NET 4.0 will support C# ’s new dynamic keyword as well as the improved version of VB ’s implicit late binding .
Editor 's note -
This article originally discussed Python 3.1 support based on information gleaned at an IronPython presentation in Copenhagen .
That information was incorrect , and there is in fact no confirmed date for 3.x compatibility according to the timeline at DevHawk .
The article above has been updated to reflect this
( Newser ) – On the same day it voted to kill Democrats ' hopes for a health bill with a public option , the Senate Finance Committee showed the love to abstinence .
Committee Republicans displayed a little nostalgia for the Bush administration , voting to restore $ 50 million a year in federal funding for abstinence - only education that President Obama has pushed to eliminate .
The 12 - 11 vote came over objections from chairman Max Baucus .
Democrats Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas joined all 10 committee Republicans in voting for Orrin Hatch 's proposal ; the measure will still have to pass the full House and Senate .
Obama had proposed in his 2010 budget to direct money spent on abstinence - only education to broader teen pregnancy - reduction programs .
An alternate measure offered by Baucus to make money available for education on contraception and STDs in addition to abstinence also passed , in a 14 - 9 vote .

Advertisement Israel 's president says Hezbollah has turned Lebanon into a " powder keg " , after an explosion at a member of the group 's house near Tyre on Monday .
Shimon Peres said the Shia Islamist group was preventing the country making peace with Israel and possibly becoming " the Switzerland of the Middle East " .
Earlier , Israel 's army released a video purportedly showing munitions being removed from the house after the blast .
Both Hezbollah and the Lebanese army have said one person was wounded .
The army and UN peacekeepers in southern Lebanon are investigating whether the building might have been used to store weapons in violation of UN Resolution 1701 , which ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah in the summer of 2006 .
Israel said it had proof munitions were removed from the house after the blast More than 1,200 Lebanese , mostly civilians , were killed during the 34 - day conflict , as well as 160 Israelis , most of whom were soldiers .
Residents of the village of Tayr Filsi , which lies on the southern bank of Litani River , say Hezbollah member Abdel Nasser Issa had found a rocket near his home on Monday and was trying to dismantle in his garage when it blew up .
But on Tuesday evening , the Israeli army released video taken by a drone which it said showed several rockets being removed from Mr Issa 's home after the blast .
" Hezbollah has turned Lebanon into a powder keg , " Mr Peres said .
" It 's not Israel that is endangering Lebanon , but rather Hezbollah , just as Hamas is endangering the Palestinians . "
" There is no reason for Israel not to make peace with Lebanon , " he stated , adding that Israel 's neighbour " could be , with the help of this peace , the Switzerland of the Middle East " .
" But it 's clear to everyone who is preventing this . "
Hezbollah MP Hussein Haj Hassan told the Associated Press that Israel was exaggerating the incident " for political interests " .

And this is Steve Ember with the VOA Special English program EXPLORATIONS .
Today we tell about what has happened to Keiko ( KAY - koh ) , the orca whale who appeared in the movie " Free Willy . "
Orcas are the black - and - white mammals sometimes called killer whales .
(( SOUNDS : WHALES SINGING ) )
VOICE ONE :
That is the sound of whales singing .
Ten years ago , a very friendly whale named Keiko was filmed for the movie ¡°Free Willy .¡±
The movie tells about a whale named Willy .
Humans capture and mistreat him .
But the film ends happily as the huge animal escapes into the open ocean .
In real life , however , nobody is sure what the future holds for Keiko .
Like Willy , Keiko was rescued from poor conditions in an animal park .
Since then many people have worked hard to give Keiko a better life .
Expert trainers now are trying to teach him to survive independently in the open ocean .
If he is able to do so , he would be the first orca ever returned to the wild after living most of his life under human control .
VOICE TWO :
Keiko¡¯s story begins with his birth near Iceland in about nineteen - seventy - seven .
He was captured at age two as he swam with his family .
Then he spent three years in an Icelandic ocean center .
Next he was sold to an entertainment center in Niagara Falls , Ontario , Canada .
There he learned to perform for people who paid to see trained sea animals .
But he began to develop skin problems .
His Canadian owners sold Keiko to an amusement park in Mexico City .
Children there loved him .
But the water in his container was too warm for an orca whale .
And , at times , it was not deep enough even to cover the skin on his back .
His skin problems worsened .
He acted sad .
VOICE ONE :
The Warner Brothers production company entered Keiko¡¯s life in nineteen - ninety - two .
The company filmed him for the movie ¡°Free Willy .¡±
The movie told about a young boy who frees a whale called Willy from an entertainment park .
The park is controlled by dishonest and uncaring operators .
Millions of people saw this film and two others about Willy that followed .
Keiko the actor - whale became famous .
Interest in the whale caused an American publication to write about the sad conditions of Keiko¡¯s life in Mexico .
The owner of the Mexican park offered to give Keiko to a better home .
Warner Brothers and an American businessman , Craig McCaw , promised they would create a better home for the popular animal .
(( MUSIC : " AND GOD CREATED GREAT WHALES " ) )
VOICE TWO :
Warner Brothers , Mister McCaw and the Humane Society of the United States took part in a campaign to help Keiko .
More than one - million children joined the effort .
The owner of the Mexican park gave the whale to an organization called the Free Willy / Keiko Foundation .
Mister McCaw and the movie company gave the last money needed to finish a new home for the whale .
A special treatment center and aquarium were built in the northwest American state of Oregon .
When Keiko arrived in this new home , he weighed nine - hundred kilograms less than he should have .
His muscles were in poor condition .
He had broken some of his teeth by biting on the sides of his container in Mexico .
He could hold his breath under water for only a few minutes .
VOICE ONE :
In Oregon , Keiko¡¯s skin growths disappeared .
He learned to hold his breath for twenty minutes .
He also ate live fish for the first time .
Life at the aquarium was good for Keiko .
And Keiko was good for the aquarium in return .
Many people came to see the orca swim and play .
After eighteen months in Oregon , Keiko had gained more than one ton .
The Free Willy / Keiko Foundation decided he was ready for a return to the icy ocean where he was born .
The next step for Keiko was to move him to Iceland .
That took place in September nineteen - ninety - eight after careful scientific planning .
An American Air Force plane flew him to Iceland .
An international environmental organization , Ocean Futures , and the Humane Society paid for the trip .
It cost two - million dollars .
Keiko¡¯s new home was a huge floating cage in Iceland¡¯s Klettsvik ( KLEETS - VEEK ) Bay .
For four years , animal experts worked to prepare Keiko for life in the wild .
VOICE TWO :
The keepers taught him skills he would need to live free .
They developed his ability to catch live fish .
They took him on what they called ¡°walks¡± in the open ocean .
This meant he would leave his floating cage and swim free .
The keepers would watch him from a boat .
During the summer , trainers released Keiko for an extended test .
They wanted to see how well he had learned his lessons .
After being freed , Keiko stayed in open waters for several weeks .
He traveled more than one - thousand - two - hundred kilometers , joining other orcas for a while .
But he did not stay with them .
Instead , he followed boats and appealed for food .
Keiko ended his trip by entering a protected area in Norway called Skaalvik Fjord ( SKOLE - VEEK FEE - ORD ) near the town of Halsa .
( HOLE - zah ) .
VOICE ONE :
Near Halsa , he performed tricks for people who came to see him .
His keepers appealed to people to leave Keiko alone .
But hundreds of people touched him .
Some visitors even rode on his back .
Officials in Norway wanted to cooperate with the keepers .
They wanted to help Keiko become independent .
So the officials restricted crowds from getting near him .
Even after that , however , he swam close to shore .
He responded to a little girl playing music on her harmonica .
A very similar incident had taken place in the movie ¡°Free Willy .¡± Keiko , it seems , wants to be near people .
(( MUSIC : " AND GOD CREATED GREAT WHALES " ) )
VOICE TWO :
The keepers say they still believe Keiko can learn to live in the ocean with other orcas .
They say he is continuing to make progress toward this goal .
Some animal experts say , however , that Keiko never can live completely free in the ocean .
They say he is too old to learn all he needs to know .
VOICE ONE :
As the warmer season ended , Keiko¡¯s trainers decided to lead him to another area , also near Halsa .
His new home protects him from fierce winter storms .
The trainers won the whale¡¯s co-operation by offering him large amounts of herring .
These fish are Keiko¡¯s first choice of food .
His trainers hope he will see more whales in the new home in Taknes ( Tahk - NESS ) Bay .
Only a few farm families live nearby .
There are no crowds to interfere with Keiko¡¯s training .
The trainers say they will continue their attempts to free him once the weather improves .
But even if Keiko never becomes independent , his keepers say he can live the rest of his life in Norway under their care .
VOICE TWO :
Humane Society official Paul Irwin says he sees no reason to move Keiko again .
Mister Irwin points out that Keiko chose where he wanted to be and seems happy there .
He says he thinks Keiko can stay as long as Norway accepts his presence .
Norwegian officials seem happy to do this .
The nation bans hunting or capture of most kinds of whales .
Norway recently resisted a request by an oceanic entertainment center to take Keiko to Miami , Florida .
VOICE ONE :
The Miami Seaquarium wanted to place Keiko with Lolita , its female orca .
But animal rights activists say the Seaquarium water is too warm for orcas .
And they say the container tank is too small .
The activists point to the fact that orcas can swim as many as one - hundred kilometers a day .
They say keeping them in restricted pools of water is cruel .
The activists say captured orcas live less than one - half the normal lifetime of an orca in the ocean .
But some animal experts dispute all these points .
VOICE TWO :
Marilee Menard heads the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums .
Mizz Menard says she is pleased that Keiko is being cared for and watched .
But she regrets that his independence training requires keeping him away from people .
She hopes Keiko¡¯s story has a happy ending .
So do thousands of other people who know about the friendly orca .
They hope that whatever happens to him , Keiko¡¯s life ends as happily as the movie that made him famous .

Ex-president gets standing ovation from paid crowd
During a visit to speak in Canada Tuesday , former president George W. Bush was met with signs , songs , screams and a black - clad Grim Reaper .
And a little applause .
Protesters outside the speech carried signs emblazoned with such phrases as “ Bush is a war criminal , ” “ Bush lied , 1,000s died ” and “ Canada is not Bush Country , ” according to a Canadian press report .
As a crowd mushroomed , police erected metal barricades .

Bush spoke at the Shaw Conference Centre in Edmonton where he led a talk , “ A Conversation with George Bush . ”
Tickets to the event ranged from $ 30 to $ 100 .
All 2,000 tickets sold out , and ticketholders were frisked and made to show their tickets twice upon entrance .
One protester carried a nine - foot tall Grim Reaper tagged with signs that said “ GWB I am your biggest fan ” and “ Thanks for 8 great years . ”
“ For the eight years that George Bush was president I was profoundly ashamed and alarmed and angry and now it seems so unfair that he ’s making a world tour trying to share his ‘ wisdom ’ and make a lot of money , ” Marilyn Gaa , who has both American and Canadian citizenship , told Metro in Calgary .
Bush got a standing ovation from the crowd when he took to the stage inside .

Walking his dog Barney , he said he had “ a plastic bag on one hand , picking up what I had dodged for eight years . ”
Addressing Canadians specifically , he said , “ Canadians have disproportionately shouldered the load … I know the Canadian people are showing great patience in the theatre of war . ”

This is what Obama told Jack Tapper this evening in his interview for World News Tonight .
President Obama said today that Congress needs to change abortion - related language in the health care bill passed by the House of Representatives this weekend that includes tougher restrictions on abortion funding but said there is more work to be done before a final piece of legislation gets to his desk .
I laid out a very simple principle , which is this is a health care bill , not an abortion bill , " Obama said .
" And we 're not looking to change what is the principle that has been in place for a very long time , which is federal dollars are not used to subsidize abortions .
Saying the bill cannot change the status quo , the President said " there are strong feelings on both sides " about an amendment passed on Saturday and added to the legislation , " and what that tells me is that there needs to be some more work before we get to the point where we 're not changing the status quo . "
In an exclusive television interview in the Map Rom of the White House , Obama told ABC News ' Jake Tapper that he was confident that the final legislation will ensure that " neither side feels that it 's being betrayed . "
I want to make sure that the provision that emerges meets that test -- that we are not in some way sneaking in funding for abortions , but , on the other hand , that we 're not restricting women 's insurance choices , " he said .
Also , it appears that some in the GOP Senate are also cool to the Stupak amendment .
http://www.politico.com/...
Senator Alexander :
Senate Republicans seem initially cool to Rep. Bart Stupak ’s ( D - Mich . ) amendment in House health - care overhaul legislation , which essentially blocks the federal funding of abortions .
Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - Tenn . ) , the third - ranking Republican in the body , said abortion is an important issue but " the issues that are going to dominate the health care debate are whether we ’re reducing costs or whether we ’re increasing the costs for most Americans . "
Senator Collins :
TOKYO  Even by Japanese standards  where chief executives routinely make public apologies if their company is in crisis  Akio Toyoda ’s comments on Friday were surprising .
A little more than three months after assuming his post , the president of Toyota , the world ’s biggest automaker , recited a long list of mea culpas to astonished reporters at the Japan National Press Club .
He expressed grief over a fatal crash that led to a recall of 3.8 million cars , regrets about an expected second consecutive annual loss and sorrow over the decision to close the company ’s first American factory in California .
Further , Mr. Toyoda said his company was shamefully unprepared for the global economic crisis that has devastated the auto industry , and is a step away from “ capitulation to irrelevance or death . ”
The company , he added , is “ grasping for salvation . ”
What 's going to happen to Las Vegas if temperatures keep rising ?
The city needs water , after all , and most models predict that the Colorado river will start shriveling up if the West keeps getting hotter — runoff from mountain snowpack could drop anywhere from 5 percent to 25 percent by mid-century .
And that , as Lauren Morello reports , could spell trouble :
For [ Patricia Mulroy , general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority ] , it is Lake Mead that tells the tale of Las Vegas ' water future .
The reservoir 's water level fell this summer to its lowest point since 1965 , when officials diverted Colorado River flows to fill the newly constructed Lake Powell .
By late August , Lake Mead 's elevation hovered at just 1,092 feet above sea level .
Under the complex system of allotments that governs how Colorado River water is distributed to seven U.S. states and Mexico , that leaves just 17 feet of wiggle room before the Southern Nevada Water Authority must , by law , begin seeking alternate sources of water .
If the lake dips to 1,050 feet , the Hoover Dam 's hydroelectric power plant will shut down and Las Vegas will have to begin weaning itself off the river .
It 's hard to tell how soon Lake Mead could hit this ominous milestone .
Already , climate change is proving pricey for Las Vegas : Water authorities now have to spend $ 800 million to build a brand - new intake pipe into Lake Mead , so that they can keep drawing water even after the lake level drops below the existing two intake pipes .
And the state 's looking to extend a new $ 3.5 billion pipe out to rural eastern Nevada .
Those costs are pretty typical :
Two trade groups recently reported that U.S. water utilities will have to spend anywhere from $ 488 billion to $ 944 billion between now and 2050 just to adjust to a shifting climate .
Keep that in mind whenever you hear the argument that it'd be cheaper to adapt to global warming than cut carbon emissions — that 's a potential $ 1 trillion tax just to adapt to changing water patterns .
In any case , there 's also the water - management angle .
Las Vegas has instituted a " wastewater patrol " that goes around looking for houses that are spraying the sidewalk with their sprinkler or violating summer bans on midday watering .
Schemes to recycle gray water from sinks into lawns are becoming popular — as are programs to replace grass with less - thirsty trees and plants .
According to one new study from the University of Colorado , smarter water management could cut the risk that the crucial Western reservoirs of Lake Mead and Lake Powell run dry by one - third .
That does n't totally eliminate the problem , but it certainly helps .

An amateur club of gay football players in Paris said Tuesday its members were victims of homophobia when a team of Muslim players refused to play a match against them .
The Paris Foot Gay team says it received an e-mail Saturday from the Creteil Bebel club canceling a match scheduled for the following day .
" Because of the principles of our team , which is a team of devout Muslims , we can't play against you , " the e-mail said , according to Paris Foot Gay .
The e-mail continued with : " Our convictions are much more important than a simple football match . "
Paris Foot Gay said in a statement that it asked the amateur league to sanction Creteil Bebel .
" This team refused to show up simply so it did n't have to play against homosexuals , " the statement said .
Zahir Belgarbi , identified as a spokesman for Creteil Bebel , told France - Info radio that he apologized if " anyone felt upset or hurt " about the decision .
But " as a Muslim , I have the right to decide not to play against homosexuals because I do n't agree with their ideas , " he said .

Bertrand Meyer and I recently presented an article entitled Methods Need Theory which outlined why we believe that methods need theory .

Our Greatest Challenge : Understanding How To Build Great Software
Do we really know how to develop great software ?
The answer for many people is clearly yes .
But do we know how to communicate and continuously improve the way that we develop software ?
Do we really understand the best way to communicate and share our knowledge ?
The answer , as we saw in the previous article is clearly no !
Do we stand on quicksand or the shoulders of giants ?
Have you ever taken the time to investigate a new method or practice only to find that it is just the re-branding and regurgitation of ideas that you have seen many times before ?
Have you ever got frustrated that every new idea about software development seems to be at the expense and in aggressive competition with everything that has gone before ?
Does it seem to you that following that latest software development trend has become more important than producing great software ?
Have you noticed how in their hurry to forge ahead people seem to throw away the good with the bad ?
Instead of learning from their own experience and building on top of the good things that they do , they heedlessly throw everything away and start again with something they believe is new .
It is as though they have no solid knowledge to stand upon .
This behavior can be seen in the way that many teams carelessly discard expensive process and tool investments , almost before they have even tried them .
Every project adopts a new approach .
Every time someone changes their job they have to learn a new approach before they can get on with the real task at hand .
This is not effective ; people cannot learn from experience as they are forever starting over .
The bottom line is that nothing new ever becomes properly established -- even today after a number of " modern " software development trends the most popular approaches to software development are prescriptive waterfall development or uncontrolled hacking .
As an industry we can not get anything to stick and nothing really seems to change .
But now we 're all Agile surely all our problems are solved ?
The latest trend to sweep the industry is " being agile " .
Now let 's be quite clear here , the " agile " movement has made a very positive contribution to the software industry .
( If you have seen any of our recent presentations at conferences around the world you know that we are both big fans of Agile and supporters of the Agile Manifesto . )
It has reminded us that people matter first and foremost when developing software .
This is not really new but it is important , and it did seem to have been neglected by the previous , more technically oriented , fashions such as object orientation , and programming in Java .
By presenting a set of values the agile manifesto created something robust and resilient that can withstand the waves of change that will be bought on by the next trend .
( A new trend is as sure to follow the agile trend as night is to follow day . )
It 's a shame that the same cannot be said for the many agile methods that have promoted themselves as supporting the agile philosophy .
For a movement that values people over process and tools it has certainly given us a lot of " new " processes and tools .
The majority of these have been effective by putting the team back at the heart of what is done to develop software but in bringing this back into focus , much has been lost or obscured as new terms are introduced for old things , creating the illusion of something completely new .
This constant re-packaging and re-branding of old ideas produces a constant churn in the way that software development teams work .
Rather than re-focusing peoples ' efforts away from wasted work onto the production of quality software all that seems to happen is an arbitrary renaming of the things they do and produce .
Even with something as correct and beneficial as the agile philosophy the underlying message can get lost in the churn and hype .
We are already starting to see a backlash against agile and our fear is that the benefits will be lost as early adopters move onto the next bandwagon and the late majority re-assert their right not to change to something that has obviously gone out of fashion .
All that seems to happen is that we add more buzz - words and conflicting terminology , and we are all becoming deadly tired of all the buzz !
Addressing the challenge : developing a basic theory describing what software engineering actually is
It is clear that we need to stop chasing after fads and easy answers that forever disappoint , and that we need to do it without discouraging innovation and the generation of new ideas .
People need to stop constantly re-packaging and re-branding old ideas just for the sake of it .
Instead they should focus on helping people understand how to build great software .
But how can we facilitate this change in emphasis ?
In our opinion , this theory is right in front of us -- we just need to grab it .
First we should start with all the popular methods , processes , and practices out there and find the " truth " of software engineering .
We can then describe and capture this small set of essential concepts in the form of a minimal , practice independent process -- we call this small set of essential things our " kernel " .
Then using this kernel as our starting point we can analyze existing processes and methods and identify the practices that they contain .
By starting from the kernel we can describe the practices in a way that allows them to be compared and composed .
Now this way of producing our theory is not in its self a theory .
This is something that we have already done .
By studying a number of methods , including XP , Scrum , and the Unified Process our team has identified a kernel with some 20 + elements , things we always do or always produce .
On the surface , there may appear to be large differences in these studied methods and the ways we work with them but under the covers they share the same DNA .
As an example , you can capture requirements with features or with use cases or with user stories , and you can use these requirements without a lifecycle , with the Unified Process lifecycle or even ( as some people still insist upon ) a waterfall lifecycle .
There is definitely a common basis for the many methods , which can be captured in the form of a small , simple set of kernel elements .
Now we are not presumptuous enough to propose that our kernel provides the needed theory .
More and greater minds than ours are needed to do this .
But we would present it as evidence of what can be done and that the theory we need is within reach .
Obama ’s attack on abortion rights
10 November 2009
The Democratic - controlled US House of Representatives has passed a health care bill backed by President Barack Obama that includes a far - reaching attack on abortion rights .
The Affordable Health Care for America
Act includes a measure , the Stupak - Pitts amendment , that would ban insurance companies participating in health care “ exchanges ” from covering abortion procedures in plans subsidized by tax credits and sold to middle - and low - income families ( those earning under $ 88,000 for a family of four ) .
Exceptions would apply only in cases of rape , incest , and if the woman ’s life is in peril .
Abortion coverage would also be banned from the bill ’s so - called “ public option ” — a government - run plan open to those presently not insured .
The reactionary Hyde Amendment of 1976 already outlaws funding for abortion from the Health and Human Services Department budget and from federal Medicaid funds .
Women forced into insurance plans offered through the public option or the private health care exchanges — on pain of fines imposed by the government — would , in the event of need , be forced to pay for the procedure out - of - pocket , or else pay premiums for a separate insurance rider covering only abortion .
When it comes to abortion rights , politicians have little compunction about interfering in the “ free market . ”
Because the amendment targets private insurance plans , the great majority of which currently offer abortion coverage , it would narrow the coverage that insured women already have .
The provision ’s ultimate aim is the de facto prohibition of abortion for low - and even middle - income women .
Among the wealthy layers not affected by the measure are those who passed it — the members of the US Congress , 237 of whom are millionaires , according to a recent study by the Center for Responsive Politics .
Since the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe vs .
Wade proclaimed the constitutional right to abortion , this right has been the object of an unrelenting attack by religious groups and the right wing .
For many working class women , it is already difficult , if not impossible , to afford the procedure or to find clinics that offer it .
Democratic politicians have for many years presented themselves as defenders of abortion rights .
This posture was in keeping with the party ’s embrace of identity politics , including feminism , which it increasingly promoted in tandem with its abandonment of any pretense to social reforms .
Every election cycle , the various liberal and feminist groups mobilize to warn that voters must cast their ballots for Democrats in order to defend abortion .
Only Democratic politicians , the electorate is told , stand between the Republicans and the imposition of religious dogma .
Now , a House of Representatives dominated by liberal Democrats — among them the House Speaker , Nancy Pelosi — with the backing of a Democrat in the White House , has passed the most sweeping attack on abortion rights since Roe vs .
Wade , a measure that goes far beyond the ban on late term abortions enacted during the administration of George W. Bush .
The Affordable Health Care for America Act , including the Stupak amendment , named after its Democratic author , passed the House with the votes of 219 Democrats .
Feminist and reproductive rights organizations were quick to condemn the vote .
The National Organization for Women ( NOW ) called the vote “ the worst blow to women ’s fundamental right to self - determination ” put in place to “ buy a few votes ” for the health bill .
“ It is unconscionable ” that the health bill could be used “ to attack women ’s health and privacy , ” said Nancy Keenan of NARAL Pro-Choice America .
These organizations did not attempt to square the bill ’s passage with their ongoing support of the Democratic Party and Obama .
This inconsistency was most glaring in a John Nichols column on the web site of the Nation .
Hailing the health care bill as “ the most sweeping expansion of health - care coverage ” since Medicare and Medicaid , Nichols conceded that the bill is “ flawed ” by its inclusion of the anti-abortion amendment .
Democratic Congressmen were cowed by the intervention of religious opponents of abortion , particularly the US Conference of Catholic Bishops , which issued “ a series of increasingly stern letters to lawmakers ” demanding that any health bill cut funding for abortion , the New York Times reports .
For his part , Obama “ listened intently ” to similar warnings from Cardinal Seán O’Malley , archbishop of Boston , while the two were attending the funeral of Edward Kennedy in late August .
It is absurd to claim that a bill stripping millions of working - and middle - class women of the ability to obtain an abortion — one dictated by corporate interests and Catholic prelates — are blemishes on otherwise progressive legislation .
In fact , the Stupak amendment is entirely in keeping with a health bill that is not a reform at all , but a sweeping attack on health care for millions of people .
The Stupak anti-abortion amendment exposes the anti-working class and anti-democratic nature of Obama ’s health care overhaul .
Its aim is to contain costs while ensuring the profits of the insurance companies , the pharmaceutical giants and the hospital chains .
It seeks to ration and restrict health care procedures for the working class .
In this sense , depriving working class women of access to abortions is entirely consistent with the general thrust of the bill .
At the same time , the bill leaves millions of people uninsured .
Obama personally intervened to ensure passage of the bill , closing Democratic congressional ranks by telling them , “ No bill can ever contain everything that everybody wants , or please every constituency . ”
Such statements reveal Obama ’s contempt for basic democratic rights .
Obama ’s “ constituency , ” as the bill ’s attack on abortion rights makes clear , is not the American people .
His drive to pass the bill is rooted in a different constituency — the US financial elite , which views health care “ reform ” as the first pass in its long - desired assault on Medicare , Medicaid , and Social Security .
Obama won office on the campaign slogan of “ change . ”
On every major issue , however , he has not only continued , but in fact deepened the right - wing policies of his predecessor — the expansion of war , bank bailouts , the attack on democratic rights , and the unrelenting assault on the working class .
The abortion measure is only the latest demonstration of the real class character of the administration , as well as the utterly decayed state of American liberalism .
Access to abortion is a democratic right .
It is a well - established and safe medical procedure .
The Socialist Equality Party supports unequivocally this right , which can be defended only as part of a socialist system of free health care that makes available to all the great scientific breakthroughs in medicine .

For someone as successful as he's been , Rupert Murdoch sure has no clue what the internet is all about .
Rupert Murdoch says he will remove stories from Google 's search index as a way to encourage people to pay for content online .
In an interview with Sky News Australia , the mogul said that newspapers in his media empire – including the Sun , the Times and the Wall Street Journal – would consider blocking Google entirely once they had enacted plans to charge people for reading their stories on the web .
In recent months , Murdoch his lieutenants have stepped up their war of words with Google , accusing it of " kleptomania " and acting as a " parasite " for including News Corp content in its Google News pages .
But asked why News Corp executives had not chosen to simply remove their websites entirely from Google 's search indexes – a simple technical operation – Murdoch said just such a move was on the cards .
" I think we will , but that 's when we start charging , " he said .
" We have it already with the Wall Street Journal .
We have a wall , but it 's not right to the ceiling .
You can get , usually , the first paragraph from any story - but if you 're not a paying subscriber to WSJ.com all you get is a paragraph and a subscription form . "
The 78 - year - old mogul 's assertion , however , is not actually correct : users who click through to screened WSJ.com articles from Google searches are usually offered the full text of the story without any subscription block .
It is only users who find their way to the story through the Wall Street Journal 's website who are told they must subscribe before they can read further .
Murdoch also wants to legally challenge the doctrine of Fair Use .
Please , please do !
Murdoch added that he did not agree with the idea that search engines fell under " fair use " rules - an argument many aggregator websites use as part of their legal justification for reproducing excerpts of news stories online .
" There 's a doctrine called fair use , which we believe to be challenged in the courts and would bar it altogether ... but we 'll take that slowly . "
Of course , Murdoch will never challenge Fair Use .
Media organizations live in fear of a clear judicial affirmation of Fair Use .
It would make it harder for them to threaten people who engage in accepted Fair Use practices .
Still , it 's amazing how little Murdoch knows about how his products interact with the internet -- that one can get full stories off of WSJ if you just know how , or that Google News does n't actually do anything except provide a headline , part of the first sentence and a link to the source material .
He actually thinks Google news is a " parasite " for linking to his products !
The people who simply just pick up everything and run with it – steal our stories , we say they steal our stories - they just take them , " he said .
" That 's Google , that 's Microsoft , that 's Ask.com , a whole lot of people ... they should n't have had it free all the time , and I think we 've been asleep . "
That level of ignorance of the medium is breathtaking .
With luck , Murdoch will also order Fox News to pull their stuff off Google News and enact a paywall to keep those freeloading communist conservatives from reading the material for free .
It 'd be the fair and balanced things to do .
And I , for one , ca n't wait .
This is Local Motors ' Rally Fighter , the first car openly developed and built using crowd - sourcing .
It will change the auto industry forever .
More importantly for me , with its P - 51 fighter plane - influenced design , it might be the coolest - looking car ever .
Advertisement
The Rally Fighter is the first - ever crowd - sourced " creative commons " - like car , is the culmination of 35,000 designs by 2,900 community members from over 100 countries .
Local Motors , the company behind it , plans to change forever the way cars are designed .
For starters , Local Motors does n't even have a designer for their cars on staff .
Each major system of the vehicle — whether it's the exterior design , interior design or doors — heck , even the name — are developed in an open source development process .
Once there 's enough support for any single design , Local Motors will develop it openly .
That means members of the Local Motors community not only choose which designs are developed , but also , they get to help develop them .
Contests are held for the development and the winner receives a monetary prize based on the importance of the system to developing the overall vehicle .
Thus , door design might receive less money than say , exterior design .
Advertisement
That includes the " where " as well as the what .
Local Motors cars are built in regional micro-factories .
The first vehicle the community chose to build — the Rally Fighter — will be built at both Local Motors ' headquarters in Massachusetts , but also in Arizona , where the car — built for off - road and desert races of the American Southwest — will be primarily used .
Each car the Local Motors community designs will be based on regional desires , tastes and preferences .
Better yet is the manufacturing — it 's done by the soon - to - be - owner .
That 's right , once design and engineering is fully developed the buyer goes to the local Local Motors Micro - Factory and builds it — with a little bit of their help .

Brilliant idea ?
Yes .
Even better is that they 're looking to work with the major automakers and not against them .
The best analogy we 've yet heard for the available market for Local Motors is to imagine a glass mason jar filled with marbles .
The mason jar represents the total potential U.S. automotive marketplace and the marbles represent cars built by major automakers .
You 'd notice that there 's a lot of nooks , crannies and openings in between those marbles .
That represents unfulfilled niche markets that , frankly , just are n't covered by current vehicles available from major automakers because they 're too costly for them to build in small runs .
Rogers wants Local Motors to be the sand that can fill the crevices of that marble - filled mason jar .
That 's what separates Local Motors from a company on the brink of failure like Tesla .
Tesla , with its designs on the mid-size sedan segment , looks to replace major automakers .
Local Motors wants to work with them .
Each Local Motors system competition is looking for the best ideas , not new ideas .
So , for instance , why design an engine from scratch , when , like the Rally Fighter , it can use BMW 's perfectly good M57 3.0 - liter turbo - diesel ?
Why build a tail light from scratch when you can just use a set from a Honda Civic ?
Need a Transmission ?
Use the 6 - speed ZF auto tranny .
Need a door handle ?
The Miata 's works just fine thank you very much .
Go through the car 's galleries in this post and try and spot what 's being used where .
I think you 'll be shocked at how much parts - sharing is going on here .
Advertisement
But that 's just the start .
Imagine a company able to help automakers build the niche products they want to make but just can't because the volume is n't there to make it profitable ?
Are you an automaker with an E85 - burning engine ?
Contract with Local Motors to make a small volume car in the Midwest with its large ethanol production .
Have a compressed natural gas engine ?
Let Local Motors build a car with it in areas with great CNG infrastructure .
There 's a lot of space in between marbles they 're able to fill .
So let 's talk about their first product — the Rally Fighter .
Thanks to the very concept caresque styling , when you walk up to it , you 're immediately struck with how attractive the Rally Fighter looks .
It 's got a look inspired by the historic P - 51 Mustang fighter plane , right down to the pregnant belly bulge in the fuselage .
The lines are swoopy in the right places and it's high up off the ground thanks to 18 " of suspension travel necessary for clearing the big rocks n' boulders you 'll find in Baja and other rally races .
Advertisement
Although the car 's built for both off - road and on , because it 's lacking so many weighty creature comforts , and thanks to the big BMW diesel engine , it 's capable of 36 MPG on the highway or 30 MPG in an off - road setting .
All while pumping out 265 HP and 425 lb- ft of torque to the rear wheels .
It 's 189 inches long , 69.25 inches high in " high ride height mode " and 61.25 inches high in " low ride height mode . "
The wheelbase is 115 inches , track width is 69.5 inches and it has a curb weight estimated between 3,000 and 3,200 lbs .
It seats four and it 's awesome .

We can't wait to drive it .
Do you want one ?
Head over to Local Motors and drop a deposit down now .
The full price will be approximately $ 50,000 and looks to be well worth it .

Recruiters tend to focus on how to examine a candidate to find the perfect match for the job .
After all , that ’s how they ’re paid .
When it ’s your future and you are the candidate , how should you examine a company to determine whether it will be a perfect fit ?
Let ’s look at the other side of the coin and talk about finding the right company , the right culture and the right job .
We might want to include finding the right manager , too .
Most interviews offer a chance for the interviewee to ask questions , and it usually comes at the end of the interview .
“ So , do you have any questions ? ” A candidate should never , ever say “ No . ”
A series of questions should be top of mind , and at least one of them will go unanswered during the interview .
Here are five questions that will surely tell you a lot about your prospective new company .
Five Questions to Help You Determine Culture Fit and Company Environment
• Describe a typical work week here at Acme Widgets and what someone in this position might be doing ?
This is a question that should be asked to multiple interviewers .
Contrasting the opinions of two or three folks will give a clear impression of the job .
Major variances in opinions would be a big red flag .
It could mean the division is disorganized and , most assuredly , signal that communication within the group is suspect .
• How long have you been here , and what keeps you here ?
Again , this question should be posed to multiple interviewers .
This puts the interviewer into a mode of feeling good about the situation .
Because you ’re asking for his opinion , you ’re creating a value proposition that comes from your interest in him .
Look for variances in opinions and statements that can be informative about the environment .
• Tell me how Acme recognizes performance , especially top performance .
After the basic needs are satisfied , a professional finds happiness in the esoteric qualities of a job and a company .
A culture that strives to give recognition to its people is one that realizes that in the hierarchy of needs , money and benefits fall to the bottom and things such as recognition and the opportunity to contribute rise to the top .
If the company has a well - defined recognition plan , it has probably considered the environmental issues that make for a happy place to work .
• What is your idea of a great boss ?
Is your boss one of them ?
This is a very telling question to ask the person who would be your immediate supervisor .
It is most likely that this person will give you the definition of the way he or she manages .
The second question will tell you how happy he or she is , and will alert you as to whether he or she might be gone shortly .
If that is the case , you might find that the replacement is not the kind of person to whom you would enjoy reporting .
• Some folks like to work long hours and around - the - clock to finish a task .
Some like a more structured day , starting in the morning and going home at quitting time .
Which person fits best in this environment ?
Obviously , this one will tell you about the flexibility of the company .
If the second example fits best and you represent the first example , this might not be the place for you .
Most importantly , if the interviewer indicates that the company is flexible enough to support both kinds of people , you know it will be flexible to your needs .
Be prepared to have the table turned and be asked , “ Which one are you ? ”
Remember , there is some risk in asking these questions .
Some managers may take them as signs that you are too inquisitive for their group .
If so , you probably do n’t want to work there anyway .
The key is to never fail to ask questions .
If you are n’t given the opportunity , then ask for it .
This is the best chance you have to really find out what it will be like to work for a company and whether you really want to work there !
I ’d like to hear any other great questions that might be used by some of you out there .
Got any ?
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The United States Supreme Court on Monday turned away a last - ditch appeal to stop the release of documents from sexual abuse lawsuits against priests in a Roman Catholic diocese in Connecticut .
The court refused to hear the appeal from the diocese , in Bridgeport , which has fought for years to prevent the release of the documents .
Last month , the justices refused to grant a delay while they considered the diocese ’s full appeal .
The order was issued without comment .
The New York Times , The Boston Globe , The Washington Post and The Hartford Courant have asked to see the documents .
The Connecticut Supreme Court has ruled that more than 12,000 pages from 23 lawsuits against six priests should be unsealed .
The documents include depositions , affidavits and motions .
The records have been under seal since the diocese settled the cases in 2001 .
They could shed light on how Cardinal Edward M. Egan of New York handled the allegations when he was the bishop of Bridgeport .
This semester I attended “ User Interface Design ” , a class that encouraged us to think critically about the ways in which people interact with systems .
While the course work naturally focused on software interfaces , the principles of good UI design are universal .
Whether you ’re creating a website , a toaster , a lamp or a door handle , intuitive design relies on understanding human psychology .
In my ongoing quest to contextualize everything I learn in terms of video games , I ’d like to explore how the principles of user interface design might be applied to make games more accessible .
In his book The Design of Everyday Things , Donald Norman defines three principles of control design :
Visibility : It Should Be Obvious What a Control Is Used For .
If I press this button , what will happen ?
If I want to unlock the door , which control should I use ?
A system with good visibility allows the user to easily translate goals into actions .
Affordance : It Should Be Obvious How a Control Is Used .
The system should provide “ strong clues to the operation of things ” .
A button affords pushing , a lever affords pulling , etc .
The user should know how to operate a control just by looking at it .
Feedback : It Should Be Obvious When a Control Has Been Used .
Once the user has pressed a button , the system should react in a manner that clearly communicates what has just been accomplished .
If nothing has happened , this fact should also be obvious .
By following these principles , we can create systems where “ the relationships between the user ’s goals , the required actions , and the results are sensible , meaningful and not arbitrary . ”
These principles can be applied to at least two layers of interaction in video games : the interface between the player and his / her agency in the game ( usually an avatar ) and the interface between the avatar and the game world .
While a lot can be said about the latter1 , I ’d like to explore two ways in which these three UI principles can be applied to a game ’s physical interface .
Visibility for Controllers
Because controllers are designed to support a wide range of games , their buttons cannot usually be labelled according to the functionality that they provide .
Instead , buttons are labelled according to letters , numbers and symbols , and the game must provide additional documentation that translates A to “ Jump ” and R1 to “ Shoot ” .
This violates the principle of visibility , and is a source of considerable frustration for inexperienced gamers .
However , some games use clever tricks to get around this problem .
The Legend of Zelda series and Beyond Good & Evil , for instance , facilitate the translation by integrating the documentation right into the player ’s heads - up display .
Since the buttons cannot be physically relabelled , they are instead relabelled on screen .
Not only does this improve visibility by mapping game functions directly to buttons , it also removes ambiguity for context - sensitive actions .
Eric Swain also pointed out the following about controls in Beyond Good & Evil :
It has a simple set of unified controls that transition from one mode to another .
From this point of view , the R2 button is not the run button , but the move faster button .
The hovercraft and the spaceship both use the same buttons to maneuver as Jade does on foot .
On the PS2 , the X button will always be action , the O button will always be item and the Square button will always be attack .
By using these kinds of labelling techniques , game designers can compensate for generic controller design and provide consistent visibility .
New Affordances
While traditional controllers have inherent visibility issues , the next generation of interfaces may circumvent the problem by harnessing new affordances .
Touch screens and motion controls can actually improve visibility by reducing the representational gap between player action and game agency .
Consider a baseball game on the Wii : the player ’s goal is for their avatar to swing at a ball .
A motion controller affords physically imitating the desired action .
Similarly , the touch screens found on the iPhone and Nintendo DS afford pressing directly on the object that the player wants to manipulate .
In both of these cases , “ how the control is used ” is conceptually very close to “ what the control is used for ” .
There is effectively no translation or thought required between “ what ” and “ how ” .
Therefore , the nature of the affordance provides visibility .
I believe that this interface quality goes a long way in explaining the success of these consoles with non-traditional audiences .
To many people , video games are user - unfriendly software .
Improving the UI design by applying proven principles will hopefully go a long way in opening up the medium to new audiences .
Gonzales will assist both Texas Tech University and Angelo State University with recruiting and retaining first generation and underrepresented students .
He will work with Texas Tech ’s Office of Institutional Diversity , Equity and Community Engagement in the planning of a first generation and minority student leadership training and development program .
He also will teach a junior - level seminar course , “ Contemporary Issues in the Executive Branch ” in the Department of Political Science at Texas Tech .
As a visiting professor Gonzales will guest lecture to classes across the campus .
“ I am excited that Alberto Gonzales is bringing his experience to Texas Tech , ” said Kent Hance , Texas Tech University chancellor .
“ His own upbringing in Houston as part of a migrant family with eight children makes him qualified to tell underrepresented Texas students that college is possible .
He will help Texas Tech and ASU prepare our students for success and to be future leaders in the State of Texas and beyond . ”
Lawrence Schovanec , interim dean of Texas Tech ’s College of Arts and Sciences , said , “ Judge Gonzales brings a unique experience to our classroom .
His career in law , government and public service will provide our political science students a rich perspective of the executive branch and issues and challenges facing our nation . ”
Gonzales joined the Air Force after graduating from high school .
From there , he sought and received an appointment to the Air Force Academy .
He transferred to Rice University and majored in political science .
He graduated from Harvard Law School and joined the Houston law firm of Vinson & Elkins .
Then Texas Gov. George Bush recruited him as a special advisor on border issues and relations with Mexico .
Gonzales also served Bush as general counsel .
He was appointed Texas Secretary of State and elected to the Texas Supreme Court .
When Bush was elected president , he again called on Gonzales to serve as White House counsel and later was appointed Attorney General .
El presidente mexicano Felipe Calderón anunció el pasado jueves que la economía mexicana creció al 2,7 por ciento en el tercer trimestre y que esto marcaba el fin de la recesión en México .
Esta declaración llama la atención por dos motivos .
En primer lugar ninguna de las metodologías aceptadas internacionalmente fecha el final de las crisis a partir de un solo dato de crecimiento trimestral ; en segundo lugar ¿cómo puede el presidente afirmar con tanta certeza que el PIB creció 2,7 en el tercer trimestre cuando el calendario oficial del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía ( INEGI ) señala que este dato no se dará a conocer sino hasta las dos de la tarde del próximo 20 de noviembre ?
Este último punto es problemático porque o bien el INEGI filtró al presidente el dato del PIB o algún diligente asesor armó al presidente con un dato muy preliminar y lo impulsó a hacer una declaración muy aventurada .
Es difícil pensar que el INEGI haya filtrado esa cifra , en primer lugar porque es técnicamente muy complicado tener un dato de este naturaleza listo con tanta anticipación ; y en segundo lugar porque justo para evitar este potencial tipo de presiones a partir del año pasado se dotó al INEGI de mayor autonomía , ¡vamos , que para subrayar eso hasta substituyeron en su dirección electrónica el sufijo .gob por el de .org !
Sea cual sea la razón para salir con este número lo que es cierto es que esto no permite señalar que la crisis terminó ; de hecho una buena pregunta es ¿cómo se determina cuándo finaliza una recesión ?
Ésta es una pregunta que ha acompañado a la macroeconomía casi desde su inicio , las metodologías usualmente aceptadas son las desarrolladas por el National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) en Estados Unidos .
El criterio que por mucho tiempo utilizó esta organización ( y que por cierto se sigue manteniendo en muchos países ) es que un periodo de expansión termina cuando hay dos caídas consecutivas en términos reales en la serie desestacionalizada ( es decir la que ajusta asuntos estacionales como navidad , vacaciones de semana santa , etc. ) del Producto Interno Bruto ( PIB ) trimestral .
Dos trimestres , no uno .
De manera simétrica , una recesión terminaría cuando el PIB crece durante dos trimestres consecutivos .
El nuevo criterio es todavía más exigente ( incluye otras variables como el empleo y no sólo el PIB ) y no vale la pena detenerse en él .
Sin embargo , valdría la pena señalar que el NBER es tan cuidadoso y prudente sobre cuándo y cómo señalar el inicio de una crisis que se tomó prácticamente un año para fechar de manera oficial el comienzo de la última recesión ( el comunicado ( en inglés ) vale mucho la pena leerse para entender cómo se determina el ciclo económico ) .
Y entonces , ¿por qué la premura ? , me parece que esto es una muestra más de la actitud innecesariamente optimista que ha estado tomando el gobierno mexicano a lo largo de los meses .
No se me mal interprete , ¡ojalá que la crisis de verdad hubiera terminado !
Pero para aplicar políticas públicas correctas se necesita una buena dosis de realismo .
En fin , ésta no es una actitud inusual , en el año 2002 Daniel Kahneman obtuvo el premio Nobel de economía por mostrar , entre otras cosas , como algunos aspectos psicológicos llevan a los agentes económicos a negarse a ver las situaciones de crisis ; esto es lo que en la literatura económica y psicológica se llama la " aversión a la pérdida " .
Esto del sobreoptimismo y la aversión a la pérdida me hacen recordar a Obelix , el robusto personaje del cómic francés Asterix y Obelix .
Cuando sus amigos en son de broma le recuerdan que está gordito , Obelix responde indignado que eso es falso , lo que pasa dice , " es que soy bajo de pecho " .
Así es , en la versión oficial la economía mexicana ya no está en crisis , sólo es baja de pecho .
What You Can Do To Fight Puppy Mills
Here are some practical things you can do to fight the spread of puppy mills :
Sign A Petition
There are many online petitions you can sign regarding the prevention of puppy mills .
Write A Letter
Write to your local government representative and ask for better enforcement of laws and increased penalties to stop puppy mills .
Join Or Donate
Join an organization dedicated to a national ban on puppy mills and stronger laws for animal protection .
Donations to these organizations will also help end puppy mill cruelty .
And Most Importantly ...
To help eliminate the income that puppy mills continually generate for their owners , follow the guidelines below to be sure you are not purchasing one of their puppies :
Do not - under any circumstances - buy a dog from a pet shop .
Find a reputable breeder .
Check with the better business bureau and ask the breeder for proof of membership in dog-related organizations .
Ask to see documentation on health clearances .
Puppy mills do no spend the time and money screening for potential health problems .
If the dog has been shown , ask to see the show record of the puppy .
Puppy mills do not bother to show their dogs because of the costs involved and because their dogs are typically not sound enough to show , or the dogs are not purebred and , therefore , not recognized by the AKC or CKC .
Ask to see the puppy kennels - obviously a puppy miller does not want you to see where their dogs are raised .
Ask to see both parents of the puppy , or get a contact number for the owner of the sire .
Ask to see the dog 's registration papers .
Ask about their puppy purchase application .
Consider visiting your local animal shelter or rescue organization and adopting a dog in need of a good home .
Remember , the only effective way to free these dogs from the miserable conditions of these below - standard puppy mills is to eliminate the demand for their puppies !
When people stop buying puppies in pet stores , the puppy mills will eventually go out of business , and the misery may finally end .
Report Them !
Report any commercial breeder you believe to be unlicensed .
In addition , contact the nearest Humane Society and / or ASPCA and talk to someone in authority - these groups also have the authority to investigate and stop puppy mills .
Your state or province should have an agency or department that also licenses and monitors breeders .
Generally you can get this information in the government section of your phone book or from listings at your local library .
Although no one person can stop a puppy mill alone , it is very helpful to have as much information as possible when / if you inform officials about one .
First - hand experience is usually the most credible - Have you or someone you know been to this puppy mill ?
Do you know how many animals are there ?
Photos of the puppy mill would also help investigators immensely ( but do n't put yourself in harm 's way to obtain them ) .
Whether you have evidence or not , any reliable tip will be appreciated by the authorities .
Remember - it can take a while to get an investigation going , so you have to be patient .
Sometimes the authorities can move very quickly , but generally it takes time to build their cases and get the evidence and the warrants needed .
If there are abused or neglected animals , the breeders will ultimately be prosecuted under Animal Welfare laws .

Artist Bio
Oliver Vernon was born in New York in 1972 .
He received his BFA from Parsons School of Design in 1995 , and currently lives and works in Brooklyn .
He has exhibited his work in cities all across the United States and internationally .
His work is part of numerous collections , including the Metropolitan Museum of Art .
Visually , Brooklyn based artist Oliver Vernon ’s paintings draw upon an incredibly varied pool of influences , from abstract expressionism , to post pop surrealism and the polished finish of figurative realism .
Formally , his work is about the deconstruction , and hence the necessary reconstruction of visual space .
From this central dichotomy stems many others : logic / illogic , physical / metaphysical , imprisonment / liberation .
His paintings come to us , perhaps , as detailed snapshots of the few primordial milliseconds when the blueprint of the universe was being sculpted from the final throes of chaos .
In this sense , anything goes .
Each painting has it ’s own set of rules , or rather the rules are being bent , broken and ultimately formed within each painting .
Color , form , energy , architecture , good , evil , flesh and machine are lurking , never as physical entities , but as transient archetypes searching out their final places within the framework of the cosmos .
Apart from this macro view , Oliver ’s work can be seen at the micro level as well .
We can view his paintings as representations of how the mind is formed from a foundation of thought , reason , and aesthetics , and how these entities are simultaneously at odds and interconnected .

The odd story of NASA ’s unused wingless escape vehicle for the International Space Station is finally over .
The prototype X - 38 , a 7 - person , unpowered , totally automatic lifeboat , was officially laid to rest at the Strategic Air and Space Museum in Ashland , Nebraska last weekend .
Canceled in 2002 by the Bush administration in an effort to cut some costs from the International Space Station budget , the vehicle could have provided an emergency return route for astronauts on the station .
It would have been docked in space , awaiting the call of duty .
The program got as far as “ drop tests ” during which the vehicles were dropped from B - 52s and piloted to the ground .
One of them is seen above .
After a short freefall , the X38 deployed an enormous parafoil , which allowed it to glide softly to the ground .
The program had cost around $ 510 million and needed around $ 50 million more to complete its flight testing .
At the time , an unnamed engineer told the Houston Chronicle the decision to abandon the project was “ absolutely ridiculous . ”
The shape of the plane ’s body recalls the X - 24 and other lifting body airplanes , including the one designed for the 1969 space opera starring Gene Hackman , Marooned .

Syfy announced a new animated comedy series , Outer Space Astronauts yesterday .
In response , fans at the network 's news site decided that enough was enough , and it was time for an intervention .
Or , at least , lots of insults and complaints .
Advertisement
To be fair , Outer Space Astronauts may not sound like the most exciting new show we 've seen this year — or even the most exciting new show we 've seen from Syfy , considering Warehouse 13 and Stargate Universe 's particular thrills — but we were kind of planning to wait to actually see a trailer at the very least before completely damning it to television hell .
Not so much the readers of Sci-Fi Wire , who saw the announcement of the series as a sign that they had to speak now about what has become of the one - time Sci Fi Channel before it was too late .
Here 're some of the comments :
You have got to be kidding me .
What happened to actual science fiction ?
Oh , wait , you guys are n't the Sci -Fi Channel anymore .
I think the name change was perhaps the most appropriate thing the execs could do for this network .
I think Syfy ( and science fiction in general ) may be heading for a new low .
Of course this program is probably very cheap to produce so I guess we should n't be too surprised .
This has to be some kind of horribly mistimed April Fool 's joke , right ?
There 's no way that they would put something this lame on the air , would they ?
Oh wait , this is SyFy , the home of lame , not Sci - Fi , the home of science fiction .
My mistake , carry on .
BWAHAHAHAHAHA !!!!
THIS is what " SyFy " has sunk to ?!
Pathetic !
Does anyone watch this ridiculous excuse of a cable channel anymore ??
Goodbye , " SyFy " - or whatever the hell you 're calling yourself these days .
Now that SyFy channel is n't using the name Scifi , maybe someone could use the name Scifi Channel and actually show science fiction on it .
Anything is better than the Ghost garbage and the Mutated shark / snake / movie of the week .
why not put on like Babylon 5 , classic BSG or even Logan 's run series .
I think Syfy needs to " imagine greater " .
As in , actually - get - an imagination .
Do you want me to send you a collection of sci - fi books for you to research so you can actually see what real sci- fi is so you can make a show that isnt derivative uninspired rubbish for once ?
I guess not , you 'd have to read through the pages :(
Next week , SyFy ( llis ) will debut a new series combining live action and stunning 1890s visual effects .
It 's about a lump - shaped space ship stuck in a caught in a swirling vortex , headed toward their doom .
Filmed entirely on location in the execute restroom at SyFy ( llis ) .
Let 's take a look at SyFy primetime : Monday - Ghost Whisperer - no SciFi not good when first shown on CBS Tuesday - Scare Tactics - not SciFI not good , not funny , not scary Wednesday - Ghost Hunters - not - oh my god what was that - good , NOT SCIFI Thursday - Bad Movies Friday - SG:U and Sanctuary .
OK , I will give you SCIFI on these , but both are poorly plotted , poorly acted , waste of two hours .
Saturday - Bad Movies - Part 2 Sunday - Bad Movies - Part 3
And now a show that was rejected 2 years ago ... it is official , the SciFi channel is no more and I will not turn it on any more .
It is a shame ... this use to be the place to get good scifi news .. hell they use to talk about books other then vampire or witch books .
What happened to SCIFI ??
Go to the book store and it all vampire .
werewolf , witch , ghost books .
And they ALL have the same theme .. goodlooking moral falls in love with even better looking immoral ... other immorals what to kill / turn / sleep with mortal .
I for one will be turning off my TV and re-reading Clark , Asimov , Bradbury , and a few others .
Goodbye and good luck .
Yet another show I wo n't waste my time on .
What happened here ?
Did Sci
Fi get taken over by Noggin ?
Reminds me of a Wonder Pets Upside Down show Mash up .
I can't believe I even know those shows .
Just shoot me .
Are you guys trying to make the wrestling portion of your line - up look like a good idea ?
Come on , you guys once had original series that were as daring as " Lexx " and smart as " Farscape . "
I know that you guys ran out of franchises to buy from Showtime , but even a tongue - in - cheek fourth revival of " The Outer Limits " would be more appropriate than this .
I think its time to fire the execs again .
Whoever greenlit this PoS " show " is a complete MORON .
Whoever watches Scare Tactics is a MORON .
Whoever watches Ghost Hunters ( or its poorly - concieved spinoffs ) is a MORON .
Whoever wathes ' wrestling ' on SyFy ( or better yet , whoever OKed its timeslot ) needs a beating .
This network has been circling the drain for YEARS .
They cancel Sliders , SG - 1 SG - A ...
They fund GOD AWFUL movies that are rip offs of other bad movies ...
And would n't know good Sci - Fi if it came up and probed them anally .
SG - U had promise , but the Lost In Space meets Battlestar Galactics meets Passions needs to be put out of our misery .
That show if going nowhere at FTL speeds .
Sanctuary .
* sigh * Amanda Tapping is a good actress ..
Loved her in SG - 1. But ..
Sanctuary is a bit meh ...
However its 110 % better then SyFy 's other offerings .
Advertisement
First off , apparently I 'm alone in liking SGU .
Secondly , what the fuck actually happened here ?
Was there some kind of psychic breakdown about Syfy 's direction that all of these people just happened to have at the same time ?
I 'm as much a fan of fanboy rampages as the next person , but this seems like an insane overreaction to the announcement of an admittedly unpromising show .
Is this misdirected Dollhouse grief or something ?
People , just remember : We survived Tripping The Rift .

29 - year - old Eric Williamson says he walked into his kitchen to make coffee .
Since he was home alone , he did n't bother getting dressed .
A woman and a young boy walking outside saw Williamson through the window and called police .
Investigators then arrested Williamson because they believe he wanted people outside to see him naked .
But Williamson says that 's not the case .
He says he should be able to walk around naked in the privacy of his own home .
If convicted , Williamson could face up to a year in jail and a $ 2,000 fine .
A few details of the story are contested by the Peeping - Tomasina neighbor .
For example , she claims it was 8 - something in the morning instead of 5:30 , as Williamson contends thus eliminating the question " What the hell was she doing walking with her young son before dawn ? "
But the above account is basically accurate .
Without commenting on the cultural hysteria and political totalitarianism that leads to a man being arrested for making coffee in his own home , several aspects of the story jump out at me .
-- this is how easy it is to be arrested on a sex - related charge these days .
This is how ridiculous the charges may be .
When someone is on a sex registry , you should always ask " what was the charge ? "
The person could be ' guilty ' of nothing more than public urination in a park or having had sex with a girlfriend who was one year younger .
-- I note that the man 's name is disclosed ; in some stories his photo is included .
I note the woman is given anonymity even though she cannot be considered off - limits -- e.g. as a rape victim .
This gender bias is typical in the reporting of most sex incidents .
-- the arrest is also typically gender biased .
If a man had made the same call about a woman who was naked in her own home , he would have been arrested as a Peeping Tom .
-- the woman was trespassing on Williamson 's property -- she cut across his front yard -- yet no charges were brought against her .
Nor was it asked 1 ) why she looked into the window of a neighbor while committing trespass , or 2 ) did she have to invade his property to see through the window .
-- the charge of indecent exposure requires an intent to be seen , which the arresting policeman cited .
How could Willaimson predict that the woman would trespass at the exact moment he was making coffee in his kitchen ?
-- the arrest came only after the policeman had checked with Commonwealth 's Attorney 's Office ( Va. 's term for D.A. ) and was " given the green light . "
This means the charge did not result from a rogue cop who acted like an idiot .
-- I note Williamson has a 5 - year - old daughter and I assume , since he reportedly lives with roommates , that he is estranged from the mother .
I hope she is a fair , decent human being because this charge alone -- should the mother pursue the matter -- could result in his losing all visitation with his little girl . .
-- the presence of the 7 - year - old child raises this case into the realm of official hysteria -- a place where it is possible that Williamson will be convicted even though he is patently innocent of wrongdoing .
Innocence is no defense against a sex crime when a child is even peripherally involved .

A 21 - year - old man who called 9 - 1 - 1 to report that his marijuana stash had been stolen was arrested earlier this week in Salem , the Marion County Sheriff 's Office announced .
Emergency dispatchers received a call from Calvin Hoover of Salem about 12:52 a.m. Tuesday , said Lt. Sheila Lorance , a sheriff 's spokeswoman .
Hoover was angry , he told the 9 - 1 - 1 operator , because someone had broken into his truck -- parked at the Free Loader Tavern in Salem -- and stolen his Carhartt jacket , $ 400 in cash and less than an ounce of marijuana , Lorance said .
Sheriff 's deputies responded to the tavern and to Hoover 's home , but he could not be found .
About an hour later , Hoover called 9 - 1 - 1 again .
This time he was driving , upset that authorities were not working harder to recover his stuff .
The dispatcher had trouble understanding Hoover , who stopped several times to throw up , Lorance said .
Deputies soon found Hoover 's truck in Southeast Salem .
Hoover was walking about 100 feet away .
He told deputies he was looking for the people who stole his " weed . "
Hoover was arrested on accusations of driving under the influence of intoxicants and took him to the Marion County Jail .
Deputies took a theft report , then warned Hoover , who does not have a medical marijuana card , that reporting the pot theft might not have been such a smart idea .
If he had been caught with the pot , they said , he could have been charged with possession of a controlled substance .

According to a recent article in InformationWeek , the United States Air Force is moving forward in obtaining 2,200 PS3 systems to enhance its already 336 unit strong supercomputer .
The PlayStation 3s will be used at the Air Force Research Laboratory ’s information directorate in Rome , N.Y .
The Air Force also has no plans to drop this method , as moving to an alternative technology hardware would also cause duplication of costs associated with redeveloping the software , military systems , and applications already based on the existing Sony PS3 cluster .
This will become increasingly relevant as the magnitude of applications and supporting hardware infrastructure likely will increase over time .
With respect to cell processors , a single 1U server configured with two 3.2GHz cell processors can cost up to $ 8 K while two Sony PS3s cost approximately $ 600 .
Though a single 3.2 GHz cell processor can deliver over 200 GFLOPS , whereas the Sony PS3 configuration delivers approximately 150 GFLOPS , the approximately tenfold cost difference per GFLOP makes the Sony PS3 the only viable technology for HPC applications .
Sony is the only firm capable of manufacturing the brand of required hardware without the Government experiencing substantial duplication of cost that would not be recoverable through competition among providers of alternative technology .
Using cell processor technology besides the Sony PS3 would cost the Government the equivalent of several years of professional research and engineering effort .

Spiritual Leaders , Freedom Fighters and Saints Among Men – all falsely accused , wrongfully imprisoned and later exonerated as justice eventually prevailed .
Today you can add Bear Stearns hedge fund managers Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin to that list , as the world collectively breathes a sigh of relief .
Detaining these two paragons of virtue for even a second could perhaps be considered the gravest travesty in the history of mankind ’s rule of law .
Never before has such a moral trespass been committed against such virginal innocence .
Any reasonable person , upon hearing of the charges levied against Mr Cioffi and Mr Tannin , must conclude that their actions were entirely altruistic and above reproach .
To wit :
Yes , they blew up $ 1.6 billion worth of other people ’s money – but what ’s $ 1.6 billion in a country with a deficit of $ 14 trillion ?
Yes , they sent emails internally about what a toxic time bomb the fund they managed was while simultaneously encouraging investors to “ hang in there ” – but could n’t we simply interpret this gentle transgression as their own way of spreading cheer to their soon - to - be devastated clients ?
And yes , they were shown to have moved their personal money out of the imploding fund while creating the impression that all was well – but if anything , should not we commend them for making sure they had some personal fortune left with which to provide stimulus to their local Lamborghini dealerships ?
Such generosity and forethought !
Surely , if we look at every fund manager who misleads their public customers while a billion and a half dollars is vaporized , we could find fault with any of them , but the greater crime in doing so would be that we ’d become nitpickers … and no one likes a nitpicker .
And so , from the deserts of Northern Africa to the teeming cities of the Far East , from the store - lined boulevards of western Europe to the rainforests in South America , from the pampered New York suburbs of Westchester to the foreclosure Hoovervilles of inland California , there will be great relief and jubilation at the justice that was done this day .
Many of us do not remember where we were when the Berlin Wall came down , when Man first set foot on the Moon or when Dan Quayle misspelled the word “ Potato ” in that classroom … but we , the global citizenry of earth , shall never forget where we were , whom we were with and what we were doing , when the fateful Not Guilty verdict shone down on the Southern District of New York ’s courtroom like a golden ray projected from the heavens themselves .
We will never forget because it was on this day that we knew with certainty that all was right with the world .
Sleep well , humanity , and take comfort in the fact that these men remain unbesmirched by the petty courts of the land .
God bless us , everyone .
“ Tintin is in trouble ! ” said The Times of India .
Legal trouble , at least .
Congolese accountant Bienvenu Mbutu Mondondo , 41 , is suing the fictional Belgian reporter — or his Belgian publisher , anyways — in French court , asking that the 1929 comic book “ Tintin in the Congo ” be banned as colonial propaganda that spreads “ racism and xenophobia . ”
Mondondo filed the same suit in Belgium two years ago , but nothing came of it .
Small wonder , said Henry Samuel in Britain ’s Daily Telegraph .
Belgium ’s inaction on the suit may not be “ politically motivated , ” as Mondondo claims , but Tintin is “ a rare unifying symbol ” in divided Belgium , which ruled Congo from 1885 to 1960 , sometimes brutally .
“ Postcolonial guilt , ” however , does n’t explain the Brooklyn Public Library ’s decision to pull “ Tintin au Congo ” from its shelves .
The Brooklyn Public Library is facing “ public outcry of censorship ” for putting “ Tintin au Congo ” under lock and key , said Rocco Staino in School Library Journal .
But it ’s not alone .
Borders moved the book from its children ’s section to adult graphic novels in 2007 .
To be fair , the book does depict Africans as “ simple savages prone to cowardice , superstition , and who use phrases like ‘ White mister !
You come save us ! ’ ”
The Brooklyn library says the Tintin book is “ racist and depicts Africans as monkeys , ” said Canadian blogger Raphael Alexander .
But that ’s not how it ’s seen in the Congo , according to photographer Nuala Sawyer , who writes : “ The funny thing is that the Congolese seem to embrace Tintin — I think that interpretations of racism are incredibly different in the Congo than the USA . ”
GNOME 3 is the much talked about next generation GNOME that was supposed to come in Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx .
( Update :
It has been confirmed that GNOME 3 will be delayed till atleast September 2010 .
So it will most probably come with Ubuntu 10.10 not 10.04 . )
It introduces a radical shift from the interface found in GNOME 2.x .
In this article we will give you a quick visual tour of GNOME 3 in Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Kola .
Click on the images to see a larger picture .
You might like to read this article on how to install GNOME 3 Shell on your system .
This is the screen you will be greeted with one you login to the GNOME 3 Shell .
It seems like they have done away with the two panels system that we are used to in GNOME 2.x.
GNOME 3 has just one panel at the top and it consists of five parts .
Starting from left it consist of the following :
The first from the right is Activities .
This consist of the various avtivities that you can do - like launch a new application , search , go to a new location , recently opened files etc .
Just to the right of Activities is where you get the name of the currently active application .
Right at the middle , you get the clock .
To the right of the clock you get the various applets running like the volume control , network manager etc .
And to the extreme right , there is the name of the current user and by clicking on it you get the menu to log out , shut down and some other functions that we will be coming to later .
This is what an application running in GNOME 3 Shell looks like .
Notice that " File Manager " next to Activities in the previous picture has been replaced by Terminal here reflecting the presence of the terminal as the currently active application .
When you click on Activities , this is what you will get .
The size of the desktop has been minimized a bit and a new menu comes up to the left .
Starting from the top , the left panel consist of the following :
A search box using which you can search for both applications and documents .
Applications , which list the your favorite applications just below it .
There is also a More menu you can go to to select other applications .
Then there is the places listing the different commonly accessed folders like Home , Music , Videos , Documents etc .
The last one is the Recent Documents under which recently opened documents come .
To the right , there is the desktop (s ) .
If you have more than one virtual desktop , they all show up here .
We will come to this again later .
We mentioned the More menu next to Applications above .
This is what clicking on it brings up .
Basically it brings up two new panels .
The left one list the various categories of applications and the applications available under that category is listed on the right one .
For this demonstration , I choosed to open Gedit from the menu seen the previous picture .
So here is Gedit above Terminal and as Gedit is the currently active application , Terminal in the panel has been replaced by Gedit .
Now , if you click on Activities again , the two running applications are shown side by side and accompanied by their corresponding icons .
When you hover the cursor over any of them , its name is indicated and by clicking on them you can go to that application .
Also note that at the left panel under Applications , Terminal and Gedit are highlighted , indicating that they are currently running .
If you open more windows in the current desktop , the windows are automatically arranged to give you the best possible view .
Now , what you are seeing here is arguably the coolest thing about GNOME 3 .
Instead of pre-defining the number of virtual desktops as was the case in GNOME 2.x , you can go on dynamically adding new virtual desktops by simply clicking the " + " in the bottom right .
To go to any of the virtual desktops , just click on it .
For this demonstration , I have added three more virtual desktops to make it a total of four virtual desktops .
Notice that the active desktop is indicated by a white border .
If you want to get a window from one desktop to another , just click on that window and drag it to the desired desktop and drop it there just like you drag and drop a file .
And once you have dropped a window into a desktop , it assumes its proper position in that desktop and the desktop from which it came also rearranges the windows to give optimum view .
We have talked about how to add virtual desktops .
To remove virtual desktops , all that you have to do is click on the " - " symbol at the center of each empty virtual desktop .
In this demonstration , I have removed the last two virtual desktops .
Going to the other parts , clicking on the clock drops down a calender .
Further to the right , we have the running applets .
Here , I have the volume applet and the network manager applet running and the volume applet is being indicated by the cursor .
To the extreme right is the name of the current user .
Clicking on it reveals a menu .
Lock Screen , Log Out and Shut Down in the menu does the obvious .
The other options are discussed below .
Clicking on Account Information brings up the window shown above .
It basically shows informations about the current user .
The password can also be changed from here .
Checking Sidebar , reveals a sidebar at the left of the desktop .
The sidebar consist of the time , applications and recent documents .
As of now this seems redundant to me and its utility is not clear when there is the Activities screen .
The sidebar can also be minimized .
This is the Control Center which comes up when you click on System Preferences .
From here you can modify various settings of your system .
The minimized sidebar is also shown in the left .
With this we come to the end of our visual tour of GNOME 3 Shell .

The family of the six - year - old boy who was allegedly trapped in a runaway hot air balloon Thursday has previously posted videos on YouTube that depict a fake terror attack on the U.S. Capitol .
Heene family father Richard , has used the online identity “ The Psyience Detectives , ” to post videos in the past , including one from January 2008 which depicts an alleged terror attack on the U.S. Capitol .
A description filed with the video describes it as only “ An under - budgeted Iraqi terrorist group posing as a defensive driving school failed at launching missiles at the United States Capitol . ”
It shows smoke coming out of a car that appears to be near the U.S. Capitol , accompanied by the sound of rockets or missiles swooshing through the air .
Meanwhile , a man is saying “ What the f*** is that ?
What the f***?
Whoa .
What the f***?
Jesus Christ .
What ’s going on ? ”

The video is tagged “ parody spoof prank ” and posted under the label “ comedy . ”
The Colorado Heene family notified authorities Thursday that they believed their son , Falcon , had climbed into a helium balloon made by father Richard Heene , and taken flight .
As the country watched the boy seem to float away , Colorado rescue workers brought the balloon down to safety , only to discover later on that the boy was hiding in an attic over the family ’s garage .
As Raw Story reported early Friday , Heene ’s son , Falcon , got sick Friday morning while answering questions on two morning shows .
The Heene family ’s “ balloon saga ” has drawn new attention after the child remarked to his father in one interview with CNN Thursday , “ You had said we did this for a show , ” a comment his father quickly disavowed .
After being questioned about the comment , Falcon said he felt sick during an interview with ABC ’s Diane Sawyer .
He was then led offstage .

In an interview with Good Morning America Friday , the local sheriff said that filing a false report — if the family knew that the child was n’t aboard the balloon — could be a misdemeanor offense .
Richard Heene has said the balloon incident was “ Absolutely not , absolutely not ” a hoax .
“ Now I ’m starting to get a little ticked off , ” Heene retorted .
“ What do I have to gain about this .
I ’m not selling anything .
I ’m not advertising anything . ”

Archived internet screen shots show Heene , under the name Psyience Detectives , has previously tried to sell a series of videos called “ Fake or Real ” on the internet .
In another “ Fake or Real ” clip posted on Youtube he says he believes John F. Kennedy Jr. faked his own death and whether Hillary Clinton is a reptile .
In addition , TMZ reported Friday afternoon that the Heene family , which has appeared on the reality show “ Wife Swap , ” has been lobbying production companies and networks including TLC to create a reality show series about their lives .

Larimer County Sheriff Alderden said during a Friday afternoon press conference that he believed Heene family members were sincere in their requests for help .
He noted , however , that Richard Heene called the FAA , then the local television station — apparently thinking they had a helicopter in the air nearby — and 911 about 20 minutes later .
Alderden said he plans to re-interview family members after the child ’s comments on television .

Two days after Italy ’s highest court deemed unconstitutional a law granting Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi immunity from prosecution , Mr. Berlusconi said he had no plans to step down .
“ I am the best prime minister ever , ” he said at a news conference on Friday , Italian news media reported .
“ I am absolutely the politician most persecuted by prosecutors in the entire history of the world throughout the ages . ”
He said that he had spent “ 200 million euros on judges , ” only to be corrected by associates , adding , “ Excuse me , on lawyers . ”
Mr. Berlusconi’s Fininvest holding company was fined $ 1.1 billion last week for bribing judges in the 1990s .
There are three cases pending against him concerning his business dealings .
A new eyewitness who was working in the WTC on 9/11 has gone on record to describe how he heard multiple grenade - like explosions around the basement levels of the north tower , backing up William Rodriguez ' story , the WTC janitor who reported explosions before the first plane hit the tower .
Anthony Saltalamacia was a morning supervisor who managed over a hundred workers in the twin towers .
He worked closely with WTC janitor William Rodriguez , eyewitness to sub - level explosions that occurred before the impact of the first plane in the north tower and representative for many 9/11 victim 's families .
Saltalamacchia was in sub-basement B1 of the North Tower , approximately 1,100 feet below the airplane 's impact point at floors 93 to 98 .
In the the following You Tube video , Saltalamacia discusses what he witnessed on 9/11 .
The account backs up the events previously described by William Rodriguez .
( Article continues below )
" The explosion .... at first we believe it came from the mechanical room and then we heard a series of other explosions that sounded up on the above levels of the building , " said Saltalamacia .
Saltalamacia then discusses how a man ran into the office with his skin hanging off .
William Rodriguez had previously described the same scenario following basement level explosions and it was also seconded by another eyewitness , Kenneth Johannemann , an employee of ABM janitorial services .
" As we 're standing there , more explosions were happening , " said Saltalamacia , before he urged Rodriguez and the other workers to leave the building .
The group left and initially headed towards the lobby before they realized it too had been partially destroyed .
Despite Saltalamacia 's plea to stay out of harm 's way , Rodriguez ran back into the burning building in an attempt to save his colleagues .
" The amount of explosions I heard from 8:46 to the time we got out was so many - at least ten - it was just like multiple explosions to where I felt there was different grenades , that 's what it sounded like , like different grenades being set off in the building , " said Saltalamacia .
" It was one major explosion and then there was different explosions throughout that period of time until we got out , " he added .
Numerous other WTC basement workers , including Felipe David and Salvatore Giambanco , have also gone public with eyewitness testimony concerning massive sub - level explosions that took place before Flight 11 hit the north tower .
WTC construction worker Phillip Morelli was headed for level B - 4 in Tower One [ north tower ] , four stories below ground , when he was thrown to the floor by a violent explosion that coincided with the plane hitting 100 floors above .
15 - year WTC worker Marlene Cruz told Peter Jennings in an interview with ABC News that she was also rocked by an explosion in the basement level of the north tower .
The 9/11 Commission completely ignored the hundreds of survivors , professionals , first responders , firefighters and police who reported numerous secondary explosions at all levels of the twin towers .
In his video interview , Saltalamacia concluded by dismissing the official story of 9/11 as a " cover - up " and urged a proper investigation to find out the truth behind what he and others witnessed that day .

On Aug. 20 , Mexico for a few days became the most enlightened nation in the western hemisphere regarding drug policy .
That day , a law took effect decriminalizing possession of small quantities of drugs .
All drugs .
South of the border you can carry up to 5 grams of marijuana ( four joints ' worth ) , half a gram of cocaine , 50 milligrams of heroin , 40 milligrams of meth and 0.015 milligrams of LSD and be on the safe side of the law .
Five days later , Argentina 's Supreme Court decriminalized drug possession for personal use .
The court unanimously ruled that punishment for drug use contradicts Article 19 of the country 's constitution .
The unnecessary deference to God aside , the article would make a nice 28th amendment to our own Constitution : " The private actions of men which in no way offend public order or morality , nor injure a third party , are only reserved to God and are exempted from the authority of judges . "
In early September , it was the Colombian Supreme Court 's turn .
Drug use " generates in a person problems of addiction and slavery that turn one into a sick , compulsive individual deserving of therapeutic medical treatment instead of a punishment , " the Colombian court ruled .
Brazil and Ecuador may be next with decriminalization .
Meanwhile , the best Americans have come up with is to attempt local reprisals of Jimmy Carter 's timid and failed attempt in 1977 to convince Congress to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana , but still punish possession with fines .
Florida State University 's branch of Students for a Sensible Drug Policy is floating a ballot amendment to decrease marijuana violations in Tallahassee to a ticket and a $ 100 fine for possession of less than 20 grams .
It 's an honorable try , but still a world of good sense away from the better examples down south .
I imagine the reaction to Latin America 's trend might elicit sneers from those who -- prejudices against brown - skinned neighbors notwithstanding -- consider drug - riddled cultures such as Colombia 's and Mexico 's poor references for drug policy .
The sneers are misplaced .
The proportion of drug addicts in the United States is the same as Mexico's and higher than in the rest of Latin America .
When prescription medication is included , Americans are world champions in pill - popping .
And Latin America is mirroring European trends .
Drug possession in most European nations is still officially banned , but rarely punished .
Traffickers are another story , though it begs the question :
If drug possession is legal , why should it be illegal to sell ?
It should n't .
That 's where state regulation steps in , as it does with other drugs and stimulants .
Narcotics , like alcohol , tobacco , coffee and sugar , can be addictive .
But by far more people suffer debilitating illnesses and abbreviated lives from , say , diabetes , which is commonly exacerbated by sugar abuse , than from the hardest drugs .
Punishing drug use is an imposition of outdated morals and state power where only state regulation and taxes should have a role .
A California assemblyman introduced a bill that would levy a $ 50 tax on an ounce of marijuana .
If enacted , the measure would add $ 1.3 billion to California 's coffers .
Florida could immediately diminish its chronic budget problems if it applied the same reasoned reforms to drug laws .
Taxing drugs could raise close to $ 1 billion a year and save more by reforming state drug laws , among the nation 's most draconian .
In Florida , 160,000 people are in prisons and jails .
About one - fifth is imprisoned on drug charges , costing state and county governments $ 640 million a year .
Even if many of the offenders are violent traffickers who should be in prison , hundreds of millions of dollars are wasted on drug - related law enforcement and on imprisoning non-violent individuals who should be in their communities earning money and paying taxes .
Democrats and Republicans have mustered more bipartisanship for the " war on drugs " since Richard Nixon declared it in 1969 than they did for the cold war or than they do for the " war on terror " or the war on universal health insurance .
It 's a $ 50 billion - a - year government business ( approaching $ 1 trillion since 1969 ) , a tax - funded mirror of the drug trade 's lucrative market .
Schools too often dutifully spread misinformation through their " Red Ribbon Week " and " DARE " programs .
Lazy and uncritical news media buddy up to cops for the same old scripts of drug busts and cleaned up neighborhoods .
Cops are grateful for the publicity and job security .
And nothing changes .
Nothing will , either , until the lessons of Latin America and Europe begin to replace America 's ruinous , 40 - year addiction to the war on drugs .

EnergyCitizens.org has a new complaint about the cap - and - trade bill :
It 's a job killer .
In an Oct. 4 , 2009 , ad in the Washington Post , the group said that " 2 million jobs lost " is " another unfortunate truth about Congress 's climate bill . "
The organization , which includes business associations , antitax groups , transportation companies and the American Petroleum Institute , has ramped up criticism of the sweeping cap - and - trade bill since the Senate took up its own version of the legislation in late September .
The House has already passed its version of the bill ; it aims to lower carbon pollution 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 by capping carbon emissions and requiring firms to buy credits , either from the government or from other companies , to continue polluting .
Opponents of cap - and - trade argue that forcing industry to buy pollution credits will ultimately harm consumers and business .
They argue that phasing out fossil fuels will require big job cuts and many employment opportunities will be sent overseas .
EnergyCitizens.org is among the critics .
The group 's ad cites a May 27 study of the House bill written for the National Black Chamber of Commerce , which opposes the bill , by private consulting firm CRA International .
The study predicts that net job losses could be as high as 2.5 million by 2030 and 3 million in 2050 .
CRA International does not dispute the fact that cap - and - trade would create new jobs .
But , " despite the promise of green jobs , ACESA would , if enacted , inevitably depress total employment from baseline levels .
The bill would divert resources now used to produce additional goods and services into the work of obtaining energy from sources that are more costly than fossil fuels . "
That outlook does n't square with what we 've been hearing from lawmakers who support a cap - and - trade plan .
The backers of the House version say the legislation would create " millions of new clean - energy jobs . "
The authors of the Senate version say , " This bill includes targeted protection for our manufacturing sector to ensure that American companies remain competitive and jobs remain here at home .
New programs will train workers to succeed in the new energy economy .
Agriculture and rural America will see a boom in investments in biofuels and alternative energy sources . "
Both bills include funding for worker training and expanded unemployment benefits ; for example , the House bill would provide 156 weeks of benefits , helping to pay for health insurance , job training and employment search assistance to those who lose their jobs as the result of cap - and - trade .
But neither House nor Senate lawmakers working on the legislation have pinned down exactly how many jobs their bills would eliminate and create , so we decided to look at other estimates .
The Center for American Progress , another liberal group , says the bill could create a net increase of about 1.7 million jobs so long as $ 150 billion is dedicated to the clean - energy industry every year .
" These job gains would be enough — on their own — to reduce the unemployment rate in today ’s economy by about one full percentage point , to 8.4 percent from current 9.4 percent levels — even after taking into full account the inevitable job losses in conventional fossil fuel sectors of the U.S. economy as they contract , " according to the June 2009 report .
And a second analysis done by the American Council for an Energy - Efficient Economy , a group that is supporting the bill , estimates that the cap - and - trade bill could create anywhere between 600,000 and 1 million new jobs by 2030 .
Meanwhile , the Congressional Budget Office issued a report in September 2009 that the cap - and - trade plan would have a minor effect on employment in the long - run .
" The small effect on overall employment would mask a significant shift in the composition of employment over time , " according to the report .
" A cap - and - trade program for carbon dioxide emissions would reduce the number of jobs in industries that produce carbon - based energy , use energy intensively in their production processes , or produce products whose use involves energy consumption , because those industries would experience the greatest increases in costs and declines in sales . "
But " the shifts in demand caused by the policy would also create new employment opportunities in some industries . "
Stephen Seidel , vice president for policy analysis and general counsel at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change , said , " Estimating jobs is a very difficult task for the limited modeling tools that we have . "
Jobs will almost certainly be lost and created under a cap - and - trade program , it 's just a matter to what degree , he said .
The CRA International report used in the EnergyCitizens.org ad " falls on the high end . "
So , back to EnergyCitizens.org 's claim that 2 million jobs will be lost under cap - and - trade .
As we 've shown , the job predictions are all over the map .
Supporters of cap - and - trade predict an increase .
CRA , which was hired by an opponent of the proposal , says jobs will be lost .
The independent CBO characterizes it as a wash .
Of all these groups , we 're inclined to believe the CBO , since it is independent .
But we can't rule out the possibility that there could be gains or losses on either end , as the predictions aligned with supporters and opponents suggest .
So we find the ad's claim to be Barely True .
Editor 's note :
This statement was rated Barely True when it was published .
On July 27 , 2011 , we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False .
Cleveland , Ohio ( CNN ) --
The niece of the mayor of Cleveland , Ohio , once lived with murder suspect Anthony Sowell , a registered sex offender charged with murder after the remains of 11 victims were found at his home , a spokeswoman for the mayor said Monday .
Lori Frazier , niece of Mayor Frank Jackson , had a relationship with Sowell that ended two years ago , said Andrea Taylor , a spokeswoman for Jackson 's office .
Taylor said it is unclear whether the relationship was romantic .
" I just want to know why , why he would do this , " Frazier told CNN affiliate WOIO on Friday .
" He took care of me , good care of me .
I never would have thought there were some bodies in the house . "
" I lived with him from 2005 to 2007 and he did n't kill me , but he killed all these girls , " she said .
Sowell , 50 , is facing five counts of aggravated murder , rape , felonious assault and kidnapping in connection with the deaths .
All the victims were African - American women .
All that remains of one of them is a skull , wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the basement .
Sowell served 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to attempted rape in 1989 .
He was released in 2005 .
So far , nine of the 11 victims found at Sowell 's home have been identified .
The latest two were identified Monday by the Cuyahoga County Coroner 's Office , police said .
They are Janice Webb , 49 , and Kim Yvette Smith , who was 43 when last seen .
Both women were from Cleveland .
Webb was last seen on June 3 and was reported missing on August 2 , police said .
Smith was last seen January 1 , but was not reported missing until November 2 .
A grand jury on Monday returned an indictment against Sowell in connection with an alleged assault and rape of a 36 - year - old woman September 22 , Cuyahoga County prosecutors said in a news release .
The investigation into that incident was what led police , armed with a search warrant , to Sowell 's home , where they discovered the bodies late last month .
The alleged victim encountered Sowell while walking in the neighborhood , and he took her back to his home , where he became violent and raped her , prosecutors said .
" While raping her , he strangled her with a cord until she lost consciousness , " the statement said .
" When she regained consciousness , he led her out of the house . "
Sowell faces a charge of attempted murder in the incident , along with two counts of rape , two counts of kidnapping and two counts of felonious assault , authorities said .
Sowell will be arraigned on the new charges Friday , authorities said .
The charges are first - degree felonies except for the assault charges , which are second - degree felonies , prosecutors said .
If convicted , he would face a sentence of up to life in prison .
The investigation into the homicides continues , prosecutor Bill Mason said in the news release .
" Upon completion of the investigation , the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor 's Office working with the Cleveland Police Department will present evidence to the grand jury seeking the death penalty for these heinous murders committed by Sowell . "
Residents of the area near the home said they had noted a smell in the neighborhood , but assumed it was from nearby Ray 's Sausage Company .
Asked whether she had noticed a foul odor , Frazier told WOIO , " Yeah , I smelled stuff , but he always told me that -- at first he said it was his stepmother downstairs .
And then I guess after she left , he told me that it was Ray 's Sausage . "
Frazier said Sowell brought other women to the home when she was not there .
" I love my niece very much and while she has made some decisions that have not been in her best interest , she has my full support , " Jackson said in a written statement .
" As a family , we are extremely fortunate that she was not a victim in this case as she did have a prior relationship with the suspect that ended approximately two years ago .
My focus continues to be on making sure the loved ones of the victims get the attention , closure and justice they deserve and it is my hope that everyone remains committed to that goal . "
Hundreds of Cleveland residents gathered outside the house Sunday night to remember the victims .
" It 's hard , because I want to burn it down , " said Inez Fortson , whose daughter Telacia , 31 and a mother of three children , is among the dead .
Sowell has been placed on a suicide watch at the request of his attorney , according to Sowell 's public defender , Kathleen DeMetz .
A psychiatric evaluation has been ordered but it 's unlikely to happen until after the case goes before a grand jury , the next expected step .
Police recovered the first bodies after they went to Sowell 's home to follow up on a rape accusation .
In a separate incident , neighbors on October 20 reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor .
Firefighters and paramedics responded , and later notified police .
But the woman told officers that she was at the home " partying , " when she fell off the roof , and no charges were filed .
Agents from the FBI 's Behavioral Science Unit are assisting Cleveland police , Cleveland FBI spokesman Scott Wilson has said .
The agents are preparing a profile of Sowell for police , tracing his life and habits , and his DNA will be entered into a national database to see whether it can be linked to any unsolved crimes .
" Our experts tell us it 's likely he 's done this before , " said Frank Figliuzzi , special agent in charge of the FBI 's Cleveland office .
" He 's probably done it elsewhere , and so we need to determine whether or not he 's responsible for other unsolved murders and rapes around the country . "
In addition , the FBI is investigating whether Sowell might be linked to crimes abroad , Figliuzzi said .
" We know , for example , he was a Marine , he was assigned to California , he served in Okinawa , Japan , and we 'll be matching all the facts from these crimes here in Cleveland with the crimes that remain unsolved in our database , and we 'll specifically be looking at those locations where he 's previously lived . "
Allen Sowell , the suspect 's half - brother , told CNN he last saw his brother more than 20 years ago .
Their stepmother , who lived in the house after Anthony Sowell got out of prison , said she knew of nothing odd going on at the time , Allen Sowell said .
The stepmother tried to get Anthony Sowell evicted from the house in 2007 because he was n't paying rent , Allen Sowell said .
Anthony Sowell said he should n't have to pay rent on a house that belonged to his father , who died in 2004 .
Anthony Sowell remained in the house when his stepmother had to be hospitalized in 2007 , his half - brother said .
Allen Sowell said he was aware of his half - brother 's prison record , but " just could n't fathom " the accusations now facing him .
" I did n't think he was in that bad of a mental state , " Allen Sowell said .
" You never think it would happen to your family .
It 's a horrible feeling . "
At 66 , Allen Sowell is 16 years older than his half - brother , and the two did n't meet until Anthony Sowell was 9 .
He added , " He deserves whatever he gets from the justice system . "

Tags : Abortion , Democracy
The majority of Australians support abortion on demand ; the majority of politicians do n’t or , more accurately , wo n’t .
According to a new study in People and Place Journal 57 percent favour a women ’s right to abortion without restrictions .
One third support abortion in specific circumstances .
Only 4 percent oppose abortion on any grounds .
45 percent of Catholics support a women ’s right to choose .
Katharine Betts , the author of the study , told Adele Horin from the Sydney Morning Herald ( Right to choose abortion wins strong support ) that the idea that liberalising abortion laws was a vote loser was wrong .
She said :
Politicians feel it ’s dangerous to try to change the status quo in the face of a very vocal anti-choice lobby .
But they ’re wrong .
Voters are more likely to vote for a pro-choice candidate than an anti-choice candidate .
In both the ACT and Victoria Labor Governments have decriminalised abortion .
In Canberra the Labor Government lost its majority , but the swing was to the Left , with the pro-abortion Greens the main winners .
In Victoria it looks as if the Labor Government will be returned at the next election .
The other States and the Northern Territory still have abortion as a crime , but liberal interpretations of what is a legal or illegal termination have saved politicians from addressing the issue .
Until now .
In Queensland police have charged Tegan Leach with procuring her own abortion ( or miscarriage ) and her partner , Sergei Brennan , with supplying drugs to procure an abortion ( after dropping the charge of attempting to procure an abortion against him ) .
As a consequence , advice to hospitals and clinics cast doubt on the legality of abortions in Queensland .
The Bligh Government amended the criminal law to supposedly reinstate the status quo without decriminalising abortion .
The nominally pro-choice Premier , Anna Bligh , refused to decriminalise abortion because to do so would have split the Government .
Her Deputy , Paul Lucas , is virulently anti-choice .
So the majority clearly support abortion , yet their representatives refuse to express that view by de-criminalising abortion .
As Dr Betts put it they ‘ have been bluffed by anti-choice groups or are cowardly . ’
In a real democracy we ’d throw these unrepresentative swill out today and put in delegates who did what we told them .
But as the ongoing criminality of abortion shows , we live in a guided democratic system at best , where the whole parliamentary process is aimed at reflecting the interests of capital , at times mediated through the wishes of working people .
There have been glimpses in the past of a truly democratic society – the Paris Commune in 1871 , the short lived Russian Revolutions of 1905 and 1917 , Shanghai in 1927 , Spain in 36 - 39 , Hungary 1956 , Portugal 1974 , Iran 1979 and Poland 1980 - 81 to name a few .
In Russia for example the workers ’ and peasants ’ government legalised abortion .
We in Australia have yet to win the legal status the Bolsheviks implemented 92 years ago .
Short of revolution , how can we win abortion rights ?
The gains of the past that women won through mass radical action give us a pointer .
In those days there was a women ’s liberation movement .
Much is still needed – free and accessible child care , equal wages , long term fully paid maternity leave , free contraception , abortion on demand …
Electing the likes of nominal pro-choice Queensland premier Anna Bligh or having Julia Gillard as Deputy Prime Minister is n’t going to deliver any of that .
Only a mass movement from below can force the do - nothings from Labor to legalise abortion .
From Washington Journal Oct. 25 , 2009 .
As much as I hate to say I agree with Newt Gingrich about anything , I 'd say he 's right here .
Gingrich is asked what he thinks about E.J. Dionnne 's article
Is there room in the GOP for moderates ?.
Gingrich says there is and disagrees with Dick Armey who has injected himself into the NY - 23 special election and endorsed Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman over Republican Dede Scozzafava .
It appears not everyone agrees with Joe Scarborough and Dan Senor that this Republican food fight is good for the party .
Dust samples collected by high - flying aircraft in the upper atmosphere have yielded an unexpectedly rich trove of relics from the ancient cosmos , report scientists from the Carnegie Institution .
The stratospheric dust includes minute grains that likely formed inside stars that lived and died long before the birth of our sun , as well as material from molecular clouds in interstellar space .
This " ultra - primitive " material likely wafted into the atmosphere after the Earth passed through the trail of an Earth - crossing comet in 2003 , giving scientists a rare opportunity to study cometary dust in the laboratory .
At high altitudes , most dust in the atmosphere comes from space , rather than the Earth 's surface .
Thousands of tons of interplanetary dust particles ( IDPs ) enter the atmosphere each year .
" We 've known that many IDPs come from comets , but we 've never been able to definitively tie a single IDP to a particular comet , " says study coauthor Larry Nittler , of Carnegie 's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism .
" The only known cometary samples we 've studied in the laboratory are those that were returned from comet 81P / Wild 2 by the Stardust mission . "
The Stardust mission used a NASA - launched spacecraft to collect samples of comet dust , returning to Earth in 2006 .
Comets are thought to be repositories of primitive , unaltered matter left over from the formation of the solar system .
Material held for eons in cometary ice has largely escaped the heating and chemical processing that has affected other bodies , such as the planets .
However , the Wild 2 dust returned by the Stardust mission included more altered material than expected , indicating that not all cometary material is highly primitive .
The IDPs used in the current study were collected by NASA aircraft in April 2003 , after the Earth passed through the dust trail of comet Grigg - Skjellerup .
The research team , which included Carnegie scientists Nittler , Henner Busemann ( now at the University of Manchester , U.K. ) , Ann Nguyen , George Cody , and seven other colleagues , analyzed a sub-sample of the dust to determine the chemical , isotopic and microstructural composition of its grains .
The results are reported on - line in Earth and Planetary Science Letters .
" What we found is that they are very different from typical IDPs " says Nittler .
" They are more primitive , with higher abundances of material whose origin predates the formation of the solar system . "
The distinctiveness of the particles , plus the timing of their collection after the Earth 's passing through the comet trail , point to their source being the Grigg - Skjellerup comet .
" This is exciting because it allows us to compare on a microscopic scale in the laboratory dust particles from different comets , " says Nittler .
" We can use them as tracers for different processes that occurred in the solar system four - and - a - half billion years ago . "
The biggest surprise for the researchers was the abundance of so - called presolar grains in the dust sample .
Presolar grains are tiny dust particles that formed in previous generations of stars and in supernova explosions before the formation of the solar system .
Afterwards , they were trapped in our solar system as it was forming and are found today in meteorites and in IDPs .
Presolar grains are identified by having extremely unusual isotopic compositions compared to anything else in the solar system .
But presolar grains are generally extremely rare , with abundances of just a few parts per million in even the most primitive meteorites , and a few hundred parts per million in IDPs .
" In the IDPs associated with comet Grigg - Skjellerup they are up to the percent level , " says Nittler .
" This is tens of times higher abundances than we see in other primitive materials . "
Also surprising is the comparison with the samples from Wild 2 collected by the Stardust mission .
" Our samples seem to be much more primitive , much less processed , than the samples from Wild 2 , " says Nittler , " which might indicate that there is a huge diversity in the degree of processing of materials in different comets . "
In the September issue of the journal Behavior Therapy , University of Vermont psychologist Kelly Rohan presents the first published research study of the long - term effects of different treatments for seasonal affective disorder ( SAD ) , a form of severe depression that occurs annually in the fall and winter seasons .
The first year Rohan randomized 69 people with SAD into one of four groups : light therapy treatment , cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) , a combination of the two or a wait - list control .
She then surveyed participants on how they were doing the next winter – one year later .
Of those treated with CBT , only 7 percent had a recurrence compared to 36.7 percent of people treated with light therapy .
The recurrence rate for the combination group was 5.5 percent .
When Rohan looked at the severity of the depression that did occur , however , CBT was associated with less severe depression than those treated with either light therapy or a combination of both .
In a previous study that measured the acute affects of each treatment ( immediately following six weeks of intervention ) , combination therapy was highly effective , with a nearly 80 percent remission rate compared to 50 percent for both CBT and light therapy alone and 20 percent on the wait - list .
Rohan hypothesizes that such dramatic results for the combination therapy are the result of being in a heavily monitored study with full participation .
When people are left on their own to manage symptoms the subsequent winter , follow - through is much more difficult .
This “ watered - down ” effect of a two - modality treatment , Rohan notes , has been reported for 20 years across psychology disorders of all sorts .
“ People treated with only CBT – that ’s all they know , ” she says , “ so I think they do it with gusto in the next year and reap the benefits . ”
Of the light therapy group , only four people used it on their own the following winter .
Rohan considers this unsurprising given the commitment the treatment requires : 30 minutes sitting in front of a light box every day through the difficult season .
Her data shows that long - term compliance is rare .
A $ 2 million , five - year grant from the National Institute of Mental Health will advance the next phase of Rohan ’s research .
In the “ Cadillac ” version of the trial , as she calls it , Rohan will follow a much larger sample , 160 people , over two consecutive winters .
That study , in progress now , will compare only CBT and light therapy .
“ The combination therapy may blow your socks off across six weeks of the initial winter , ” says Rohan , “ but if it does n’t have good long - term outcomes , what is the point ?
This is a recurrent depression .
It ’s going to come back every year in some form and I want to develop treatments that are going to have lasting effects . ”
Conservative Doug Hoffman officially gave up his fight Tuesday for the 23rd Congressional district seat .
“ Yesterday , the remaining ballots were counted in the 23rd Congressional District special election .
The results re-affirm the fact that Bill Owens won , ” Hoffman said in a statement .
With the final town recorded from Clinton County Tuesday morning , a recheck of machines , affidavits and absentee ballots in the 11 - county 23rd Congressional district shows Democrat Bill Owens with a lead of 3,559 over Hoffman .
Hoffman won more counties than Owens , but Owens won two large counties in the district — Clinton ( his home base ) and St. Lawrence — and came close to Hoffman in many of the smaller counties such as Fulton , Hamilton and Lewis .
With the last of the Clinton County absentees counted Tuesday morning , Owens picked up another net 130 votes .
Owens ’ lead increased by 430 votes from Friday as Oswego , Essex , Jefferson , St. Lawrence and Clinton finished their absentee counts .
Hoffman spokesman Rob Ryan said this is the only statement Hoffman is making at this time and he would not explain why he decided not to challenge the vote results .
“ Since , the morning of Nov. 4 , many of my supporters have asked me to challenge the outcome of this race , ” Hoffman said in his statement .
“ Their concerns centered on the veracity of the new voting machines used , for the first time , in the majority of the 11 counties that make up the Congressional District .
Over the past three weeks , we nearly cut Bill Owens ’ lead in half .
“ Sadly , that is not enough , ” he said .
Hoffman went on to advise the state and county boards of elections to work to ensure all the new voting machines used in the 2010 statewide and midterm elections work properly .
Hoffman told supporters last week the election was “ stolen ” by Democrats , labor unions and the community activist group ACORN .
Hoffman also accused his opponents of tampering with ballots , but when pressed for evidence , he declined to offer any .
Hoffman also said the close election shows clearly the sentiment of North Country voters .
“ While we may have lost the election , this race proved that Americans are sick and tired of the status quo in both Albany and Washington , ” he said .
Hoffman also thanked his supporters and volunteers .
He also promised to stay active in politics .
When asked if he planned to challenge Owens for the seat again next year , Ryan simply said “ stay tuned . ”
As of Tuesday , with all counties votes tallies , Owens had 73,005 votes to Hoffman 's 69,446 .
All totals still are unofficial until the votes are certified , which should be in a week or so .

HTML5 is coming quicker than a lot of web designers are probably aware .
You ’ve probably seen the stories that it wo n’t actually be usable until 2022 but in reality , you can actually start using it today .
Not all web browsers support CSS2.1 , not all visitors are using software capable of using JavaScript but that does n’t stop us from using it and it should n’t stop you using HTML5 either , and here ’s why …
Using progressive enhancement we can start using HTML5 while ensuring that visitors that are using outdated technology will still find your site usable and accessible .
I ’ve uploaded an example of a simple webpage using HTML5 and below will explain how it differs from HTML4.01 that you ’ll be familar with .
It ’s also worth mentioning that if you ’re used to validating your HTML that I ’ve started using Validator .nu as it is specifically for HTML5 however I ’m sure the W3C will update their validator at some point soon .
HTML5 doctype
To start using HTML5 you ’ll need to use the new HTML5 doctype and all you need is the following snippet of code .
Simply place this on the first line of your HTML document and you ’re ready to start using HTML5 .
<! DOCTYPE html >
Something worth remember at this stage is that the HTML5 doctype allows you to code using XHTML syntax or HTML in strict mode .
Gone are the transitional and loose variations of the doctypes though .
Personally I use HTML syntax but if you prefer XHTML then that ’s fine too but I would recommend keeping things consistent whichever method you use .
The HEAD section
The head section of an HTML5 document will be pretty familiar with anyone used to seeing HTML …
<! DOCTYPE html >
< html lang = " en " >
< head >
< meta charset = " utf - 8 " >
< title > Page Title </ title >
<!-- meta tags -->
< meta name = " keywords " content= " " >
< meta name =" description " content= " " >
<!-- stylesheets -->
< link rel=" stylesheet " href=" css/reset.css " type =" text /css " >
< link rel=" stylesheet " href="css/common.css " type =" text /css " >
<!-- javascript -->
< script src="js/jquery -1.3.2.min.js " ></ script >
<!--conditional comments -->
<!--[ if IE ] >
< script src="js/html5.js " ></ script >
<![endif ] -->
</head >
The first thing you ’ll notice is that the meta tag for the character set has been simplified somewhat .
This was something that I used to copy and paste along with the doctype into a new document as it was a little difficult to remember the full HTML for the character set so this is a welcome change for me .
IE8 HTML5
The other part within the head that you might not be familiar with is the conditional comment which includes an html5.js file .
This is basically a work around which enables the styling of HTML5 elements within IE8 .
Without it and users of IE would simply see content that was unstyled but with a little JavaScript we can make good use of progressive enhancement .
The BODY section
Here ’s where things start getting a little more interesting .
Instead of nesting a number of div’s to create a layout , we can now take advantage of new HTML5 elements to create a better structure for our pages .
The HEADER and NAV elements
In the example I gave above , the HTML uses the HEADER and NAV elements to contain these elements .
The HEADER element can be used to markup the header for the page but could also be used to markup the headers within the content .
Personally , I just use the H1 , H2 elements but you could technically wrap these within a HEADER element if you wanted .
The NAV element can also be used multiple times so you might use it within your HEADER but also for a side navigation , footer links or related links so I ’ve given both of these IDs so that they can be styled using CSS independently of any other elements that we add of this type later .
< header id =" page - header " >
< div id =" logo " >< a href= " / " >< img src= " images/graphic-logo.gif " alt = " Company Name " ></a></div>
< nav id =" main - navigation " >
< ul >
< li class =" current " >< a href= " # " >
Home</a></li>
< li style = " color : red ; " >< a href= " # " >
About </a></li>
< li > < a href= " # " >
Services </a></li>
< li > < a href= " # " >
Portfolio</a></li>
< li > < a href= " # " >
Contact</a></li>
</ul >
</nav>
</header >
The ARTICLE , SECTION and HGROUP elements
I ’ve also used the ARTICLE element to surround the main content , the SECTION element to contain that section of the page ( for example , I could repeat this if I was repeating news articles or blog entries on a home page ) .
The HGROUP element is also used here to group a series of Heading elements ( i.e. h1 , h2 , h3 etc ) .
< article id =" page - content " >
< section >
< hgroup >
<h1 > Demonstration of Using HTML5</h1 >
<h2 > An HTML5 Template </h2 >

The ASIDE element
In the above code you ’ll also notice the ASIDE element , which is used to contain content that relates to the content within the SECTION part of a document and would contain things like links to related content or content pulled from Twitter .
The FOOTER element
Lastly we have the FOOTER element which can be used for the bottom of the content to contain things like copyright information but you can also use it for including author information at the end of a SECTION element so it does have multiple purposes .
Summary
There are more HTML5 elements to get to grips with so I did n’t want to try and cover everything in one article .
However , I hope to make this a series of HTML5 posts which goes into much more depth and also explains how I ’ve used CSS in the above example to style these new elements and keep markup to a minimal .
In the place of a global extravaganza , smaller Microsoft events have been planned around the world , kicking off with the official Sydney launch today at the Maritime Museum .
As the company attempts to put distance between itself and the poorly - received Vista platform , it has adopted a very different tone as it attempts to reach out more personally to its customer base , recruiting Windows users to host their own Tupperware - style Windows 7 house parties to spread the good word on the new OS .
“ Were not about big events any more .
We are about listening to what users have got to say , " said James DeBragga , general manager of Windows consumer product marketing .
Microsoft estimates 60,000 enthusiasts worldwide will hold house parties in the coming week , with 1500 of these in Australia .
“ We 're very bullish about the launch party as a vehicle to introduce the product .
We have estimated that each guest is likely to tell roughly 10 people about it .
We have never marketed that way in the past , ” DeBragga said .
------------------------------------------------------
Windows 7 launch centre
------------------------------------------------------
Although it has not been commercially available until today , early releases of the new operating system have received a glowing reception from software developers , hardware manufacturers and reviewers .
They have been impressed by its superior speed and performance , improved layout of taskbars for accessing favourite applications and features such as the HomeGroup that serves to simplify the sharing of files , photos and hardware devices across a home network .
In addition to this , the operating system has touch technology built in , making it much easier for hardware manufacturers to deliver a new breed of integrated touch sensitive PCs to market , the first fruits of which have already been launched by vendors such as HP .
A free upgrade of Windows 7 will be offered to those buying a Vista PC from the end of June to the end of January .
The Home Premium version of the operating system is expected to cost $ 299 ( or $ 199 for an upgrade version ) , the Professional $ 449 ( $ 399 upgrade ) and the Ultimate $ 469 ( $ 429 upgrade ) .
A family pack being offered in the US to cut software costs for home users will not be immediately available in Australia .
" We are going to test it in a few markets around the world .
If it is successful there , we will launch it within three to six months in other regions , " DeBragga said .
Research company Gartner predicts that , in 2010 , Windows 7 will become the dominant operating system on new PCs with nearly 66 per cent of all new PCs preloaded with Windows 7 by the end of the year .
" When looking at the overall installed base - Windows 7 is expected to overtake Vista as the main operating system in 2012 with 53 per cent of installed PCs running that version of Windows OS , " the researcher said .
Although many of the improvements to Windows 7 were first conceived in its predecessor , Vista , its performance was widely criticised .
Many businesses and consumers preferred to remain with XP than to upgrade .
Gartner said it " categorised Windows 7 as a ' polishing ' release on top of the architectural change that the Windows Vista ' plumbing ' release delivered " .
De Bragga said the company acknowledged that some development decisions it made in regard to Vista had negatively influenced its market perception and subsequent adoption .
" With Vista we made conscious trade - offs with compatibility to put an emphasis on security .
With reduced application and hardware device compatibility , we knew we were going to take hits .
" We also launched multiple betas and release candidates .
Because we made so many versions available , our ecosystem got frustrated with us and lost confidence in Vista , " he said .
Harvey Norman chairman Gerry Harvey said computers were the only category of products performing poorly in his stores in recent months .
Harvey , who personally sold the first Australian copy of Windows 7 at the midnight launch in Alexandria , predicts the operating system will increase hardware sales by 30 per cent .
" The weakest part of our business at the moment is computer hardware , because we believe they 've all been hanging out for this , " Harvey said .
" Every other category we 've got is showing good market growth but the weak spot , the very weak spot , is computers . "
Advertising is another area in which Microsoft is attempting to reinvent itself .
Not only is it marketing a brand new operating system , but it is also attempting to turn the tables on Apple in response to its recent campaign that depicts PC users as bumbling nerds .
One of its more notable recent ad campaigns featured Bill Gates and Jerry Seinfeld , but its efforts met with a lukewarm reception .
" The Bill and Jerry commercials were the first salvo in creating a conversation in the marketplace .
We needed to not talk about stuff but to tap into the silent majority .
In terms of sparking that conversation , we are very pleased with the outcome of that , " DeBragga said .
More recently its Windows House Party instructional videos provoked a strong reaction from a number of Microsoft party hosts who felt it did not depict them in an accurate or flattering light .
" The cutting edge types are some of our best advocates , but we have a huge base of users out there and we needed to cut across lots of different types of people , " DeBragga said .
In a new initiative , the company revealed this month that it had sponsored a whole episode of the airing on November 8 to promote Windows 7 .
The show will cut all commercial breaks and network promotions and instead feature Windows 7 - branded programming blended seamlessly with show content .
Whether or not this helps it to win over mainstream consumers , it is clear Microsoft cannot have the desktop market to itself .
Competitors have not been shy with spoiler product announcements and campaigns designed to divert attention away from the launch of Windows 7 in recent days .
Apple yesterday announced a range of new , cheaper Mac computers and a new multi - touch mouse that is likely to turn some heads among those looking to upgrade their desktop computers .
Google also chose this week to promote a " Gone Google " campaign promoting the benefits of its cloud - based Google Apps suite .
Although it is not a direct threat to Windows 7 , some experts believe the role of desktop computing could be unseated by the rise of cloud based services such as Google Apps .
" If two emerging trends in the IT industry - cloud computing and virtualisation - gain in popularity , desktop computing will become obsolete .
This would render the systems required to operate desktop applications redundant , " said Associate Professor Sanjay Chawla , head of the University of Sydney 's School of IT .
Loading " Microsoft may not release another desktop operating system beyond this week 's release of Windows 7 , " he said .

This is a cross post by Dave Rich from the CST Blog
Last month , the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet published an article alleging that Israeli soldiers kidnapped Palestinian civilians and stole their organs , before returning their mutilated bodies to their families .
This story provoked a storm of protest , as many saw it as a revival of the medieval antisemitic myth of the blood libel .
One feature of the blood libel charge during the Middle Ages is that an allegation in one locale would spark similar accusations against Jews elsewhere ; and so it has proved with this latest version .
On 6 September , some two weeks after the Aftonbladet article , a story appeared in an Arabic newspaper , al - Marada , claiming that “ Jewish rings ” were kidnapping Algerian children and smuggling them to Morocco , where their organs were extracted for export to America and Israel .
This story was quickly translated into English , spliced with some out - of - context quotes from the genuine organ - trading case in New York this summer , and circulated on the internet .
Press TV , the Iranian government ’s mouthpiece in the UK , was quick to pick it up , and headlined their story : “ New Jewish organ theft gang busted ” .
No beating about the bush there ; but then Iranian state broadcasters have a history of promoting blood libels against Jews , such as the TV series Zahra ’s Blue Eyes , shown on Iranian television in 2004 .
The Adolf Hitler Research Society also published the story on their website .
They dubbed it : “ Missing Algerian Children Had Their Organs Removed by Vampires ” .
It is not a surprise that either of these outlets thought that the story was both true and worth reporting , rather than an obviously antisemitic libel .
More suprising perhaps , is the fact that it also appeared on the website of the Muslim Association of Britain ( MAB ) [ Removed today following article in TheJC .
This story has nothing to do with Israel , other than that Israel is named , along with America , as one of the ultimate destinations of the organs .
The allegation is against “ American Jews ” , “ Jewish rings ” and a “ Jewish led network ” .
The usual defence of merely being anti-Israel , not antisemitic , has no place here .
The MAB is a member of MINAB , the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board , which was set up by the government in 2006 as part of their strategy against violent extremism .
The MAB is one of four founding members of MINAB , and consequently has four guaranteed seats on its Executive Board .
As a child of the government ’s Prevent strategy , MINAB has received extensive state funding in recent years : £ 75,600 from the “ Community Leadership Fund ” in 2007 / 8 , and £ 116,000 from the same fund in 2008 / 9 .
They are also partners in a series of workshops run for young Muslims by the thinktank Demos , which are funded by the government to the tune of £ 65,624 ; and provide specialist advice to the Charity Commission ’s Faith and Social Cohesion Unit .
This is not the first time that the MAB has published antisemitic propaganda .
In October 2000 , the MAB ’s newsletter New Dawn printed the ‘ Franklin Prophecy ’ under the headline “ The Jewish Threat on the American Society ” , a 1950s Nazi hoax which claims to quote Benjamin Franklin warning that Jews are vampires who destroy every society in which they live .
The MAB ’s role in MINAB has been questioned before , due to their strong connections to the Muslim Brotherhood , which have been covered extensively elsewhere .
This latest episode is yet more evidence that if you are looking for a genuine partner in “ Community Leadership ” and “ Social Cohesion ” , the MAB is not the right place to look .
Update : this is the image the MAB used to illustrate the story .
Warning : graphic and offensive .

Beijing , China ( CNN ) -- A Chinese blogger who helped victims of a devastating earthquake has been sentenced to three years in prison , his attorney said Monday .
Huang
Qi received the maximum sentence for " illegally holding secret state documents , " according to his lawyer , Mo Shaoping .
The U.S. State Department had protested the blogger 's jailing , saying his activities support China 's efforts to institute the rule of law .
Huang was detained in June 2008 after working to help families of children killed in the May 12 , 2008 , Sichuan earthquake because of the collapse of poorly constructed school buildings , State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid has said .
Huang , founder of the human rights
Web site 64 Tianwang , had been posting articles on the site criticizing the way the earthquake relief was being organized , according to the organization Reporters Without Borders .
" The reports we are seeing are biased , " he wrote on May 20 , 2008 , according to the group .
" In reality , it is very difficult for NGOs to deliver food aid .
They are obliged to go through government channels .
The government is using its propaganda to portray itself as a savior to little avail .
Few citizens trust the government because of the corruptions scandals that already occurred during similar disasters in the past . "
Huang was charged with illegal possession of state secrets after posting the appeals and complaints of the families .
Officials said they found two municipal documents in his house .
He was tried secretly in August , Amnesty International said .
The human rights organization protested the sentencing , saying Huang should not have been arrested and should be released immediately .
" The Chinese government is penalizing someone who is trying to help the victims of the Sichuan earthquake .
Huang
Qi should be treated as a model citizen , committed to the rule of law , but instead he has fallen victim to China 's vague state secrets legislation , " said Sam Zarifi , director of Amnesty International 's Asia Pacific program .
" We urge the judges to display humanity by freeing a seriously ill man who has already spent more than six and a half years of his life in prison , " Reporters Without Borders said in a statement following Huang 's sentencing last week .
" We also hope that the court will remember that all this courageous human rights activist did was provide information about the Sichuan earthquake victims , which cannot be considered a crime .
If Huang were given another long prison sentence , we fear it could be fatal . "
Huang previously spent five years in prison following a June 2000 arrest on the eve of the 11th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on demonstrators in Tinananmen Square , according to Reporters Without Borders .
He was charged with subversion for posting articles about the incident by exiled dissidents on his Web site .
Reporters Without Borders in 2004 awarded him its Cyber - Freedom Prize " for his online defense of free expression and human rights , " the group said .
The organization said last week Huang had been held in " very harsh conditions since his arrest , although he has been suffering from very bad headaches . "
The State Department raised concerns about Huang 's arrest before Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited China in February .
Huang plans to appeal the sentencing by the Chengdu Wuhou District Court , Mo said .
If unsuccessful , he is scheduled to be released in June 2011 , three years after authorities arrested him .
CNN 's Wen - Chun Fan in Beijing , China contributed to this report .
A police officer received $ 10,000 as compensation because he can no longer enjoy gardening , visiting flea markets and collecting carnival glass .
Another officer was awarded $ 1,000 after a suspect bit his arm but not hard enough to break the skin .
A third broke a finger while making an arrest and received $ 6,500 after he claimed the fracture led to arthritis and a lower quality of life .
A provincial fund that compensates civilians victimized by violent crime is routinely and increasingly paying " pain and suffering " cash awards to police officers who suffer minor injuries on the job .
Workplace insurance already compensates these injured officers .
A Toronto Star investigation has found that since 2005 , more than 400 officers and prison guards across Ontario received a total of $ 1.5 million from the taxpayer - funded Criminal Injuries Compensation Board ( CICB ) .
The board released 10 per cent of its decisions to the Star , and an analysis shows the officers who receive the cash often return to full duties , carrying a gun .
" It 's unconscionable , " said Joe Wamback , whose teenage son was beaten nearly to death in a Newmarket park .
Wamback waged a frustrating and ultimately failed attempt to secure money from the board after his son's assault .
" We all have the greatest respect for the work officers do .
It 's an extremely difficult job , but it is their job . "
A Star analysis shows the number of payouts and the average amount of each award have risen dramatically over the past four years .
The amount of money given annually to officers has more than doubled since 2005 , with $ 623,000 awarded in 2008 .
The number of payouts has also jumped , from 92 in 2005 to 137 last year .
That 's a 49 per cent increase .
" I 'm absolutely appalled , " said Dr. Leslie Balmer , a Peel Region psychologist who counsels families of murder victims .
" I thought this is a fund ... for victims of crime , not police officers ... doing their job . "
Alan Young , law professor and author of a 2003 report on victim compensation systems across Canada , said : " I am somewhat shocked by the audacity that police forces feel they can tap into money that ( is not ) intended to assist them .
It seems like this is double - dipping going on . "
Toronto Police Service employees top the list with 133 cash awards since 2005 .
Ontario Provincial Police is second with 71 .
Peel Regional Police is next with 25 .
Ottawa Police ranked fourth with 20 .
The forerunner of the current law , the 1967 Law Enforcement Compensation Act , was meant to compensate civilians injured while assisting police , like the widow of Jack Blanc , a Toronto resident who was killed helping police try to stop a bank bandit .
Over the years the law changed and has become widely known as a fund for civilian victims of violent crime who lose wages or suffer out - of - pocket expenses .
It is now the Compensation for Victims of Crime Act .
It is a law that Wamback , Balmer , Young and others want changed .
The chair of the board , Maureen Armstrong , a recent appointee of Premier Dalton McGuinty 's government , did not comment .
The board reports to the Ministry of the Attorney General .
A ministry spokesman said in an email : " Police have the same right as any other citizen to apply for compensation if they have been the victim of a crime . "
A recently retired Toronto police officer said it is widely known within the force that this money is available .
He angrily called it a " loophole to rack up cash . "
" Are police victims of crime ?
Let 's get serious here , " the officer said .
" The victim is the guy the police show up to help . "
But Toronto Police spokesperson Mark Pugash said , " The legislation is quite clear .
( It ) permits police officers amongst many other people to apply to the CICB . "
The OPP said it is up to individual employees to apply for board money .
A Peel Region Police spokesperson said officers have a legal right to apply to the board " just like every other citizen , " and that workplace insurance often does not fully cover all expenses .
At the Ontario Provincial Police Association , the union that represents OPP officers , president Karl Walsh said in an email that officers can be victims , too , and he lashed out at " so - called " crime victim advocates interviewed by the Star , saying they " should all be ashamed of themselves for suggesting that this law be changed to exclude police officers . "
When presented with the Star 's findings , Ottawa Police Chief Vern
White said he heard officers apply to the board to recoup medical expenses not covered by workplace insurance .
But , he added , " I am surprised .
I always thought it was for civilian victims . "
The secretive provincial agency will not fully disclose how it is spending taxpayer money .
The Star asked for all 412 officer award decisions since 2005 , and the provincial agency said it would need up to three months and $ 5,000 to release some but not all of the details .
Due to privacy concerns the board said it would have to black out the names of officers and their forces , although the hearings are public .
The Star narrowed its request and received 40 of the decisions , with officer and force blacked out .
So taxpayers will never know the identity of the bicycle unit officer who , in October 2007 , chased a suspected trespasser on foot , misjudged his jump over a chain - link fence , caught his arm and tore a bicep tendon .
After surgery and physiotherapy , the officer returned to full duties five months later .
The officer told the board the arm is weakened , but he has experienced no problems while on duty .
He was distressed by his inability to help his pregnant wife while injured .
The board awarded him $ 5,000 for pain and suffering .
In every one of the 40 cases , the board awarded " pain and suffering " payments , sometimes to trained officers who broke a bone or knocked their head and complained about not being able to lift weights or play golf like they did .

One officer who received taxpayer money was not hurt by a criminal but by another officer who was trying to strike the suspect with a handgun and missed .
Another told the board he lost out on moonlighting opportunities because of his injury , and the board paid him $ 2,600 for the loss of work opportunities outside of his regular job and $ 6,000 for pain and suffering .
The officers did not claim or receive much compensation for out - of - pocket medical expenses .
" The police force and prison guards have a very strong union .
They have unbelievably strong benefits .
They have additional resources that ordinary citizens do not have if they are injured by violent crime , " said Wamback , at his home in Newmarket , not far from where , 10 years ago , his son Jonathan was brutally beaten by a gang of teens .
Jonathan , then 15 , was on life support for two weeks and in hospital for seven months .
" The fact they 're dipping in to the crime victim 's fund is very unsettling . "
Wamback faced repeated delays in his effort to get money for wheelchair and ambulance costs .
His story was featured in the damning Ontario Ombudsman 's report " Adding Insult to Injury . "
The 2007 report detailed results of the Ombudsman 's investigation into the board 's " deplorable shape " and poor treatment of victims applying for help .
Law professor
Young said the " spirit of the legislation is not to compensate law enforcement officials . "
He added police are taking money that others sorely need .
" You 're actually making the pie smaller for deserving victims who have been complaining for a decade that the board is not responsive to their needs , " he said , referring to the Ombudsman 's report .
Each year the board awards about $ 20 million to victims .
In a few cases , the Star was able to match details of the incident provided in board documents with newspaper crime reports from the time and was able to determine the identity of the officer .
On Feb. 18 , 2004 , during the night shift , Niagara Region police constable Edward Bednarowski confronted a man wanted for a fatal hit - and - run , carjackings and crashing through a border stop .
As Bednarowski approached , the suspect fired a . 22 - calibre handgun , narrowly missing the constable .
The two men struggled for the gun and with the help of bystanders , Bednarowski made the arrest .
According to the written decision by the board , Bednarowski suffered minor physical injuries but experienced major depression and severe post - traumatic stress disorder that made him " unable to return to work . "
The board awarded him $ 40,000 .
When the Star reached Bednarowski at his home , he said he did not want to comment .
" I have all the respect for the hard work ( police ) do , bringing down murderers , " said Balmer , the Peel Region psychologist .
" I have people threatened with losing their homes because they are so devastated by their child being murdered , and they are getting less compensation than that .
Some guy , who is not even dead , and he gets $ 40,000 ? "
Debbie Levack , whose 14 - year - old son Eric was strangled in Brampton six years ago , said she received a $ 10,000 pain and suffering payment and reimbursement for some but not all therapy costs .
On May 7 , 2003 , about a month after Eric Levack 's murder , an unnamed officer in an unnamed town – the board blacked this information – responded to a disturbance call .
The suspect resisted arrest .
A fight broke out , and the two fell to the ground .
The officer broke his right leg .
The officer attended 116 physiotherapy sessions .
He can no longer kneel on his right knee but continues to pass the annual " Use of Force re-qualification . "
The board awarded the officer $ 10,000 – the same amount of pain and suffering money Debbie Levack received from the board after her son was strangled .

I need to find more people like me .
People that find what these guys do more annoying than funny .
I know there is at least one other out there .
Right ?
Le 3 juillet 2009 , Serge Aleynikov , programmeur de logiciels financiers , est arrêté par le FBI à l'aéroport de Newark , près de New York , alors qu'il rentrait de Chicago .
Il est accusé par son ancien employeur , la banque d'affaires Goldman Sachs , d'avoir volé des programmes informatiques de très haute valeur .
Le soir même , la police va perquisitionner chez lui et saisit ses ordinateurs .
Jusqu'alors , cet informaticien de 39 ans avait mené une vie sans histoires .
Il habitait une belle maison dans une banlieue chic de New York , avec sa femme et leurs trois fillettes .
Après une carrière brillante , il est embauché par Goldman Sachs en mai 2007 avec un salaire de 400 000 dollars par an ( 280 000 euros ) .
Un beau parcours pour cet immigrant russe , arrivé aux Etats - Unis à l'âge de 21 ans avec un modeste diplôme de l'Institut des transports de Moscou .
En juin 2009 , Serge Aleynikov décide de quitter Goldman Sachs et d'aller travailler pour une société financière basée à Chicago , baptisée Teza Tech - une start - up qui n'a pas encore commencé à fonctionner , mais qui lui promet déjà de tripler son salaire .
Le fondateur de Teza , Mikhaïl Malyshev , est lui aussi d'origine russe .
Il vient de quitter un poste important chez Citadel , le grand hedge fund basé lui aussi à Chicago , pour se mettre à son compte .
Début juin , juste avant de quitter Goldman Sachs , Serge Aleynikov fait des copies de quelques logiciels sur lesquels il travaillait , puis les envoie sur un site Internet de stockage gratuit , ainsi que sur le serveur de Teza .
Quinze jours plus tard , lors d'une vérification de ses systèmes de sécurité , Goldman Sachs découvre le transfert non autorisé , et porte plainte .
Lors de son interrogatoire , Serge Aleynikov déclare qu'il croyait avoir téléchargé uniquement des logiciels libres ( dans le domaine public ) , et copié par mégarde quelques programmes appartenant à Goldman Sachs .
Il affirme n'avoir jamais eu l'intention de les vendre ni de les donner à quiconque .
Pourtant , le procureur demande au juge sa mise en détention provisoire , une décision rarissime dans ce genre d'affaires , en insinuant qu'il ferait partie d'un réseau d'espionnage international : le site sur lequel il a envoyé les logiciels est hébergé par un serveur situé en Allemagne , et appartient à un homme vivant à Londres , dont le nom est à consonance indienne .
Par ailleurs , il a toujours de la famille en Russie , où il se rend régulièrement .
Finalement , le juge décide de libérer Serge Aleynikov , contre une énorme caution - de 750 000 dollars ( 525 000 euros ) .
Il n'a pas le droit de quitter la région de New York et ne doit en aucun cas accéder aux fameux logiciels dérobés .
Peu après , il est au chômage , Teza renonce à l'embaucher .
Parallèlement , une autre affaire judiciaire a démarré à Chicago .
Le hedge fund Citadel porte plainte contre Mikhaïl Malyshev , son ancien employé qui vient de créer Teza , pour violation d'une clause de non-concurrence dans son contrat de travail .
Les avocats de Citadel se réfèrent à l'affaire Aleynikov , qu'ils interprètent comme une circonstance aggravante : si Malyshev avait décidé d'embaucher un voleur de logiciels , c'est sans doute qu'il avait spolié Citadel de la même façon , ou qu'il s'apprêtait à le faire .
Citadel exige carrément que Malyshev soit interdit à vie de toute activité professionnelle dans la finance .
En général , ces batailles entre grandes banques d'affaires et petites start - up restent confidentielles .
Mais celle - ci fait la " une " de la presse financière , car , en ce début d'été 2009 , les médias et certains hommes politiques mènent une nouvelle campagne contre Goldman Sachs , accusée de faire des profits gigantesques alors que le pays s'enfonce dans la crise .
Les affaires Aleynikov et Malyshev suscitent deux interrogations : pourquoi ce logiciel dérobé est-il si précieux ?
Et comment les banques font - elles pour gagner autant d'argent en pleine récession ?
En consultant les CV d'Aleynikov et de Malyshev sur Internet et les forums auxquels ils participent , les journalistes découvrent que tous deux sont des spécialistes du high frequency trading , " transactions à haute fréquence " .
Depuis l'informatisation complète des transactions boursières , l'arme suprême des spéculateurs est la vitesse .
Les programmes d'achat et de vente ultrarapides , basés sur des algorithmes toujours plus complexes et tournant sur des ordinateurs toujours plus puissants , sont devenus des outils décisifs .
On assiste à une féroce course à l'armement entre opérateurs .
En 2008 , plus du quart des transactions boursières aux Etats - Unis ont été réalisées grâce à des algorithmes .
Le temps de latence ( délai entre l'émission d'un ordre et sa réalisation ) est de l'ordre de la milliseconde , et les profits ainsi réalisés se chiffrent en milliards de dollars par an .
Les superordinateurs scannent des dizaines de plates - formes en quelques millisecondes , pour détecter les tendances du marché , puis passent des ordres à la vitesse de la lumière , laissant sur place les investisseurs traditionnels , beaucoup plus lents .
Ils peuvent aussi détecter le cours plafond fixé par un acheteur ( prix au - dessus duquel il arrête d'acheter un titre ) .
Aussitôt , ils raflent toutes les actions disponibles avant que l'acheteur légitime ait eu le temps d'agir , et les lui revendent plus cher , généralement au cours maximal - c'est - à- dire 1 centime en dessous de son plafond .
Par ailleurs , les différentes places boursières , qui sont de plus en plus en concurrence , reversent une prime à tout opérateur choisissant en priorité leur plate - forme pour lancer les transactions sur un titre .
Là aussi , le trader le plus rapide est récompensé , même s'il a fait un aller - retour éclair dans le seul but de toucher la prime .
Pour répondre à cette demande de vitesse maximale , on a vu apparaître des petites plates - formes de transactions automatisées , fonctionnant avec quelques dizaines d'employés , et installées dans des bureaux bon marché , loin de Wall Street .
Certaines sont déjà devenues des concurrentes redoutables pour les Bourses traditionnelles .
En juillet 2009 , le New York Stock Exchange ne réalisait plus que 28 % des transactions boursières aux Etats - Unis , le Nasdaq 21 % .
Deux sociétés inconnues du grand public , le BATS à Kansas City ( Missouri ) et Direct Edge à Jersey City ( New Jersey ) rivalisent pour s'imposer au troisième rang des places boursières américaines , avec chacune 10 % à 12 % du marché , selon les modes de calcul .
Le BATS ( Better Alternative Trading System ) a été créé en 2006 par une quinzaine d'informaticiens et d'ingénieurs du Midwest , comme une petite start - up ordinaire .
En un an , la société s'est fait un nom auprès des hedge funds , grâce à ses faibles coûts et à sa vitesse d'exécution : 1 à 3 millisecondes par transaction .
Aujourd 'hui , le BATS traite plus de 1 milliard d'actions par jour .
Pour le mois de juin 2009 , la valeur de ses transactions a atteint 540 milliards de dollars .
Attirés par le succès , des clients comme Citigroup , Credit suisse , Deutsche Bank et Morgan Stanley ont acheté des parts de son capital .
Récemment , le BATS a ouvert un petit bureau à New York , juste en face de la Bourse .
Les geeks ( mordus de nouvelles technologies ) sont partis à la conquête de Wall Street .
De son côté , Direct Edge revendique aujourd ' hui plus de 11 % du marché en volume , contre seulement 7 % en janvier .
Elle compte parmi ses actionnaires Citadel , Knight , JP Morgan et Goldman Sachs , qui font largement appel à ses services .
Le BATS a acquis le statut juridique de Bourse à part entière en août 2008 .
Direct Edge en a fait la demande en mai 2009 .
Parmi les services innovants proposés par ces plates - formes , le plus controversé est le flash order .
Il consiste à laisser quelques bons clients consulter les ordres sur certains titres une fraction de seconde avant qu'ils soient rendus publics .
Ces privilégiés ont un coup d'avance sur les autres investisseurs .
Les flash orders ont été introduits par le Chicago Board Options Exchange et par Direct Edge en 2006 .
En 2009 , le Nasdaq et le BATS les ont imités .
En dévoilant au public ce nouveau moyen de s'enrichir à toute vitesse , les médias ravivent le scandale , car , pour beaucoup d'observateurs , les flash orders s'apparentent à un délit d'initié .
Le sénateur démocrate de l'Etat de New York , Charles Schumer , en a fait une croisade personnelle .
Il a écrit à la SEC ( Securities and Exchange Commission , autorité de tutelle des Bourses américaines ) pour exiger la suppression des flash orders .
Si la SEC n'agit pas , le sénateur menace de déposer un projet de loi pour les interdire .
La SEC lui répond qu'elle va étudier le problème , dans le cadre d'une enquête plus vaste sur d'autres pratiques , notamment les dark pools ( marchés privés où les transactions sont anonymes , et où se pratique une variante des flash orders ) .
En août , le Nasdaq et le BATS ont annoncé qu'ils allaient renoncer volontairement aux flash orders et ont tenu parole dès le 1er septembre .
En revanche , le patron de Direct Edge , William O'Brien , a multiplié les interviews pour expliquer que les flash orders sont une innovation bénéfique , et qu'il allait proposer ce service payant à tous les professionnels intéressés .
De son côté , la SEC reconnaît que son enquête n'en est qu'à ses débuts et qu'aucune mesure contraignante ne sera prise à court terme .
Sur le front judiciaire , l'affaire Aleynikov semble s'enliser dans une bataille de procédures .
Début septembre , Serge Aleynikov n'avait toujours pas été formellement inculpé .

As my colleague Alexei Barrionuevo reports from Rio de Janeiro in The New York Times today , “ over the weekend , in a chilling outburst of violence , drug traffickers wielding what the police say they believe was a large - caliber weapon shot down a police helicopter just one mile from Maracanã Stadium , where the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympics will be held and the World Cup soccer final will be played two years before the Olympics . ”
The Associated Press obtained these video images — shot by Sistema Brasileiro de Televisão , a Brazilian television network — of the helicopter shooting , which took place on Saturday as Rio ’s police force tried to intervene in a battle between rival gangs :
Three of the six officers aboard the helicopter were killed when it crashed and exploded .
Brazil is scheduled to be the host nation for the soccer World Cup in 2014 and the Summer Olympics in 2016 .
The power of the imagination is well - known : it 's no surprise that scary music is scarier with your eyes closed .
But now neuroscientist and psychiatrist Prof. Talma Hendler of Tel Aviv University 's Functional Brain Center says that this phenomenon may open the door to a new way of treating people with Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's and other neurological diseases .
In her new study , Prof .
Hendler found that the simple act of voluntarily closing one 's eyes — instead of listening to music and sounds in the dark — can elicit more intense physical responses in the brain itself .
This finding may have therapeutic value in treating people with brain disorders .
Her research was just published in PLoS One and builds on her 2007 study published in Cerebral Cortex .
Prof .
Hendler 's research suggests that , when our eyes are closed , a region in our brain called the amygdala is fired up .
The experience of scary music becomes more emotionally and physically intense .
And the converse of the scary music effect may be true : happy music could produce a joyous effect when our eyes are shut as well .
Listening to sounds with our eyes closed seems to wire together a direct connection to the regions of our brains that process emotions , says Prof.
Hendler .
" Music is a relatively abstract emotional carrier , " says Prof. Hendler .
" It can easily take one 's subjective personal experience and manipulate it .
Our new findings , however , suggest that the effect is not only subjective .
Using a functional MRI ( fMRI ) , we can see that distinct changes in the brain are more pronounced when a person 's eyes are not being used . "
Alfred Hitchcock in the laboratory
Dr. Yulia Lerner , a post - doctoral fellow at Prof.
Hendler 's lab , had 15 healthy volunteers listen to spooky Hitchcock - style music , and then neutral sounds with no musical melody .
They listened to these twice , once with their eyes open and a second time with their eyes shut , as she monitored their brain activity with an fMRI .
While volunteers were listening to the scary music , Dr. Lerner found that brain activity peaked when the subjects ' eyes were closed .
This medical finding corresponded to volunteer feedback that the subjects felt more emotionally charged by the scary music .
The amygdala , the region of the brain in which emotions are located , was significantly more active when the subjects ' eyes were closed .
" It 's possible that closing one 's eyes during an emotional stimulation , like in our research , may help people through a variety of mental states .
It synchs connectivity in the brain , " Dr. Hendler says .
" We do n't know exactly how or why this happens — it 's like a light switch gets turned off , allowing the brain to better integrate the highs and lows of the emotional experience when the eyes are shut . "
Music brings balance to the brain and more readily integrates the affective and cognitive centers of our mind .
Music may help us think better and even improve our learning abilities .
But , she warns , more studies are needed before you let your teen crank up the hip - hop music as a study aid .
Applications for dementia and systemic brain disorders
" This study is the first time scientists have looked inside the brain non-invasively , to examine what happens to the brain under these conditions , " says Prof.
Hendler .
Small physical behaviors can radically alter the balance and color of emotions .
Not long ago in U.S. classrooms , teachers found that hyperactive students learned better while standing , rather than sitting at their desks .
Now , Prof .
Hendler 's latest study with scary music is " just an example of how a small manipulation in one 's physical state such as eyes open or shut can change our mental experience , " she says .
The findings , researchers hope , can be applied to therapies that achieve more significant and longer - lasting effects without chemical intervention .
While her study just touches on the connection of physical and emotional activity in the brain , Prof .
Hendler does n't rule out music therapy in alleviating symptoms in chronic mental disorders such as depression , Schizophrenia and Parkinson's , in the future .
Just 15 minutes after stepping off the train at Baltimore 's Penn station I found myself standing behind the yellow crime - scene tape after a shooting .
We had been alerted to the attack on N Milton Avenue , in the east of the city , via Twitter .
In the UK , the micro- blogging site is used mainly by people wanting to follow the thoughts and inanities of celebrities such as Stephen Fry .
Here in Baltimore , the police use it to alert the media to shootings and homicides , such is their regularity .
Pacing up and down behind the tape , several police officers and a detective – bathed in the blue and red reflection of flashing police lights – are looking for a gun .
They have searched under car wheel - arches and other likely hiding places it has been fruitless .
And they appear to know it .
One of the cops jokes with another that he would take him and the rest of his team out to dinner at a restaurant of their choosing if they found the weapon that night .
There was a catch , though .
The detective made it clear that theyneeded to find the gun used in the shooting , not just a gun .

We take a walk around some of the neighbouring streets where young men are sitting on stoops outside rowhouses , listening to rap music and shooting dice .
None had any information about how a man had come to be shot in the stomach just yards from them .
I had come to see the real Baltimore , the one behind the fictional television drama of The Wire .
But my initial encounter – the bloody aftermath of a man shot in the stomach – was a scene which I had seen many times on the television , and reinforced all of the stereotypes .
Like countless others , I know what the corner of Fayette and Monroe looks like .
I had seen drug deals in the low - rise projects .
And I witnessed murders in vacant row - houses .
It is , of course , all thanks to The Wire and the endless weekends I devoted to the box set .
But , despite the brief sojourns I made from the comfort of my living - room , until now I had no idea how accurate a picture The Wire painted of the real - life Baltimore .
The crime figures certainly suggest the fictional drama matches the reality .
Baltimore is , statistically , the second - deadliest city in the USA ; only in Detroit are you more likely to be murdered .
Last year there were 234 homicides in the city which has a population of 650,000 .
It was a 20 - year - low , but still meant that one in every 2,700 people was murdered .
In Britain , that figure is about one in 85,000 .
In that sense , I was wary that straying into the wrong neighbourhood could cause problems .
Although I was not hysterical enough to have pre-emptively penned my own obituary .
Justin Fenton , the Baltimore Sun 's crime correspondent , said : " Statistically , it is very dangerous , but I have lived here a long time and I do n't feel like I 'm in any danger . "
Throughout the week , we will be writing about all aspects of crime in Baltimore .
Particularly , given the extraordinarily high murder rate , we will examine the city 's homicide epidemic ; what causes it , who causes it and what is being done to stop it .

The answer to the first question , I am told , is drugs .
The city has a very real drug problem and I am assured by natives of Baltimore that the gangs fighting turf wars for control of the drug trade are the main cause of the higher - than - usual murder rate .
I want to speak to the people who deal drugs and those who take them .
One columnist in the Baltimore Sun recently described Baltimore as a city of two worlds .
It is in the " other world " , the one populated by drug dealers and gangsters , that most murders occur .
Those not involved in the drug trade are apparently as unlikely to be murdered in Baltimore as they are in any other civilised city in the world .
Figures seem to suggest that is true .
Of the 234 murders last year , 194 of the victims ( 82 per cent ) had criminal records and 163 ( 70 per cent ) had a history of being arrested for drug offences .
It is a similar story with the suspects .
Police identified 107 homicide suspects in 2008 .
Of them , 94 ( 88 per cent ) had a criminal record and 76 ( 71 per cent ) had been arrested for drugs .
So it would appear that most murders are committed by criminals against criminals .
The exchange will also be an opportunity to see the American police forces and justice system at work .
Last month , the Metropolitan Police announced that armed police officers were to patrol the streets of London for the first time .
They then backed down in the face of overwhelming fury from politicians and the public .
But police carrying weapons is common practice in the US .
Supporters say that it is only right that officers , who are likely to be confronted by criminals with weapons , should be armed themselves .
Detractors claim it leads to more murders than it prevents .
In Britain , there are specially trained firearms police officers who are called upon to attend incidents in which guns are involved , and they are used to protect VIPs .
They do not patrol the streets .
It is a system means that instances of the police shooting people are relatively rare .
In Baltimore , police - involved shootings are not as uncommon .
This year the Baltimore Police Department has shot 16 people so far ; in a recent case , a 14 - year - old robbery suspect was shot , although not killed .
I want to speak to officers on the front line in Baltimore to see how they see crime in their own city and ask whether , by carrying and using weapons , they perhaps add to it .
I am also told that crime is allowed to thrive in Baltimore because of what the criminals perceive to be a weak justice system .
We will speak to prosecutors and ask about their efforts in the fight against crime .
And we will look at what the communities are doing to stop it .
I hear a lot about perceived apathy in Baltimore .
I know there are a lot of groups working to address the problem of gun violence , but I also hear that many residents do not care about the crime rate and are not interested in solving murders that do not concern them .
Finally , while The Wire has been an unmitigated success in most quarters , I am acutely aware that the place it received the most hostile reception was , unsurprisingly given the murderous , drug - addled , bastion of corruption the city is represented as , Baltimore .
Both the Mayor and the present police administration are keen to distance themselves from the programme .
They say it is fiction and not realistic .
It has also been a sore point in the UK , with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner eager to play down any comparisons between London and Baltimore .
Because of this the exchange that Justin and I are undertaking has caused some consternation , especially in Baltimore .
Many groups have been happy , even eager , to speak to me .
Yet the Mayor and the police commissioner turned down interview requests .
So while , during the week , we will aim to give a complete picture of crime in Baltimore , the voices missing will be those of arguably some of the most important and influential people in the city , those charged with halting crime .
NPR ( All Things Considered ) is devoting an entire hour of programming today to the war in Afghanistan .
The show was prefaced with a comment something like “ We do n’t have all the answers . ”
Well , I have the answer : Get out !
Get out now before one more Afghan dies , before one more U.S. soldier dies , before one more dollar is spent .
Get out now .
Like Vietnam , we will eventually get out .
The question is how many more Afghans will die before we do ?
How many more U.S. soldiers will die before we do ?
How many more billions of dollars will be wasted before we do ?
And how many more terrorists will we create before we leave ?
As Daniel Ellsberg recently said , sending more troops to AfghanistanÂ will only increase the Taliban ’s strength :
The more troops we put in Vietnam , the more Vietcong were recruited .
And , the more troops we put in Afghanistan , the curve shows very clearly from 2005 on , the Taliban has come back having been , as you say , despised and reviled by most of the country .
How can it be that they get the degree of support that they do now ?
One reason only : the number of troops , of US troops that they are fighting .
He said : " Matt and Karen are going to be incredible , and Doctor Who is going to come alive on Saturday nights in a whole new way . "
Drive through Vallejo and you will see a once - proud Navy town clearly down on its luck .
A motel room goes for $ 30.99 a night , including HBO .
Closed businesses proliferate ; those that remain often have temporary vinyl signs held up by string , indicating a tentative investment in the future .
The problems plaguing this community are among the most daunting to face any municipality : the city has declared bankruptcy , its schools are in state receivership and a court battle threatens to strip firefighters of expensive salaries and benefits .
But there is concern that , as the city tries to find the way out of this financial abyss , it is falling into another that is perhaps more pernicious  its political system increasingly reflects the influence of evangelical churches .
This influence , many say , has been gained by condoning intolerance of the city ’s growing gay community .
“ There ’s definitely a disconnect between the faith community and the gay community , ” said Marc Garman , editor of The Vallejo Independent Bulletin , an online town crier .
Blackwater , now known as XE , is run by christian fundamentalist whack job Erik Prince .
This story is very huge , but the final puzzle piece has not yet fallen .
The Blackwater / XE employees who have come forward only know of where the money was diverted , not it 's final destination , or the actual recipients .
Four former Blackwater executives said in interviews that Gary Jackson , who was then the company ’s president , had approved the bribes , and the money was sent from Amman , Jordan , where Blackwater maintains an operations hub , to a top manager in Iraq .
The executives , though , said they did not know whether the cash was delivered to Iraqi officials or the identities of the potential recipients .
The press was so bad in those two months following the massacre , that Blackwater had to act .
They did n't reform , they hatched bribery plots , trying to find Iraqi officials who cared more about a nice cash payout than justice for the seventeen dead citizens that they were elected to represent .
The story is just crossing the wires .
Let 's just hope this does n't get diverted to Joe Lieberman 's Subcommittee and the truth shall come out .
These folks need to go to prison , starting at the rotten head at the top .
If you ’ve walked by the Walled Garden in Shadyside ’s Mellon Park recently , you ’ve probably noticed that it ’s beginning to look like a garden again .
The Management and Maintenance staff at the Parks Conservancy has spent a lot of the last four months in Mellon Park , working alongside Department of Public Works crews and contractors to restore this beloved space in memory of one who left it too soon .
The project had to balance several things : it honors the life of Ann Katharine Seamans through an art installation that mimics the pattern of the stars in the night sky over Pittsburgh on Annie ’s birthday .
It also returns several historical elements from the garden ’s 1929 design by Alden and Harlow for the Richard B. Mellon estate .
And finally , the garden had to be a welcoming space for today ’s visitors , with plenty of seating , well - maintained plantings , and a beautiful , open design .
With work just about finished for this year , we wanted to give you a look back at how the project has progressed since our groundbreaking in July .
We ’re planning on a June 2010 re-opening when the new trees are in full bloom and the grass has had a chance to grow into the lawn .
Before we get to the photos , Phil wants me to pass on something very important : if you ’re using Mellon Park between now and June , please keep your dogs out of the fenced area !
The new grass needs time to grow in , and some larger dogs are leaping over the fencing and tearing up patches of lawn .
We ’ll be working on some of the lawn area in front of the garden too , so you ’ll see more fencing in the months to come , but we ask for your patience in helping us make the park better for everyone .
And now for the pics !
In July , crews began removing the plant material in the garden borders so that work could begin .
In August , the whole lawn was dug up to prepare for the installation of the stars .
Meanwhile , Eagle Scout Jake Meyer assembled a crew at Schenley Plaza to assemble the stars out of PVC piping .
The garden ’s signature fountain received a new water supply , and an underground vault was built that will serve as a mechanical room when a full restoration of the fountain can be undertaken .
( That portion of the project has not been funded to date . )
The fountain is once again able to flow but needs a little tweaking to do so properly .
New pipes were run from the vault to the fountain –the water supply and a return line that will allow the water to recirculate .
Electrical conduits were laid to power the fiber optics that make the stars glow .
Then fill was added to the lawn that covered the stars up to their fiber optic tip .
A nighttime lighting test allowed the garden to glow for the first time .
The effect is unique and surprising , and as Phil says , “ If you look closely , they wink at you . ”
Each star ’s name and a short saying is affixed to a granite disc that covers up all but the tip of the fiber optic line .
So not only will you be able to sit on the lawn without running into a bunch of poky lights , but you ’ll get to learn a fun star fact whenever you visit !
October was a time for planting .
A great crew of volunteers came out to help install shrubs , bulbs , perennials , and finally trees on the garden ’s borders .
The restoration includes two plaques , one honoring Ann Katharine Seamans and the other recalling Vitale and Geiffert ’s work .
The original design had an octagonal planting bed leading up to the lawn , so this element is being brought back .
The garden ’s much - loved frog has hopped over to a nearby pad but is still part of the garden .
Its original location was at a pond in another part of the park , and it will likely return there if a restoration of the pond is ever undertaken .
The two lions on either side of the steps are currently in storage .
Historically , there were urns where they sat , so that ’s what you ’ll be seeing when the garden re-opens .
The lions are likely to turn up somewhere in another park to be determined .
The distinctive iron gates by Samuel Yellin were partially restored as part of the project .
Although a test revealed no lead paint on the gates , they are over 100 years old , so to be on the safe side they were sandblasted and repainted with lead - free , environmentally friendly coatings .
( Do n’t worry , we did n’t turn them white –this is how they looked between blasting and painting ! )
And this is where we stand today .
You can see that wooden park benches have been added , replacing some of the stone benches .
The idea there was to add to the garden ’s airy feel by installing benches that were n’t completely solid , allowing the other elements to show through to a degree .
You can also see that a stepped terrace has been added near the front of the garden with another planting bed and a circular bench .
This allows for a new and elevated perspective on the garden below .
So come next June , this is what you should see : an attractive space that ’s lively yet intimate , bringing together an innovative new art installation with a stunning historical design and sustainable plantings .
We ca n’t wait to open this back up and see it filled with people again !
Thanks to Carlos Peterson for the sketch and Joe Seamans for the lighting photo !
Joe Lieberman in 1994 : ' The abuse of the filibuster [ is ] bipartisan and so its demise should be bipartisan as well '
This is a helluva catch by Sam Stein :
" [ People ] are fed up -- frustrated and fed up and angry about the way in which our government does not work , about the way in which we come down here and get into a lot of political games and seem to -- partisan tugs of war and forget why we 're here , which is to serve the American people .
And I think the filibuster has become not only in reality an obstacle to accomplishment here , but it also a symbol of a lot that ails Washington today . "
" But I do want to say that the Republicans were not the only perpetrators of filibuster gridlock , there were occasions when Democrats did it as well .
And the long and the short of it is that the abuse of the filibuster was bipartisan and so its demise should be bipartisan as well . "
" The whole process of individual senators being able to hold up legislation , which in a sense is an extension of the filibuster because the hold has been understood in one way to be a threat to filibuster -- it 's just unfair . "
The speaker there is Sen. Joe Lieberman .
The quote is from 1994 .
And Lieberman 's solution was pretty clever .
As Stein explains it , " The Senate would still need 60 votes on the first motion to end debate , ( the cloture vote ) .
But the next motion would require just 57 votes , the third motion 54 votes , and the fourth and final effort would need just 51 votes -- a simple majority .
In all , roughly 25 days would elapse between the first and fourth vote . "
In that way , the filibuster would still extend debate and ensure that minority viewpoints were heard .
But it would no longer mean that minority viewpoints could obstruct .
This year , of course , Lieberman is saying that he 's considering filibustering health - care reform .
It 's tempting to just make this about Lieberman , but it is n't , really .
A lot of young senators consider the filibuster somewhat insane .
Many of them come from the House , where action is easier , or they led state legislatures , where the filibuster did n't exist .
Others were governors or leaders in the private sector .
They enter the Senate and are appalled that the place is paralyzed by bad - faith proceduralism .
But over time , they lose that perspective .
They serve in the minority for a while and realize they like the filibuster .
They find themselves serving as a crucial vote on some issue or another and find they like the power .
They spend a lot of time with older senators and decide they like the chamber 's institutions .
And they either drop the fight or , as in Lieberman 's case , join the other side .

BHP Billiton remains uncertain about short - term demand for commodities because of the lingering impact of the global financial crisis .
But it is in no doubt about the longer term , predicting looming global shortages in energy and copper as the industrialisation and urbanisation of China and India pick up pace .
And for good measure , it is also predicting that global steel demand will double over the next 15 years , underpinning long - term demand for the steel - making commodities of iron ore , coking coal , manganese and nickel .
The man responsible for BHP 's marketing of $ US50 billion ( $ A58 billion ) in commodities annually , Tom Schutte , said yesterday that the ' ' world is going to be short of energy in the medium to long term ' ' .
'' We expect world energy consumption to increase by 40 per cent over the next two decades , driven again by population growth , urbanisation and increasing per capita consumption [ of commodities ] in China and India , '' Mr Schutte said .

I really hate the Leffews !
Every time that I watch one of their damned sentimental videos , I tear up !
Mascara running , red - eyes promoting , heart touching .. so , I 've sworn off the Leffews !
At least until the next video .. they 're just so damned adorable .
And , for anyone who can't tell , my tongue is firmly tucked in my overtly facetious cheek .
What a terrible time it ’s been for us Left 4 Dead 2 boycotters .
The leading members of the boycott were whisked away to Valve ’s offices and brain washed with ‘ freebies ’ and other subversive means .
If that was n’t bad enough , Valve offered a 4 pack pre-order bonus for the low price of $ 33.75 , a mere $ 8.75 more than what I paid for the original on PC ( or $ 16.25 less than retail , but I ’m a glass half empty man ) .
What more , PC gamers railed against Activision for actually doing something evil .
Now , the final straw in whatever we were mad about ( I ’ve somewhat forgotten , but I ’m sure I will by the end of this article ) , the game is actually good .
Damn .
Well , now I know more or less what Pagliacci felt when he got bitten by a zombie and shot in the head by me .
Err , well at least I know it felt when I shot him .
The first thing you ’ll be treated to is a view you wo n’t quite be familiar to in Left 4 Dead .
Sunlight , shopping grounds , gazebos , a wide array of diverse scenery all around .
Graphically , the Source engine maybe showing its age , but on the game ’s highest settings you wo n’t be complaining for long .
You ’ll be far to busy slaying zombies to form a complex sentence anyway .
There are a few things that often change in video games you ’ve put a lot of time into that you did n’t even realize needed tweaking at the time .
When these things are adjusted even slightly they make more of a difference than the most pronounced changes .
This evident in games like Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves , and sports gamers swear that their favorite titles change year after year .
It ’s debatable really .
The casual observer will notice next to nothing has changed in Left 4 Dead 2 , but anyone who ’s put in at least 20hrs into the series will see how small things have managed to wind up different , for the better in this case .
Your new cast members might not be quite as iconic as the original set , but give them a break .
They lived in New Orleans , that place was a disaster zone before a zombie outbreak .
Your first weapon will be the standard fare of shotgun or SMG .
Do n’t complain for too long , the weapons do get better along the way .
The items that you ’ll find as melee weapons will be hilarious at first , and then life saving throughout your journey .
Your friend may have a machete and you may be stuck with a frying pan , but the game really does n’t differentiate between the two , or at least the zombies do n’t .
More powerful than the melee of your guns and having a wider damage radius , this is your best way for clearing the path for you and your buddies .
The new guns are definitely a welcome addition , especially the desert eagle .
Eight shots , but they make such a big impact compared to the standard pistol .
It ’s fun to watch zombies split in half .
You ’ll also find an AK - 47 , less accuracy but more damage than the M4 , but both fail in comparison with the new 3 burst assault rifle the name of which escapes me .
The SMG gets a little bit of an upgrade as well .
A silencer has been tied off with twisty ties and attached to the regular SMG making it more accurate and devastating to zombie flesh .
And can you believe that there are some people who believe that you should n’t try this at home ?
You ’ll be met with a diverse array of Louisianian zombie wildlife .
Although they ’re really not harder to kill in most cases , they ’re definitely more fun to watch die .
Expect them to charge at you with a limb or two missing , as well as stumbling or tripping over something when you swat them away .
They ’ll get back up of course , so it ’s a good idea to blast them while they ’re down .
It ’s also not uncommon to mistake a good sign as a bad one .
In a disaster scenario it is only natural to try to find the police , but trust me , the cops in this game will use excessive force .
The SWAT zombies are brutal , completely armored and swing a billy stick hard enough to turn a flower tossing hippie into Rush Limbaugh .
The riot guard ’s only weakness is being shot in the back while one of your friends distracts him .
Not to be outdone in the annoying department , the Jockey is like a head humper with a full body .
It leaps onto your head and steers you around ( often into Molotov fire ) until it ’s shot off of you .
The Charger is like a lighter version of the tank , much lighter .
It can be taken down in a few seconds , but it breaks up the pace of your winning streak if it manages to down a partner .
It only takes going down once to lose a game for everyone .
The Spitter manages to inspire vomit from herself and others .
If you do n’t pay attention you can find 30 % of your health gone in the blink of an eye .
She sprays acid on the ground , far deadlier than the Boomer and less obvious when there ’s a zombie horde at your feet .
It ’s best to stow the yo mama jokes and take her out quickly when you see her from a distance , she has a far reach … like yo mama .
Sure , Louis is no longer in the game to shout “ PEELS HERE ! ” , and when they do its not nearly as funny , but there ’s more than just pills now .
In addition you ’ll find shots of adrenaline providing a temporary boost in health as well as heightened senses .
Do n’t use it unless you have to though because it ’ll leave you in worse shape overall .
For teammates who are dying there ’s also a defibrillator used to keep them alive .
I suppose you could also Kill All Sonsabitches with it too , although I have n’t actually tried that , yet .
You will also find containers of Boomer bile lying around that can be thrown at zombies to get them all in one area .
A traitorous swine could also use it to betray a teammate who cracked wise about his mama when The Spitter showed up , but you ’d have to be a bastard to do that .
It begs the question as to who or what collected all the Boomer ’s bile , or even how they did it .
The best questions are the ones you do n’t want to know the answer to .
There are quite a few things that are different .
The enemy skins are more diverse although the game moves so fast you wo n’t even notice .
If you pay attention you ’ll even see a female Boomer , and I might not be sure but as I was being trampled to death the Tank looked like he ’d gotten a new pair of pants .
Valve always did have the gameplay down to a science for this game , but the variations of game types were n’t available in the demo so the jury is still out .
The only real thing to complain about would be for the modders still working with Left 4 Dead 1 .
If there work will carry over or not seems to be an issue all on its own .
The first game wo n’t magically disappear , but it will seriously reduce interest .
For me the boycott came from a typically unexpected move from Valve .
They ’d always extended the life of their games and have never release a sequel this fast .
All the Half Life ’s had interchangeable assets , even updated in some cases .
But in a move like this , it ’s still awkward to see these changes however slight or effective be separating the two games in the most bizarre of ways .
Identical on a genetic level , but their skin deep qualities affecting their interactions .
Sort of like humans and zombies forever at war .
I guess that is pretty fitting .

Planets with retrograde orbits should be rare
Astronomers have discovered the first planet that orbits in the opposite direction to the spin of its star .
Planets form out of the same swirling gas cloud that creates a star , so they are expected to orbit in the same direction that the star rotates .
The new planet is thought to have been flung into its " retrograde " orbit by a close encounter with either another planet or with a passing star .
The work has been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal for publication .
Co-author Coel Hellier , from Keele University in Staffordshire , UK , said planets with retrograde orbits were thought to be rare .
" With everything [ in the star system ] swirling around the same way and the star spinning the same way , you have to do quite a lot to it to make it go in the opposite direction , " he told BBC News .
The direction of orbit is known for roughly a dozen exoplanets ( planets outside our solar system ) .
This is the only example with a retrograde orbit .
All others are prograde ; they orbit in the same direction as the spin of their star .
Close encounters Professor Hellier said a near - collision was probably responsible for this planet 's unusual orbit .
" If you have a near - collision , then you 'll have a large gravitational slingshot from that interaction , " he explained .
" This is the likeliest explanation .
But it might be possible you can do it by gradually perturbing the orbit through the influence of a second planet .
So far , we have n't found any evidence of a second planet there . "
The new object has been named WASP - 17b .
It is the 17th exoplanet to have been discovered by the Wide Area Search for Planets ( WASP ) consortium of UK universities .
The gas giant is about twice the size of Jupiter , but has about half the mass .
This bloatedness might also be rooted in the close encounter that changed the planet 's direction .
WASP - 17b was detected using an array of cameras set up to monitor hundreds of thousands of stars .
Astronomers were searching for small dips in light from these stars that occur when a planet passes in front of them .
When this happens , the planets are said to transit their parent star .
A team from Geneva Observatory in Switzerland then looked for spectral signs that the star was wobbling due to gravitational tugs from an orbiting planet .
" If you look at how the spectrum of the star changes when the planet transits across it , you can work out which way the planet is travelling , " Professor Hellier added .
" That allows you to prove that it 's in a retrograde orbit . "
The size of the dip in light from the star during the transit allowed astronomers to work out the planet 's radius .
To work out how massive it was , they recorded the motion of the star as it was tugged on by the orbiting planet .

13 September 2009Statement from Morrissey : I am forced to defend myself - again - from a comment made by Andy Rourke last week on the eyeweekly website .
It is a recurring comment whereby Andy confirms that his dismissal from the Smiths was made via a handwritten postcard from me telling Andy " you have left the Smiths .
" I would like to state to anyone interested in the truth of this matter that no such postcard was ever written by me , and no dismissal postcard was ever placed on Andy 's car with my knowledge or consent , and I am naturally irked that such an alleged deed has gone down in the fairy tale footnotes of Smiths lore .
If such a postcard ever existed , it is likely that an unfunny stunt was played on Andy by someone attempting Morrissey - scrawl - easily done .
Secondly , Andy's " dismissal " from the Smiths would not be a decision solely made by me , and would not be announced by me on a note bearing only my name , and it would also not be executed by a handwritten note carelessly thrown onto the hood of a car ( or window - wipers , as has often been reported . )
Does n't anyone have the wit to work this one out ?

The Internet Governance Forum ( IGF ) has made a right mess of the opening day of its meeting in Egypt .
Already under fire for holding the forum in Egypt , which banged up a blogger for four years , the group also made a truly ham - fisted attempt to censor debate at the meeting .
A security guard was told to remove a poster created by the OpenNet Initiative which included the incendiary line : " China 's famous ' Great Firewall of China ' is one of the first national Internet filtering systems . "
The risk of this outrageous piece of entirely unstartling information upsetting a Chinese delegate was presumably behind the move .
Unfortunately the incident was filmed and later put on YouTube .
So now a poster , which stated the bleedin ' obvious , will now be seen by most of the internet rather than a few dozen policy wonks at a faraway conference .
Really good work there chaps .
Lobby group OpenNet said it would be writing to the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights to complain .
In other news the European Commission welcomed Icann 's adoption of non-Latin top level domain names . ®
Moments before the film The Time Traveler 's Wife began rolling , the cinema I was attending screened a " preview " of a new video game .
The star of the game , whose highly recognisable voice would be used to bring the principal character to life , was Jack Black .
I had recently heard Black 's voice in the animated film Kung Fu Panda and , while channel - surfing , had glimpsed a few minutes of Nacho Libre , Black 's sendup of Mexican wrestling culture .
I had also heard my son mention both the band Tenacious D and the film based on their exploits , and seen a few snippets of Black 's turn in King Kong , where he played a porky impresario .
Finally , I had watched him in Ben Stiller 's 2008 comedy hit Tropic Thunder , where he played a subordinate role to Robert Downey Jr and Stiller himself .
As I sat there in that darkened room , listening to his half - hearted pitch for what sounded like a thoroughly generic video game , it occurred to me that it would now be almost impossible to convince anyone under the age of 20 that there was actually a time when Jack Black did not suck .
Black – the classic example of the raffish outsider who initially spits on the entertainment industry , then is seduced by it , and then comes to epitomise everything that is wrong with it – first came to the public 's attention in the 2000 film High Fidelity , in which he played a hilariously idiosyncratic record store employee .
Prior to that , he had appeared in a number of films , including The Jackal and The Cable Guy , in which he played the designated loser .
Three years later , Black would achieve his greatest success in School of Rock , again playing a dyspeptic slob .
As far as I can tell , these are the only films in his recent CV in which he does not flat - out suck .
He sucked in Shallow Hal , he sucked in Orange County , he sucked in The Holiday , and he sucked in Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny .
He also sucked in King Kong , Saving Silverman , Year One and yes , Kung Fu Panda .
It is almost impossible to suck in a film in which only your voice is used , but Black sucked anyway .
Even in the rare Jack Black film that is not explicitly revolting – the exuberantly irreverent and very clever Tropic Thunder is a perfect example – Black succeeded in turning in a useless performance while those around him shone .
Tropic
Thunder is the film in which Black , playing a fatso sourpuss , heroin addict movie star stranded in an Asian jungle , gets upstaged by Downey Jr , Stiller , Matthew McConaughey , Tom Cruise , Nick Nolte and basically everyone else in the film , including a small child who never says a word in English .
That is really embarrassing .
It may explain why Black pouts through the entire film .
He knows he 's getting smoked .
It is not our purpose here to upbraid Black for sucking , nor to encourage him to stop sucking , nor even to suggest steps he might take to at least suck less .
At this point in his career , it is almost impossible to believe that Black could ever be anything other than what he is .
Following in the trail blazed by Bob Hope , Dan Aykroyd and a few others , Black is a sterling example of the actor who starts out seeming like a breath of fresh air , and then turns into something stale , fetid , mephitic , nauseating .
That is a process that it almost impossible to reverse .
It can be done ; it has been done .
But you would n't want to bet the rent money that Black can do it .
This being the case , the wisest , fairest course is take a detached , scientific approach toward the situation and examine the very concept of hardcore , full - tilt sucking in all its manifestations .
There are three questions that should concern us here :
Were the seeds of thespianic vileness already planted in the performer 's personality at an early age and the rest of us simply failed to notice it ?
Or was Black one of those supremely cunning individuals who masqueraded as an appealing , multifaceted , bona fide talent to get his foot in the door and then sprung the trap of suck on us all when the moment was propitious ?
Or was Jack Black always meant to be a churlish loser whose inherent obnoxiousness only became apparent once he moved out of the sidekick role and emerged as a star in his own right ?
The shark awaits its cue
For what it is worth , here is my theory :
When the fat slob Chris Farley passed away in 1997 , Black gradually inherited the roles Farley could no longer fill .
But unlike Farley , who emitted a sweetness and innocence - he did , after all , go to college in Milwaukee , hometown of Liberace and the Fonz - when he was actually born in Madison , Wisconsin. , Black was almost certainly predestined to suck , because the very things that made him amusing when he was a sidekick would make him tiresome once he got top billing : his smirk , his snarl , his whining , his basic meanness , his poor grooming habits , his bred - in - the - bone creepiness , his face that only a mother could love , but not necessarily his mother .
In the fullness of time , it was inevitable that Black would wear out his welcome .
He would be given tasks too large for his meagre talents .
Thus , in another nod to the Fonz , this is not a case where the shark got jumped inadvertently .
Black 's shark was just biding its time , waiting to be jumped .
The single greatest problem posed by Black 's appearance on screen today is a phenomenon sometimes referred to as the aureole of anachronistic atrociousness , whereby people who did not always suck are surrounded by a glimmering halo of barely visible non-sucking that evokes vague memories of the time when they were not fully fledged enemies of the people .
Each time these actors perform , the Ghost of Goodness Past hovers above them , bathing them in a flickering light , serving as a bittersweet reminder of the time when they seemed fresh and new , when their very existence was a relief from the appalling triumvirate of Daniel Stern , Joe Pesci , and Steve Guttenberg .
Like Judas Iscariot or Robespierre or Chris Martin , these people were not born monsters .
They grew into the role .
Scarlett Johansson 's seven - year - itch
Obviously , it would not be fair to Black to single him out as the only member of his generation who started out tickling the common man 's fancy , and then told the public to stick it where the sun do n't shine .
When Scarlett Johansson first burst upon the scene , her air of normality , her sleepy manner , her reassuring lack of movie - star looks , made her seem fresh and new .
This was back in the days of Ghost World and Lost in Translation .
Now , years later , after Scoop and Match Point and The Nanny Diaries , as Hollywood has tried every trick in the book to repackage her as a postmodern Marilyn Monroe , that early charm has faded and she has been exposed for what she is : Scarlett Johansson .
A similar trajectory describes the careers of Matthew McConaughey , Gwyneth Paltrow and even Jude Law .
This trio made their names in films like Emma , Lone Star , The Talented Mr Ripley , Dazed and Confused , Amistad , Hard Eight and Shakespeare in Love .
But that was a long , long time ago , and in the interval there have been How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days , Sleuth , The Wedding Planner , Two Lovers , The Good Night , Sahara , We Are Marshall , Failure to Launch , Fool 's Gold , Two for the Money , Infamous , View from the Top , Alfie and , of course , Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow .
The difference here is that Paltrow , Law and McConaughey are talented actors who have lapsed into sucking but could easily stop sucking if they wanted to .
Paltrow took time off from being useless to make The Royal Tenenbaums .
McConaughey made Tropic Thunder .
Law made All the King 's Men .
They may suck now .
They will not suck forever .
The Travolta syndrome
We can all take solace from the realisation that those who suck can in fact revert to a pre-sucking state , if they only put their minds to it .
This is a phenomenon sometimes referred to by clinicians as Travolta Syndrome .
Caution , though :
Those who suffer from Travolta Syndrome invariably have lapses and go back to sucking .
There is also a second condition called Clapton 's Septic Aphasia , which causes those who did not always suck to momentarily revert to not sucking .
The non-sucking may never be repeated , but it is there .
It also does n't last very long .
If you blink , you will miss it .
It could be an optical illusion .
I have a friend who insists that on 13 January 2002 , Rod Stewart stopped sucking for a minute - and - a - half .
She actually claims to have been there when it happened .
She timed it .
She even had a video of the event .
I checked the videotape .
Alas , she is quite mistaken .
Several years ago , after Dan Aykroyd admitted that he had never seen a good number of his movies , I wrote an article in GQ demanding to know why Aykroyd should be exempted from such misery while the rest of us had to suffer .
The problem , as I soon learned when I was contacted by one of Aykroyd 's simpering minions , was that Aykroyd himself was not aware of the low repute in which his films were held .
I suspect the same is true of Jack Black .
Black is not evil ; he is merely oblivious .
This is the difference between Black and Aykroyd and , say , Ghengis Khan .
Ghenghis Khan was aware that he was not a nice person .
He did not delude himself into thinking that the millions of people he put to the sword enjoyed it .
And to his credit , he never tried to pass himself off as a maverick , an iconoclast , a subversive , or an outsider .
Ghenghis Khan was a standup guy .
Ghenghis Khan knew the score .

A US jury ’s decision that an antidepressant caused heart defects in an unborn baby is highlighting the painful dilemma facing pregnant women with depression .
The most common antidepressants have been linked to birth defects and miscarriage , yet some doctors fear that letting depressive symptoms go untreated may have long - term consequences for the mother and her unborn baby .
On 15 October , a jury in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , ordered manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline to pay $ 2.5 million to the family of 3 - year - old Lyam Kilker , who was born with serious heart defects .
While pregnant , Kilker ’s mother took the antidepressant paroxetine ( Seroxat or Paxil ) , which belongs to …
Last week , Within Windows noted something suspicious in regards to Microsoft 's use of the GNU 's General Public License ( GPL ) : " While poking through the UDF - related internals of the Windows 7 USB / DVD Download Tool , I had a weird feeling there was just wayyyyyyyyy too much code in there for such a simple tool .
A simple search of some method names and properties , gleaned from Reflector 's output , revealed the source code was obviously lifted from the CodePlex - hosted ( yikes ) GPLv2 - licensed ImageMaster project .
( The author of the code was not contacted by Microsoft . ) "
Redmond remained quiet until yesterday , when the company pulled the tool in question from its servers .
The Windows 7 USB / DVD Download
Tool webpage now brings up the following error : " Sorry , the page you are looking for can not be found .
You can try searching our site using the Microsoft Store search box above , or you can browse our site using one of the links below . "
We contacted Microsoft and indeed it seems the two stories are closely related , though whether the software giant is actually violating the GPL , a widely used ( including by the Linux kernel ) free software license , is not confirmed .
" We are currently taking down the Windows USB / DVD Tool ( WUDT ) from the Microsoft Store site until our review of the tool is complete , " a Microsoft spokesperson told Ars .
" We apologize to our customers for any inconvenience . "
Coincidentally , yesterday we ran a story in which we explained that Bradley Kuhn , the technical director of the Software Freedom Law Center ( SFLC ) , has published a helpful set of guidelines about the most productive way to respond to a suspected violation of the GPL .
The guidelines caution against jumping to conclusions , since GPL violations are extremely common ( Kuhn finds one a day ) and encourage free software enthusiasts to give violators the benefit of the doubt , so that 's what we 're going to do for Microsoft .
The fact the company pulled the tool does n't bode well , so we 'll have to watch closely to see what the company puts back on its servers .
When you purchase Windows 7 from the Microsoft Store , you have the option to download the Windows 7 .ISO file or the compressed files .
The Windows 7 USB / DVD Download
Tool not only allows you to download Windows 7 from the Microsoft Store but it also lets you put the files on a USB Stick or DVD .
To create a Windows 7 bootable DVD or USB flash drive that you can use to install the operating system , you would download the .iso file , and then run the Windows 7 USB / DVD Download tool .
In May 2007 , Microsoft funded a questionable study attacking GPL 3 draft process .
In April 2008 , Bill Gates publicly stated Microsoft disagreed with the GPL .
Most recently though , in July 2009 , Microsoft contributed Hyper - V drivers to the Linux kernel in order to improve the performance of running virtualized Linux guests in a Windows host environment and also opened its Linux Hyper - V drivers under the GPL .

This is a disturbing video of it raining polar bears ( why could n't it be men ? ! ) funded by U.K. based Plane Stupid , an anti-airport expansion ( read : terrorist ) organization .
Brief :
We wanted to confront people with the impact that short - haul flights have on the climate .
We used Polar Bears because they 're a well understood symbol of the effect that climate change is having on the natural world .

It did not .

As the United States Senate ramps up its efforts on climate - change legislation this week , a bipartisan poll released Monday suggests that a strong majority of voters believe global warming is a real and needs to be remedied .
Some 56 percent of likely general - election voters say global warming is happening now , and a further 21 percent say it will happen in the future , according to a survey by Democratic Pollster Mark Mellman and Republican pollster Bill McInturff .
By contrast , some 16 percent said global warming will not happen .
The study was funded by the Pew Charitable Trusts Global Warming Campaign .
When asked whether they favored having the United States take steps to reduce the emission of gases like carbon dioxide that cause global warming , 77 percent of respondents favored action , 18 percent opposed action , and 5 percent were undecided .
“ The battle for legitimacy of the global warming issue has largely been won with the public , ” Mr. Mellman said at a Monitor sponsored breakfast for reporters .
“ There is no evidence that we have uncovered in Democratic districts of a backlash against those who support this legislation , ” he added .
Striking a contrary note , though , a survey released in October by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press suggests that Americans ' certainty about climate change is declining .
It found that the percentage of Americans surveyed who believe there is “ solid evidence the earth is warming ” has dropped from 71 percent to 57 percent since April 2008 .
Fighting global warming = jobs ?
In the survey by Messrs .
Mellman and McInturff , a large plurality of voters canvassed – 48 percent – thought efforts to reduce global warming would create new American jobs .
The view that efforts to reduce global warming will cost American jobs was held by 27 percent of those surveyed .
Another 16 percent thought efforts to remedy global warming would have no effect on jobs .
Despite strong , bipartisan support for remedial action , “ party labels do shift this data , ” said McInturff , who served as John McCain ’s pollster in the 2008 presidential election .
For example , 49 percent of Republicans think global warming is a serious threat , versus 90 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of independents .
In fact , “ our core Republican primary voters do not believe in global warming ” by a 2 - to - 1 majority , said McInturff .
So the pollsters ' partner , Public Opinion Strategies , argued that among core Republican voters the argument for action on the climate should be tied to the need for energy independence .
Tough road for Senate bill
Senate Republicans on the Environment and Public Works Committee plan to boycott a meeting Tuesday to debate a potential climate - change bill .
Even Democrats are deeply divided , according to The Washington Post .
When asked why climate legislation faced such an apparently tough road in the Senate , Mellman noted that “ by and large congressional opinion tends to run beyond public opinion , sometimes pretty substantially . ”
He added that , “ obviously you get into the details and people have sectoral interests , geographic interests . ”
For Republicans , part of resistance to climate - change legislation is the desire “ not be seen as the deciding vote to help a major Obama initiative , ” McInturff said .
“ I think that is the political dynamic . ”
Polling in battleground states and congressional districts by the Mellman Group and Public Opinion Strategies was conducted in several waves starting in July and ending in late October .
National survey data was collected in late September among general election voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points .

In terms of what we know about them , the contrast between our two greatest men of letters , William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens , could scarcely be sharper .
Of Shakespeare , we know next to nothing ; of Dickens we know next to everything .
Dickens might well have wished it otherwise : speaking of his great predecessor , he wrote to a correspondent : " It is a great comfort , to my way of thinking , that so little is known about the poet .
It is a fine mystery , and I tremble every day lest something should come out . "
The mystery of Charles Dickens is quite as profound as that of William Shakespeare , but it is essentially the mystery of art itself and of its roots in the deepest layers of experience and personality .
Of the writer 's external life , there is almost an embarrassment of riches .
It was a life lived at full tilt .
There are times in Michael Slater 's indispensable new biography when one simply has to close the book from sheer exhaustion at its subject 's expenditure of energy .
It 's like being sprayed by the ocean .
Even Dickens was astonished at it : " How strange it is , " he said , " to be never at rest ! "
He started Oliver Twist halfway through writing The Pickwick Papers , and halfway through writing Twist he began Nicholas Nickleby , shooting off a constant volley of journalistic fireworks the while .
Nor did he confine himself to literature .
From the beginning , he took up cudgels on behalf of the socially disadvantaged .
He flung himself into social life – dancing , horse - riding , performing conjuring tricks , and putting on shows for his family and friends .
He walked 10 , 12 , 15 miles a day , communing with his imagination , but also seeking out the hidden truths of his society , throwing himself into the darkest recesses of human life .
On holiday in Italy , he climbed up Vesuvius in full eruption , then witnessed a public execution , getting as close as possible to the severed head .
No wonder he observed , when planning the alterations to his new house on Tavistock Square , that " a Cold Shower of the best quality , always charged to an unlimited extent , has become a necessary of life to me . "
A global , all - inclusive biography of such a man is an impossibility .
Recent biographies have each approached their task from a different angle , the most striking , by Peter Ackroyd , being Dickensian itself .
Michael Slater , a seasoned Dickens hand , is altogether more measured , but no whit less exciting .
He assembles a million accumulated details , minutely examining the genesis of each work and demonstrating the thing on which the writer himself so passionately insisted : " My own invention or imagination , such as it is . . . would never have served me as it has but for the habit of commonplace , humble , patient , daily , toiling , drudging attention . "
In the earlier books , Dickens wrote out of brilliant improvisation ( Slater is riveting on the evolution of Oliver Twist out of a piece that was essentially a Boz sketch ) , but from Dombey and Son on , they were meticulously planned .
Making telling use of Dickens 's notes to self ( " Jo . Yes ?
Kill him . . . No. Decide on no love at all " ) , Slater carefully shows how , as each new novel comes to life , their author creates a force field of imagery and thought , feeding the process with current events , preoccupations and accidental meetings .
Forging all this into the massive and complex structures of the later novels became increasingly arduous .
Small wonder that he loved to throw off simpler pieces for the magazines he edited .
These journals , one weekly and one monthly , were absolutely central to his practice as a writer .
It is astonishing to think of books of the scale and integrity of the great last novels being written according to the demands of this form .
No doubt the absolute need to produce copy , to length and on time , suited Dickens 's adrenaline - hungry temperament , but the profundity and brilliance of the writing in the circumstances is awe - inspiring .
He was indifferent to his often frail physical condition : the last chapters of Bleak House were written immediately after an operation , without anaesthetic , on a fistula .
The force of his will is alarming , and often annihilating : he swept up the young actress Ellen Ternan and , because of the necessary secrecy of their life together , made her in effect a prisoner of love , robbing her of her youth and her autonomy ; not for nothing did he call her The Patient in his letters .
Sometimes his willpower is almost comic : when his friend Douglas Jerrold died , he whipped up a huge fund - raising campaign to provide for his widow and children , despite their protests that they were perfectly well - off .
The story of his relationship with his wife Catherine , on the contrary , makes ugly reading : her one jealous reproach of him , when he practised hypnotism on the wife of a friend , is clearly the root of his increasingly savage rejection of her ( " he wrote her out of his life , " says Slater ) , while his children , especially his sons , were the subject of brutally expressed disappointment : " they have , " he wrote , " the curse of limpness on them . "
His feeling for his readers was , by contrast , entirely positive .
His connection with them was like that of no other writer before or since .
The famous public readings were the consummation of this relationship , making him the most celebrated and best loved man of his time .
" To stimulate and rouse the public soul to a compassionate feeling that this must not be " , he unleashed electrifying assaults on poverty , ignorance and injustice , " sledge - hammer blows " delivered in print and in person against government , business interests , moralists .
His warnings to charitable organisations about spending their money on the people they were supposed to benefit , his hatred of statistical manipulation , his denunciation of the incompetent prosecution of military campaigns to the detriment of soldiers , his loathing of the profiteering convolutions of lawyers , his contempt for bankers ( " slobbering , bow - paunched , overfed , apoplectic , snorting cattle " ) all ring loud bells today .
Against this , Slater carefully sets Dickens 's entrenched racism , his derision for the idea of female emancipation and his enthusiastic endorsement of capital punishment .
Slater , who has a nice line in droll asides ( " Dickens can never keep wooden legs out of his writing for long " ) , rarely offers a judgment , but insights abound : noting the triumphant arrival of Sam Weller in The Pickwick Papers , he writes that if Pickwick were " to metamorphose into a Dickens version of Don Quixote , he would need a Sancho Panzo to ground him in reality " .
He takes us compellingly through all the great shocks of Dickens 's life – the blacking factory ; first love ; second love ; the railway accident – but he does n't dwell on them , nor does he speculate on the psychological aspects of his relationship with his father and mother or with Nelly .
Nor does he mention magic , Dickens 's life - long obsession .
All this can be found elsewhere .
His quarry is the writing .
The novels are the tip of a vast iceberg , and Slater introduces us to some miraculous pieces – stories , essays , sketches – and shows how closely connected they are to the novels .
It is especially pleasing that he turns the spotlight on the masterly monologues that Dickens derived from his All the Year Round serials : " The Boy at Mugby " , " Mr Chops the Dwarf " , " Mrs Lirriper " ( in the opening of which he virtually invents stream - of - consciousness writing ) , and his masterpiece in this form , " Doctor Marigold " .
The book is an incomparable portrait of the writing life of Dickens .
Cumulatively , it is profoundly moving , chronicling the constant restless interaction between the life and the work .
Slater quotes to immensely touching effect the account by Forster , Dickens 's best friend and first biographer , of a day trip up river , undertaken to furnish him with material for a chapter he needed to write for Great Expectations : " he seemed to have no care , all of that summer day , except to enjoy [ his friends ' and family 's ] enjoyment and entertain them with his own in the shape of a thousand whims and fancies ; but his sleepless observation was at work all the time , and nothing had escaped his keen vision on either side of the river .

Editors James Patrick Kelly and John Kessel have collected these nineteen stories to explore the supposed divide between mainstream literature and speculative fiction .
They 've written an eye - opening and informative introduction as well as compiled dozens of quotes by the individual authors on the subject of Sci - Fi vs. Literary Fiction or " Li-Fi " *.
Writers and fans in the field have long complained of being marginalized by the general public and even more so by the literary elite .
How did this happen and who 's to blame ?
Does it even freakin ' matter any more ?
Before Hugo Gernsback there was no separate science fiction genre ( or " scientificton " as Gernsback called it , Forrest Ackerman popularized the current two - word term ) .
Writers from Mary Shelly , Hawthorne , Melville , Poe , and Twain used themes of the fantastic in their works that are still considered classics of Literature today .
Jules Verne and H.G. Wells explored advancements in contemporary science and technology and were lauded by audiences around the globe inspiring millions .

As Gernsback and later , John W. Campbell and others codified early science fiction traditions they were deeply mired in the pulp magazine traditions .
Fun stuff to be sure , but the gee - whiz boys ' adventure stuff was very lacking in well - rounded characters and well - crafted plotting .
It has been pointed out recently that even notable award winners of the 1950s were n't really turning out timeless prose .
Let 's face it , the SF Ghetto was constructed from the inside out and zealously maintained from within .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
Around 1970 followers of the New Wave movement like Moorcock , Aldiss , and Disch tried busting out of the ghetto but could never find a large enough audience .
An incursion in the other direction occurred in 1973 when Gravity 's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon was shortlisted for the Nebula for Best Novel .
It lost to Rendezvous with Rama which , with all due respect to Sir Arthur C. Clarke , is a novel with some cool science and a great setting where not much actually happens .
In a 1998 Village Voice essay Jonathan Lethem called this moment " a tombstone marking the death of the hope that science fiction was about to merge with the mainstream " .
Really ?
Maybe it was just too soon .
In the decades since Lethem made that morbid observation popular culture has become very accepting , if not downright starved for science fiction and its fantastical siblings .
Granted , much of that is re-hashing Space Opera pastiches from the 50s or teen vampire fluff , but science fiction prose continues to grow , mature , and inspire .
Besides , I really can't imagine Pynchon as a Guest of Honor at a big convention .
Although he would probably like filking .
To me these concerns over genre distinctions are silly but will probably never go away .
Booksellers and librarians will still need some classifications so that they can direct you to the right shelf .
There will always be a handful of literary elitists in pooh - poohing our favorite books as escapist drek .
And deep within the bowels of SF fandom , grumbles will continue about certain writers abandoning the field for snootier credentials ( O hai Mr. Vonnegut & Ms. Atwood ! ) .
Or even worse , Outsiders coming in to completely destroy all their precious memories of Astro - King vs. the Bimborgs of Pluto ( admit it , a remake of that would totally rock . ) .
The thing to remember is that the distinctions between types of literature are not walls with razorwire to be patrolled .
They are shifting vague zones — grey areas , if you will .

The Secret History of Science Fiction is all about authors mixing it up , exploring , Boldly Going where they like and never sacrificing quality .
These stories are good enough to make The New Yorker 's Eustace Tilley pop his cartoon monocle .
You 'll get profound and often disturbing looks at the human psyche and what we do to each other .
The effects of science and technology upon society are also explored in this volume by writers who really know science fiction , not just slumming .
Instead of quick summaries of these worthy reads I 'm going to close with a few quotes by the authors about this whole imaginary divide of imaginations .
Gene Wolfe :
What we now normally consider the mainstream – so called realistic fiction – is a small literary genre , fairly recent in origin , which is likely to be relatively short lived ....
It 's a matter of whether you 're content to focus on everyday events or whether you want to try to encompass the entire universe .
F you ga back to the literature written in ancient Greece or Rome , or during the Middle Ages and much of the Renaissance , you 'll see writers trying to write not just about everything that exists but about everything that could exist .

Connie Willis :
The thing I have always liked best about science fiction is that it defies definition .
It keeps constantly reinventing itself – and just when you thought stories about robots or time travel or first contact had been done to death , it thinks of some brand - new story to tell .
Advertisement
T.C. Boyle :
I 've thought about the domination of the literary arts by theory over the last 25 years — which I detest – and it's as if you have to be a critic to mediate between the author and the reader and that 's utter crap .
Literature can be great in all ways , but it 's just entertainment like rock 'n ' roll or a film .
It is entertainment .
If it does n't capture you on that level , as entertainment , movement of plot , then it does n't work .
Nothing will come out of it .
The beauty of the language , the characterization , the structure , all that 's irrelevant if you 're not getting the reader on that level – moving a story .
If that 's friendly to readers , I cop to it .

Ursula K. Le Guin :
It seems to me that SF is standing , these days , in a doorway .
The door is open , wide open .
Are we just going to stand there , waiting for the applause of the multitudes ?
It wo n't come ; we have n't earned it yet .
Are we going to cringe back into the safe old ghetto room and pretend that there is n't any big bad multitude out there ?
If so , our good writers will leave us in despair , and there will not be another generation of them .
Or are we going to walk through that doorway and join the rest of the city ?
I hope so .
I know we can and I hope we do , because we have a great deal to offer – to art , which needs new forms like ours , and to critics who are sick of chewing over the same old works and above all to readers of books , who want and deserve better novels than they mostly get .
But it will still take not only courage for SF to join the community of literature , but strength , self - respect , the will not to settle for the second rate .
It will take genuine self - criticism .
And it will include genuine praise .

Commenter Grey_Area is known to Real Literary Critics as Chris Hsiang .
He will not get off their lawns .
Recently a friend of mine approached me with a weird question : how to install Windows on a machine without a CD or Floppy drive .
I was intrigued .
The obvious question here was “ why ? ”
It turned out that he just ordered himself one of those Dell Mini notebooks .
Naturally , like every living being on planet Earth my friend hates Windows Vista with a passion and as a result he did n’t really feel like paying a Vista tax .
So he opted for the Ubuntu version with the intention of installing his copy of Windows XP on the machine .
But while he was in the cost saving mode , he also decided not to purchase the optional external CD drive .
Oops …
That CD drive was sort of there for a reason .
He realized that after it was too late to do anything .
So now he basically wanted to know if it ’s possible to install XP from a USB thumb drive .
Can it be done ?
Apparently , yes it can .
All you need to do , is google for it .
But at the time we were having this conversation I gave him a benefit of the doubt and assumed he already did search it online , and came up empty .
And since I did n’t know the solution of the top of my head , I got a crazy idea .
“ Why do n’t you just keep Ubuntu ? ” I asked him .
I mean , it ’s a Dell Mini with a 16GB solid state drive and a tiny ass screen – he is definitely not going to use that machine for gaming , photoshop or other Windows centric stuff like that .
The machine will likely be used as a hardware extension of a web browser .
The OS is mostly an overhead on a machine like that .
Now , I ’m not a linux evangelist .
I do n’t go around telling people to switch to Linux .
I honestly ca n’t do that anymore because I know that my experience with the OS is irrelevant .
I am a computer geek a software developer and linux enthusiast .
This makes so far removed from the general population , that I can hardly relate to your average Windows user .
Nevertheless I did my best to give him a quick pitch on how the OS will be mostly irrelevant on that machine .
And it will run most of his favorite apps – like firefox for example .
“ Will it run Chrome ? ” he demanded .
Of course it will run chrome .
Then again last time I used Linux version of Chrome Flash did n’t work yet , but they fucking update it daily .
I quickly launched my copy of the browser to check , and lo – it was running flash quite flawlessly now .
My friend was not fully convinced yet .
He started asking me about opening Word documents so I pulled up Open Office and illustrated how it works .
Then I quickly downloaded and burned him a copy of the Gnome based Jaunty to show him what the OS that ships with his Mini will look like ( I ’m running Kubuntu on my laptop , and it looks quite different ) .
I booted it on his laptop , and he was blown away when he realized you can actually run a fully functional OS from the CD like that .
“ But how can it do that ? ”
Well , because it ’s really not that impressive .
I mean , it does n’t really matter whether your OS binaries are on the HD or on some other media .
You have to load them into memory before they get executed anyway – so where they are originally is irrelevant .
There is really no reason why Windows could n’t have a Live CD version .
In fact , you can easily make one with BartPE .
He was also enamored with virtual desktops .
“ It ’s like tabs for your desktop ” he said .
I never thought about them like that , but yes – that ’s a valid analogy .
That ’s technically how these things work .
He was also amazed on how many “ features ” were included in the OS itself .
I had to explain that most of the applications he saw there were really stand alone open source projects – but by virtue of being free software they could be included in the free OS .
To make this long story short , my friend decided to keep Ubuntu on that machine – at least for now .
In fact , he said he might replace it with the Notebook Remix version he found online so he can be running Jaunty ( the Dell ships with Intrepid if I ’m not mistaken ) .
I told him that if he tries Ubuntu can’t deal with it , I ’ll be happy to help him with the XP installation hack .
He nodded , but I ’ve seen that gleam in his eye that told me it wo n’t be needed .
I think our little community might have a brand new member .
Now , I ’m fairly sure my friend will continue using Windows .
I did n’t “ convert ” him and made him into an exclusive Linux user .
But he will give Ubuntu a try , and hopefully will like it becoming an OS agnostic nut bag like me .
And that ’s more than I could ever ask for .
We really do n’t need to convert people , or try to ween them off of Windows .
All we need to do is to show them the alternatives and find places in which they work well – like mini notebooks for example .
This will have far reaching effects .
For one , they will no longer automatically assume that OS == Windows .
They will see that there are different operating systems that can be used for different purposes .
Secondly , they will be now able to call MS on their bullshit as they will see that things can be done differently in the open source world .
Thirdly …
Well , they will be using linux .
The more of us are there , the better .
I do n’t care if he still uses Windows on the other machine – he still counts as one of us .
Marylebone is a thriving , affluent area of central London located within Westminster .
It can be defined roughly as the area of London between Marylebone Road , Oxford Street , Portland Place and Edgware Road .
It also lends its name to a train station and a cricket team in the area .
Marylebone consists mostly of residential and office buildings , with medicine and dentistry particularly prominent .
The area is very sought after and its popularity continues to increase due to it 's central location .
Any part of London is easy to access from Marylebone with great Underground , bus and taxi transportation available .
Many famous landmarks in the area have since disappeared , including Egton House , which used to be where BBC radio 1 had their studios before the building was demolished .
Marylebone Gardens used to host many concerts before closing in 1778 and the Queen 's Hall was a classical concert venue before a fire destroyed it during World War II .
Today , a large amount of men live and work in the area .
Many of them hire the services of Marylebone escorts , because they know that the companionship offered by these gorgeous women is second to none .
With the fast pace of life of central London , demand is very high here so escorts in Marylebone understand how important it is to be punctual , discreet and efficient .
They can meet you at your convenience , at a time and place that suits your schedule .
Men like to hire Marylebone escorts for several different reasons ; some like the thrill of being with a beautiful woman , others are lonely and looking for comfort , and some require a companion for public functions such as corporate events .
Whatever it is you are looking for , Marylebone escorts will adapt to be your perfect date fulfilling all your requirements .
All of the girls at our agency are of the highest standard and are able to come to any location in Marylebone , whether it 's your home or a hotel .
Dear Mr. Levitt ,
The problem of global warming is so big that solving it will require creative thinking from many disciplines .
Economists have much to contribute to this effort , particularly with regard to the question of how various means of putting a price on carbon emissions may alter human behavior .
Some of the lines of thinking in your first book , Freakonomics , could well have had a bearing on this issue , if brought to bear on the carbon emissions problem .
I have very much enjoyed and benefited from the growing collaborations between Geosciences and the Economics department here at the University of Chicago , and had hoped someday to have the pleasure of making your acquaintance .
It is more in disappointment than anger that I am writing to you now .
I am addressing this to you rather than your journalist - coauthor because one has become all too accustomed to tendentious screeds from media personalities ( think Glenn Beck ) with a reckless disregard for the truth .
However , if it has come to pass that we ca n’t expect the William B. Ogden Distinguished Service Professor ( and Clark Medalist to boot ) at a top- rated department of a respected university to think clearly and honestly with numbers , we are indeed in a sad way .
By now there have been many detailed dissections of everything that is wrong with the treatment of climate in Superfreakonomics , but what has been lost amidst all that extensive discussion is how really simple it would have been to get this stuff right .
The problem was n’t necessarily that you talked to the wrong experts or talked to too few of them .
The problem was that you failed to do the most elementary thinking needed to see if what they were saying ( or what you thought they were saying ) in fact made any sense .
If you were stupid , it would n’t be so bad to have messed up such elementary reasoning , but I do n’t by any means think you are stupid .
That makes the failure to do the thinking all the more disappointing .
I will take Nathan Myhrvold ’s claim about solar cells , which you quoted prominently in your book , as an example .
As quoted by you , Mr. Myhrvold claimed , in effect , that it was pointless to try to solve global warming by building solar cells , because they are black and absorb all the solar energy that hits them , but convert only some 12 % to electricity while radiating the rest as heat , warming the planet .
Now , maybe you were dazzled by Mr Myhrvold ’s brilliance , but do n’t we try to teach our students to think for themselves ?
Let ’s go through the arithmetic step by step and see how it comes out .
It ’s not hard .
Let ’s do the thought experiment of building a solar array to generate the entire world ’s present electricity consumption , and see what the extra absorption of sunlight by the array does to climate .
First we need to find the electricity consumption .
Just do a Google search on “ World electricity consumption ” and here you are :
Now , that ’s the total electric energy consumed during the year , and you can turn that into the rate of energy consumption ( measured in Watts , just like the world was one big light bulb ) by dividing kilowatt hours by the number of hours in a year , and multiplying by 1000 to convert kilowatts into watts .
The answer is two trillion Watts , in round numbers .
How much area of solar cells do you need to generate this ?
On average , about 200 Watts falls on each square meter of Earth ’s surface , but you might preferentially put your cells in sunnier , clearer places , so let ’s call it 250 Watts per square meter .
With a 15 % efficiency , which is middling for present technology the area you need is
2 trillion Watts /(.15 X 250 .
Watts per square meter )
or 53,333 square kilometers .
That ’s a square 231 kilometers on a side , or about the size of a single cell of a typical general circulation model grid box .
If we put it on the globe , it looks like this :
So already you should be beginning to suspect that this is a pretty trivial part of the Earth ’s surface , and maybe unlikely to have much of an effect on the overall absorbed sunlight .
In fact , it ’s only 0.01 % of the Earth ’s surface .
The numbers I used to do this calculation can all be found in Wikipedia , or even in a good paperbound World Almanac .
But we should go further , and look at the actual amount of extra solar energy absorbed .
As many reviewers of Superfreakonomics have noted , solar cells are n’t actually black , but that ’s not the main issue .
For the sake of argument , let ’s just assume they absorb all the sunlight that falls on them .
In my business , we call that “ zero albedo ” ( i.e. zero reflectivity ) .
As many commentators also noted , the albedo of real solar cells is no lower than materials like roofs that they are often placed on , so that solar cells do n’t necessarily increase absorbed solar energy at all .
Let ’s ignore that , though .
After all , you might want to put your solar cells in the desert , and you might try to cool the planet by painting your roof white .
The albedo of desert sand can also be found easily by doing a Google search on “ Albedo Sahara Desert , ” for example .
Here ’s what you get :
So , let ’s say that sand has a 50 % albedo .
That means that each square meter of black solar cell absorbs an extra 125 Watts that otherwise would have been reflected by the sand ( i.e. 50 % of the 250 Watts per square meter of sunlight ) .
Multiplying by the area of solar cell , we get 6.66 trillion Watts .
That 6.66 trillion Watts is the “ waste heat ” that is a byproduct of generating electricity by using solar cells .
All means of generating electricity involve waste heat , and fossil fuels are not an exception .
A typical coal - fired power plant only is around 33 % efficient , so you would need to release 6 trillion Watts of heat to burn the coal to make our 2 trillion Watts of electricity .
That makes the waste heat of solar cells vs. coal basically a wash , and we could stop right there , but let ’s continue our exercise in thinking with numbers anyway .
Wherever it comes from , waste heat is not usually taken into account in global climate calculations for the simple reason that it is utterly trivial in comparison to the heat trapped by the carbon dioxide that is released when you burn fossil fuels to supply energy .
For example , that 6 trillion Watts of waste heat from coal burning would amount to only 0.012 Watts per square meter of the Earth ’s surface .
Without even thinking very hard , you can realize that this is a tiny number compared to the heat - trapping effect of CO2 .
As a general point of reference , the extra heat trapped by CO2 at the point where you ’ve burned enough coal to double the atmospheric CO2 concentration is about 4
Watts per square meter of the Earth ’s surface — over 300 times the effect of the waste heat .
The “ 4 Watts per square meter ” statistic gives us an easy point of reference because it is available from any number of easily accessible sources , such as the IPCC Technical Summary or David Archer ’s basic textbook that came out of our “ Global Warming for Poets ” core course .
Another simple way to grasp the insignificance of the waste heat effect is to turn it into a temperature change using the standard climate sensitivity of 1 degree C of warming for each 2
Watts per square meter of heat added to the energy budget of the planet ( this sensitivity factor also being readily available from sources like the ones I just pointed out ) .
That gives us a warming of 0.006 degrees C for the waste heat from coal burning , and much less for the incremental heat from switching to solar cells .
It does n’t take a lot of thinking to realize that this is a trivial number compared to the magnitude of warming expected from a doubling of CO2 .
With just a little more calculation , it ’s possible to do a more precise and informative comparison .
For coal - fired generation , each kilowatt - hour produced results in emissions of about a quarter kilogram of carbon into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide .
For our 16.83 trillion kilowatt - hours of electricity produced each year , we then would emit 4.2 trillion kilograms of carbon , i.e. 4.2 gigatonnes each year .
Unlike energy , carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere , and builds up year after year .
It is only slowly removed by absorption into the ocean , over hundreds to thousands of years .
After a hundred years , 420 gigatonnes will have been emitted , and if half that remains in the atmosphere ( remember , rough estimates suffice to make the point here ) the atmospheric stock of CO2 carbon will increase by 210 gigatonnes , or 30 % of the pre-industrial atmospheric stock of about 700 gigatonnes of carbon .
To get the heat trapped by CO2 from that amount of increase , we need to reach all the way back into middle - school math and use the awesome tool of logarithms ; the number is
( 4 Watts per square meter ) X log 2 ( 1.3 )
or 1.5 Watts per square meter .
In other words , by the time a hundred years have passed , the heat trapped each year from the CO2 emitted by using coal instead of solar energy to produce electricity is 125 times the effect of the fossil fuel waste heat .
And remember that the incremental waste heat from switching to solar cells is even smaller than the fossil fuel waste heat .
What ’s more , because each passing year sees more CO2 accumulate in the atmosphere , the heat trapping by CO2 continues to go up , while the effect of the waste heat from the fossil fuels or solar cells needed to produce a given amount of electricity stays fixed .
Another way of putting it is that the climate effect from the waste heat produced by any kind of power plant is a one - off thing that you incur when you build the plant , whereas the warming effect of the CO2 produced by fossil fuel plants continues to accumulate year after year .
The warming effect of the CO2 is a legacy that will continue for many centuries after the coal has run out and the ruins of the power plant are moldering away .
Note that you do n’t actually have to wait a hundred years to see the benefit of switching to solar cells .
The same arithmetic shows that even at the end of the very first year of operation , the CO2 emissions prevented by the solar array would have trapped 0.017
Watts per square meter if released into the atmosphere .
So , at the end of the first year you already come out ahead even if you neglect the waste heat that would have been emitted by burning fossil fuels instead .
So , the bottom line here is that the heat - trapping effect of CO2 is the 800 - pound gorilla in climate change .
In comparison , waste heat is a trivial contribution to global warming whether the waste heat comes from solar cells or from fossil fuels .
Moreover , the incremental waste heat from switching from coal to solar is an even more trivial number , even if you allow for some improvement in the efficiency of coal - fired power plants and ignore any possible improvements in the efficiency of solar cells .
So : trivial , trivial trivial .
Simple , is n’t it ?
By the way , the issue of whether waste heat is an important factor in global warming is one of the questions most commonly asked by students who are first learning about energy budgets and climate change .
So , there are no shortage of places where you can learn about this sort of thing .
For example , a simple Google search on the words “ Global Warming Waste Heat ” turns up several pages of accurate references explaining the issue in elementary terms for beginners .
Including this article from Wikipedia :
A more substantive ( though in the end almost equally trivial ) issue is the carbon emitted in the course of manufacturing solar cells , but that is not the matter at hand here .
The point here is that really simple arithmetic , which you could not be bothered to do , would have been enough to tell you that the claim that the blackness of solar cells makes solar energy pointless is complete and utter nonsense .
I do n’t think you would have accepted such laziness and sloppiness in a term paper from one of your students , so why do you accept it from yourself ?
What does the failure to do such basic thinking with numbers say about the extent to which anything you write can be trusted ?
How do you think it reflects on the profession of economics when a member of that profession — somebody who that profession seems to esteem highly — publicly and noisily shows that he cannot be bothered to do simple arithmetic and elementary background reading ?
Not even for a subject of such paramount importance as global warming .
And it ’s not as if the “ black solar cell ” gaffe was the only bit of academic malpractice in your book : among other things , the presentation of aerosol geoengineering as a harmless and cheap quick fix for global warming ignored a great deal of accessible and readily available material on the severe risks involved , as Gavin noted in his recent post .
The fault here is not that you dared to advocate geoengineering as a solution .
There is a broad spectrum of opinion among scientists about the amount of aerosol geoengineering research that is justified , but very few scientists think of it as anything but a desperate last - ditch attempt , or at best a strategy to be used in extreme moderation as part of a basket of strategies dominated by emissions reductions .
You owed it to your readers to present a fair picture of the consequences of geoengineering , but chose not to do so .
May I suggest that if you should happen to need some friendly help next time you take on the topic of climate change , or would like to have a chat about why aerosol geoengineering might not be a cure - all , or just need a critical but informed opponent to bounce ideas off of , you do n’t have to go very far .
For example …
But given the way Superfreakonomics mangled Ken Caldeira ’s rather nuanced views on geoengineering , let ’s keep it off the record , eh ?

Something strange and a little disorienting is happening in the fight to reform Wall Street :
It looks like the reformers are actually starting to win .
This is not something you could have said as recently as six weeks ago .
Back then , House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank had just released a proposal to regulate derivatives , essentially bets on the movements of other assets ( like stocks , bonds , commodities ) or interest rates .
Derivatives are in some respects the key battle in the broader regulatory campaign .
They were at the center of last fall ’s financial crisis -- Lehman ’s balance sheet was stacked with them , and they triggered AIG ’s collapse .
But because they ’re so poorly understood by the general public , the fight has unfolded almost entirely in Congressional backrooms , where the banks and their lobbyists naturally have the upper hand .
Frank ’s " discussion draft " seemed to reflect that .
The proposal the Obama administration unveiled this summer would have forced banks and hedge funds to trade derivatives on exchanges and “ centrally clear ” them .
Clearing means inserting a well - capitalized middleman between two parties on either side of a trade .
When derivatives trades are cleared , the failure of one institution does n’t threaten everyone else it has traded with , which is what happened with Lehman .
The only downside is that clearing requires the trader to post margin - - a kind of cash cushion -- to the middleman , which they ’re generally loath to do .
Before long , dozens of companies were flocking to Congress to plead their case .
In order to ensure the measure ’s eventual passage , Frank found himself having to strike a deal with a group of moderate New Democrats on his committee .
The so - called “ end-user exemption ” they settled on would give a pass to industrial companies that use derivatives simply to hedge the risk that , say , oil prices or interest rates might rise .
The thinking was that hedging by the Caterpillars and the 3Ms of the world was n’t what brought down the financial system last fall ; it was speculation by the likes of Lehman .
The New Dems who supported the compromise argued that it would only exempt some 15 percent of standardized derivatives contracts .
( That is , contracts that follow a straight - forward template , which reformers want to force onto exchanges . )
But independent experts who studied the measure came to a different conclusion : that it could exempt between 60 and 80 percent of the standardized market because of its vague wording , including many firms who were speculating rather than simply hedging risk .
A few days after Frank unveiled his draft , Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Gary Gensler , official Washington ’s leading advocate of regulating derivatives , testified about his concern that the compromise “ could have the unintended consequence of exempting a broad range of entities , ” possibly even major Wall Street firms .
Will GM Spend Taxpayer Bailout Money on Overseas Operations ?
U.S. operations that received taxpayer funds may send millions overseas .
SHANGHAI , CHINA , Nov. 16 , 2009  --
At a meeting with President Obama Monday morning , Communist Party Secretary Yu Xheng Sheng told the U.S. president how well General Motors ' Chinese division was doing .
" The business of GM in Shanghai is pretty good , " Secretary Yu told the president .
" By the end of October this year their sales has increased by 40 percent over the same period of last year .
I think that the fantastic performance here in Shanghai is definitely a boost to their business in the United States . "
" Absolutely , " said President Obama .
" I think they can learn from their operations here in terms of increasing sales back in the United States . "
But some critics wonder if GM is a little too focused on its international operations .
Specifically , at a time when the nation 's unemployment rate has soared to levels not seen in decades and GM is cutting thousands of U.S. jobs , the company 's CEO is considering spending millions from its U.S. coffers -- fattened by $ 50 billion in taxpayer aid -- on its overseas operations , a possibility that has outraged critics and lawmakers .
" I do n't think most Americans believe that when the taxpayer bailouts were happening it was intended for that purpose , " said Rep. Anthony Weiner , D - N.Y .
" It was intended to protect the American economy -- not take the money overseas . "
GM today reported that it lost $ 1.2 billion in the third quarter , from the time it left bankruptcy protection through Sept. 30 .
GM's Chief Executive Fritz Henderson recently announced that the bailed - out automaker might use its U.S. funds to help restructure its European unit Opel , noting that the financing agreements with the Treasury for the $ 34 billion of bailout funds already spent allow GM to spend any subsequently earned funds as its executives see fit .
Some $ 16 billion remaining after its bankruptcy has strings attached .
In a world where funds are fungible , where GM has yet to repay the $ 50 billion bailout , and where GM only remains in existence because of those bailout dollars , critics argue sending these funds to Europe is essentially the same as sending taxpayer dollars overseas .
" We certainly need to be prudent about it , be very careful about it , but we do have the ability to run a global business , " Henderson told reporters earlier this month .
GM has other plans to expand its business abroad .
In August , GM China announced a $ 293 million venture , while last month GM South Korea announced a new infusion of more than $ 400 million .
The automaker also recently inaugurated a $ 300 million transmission plant in Mexico .
The reasons for international expansion are obvious -- Asia , for instance , is the fastest - growing economic region in the world , forecast to grow at a 7 percent rate next year .
A GM spokesman noted that the best way for the Detroit automaker to repay American taxpayers is to be strong internationally .
" As much as some people might wish that it were not so , the reality is that the auto industry is global , and no company can survive without a strong global presence , " said GM spokesman Tom Wilkinson .
" Any dream of a U.S. - only carmaker is just that : a dream . "
Wilkinson said " the exit financing agreement for the new GM does permit some money earned by GM here to be used for non-U.S. operations . "
The Treasury Department declined to comment on whether it was appropriate for GM to send money from its U.S. accounts to shore up its European operations .
Wilkinson said Treasury " realizes that the best way for taxpayers to maximize their return is for GM to be a strong , healthy company . "
Others say that while it may be legal , that does n't make it right .
" I do n't believe that it is consistent with the original objective so I would say it 's not wise or helpful that our taxpayer dollars are being used to support the global efforts of these companies , " said Thomas Hopkins , professor of economics at the Rochester Institute of Technology .
Said Rep.
Weiner , GM " might legally have the right to do this , but politically and from an optics perspective I can't imagine a more boneheaded move . "
When President Obama announced his plan to send GM into bankruptcy , he pledged an initial $ 30 billion of taxpayer aid to help the automaker emerge from the process successfully , casting the investment as a way to save American jobs .
" GM is an American company with tens of thousands of employees in this country , and responsibility for its future ultimately rests with us , " the President said June 1 at the White House .
" That 's why our government will be making a significant additional investment of about $ 30 billion in GM – an investment that will entitle American taxpayers to ownership of about 60 percent of the new GM . "
It is precisely that 60 percent ownership stake that could make American taxpayers open to GM doing whatever it takes to be successful and eventually repay its bailout funds , even if that means expanding abroad .
" GM is trying to make a profit , " said Dan Ikenson of the Cato Institute .
" They know best how to do that .
We should not infringe on their decision - making . "
However , a government watchdog group recently warned that it was " unlikely " that American taxpayers would receive a full return on their investment in GM .
" Treasury is unlikely to recover the entirety of its investment in Chrysler or GM , given that the companies ' values would have to grow substantially above what they have been in the past , " the Government Accountability Office said in a Nov. 2 report .
Speaking in Washington last month about GM 's future prospects , Steve Rattner , the former head of the Obama administration 's auto task force , said , " Like any patient that undergoes major surgery , a successful recovery is far from assured . "
On Monday morning GM will release its third - quarter earnings report .
Sources familiar with the announcement told ABC News that the automaker will state that it aims to repay taxpayers $ 1 billion per quarter , starting in December .
ABC News ' Dan Arnall and Jessica Hoffman contributed to this report .
Yes , I know that Final Fantasy Tactics was re-released as a PSP game .
It 's just that as lover of the early disc - based consoles , I like that old school flavor ... and that horrible PSP screen stretching .
That 's right , the original strategy role - playing gateway drug for many is up on the PlayStation Network as a PS3 or PSOne Classic Download .
They 're asking $ 9.99 for this ticket back to old Ivalice .
It 's worth it , you know .
Fantastic videogame , this is .
Make sure you have 214 mb free .
Also available today is the not as cool Tomb Raider III .
Sorry , Eidos or whatever your name is .
Boobs and guns are n't as cool as FFT 's Job System and storybook narration .
It looks like they realize this , because Tomb Raider III is only $ 5.99 ( 366 mb ) .

Driving home from Boston Friday night , I caught much of an interview on Tom Ashbrook ’s public radio program , On Point .
The interview was with Robert Diggs – the RZA – the founder and leader of Wu Tang Clan , one of the most influential groups in hiphop .
RZA was pitching his new book , “ The Tao of Wu “ , which his publisher describes as “ a spiritual memoir ” .
For those of you who do n’t follow hiphop , Wu Tang revived the fortunes of east coast hiphop in the early 1990s – the center of gravity in the rap world had moved from the outer boroughs of NYC to the West Coast and Dr. Dre ’s project – with an astoundingly fine album .
“ Enter The Wu Tang ( 36 Chambers ) ” featured nine skilled MCs , dark and sinister beats , and wonderfully cheezy samples from Hong Kong kung fu films .
It sounded like nothing anyone had heard before , and it sounds remarkably fresh almost two decades later .
Ashbrook asked RZA about his interest in those films , revealing a personal interest in the answer – in the early 1990s , Ashbrook tells his listeners , he was living in Hong Kong , moonlight from his life as a journalist , dubbing kung fu flicks .
It ’s possible , he tells RZA , that his was the voice in those childhood films .
RZA shares a story about a long night on Staten Island with his cousin Russell ( Ol’ Dirty Bastard ) that ended with the two looking for a safe place to sleep and visiting a local movie theatre that alternated between porn and kung fu flicks .
While ODB slept , RZA found himself fascinated by the philosophy expressed in the films .
Explaining the significance of the knug fu flicks to Ashbrook , RZA mentions that his universe , growing up in Staten Island and Brooklyn , was a pretty limited one .
Kung fu films offered a picture of life in a different place , a world where people of color were badass :
When we watch TV in those days in America , there was n’t a lot of channels …
TV programming was limited .
When you see a martial arts film , you had a chance to see a time in history that was n’t just what the western world was showing us .
And especially as a young black man , you know , most of the black figures you ’d see were some kind of slaves , some kind of pimps , not the sort of heroes who would inspire you .
But through the martial arts films , I was seeing great heroes that inspired me , in the past , hundreds or thousands of years ago .
It gave me another perception of history …
It gave me a whole interest in finding out what was going on in that period of time , not only in Asia , what about in Africa , Australia ?
It takes some work to find opportunities for intercultural encounter and xenophilia in kung fu films , but it ’s clear that RZA was looking for something beyond the intellectual influences he was encountering in his own community .
RZA and many of the Wu Tang were involved with The Nation of Gods and Earths , an offshoot of the Nation of Islam sometimes referred to as “ the Five Percenters ” , which offers a complex , syncretic worldview with emphasis on numerology and other esoterica .
He ’s subsequently found inspiration in Islam , Christianity , Taoism and in chess .
While I found that the snippets of philosophy RZA offered in an hour - long interview alternated between profound and goofy , I ’ve got nothing but respect for a mind that found a path from kung fu flicks to religious study via hiphop .
I was n’t listening to Wu Tang when 36 Chambers first dropped .
I was living in Ghana and the local soundtrack was heavy on Whitney Houston ’s “ I Will Always Love You ” and lots of country music .
( Seriously .
Surprised me , too . )
But as I started travelling around the world , I began noticing that the Wu was everywhere .
In Ulaanbaatar , the most common tags were n’t in Cyrillic – they were “ Wu Tang ” and the Wu symbol .
Ulaanbaatar .
There ’s a “ Wu Tang ” on the right side of the middle mural .
I never heard much Wu in Ghana – the lyrics are a little raw for Ghanaian tastes , which tend to run towards versus you can recite on the way to church .
But friends took me to a corner of Nima , one of Accra ’s rougher neighborhoods , that had been dubbed “ Alaksa ” .
I understood the name immediately – local style dictated that you wear a puffy down coat , as members of the Wu did in most of their publicity photos .
Wearing actual down jackets in West Africa is impractical , so shops existed to “ convert ” winter coats to be Ghana - compatible .
Tailors carefully ripped seams on the jackets , removed the down and restuffed the coats with crumpled newspapers , which gave the requisite puffy look but were less insulative .
They were n’t cheap – kids were paying almost fifty bucks for a converted coat , and they were selling well .
What ’s more incredible : that kung fu flicks turned a middle school dropout into a millionaire artist , or that a musical and stylistic statement from Staten Island would shape culture in Mongolia and Ghana ?
( That may be a trick question .
There ’s a deep Central Asia / hip - hop connection , as exemplified in Joe Sabia ’s “ Tupac in Kazakhstan ” video .
Sabia filmed the video – which features a couple dozen Kazakhs reciting lines from Tupac ’s “ Changes ” – while racing in the Mongol rally , an overland race from the UK to Mongolia .
Unclear to me how Sabia staged the footage , but it certainly seems like many of the folks Sabia filmed knew and loved the song in question … or perhaps it ’s complex revenge on Borat .
Unclear . )
What quirk of character leads a person to search for new and different perspectives ?
John Hummel is an interesting case study .
A lapsed Mormon , Hummel decided to spend a year encountering 52 different religions , one a week , and documenting the encounters through audio interviews and blog posts .
His visits thus far have included mosques , synagogues , churches , and temples , and he ’s interviewed Buddhists , Baptists , Wiccans , Satanists and several flavors of humanists , including Atheists .
Not every experience is fully comprehensible to him – many faiths lead long services that involve languages he does n’t speak – but he ’s got a gift for finding moments of beauty in every encounter :
The next day I had a chance to interview Pastor Singh .
We spoke of how the Sikh religion started , the beliefs and practices .
The entire time , he and his congregation were gracious , making sure my needs were met .
When I left , he was still making sure I had anything I needed – water for my trip , a bit of food if I was hungry .
I did n’t , but asked him if there was anything he needed .
His eyes twinkled as he patted me on the arm .
“ All I need if your love , my friend , ” he told me .
I was wrong .
It ’s not the discovery of the unknown that ’s the best part .
It ’s meeting the people .
Hummel now identifies as an atheist , but he ’s putting significant work into an exploration of a wide set of religions , attending a service a week and reading at least one text significant or sacred to the people he ’s meeting with .
His goals are complicated – he ’s trying to demonstrate that religions he knows nothing about are n’t evil cults , but groups of people who want to be good and help one another .
But there ’s another motivation – a fascination with the unknown : “ Then I found myself with a lot of free time on my hands , and a lot of curiosity .
Like ‘ I wonder what the people in that church down the road believe .
And what they do to help the community . ’
Or ‘ That temple looks really keen – I wonder what they do in there ? ' ”
What turns curiosity into action ?
What convinces a former Mormon to seek out – and hug – Tibetan Buddhists ?
Or visit a different New York City mosque on each evening of Ramadan ?
To step out of a kung fu movie and start reading Lao Tzu ?
And how do we cultivate lots , lots more of it ?

Liberty
The libertarians , especially social conservatives , need to realize that they do try to protect rich too much even though it's the rich who created the Fed and many of our current economic problems .
It 's the rich , after all , who can afford to thrive during times of moderate to high inflation because they can hire a team of accountants , investment bankers and so on to ride the rough waters of fiat capitalism .
Some well - meaning libertarians , being perpetually out of power , are gradually seduced into supporting right - wing bombthrowers like Glenn Beck , which only makes them look stupid , racist , backwards and irrational to a liberal .
The tea parties have not succeeded because they are partisan and co-opted by mainstream Republican politicians like Minnesota 's own Michele Bachmann , tapping into anger and doing nothing to really change things .
If they were non-partisan End the Fed rallies that might be a step in the right direction .
But many libertarians hate liberals because the Democrats who get elected tend to be corrupt establishment figures -- just like Republican politicians .
Conversely , the leftist populists need to realize that Obama is not the savior they want him to be .
He 's a politican like any other and he 's just playing the game .
Note how little has changed since he took office .
He 's made lots of noise about change , but our Empire is still killing peasants in Afghanistan , our privacy is still nonextistent as warrantless wiretapping continues , and our economy is still in the thrall of the rich as Bernanke gets re-upped for another term and the idiots who supported deregulation ( like Summers ) get cushy jobs in the administration .
Meanwhile , Obama 's tackling ( and losing ) the health care fight when he should be focused on the economy first and foremost .
I support universal healthcare , but the conservatives are right to question how we 're gonna pay for it .
Should n't we get our economic house in order before we make massive commitments to future spending ?
The health care conundrum is a medium - sized part of our economic problems .
The bigger problem is exactly what the Libertarians are talking about ( and what progressive left - wing publications like the HuffPo are finally starting to realize ) :
The secretive Fed 's embrace of fiat currency and fractional reserve banking will make peasants of us all This government , and everything in it ( including Obama ) is controlled by the banking apparatus .
Look at how quickly the bailout and stimulus packages were passed in comparison to health care reform .
And yet we could 've easily paid for health care for every single American with the money we threw at the bankers so they could erase the red ink from their bottom lines and then refuse to give loans to regular people .
Bonuses to executives are already back to pre-crash levels .
My point is that unless we fix the underlying issue we 'll be back at square one again .
Unless a new amendment is added to the Bill of Rightsfree health care for all ( not bloody likely ) the bankers will find a way to put us back in the poor house again .
Congress will bankrupt whatever public option we create unless it is rock - fucking - solid .
Because of the inflationarydemographic bubbles we face , Social Security and Medicare will likely go bankrupt within a few decades .
How will adding more financial obligations to the pile help us solve this mess ?
The typical libertarian response is to say " Get government off my back ! "
I think libertarians are susceptible to Republican messaging because the Republican politiciansto be in favor of limited government .
And both libertarians and Republicans see poor people as failed and lazy .
Here 's something libertarians can learn from liberals : Sometimes the main forces that cause poverty really are society 's fault .
More specifically to blame : government and corporate interests from banking to health care who are in favor of fiscally incapacitated citizens who thus become dependent on the state and the state 's favored corporations .
Fiat currency and fractional reserve lending have created the underlying conditions that make this economic incapacitation possible .
Liberals have traditionally tried to solve this problem with even more government intervention .
They see government as a tool they can use to elevate the playing field and give those people a shot at crawling out of poverty and back to fiscal independence .
Libertarians have largely cried foul but have n't proposed a practical solution and have in fact fallen for Republican Party propaganda ( especially on taxes ) when they should have stood with the poor .
It is the poor who suffer most from the Fed 's policies .
Yet liberals who think we can continue to spend our way out of this mess are sadly mistaken .
In fact , we 've already spent far too much .
It is perhaps the best response to the problem within the context of an inflationary world , but the Keynesian approach will ultimately collapse because the inflation is too destabilizing and it's also incredibly iniquitous .
Who here gets a check for inflation each month ?
Not me , but because of fractional reserve lending practices , banks benefit disproportionately from inflation .
Liberals , just like right - leaning libertarians , are inadvertantly supporting the rich elites who create the problems they decry .
This crisis threatens to rend our nation apart but also presents an opportunity ; a chance to end the Fed and the economic inequity it has wrought .
And the only way that can happen is by unifying liberals and libertarians once again .
Their names come from the same root word , after all --.
Both sides need to make bold changes to come together , but the only way to achieve true economic liberty is by a combination of tight regulation of banks and specie - backed currency .
We have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence .
" Necessitous men are not free men . "
People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made .
Political liberty cannot come without economic liberty .
A lot of Libertarians hate Franklin Delano Roosevelt , but what they do n't seem to realize is that he was fighting an all - out war against the corrupt banking and corporate interests who were colluding against the common man , and the levers of government were the only powers the president had available to him .
The banker - controlled Fed , after all , caused the first Great Depression and FDR was forced to act quickly to stem the bleeding .
Read this link for more insight into FDR and why he abandoned the gold standard -- Europeans had already ditched gold and were buying up ours with their fiat currency , but FDR wanted to work out an international gold standard once the crisis subsided .
And indeed , Bretton Woods was an attempt to do just that .
Roosevelt has been slandered as anti-business by many on the right .
He was not ; he was anti-Big Business .
He stood up for all of America , not just the plutocrats .
FDR 's Keynesian solution was imperfect but it bought time and saved the Union .
If he had not acted quickly the Business Plot of 1934 may have succeeded and America may have spiraled into despotic fascism , never to return .
Some libertarians have not been sufficiently suspicious of the motives of Big Business .
They think that corporate rights are the same as personal liberty .
They are not .
Corporations are amoral machines that must be controlled .
Men should be free to do what they will , but who among us will argue that a man is free to run over people in his car because , by golly , he paid for that car and he controls it and he uses it to make money for his family , so anybody who tries to stop him is abridging his rights ?
Well , we should n't let corporations driven by men to run amok any more than we should allow that of motor vehicle operators .
It is imperative that libertarians understand that economic freedom is more fundamental and more important than corporate power .
Liberals , meanwhile , have long regarded libertarians a bunch of kooks ; militia - joining types who are all paranoid gold - bugs who believe in anarchic and anachronistic principles .
But libertarians have learned the hard way that governments can resort to tyranny whether they 're controlled by the Democrats or the Republicans .
Democratic attempts to solve our basic economic problems have either been limp - wristed or misguided .
Liberals need to take a look at the constitutional principles libertarians stand by and realize how closely they align with progressivism .
Most importantly , liberals need to get past the false " left vs. right " dichotomy that the elites use to divide and conquer us .
The marginalized , but proud Libertarian voters have defiantly supported their minor party despite no chance of winning .
Perhaps liberals will have more respect for libertarians and their journey through the political wilderness after the last 8 years of suffering their own indignity .
Soured on big , invasive government ( wiretapping , No Child Left Behind , literal invasions ) during the Bush years , this is the ideal time for liberals to wake up and realize that they can only secure the freedom and prosperity by looking beyond the political and focusing on the very most fundamental monetary elements of our economy upon which the government and society are built .
Libertarians are not greedy to focus on money ; they are prudent .
Unless we have a secure gold - backed money supply we will continue to have these crises , and at some point we can't continue to solve them through social programs and endless spending .
Inflation creates the poverty that we all fear .
It 's time to end it .
This is my plea for liberals and libertarians to work together and remove the Federal Reserve 's charter .
It 's time to take back our economic liberty .
We do n't have much time to waste .
Officially , the Dreamcast died an ugly death at the hands of the PlayStation 2 .
The system did n't have the support of EA .
Sega could n't compete with Sony on marketing , the inclusion of a DVD drive , and the backwards compatibility included with the PlayStation 2 .
The end result is that Sega became what it is now : a software company .
That 's the official story , at least .
Sega never picked up enough steam to put Sony down , but it did have enough power to kick the giant in the teeth .
In the minds of gamers , the Dreamcast was an unqualified success .
The system had much better 2D capabilities than the PlayStation 2 , making fighting games and shooters on the system a joy to play .
It included a modem , and later an optional — if hard - to - find — broadband accessory ; the system came with a Web browser and a telephone cable in the box so users could go online the second they opened the system .
The system included four , count 'em , four controller ports .
You could buy a VGA adaptor to play games on screens that supported 480 p long before high definition televisions were common .
The Dreamcast launched on September 9 , 1999 , exactly ten years ago .
Today 's Sega bears almost no resemblance to the company it was back then .
Sonic Adventure brought the hedgehog into the 3D world gracefully , and even introduced some friends without becoming cloyingly cutesy ( although some may argue that point ) .
The Dreamcast took risks , with the virtual life title Seaman captivating , if confounding , audiences in both the US and Japan .
You spoke to the unattractive titular character through an included microphone , and he spoke back .
Was it fun ?
Maybe not , and that seemed almost the point .
On the Dreamcast , developers and publishers were brave and forward - thinking .
You can find echoes of the Dreamcast 's games in what we play today .
Rez was never formally released in the United States on the Dreamcast , although the trippy mixture of music and shooting would inform and inspire games like Everyday Shooter , Amplitude and Frequency .
And of course developer Q? Entertainment would go on to create one of the PSP 's earliest killers apps , Lumines .
While EA never supported the system , it barely mattered .
Sega and Visual Concepts released the impossibly high - quality NFL2KX series , as well as NHL2KX titles .
For many of us , these titles were more impressive than the EA competition , and continued to be fan favorites until EA 's Football monopoly forced the NFL2 K series out of the running .
If you did n't care about football or hockey , the Virtua Tennis series brought a deep but accessible tennis experience to consoles , and the four controller ports allowed you to invite friends over for a nice set of doubles .
Power Stone was another game that used the four controller ports to great effect , giving us a four - way brawler that still impresses with frantic action and strong character design .
Other titles have tried to recreate Capcom 's fan favorite , but few have come close .
It 's worth pointing out that Marvel vs. Capcom 2 on both the PS3 and Xbox 360 is based on the Dreamcast code of the game .
There are multiple games , across multiple genres that are still considered definitive on Sega 's white console .
Sega never picked up enough steam to put Sony down , but it did have enough power to kick the giant in the teeth .
The Dreamcast launched at a lower price point than the PlayStation 2 , and delivered more features .
The launch lineup of games included enough classics to choke a horse : if you were n't blown away by the graphics and features of Soul Calibur on 9 - 9 - 99 when you took home your system then there was a hole in your soul .
Hydro Thunder looked great on the system .
NFL2 K made us forget about EA 's snub .
Sonic Adventure was the rare 3D Sonic title that was n't terrible .
House of the Dead 2 looked arcade - perfect .
Think of how many Dreamcast games that launched on that day that are still considered classics , and then take a look at the PlayStation 2 launch library .
Sony launched with mediocre games , two controller ports , no online features , and games that did n't look as good as what we were used to from the less - expensive Dreamcast .
Sony had done a wonderful job taking out the Dreamcast 's knees with a high level of hype and promises that were impossible to keep , but at the end of the day the PlayStation 2 had Madden , it worked with your existing PlayStation
One library , and it had a DVD player built - in , a rarity in the year 2000 .
At this point gamers also realized how simple it was to pirate Dreamcast games , meaning that with a little bit of know - how you did n't need to buy another game .
The writing was on the wall , and in 2001 Sega ceased production of the system .
Soon afterward , the company began developing games for competing consoles .
The Dreamcast barely made it through half a generation , but the system remains one of the most beloved and collected pieces of hardware ever released .
The games , especially those 2D shooters and fighting titles , are now collector 's items , fetching a high price on the secondary market .
The faithful have held onto their visual memory units , their fishing controllers , and their lightguns and keyboards .
In many ways , the PlayStation 2 brought gaming to the mainstream , and Sony 's system was home to its own share of wonderful games .
For those of us who waited in line ten years ago , however , the Dreamcast was one of the last great systems for the hardcore gamer .
Dreamcast developers and publishers gave us offbeat titles , began working in genres that are only now maturing , and fed our love for the quirky , the quality , and the unexpected .
It brought the arcade into our homes .
It made online gaming work on consoles .
It was non-threatening and approachable way before the Wii made this the generation of casual and family gaming .
Gaming owes worlds to the Sega 's system , and today is the day for us to pay our respects .
Get your Dreamcast out of the closet , plug in some controllers , and enjoy .
And always remember : it 's thinking .
Dreams remembered : a look back
While making a definitive list of the best games for the Dreamcast is a daunting task , let 's take a moment to remember just a few of the games that gave the system part of its distinctive charm .
Soul Calibur
The graphics do n't look like much today , but you have to remember when the Dreamcast launched with Soul Calibur we were still happily playing our PlayStation One systems .
Sony 's first stab at the PlayStation was advanced for its time , but it was also released at the beginning of the 3D revolution ; Soul Calibur was the first time many gamers had seen mature , attractive 3D graphics in a fighting game .
The weapons - based combat was attractive , fast , and easy to play for button mashers while maintaining some depth for the hardcore .
The series has since had its ups and downs , but Soul Calibur on the Dreamcast is a game that almost everyone who played it remembers fondly .
ANALYSIS / OPINION :
The death of Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud is a major victory in the ongoing struggle against terrorism .
Mehsud ’s demise Wednesday by Hellfire missile is also a vindication of a controversial U.S. military program that has produced dramatic results .
President George W. Bush authorized the expanded use of unmanned attack drones in August 2008 .
At the time , Pakistan had a Top 20 list of targets .
The program was so successful that nine months later , more than half the targets had been hit , and Pakistan issued a new Top 20 list .
President Obama has continued this program despite complaints in Pakistan that the drone attacks are a violation of its sovereignty .
The gripes most likely are for political cover because Islamabad is complicit in the program .
It has been reported that Predators have operated out of bases in Pakistan , and it is probable that targeting intelligence is based in part on information sources in the frontier areas where the Taliban is active .
The strikes have been very precise and well - timed , which implies that there are spooks on the ground working with the drones in the air .
The fact that Mehsud was believed to have ordered the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , who was the wife of current President Asif Ali Zardari , may explain the absence of any official protest .
The program has been criticized for killing noncombatants , but these charges have come largely from Taliban sources .
The insurgents habitually surround attack sites , then invent stories of missed targets and mass civilian casualties .
But high - ranking government sources in Pakistan tell us that those claims are false .
The strikes in the past year have been very accurate , and civilians who are killed tend to be family members and others who are close to the terrorists being targeted .
It is regrettable that one of Mehsud ’s wives died in the attack but even more so that he would knowingly place her in such danger .
The drone strikes have been welcomed by the people in the region , who are tired of suffering from Taliban intimidation .
In March , we reported on an opinion poll conducted by Pakistan ’s Aryana Institute for Regional Research and Advocacy .
A survey of 550 people in drone - targeted areas of the North West Frontier Province and Federally Administered Tribal Areas found that 58 percent of respondents said the attacks have not increased anti-American feelings .
Fifty - five percent said they did not “ create fear and terror in the common people , ” 60 percent said the strikes were effective in damaging terror organizations , and 70 percent said they would like to see the Pakistani army make its own strikes on the militants .
Targeting leaders is not a comprehensive solution to the terror problem but is a proven method of blunting the effectiveness of extremist groups .
Al Qaeda in Iraq was severely , perhaps fatally , damaged by the death of its leader , Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , in 2006 .
Similar strategies in Israel and Saudi Arabia have driven surviving leadership elements underground , making it more difficult for terrorists to plan operations and coordinate their dispersed networks .
Mehsud ’s Tehrik - i- Taliban movement undoubtedly will continue under a new leader , though whether he will be as capable is open to question .
Continued drone strikes may convince others that engaging in political violence is not cost - free because the attacks impose sudden , direct and definitive consequences .
For those who want to inflict terror on others , there is a certain justice to the fact that they are forced to live in constant fear of imminent Hellfire .

Like the “ Jaws ” character in the old James Bond movies , it seems nothing can stop the U.S. wind power industry .
This was supposed to be the year that was n’t for wind power , thanks to the economic meltdown and credit crunch .
Yet the industry keeps on trucking — third - quarter U.S. wind - power installations topped 1,600 megawatts , which was more than in the same quarter during the record - setting 2008 .
That was largely due to the impact of U.S. stimulus funding , the American Wind Energy Association said .
So far this year , the U.S. has installed 5,800 megawatts of wind power — again , more than at the same time last year ( 4,200 megawatts ) .
That ’s nearly as much as the industry initially expected to install during the entire year .
That brings total U.S. wind power installations to more than 31,000 megawatts , which leads the world .
( That ’s the equivalent of 31 nuclear power plants on paper , and about 10 nuclear plants in reality . )
The U.S. wind industry is still nervous , though , and expects fourth - quarter performance will — finally - - fall short of last year ’s pace .
The industry wants more help from Washington : “ A firm , long - term national commitment to renewable energy ” is still needed to boost wind - turbine manufacturing , said AWEA chief executive Denise Bode .
Report : Vegas near bottom on list of smartest cities
Justin M. Bowen / File photo
The lights of Las Vegas might be bright , but some of its residents are n't .
That ’s according to some number crunching by The Daily Beast Web site , which in its ranking of smarts for 55 metro areas put Las Vegas one notch away from being the dumbest city in America .
The only place dumber , The Daily Beast said , is Fresno , Calif .
The online magazine kept its assessment of Las Vegas short : " A city that prides itself on sin performs predictably for each of our intellectual - based criteria . "
The magazine used U.S. Census data to drill down on metro areas with 1 million or more people , then analyzed , per-capita , two sets of criteria : “ education ” and “ intellectual environment , ” according to its methodology .
For education , it at looked how many residents had bachelor ’s and graduate degrees .
For intellectual environment , the magazine looked at three components : data on the sales of nonfiction books ; the ratio of higher education institutions to population ; and the number of eligible voters who cast ballots in the presidential election .
A perfect score on the ranking was 200 .
Raleigh - Durham , N.C. , which it ranked No. 1 , had a “ Daily Beast IQ Score ” of 170 .
Las Vegas ’ score ?
11 . Fresno got a 3 .
After Raleigh , the top five areas were San Francisco - Oakland - San Jose ; Boston ; Minneapolis - St. Paul ; and Denver .
At the bottom were Memphis , Tenn . ; Louisville , Ky. ; San Antonio , Texas ; Las Vegas ; and Fresno .
We all pay for obesity
Catherine Rampell assembles two maps that do a pretty good job explaining why obesity is , whether we like it or not , something the country needs to worry about , as opposed to something that individuals deal with entirely on their own .
First , she posts this image from a recent Center for Disease Control and Prevention report :
Then comes this map of Medicare spending rates from the Dartmouth Atlas Project :
This might also be a good time to repost an old graph showing the percentage rise in health - care costs between 2001 and 2006 for folks in different weight categories :
As long as we help pay for each other through Medicare , Medicaid , and assorted other subsidies , the aggregate health of the nation is a concern for taxpayers , not just individuals .
But this is n't just about government .
As long as most of us pay health - care premiums based on the average health needs of other people ( and that 's true for everyone receiving employer - based health coverage , and any other type of risk - pooled coverage ) , the health of others will be a financial concern for us .
And , er , happy Thanksgiving !
Ignoring Chinese protests , the Dalai Lama traveled Sunday to a remote town in northeastern India near China ’s Tibetan border where thousands of pilgrims had braved cold weather to catch a glimpse of their spiritual leader .
The Dalai Lama , who was sharply criticized by Beijing before the visit , expects to spend five days praying and instructing Buddhist worshipers in the monastery town of Tawang in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh , an area claimed by China .
His last visit was in 2003 .
China has accused the spiritual leader of making the trip to further the movement for an independent Tibet , a region that accounts for about one - sixth of Chinese territory .
“ He is always involved in activities that undermine the relations between China and other countries as well as ethnic separatist activities , ” Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said in a regular news briefing last week in Beijing .
“ The Dalai Lama is a liar . ”

Although Beijing has leveled similar accusations for decades , its charges have become more pointed since deadly anti-government riots broke out in March 2008 across the Tibetan plateau .
The Dalai Lama ’s previous visits to Tawang merited little response from China , said Vijay Kranti , editor of Tibbat Desh , a newspaper for the Tibetan exile community in India .
China ’s reaction this time has turned the visit into a bigger deal than it otherwise would be , he said .
“ The Dalai Lama ’s best advertising agency is Beijing , ” Kranti said .
Tawang holds political and religious significance .
Not only has it been at the heart of a border dispute between India and China since their 1962 war , but China briefly occupied the town during the conflict before pulling back to the current demarcation .

The town of 39,000 is also the site of one of Tibetan Buddhism ’s largest monasteries and a place where the Dalai Lama took refuge 50 years ago when he fled Tibet ahead of pursuing Chinese soldiers .
He is now based in Dharamsala , north of New Delhi .
Tawang residents , many from the Monpa tribe , have close ties to Tibetans in China , adding to China ’s distrust .
The sixth Dalai Lama , enthroned in 1697 , was from Tawang .
Beijing , which often blames domestic instability on outside instigators , fears the current Dalai Lama , 74 , might name a successor from the area .
Kranti said that as China has cranked up the rhetoric ahead of this visit , India has pushed back , a welcome development .
“ By saying he ’s got every right to go and is an honored guest , India is sending a message to China , standing up a bit more to Chinese hegemony , ” he said .

In recent months , Sino - Indian relations have become strained as the Asian giants , both enjoying rapid economic growth and vying for regional influence , have sparred over visa policy , trade and border issues .
Few of these issues are new , however .
“ In actual substance , I see no development , ” said Salman Haidar , a former Indian foreign minister .
“ But the atmospherics are certainly undesirable .
It shows an edginess has crept into the bilateral relationship . ”
Indian news media cite frequent cases of Chinese soldiers firing weapons into India and leaving Chinese - brand cigarette packs and the word “ China ” painted on rock faces on Indian territory .
Although the 1962 conflict between the two neighbors , which China essentially won , spotlighted the border dispute , the roots of the differences involving about 56,000 square miles of Arunachal Pradesh actually stretch back nearly a century .
India recognizes the so - called McMahon Line , a border drawn by British colonial rulers in 1914 , which China does not .
China also occupies a part of Kashmir claimed by India .

In recent years , eager for regional stability , China has resolved most of its border disputes with other neighbors .
Despite meeting 13 times , however , India and China have not made much progress , in part because the area under dispute is far more populous and culturally sensitive than those shared with Russia and others .
Adding to recent distrust , China tried to block part of an Asian Development Bank loan to India that included projects for Arunachal Pradesh .
And China accuses India of discriminating against Chinese workers with its visa policy .
The two countries in recent weeks have tried to lower the temperature given their shared interests .
Late last month , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held a meeting on the sidelines of an Asian regional conference .
India , in an apparent effort to placate China , refused to grant permits to foreign journalists hoping to travel to the restricted region to cover the Dalai Lama ’s trip .

The two nations ’ economic links have grown stronger as bilateral trade has expanded by 50 % annually over the last five years to reach $ 51.8 billion in 2008 , and both sides have significant domestic problems on which they ’d prefer to expend their time and resources .
“ Neither side can afford this , ” Haidar said .
“ China is aspiring to a global role , expanding rapidly and sees Asia as an extension of its bailiwick .
Similarly with India , we have enough on our plate without trying to pick quarrels . ”

" I do n't want any more 2 am phone calls . "
Those were the first words of relieved father Roger Watson upon clapping eyes on his daughter Jessica this morning after the 16 - year - old sailor hit a 60,000 tonne coal tanker off the coast of Stradbroke Island in pitch darkness .
The Queensland schoolgirl had earlier called her parents , including mother Julie , with the news : " It 's all right really , but I lost half my mast . "
Jessica 's damaged yacht , Ella 's Pink Lady , motored into the Southport seaway on the Gold Coast this afternoon , 10 hours after the collision and less than 24 after she set sail on a 10 - day solo trial before trying to become the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe solo and unassisted .
President Obama did n't wait long after Tuesday 's devastating elections to give critics another reason to question his leadership , but this time the subject matter was more grim than a pair of governorships .
After news broke out of the shooting at the Fort Hood Army post in Texas , the nation watched in horror as the toll of dead and injured climbed .
The White House was notified immediately and by late afternoon , word went out that the president would speak about the incident prior to a previously scheduled appearance .
At about 5 p.m. , cable stations went to the president .
The situation called for not only his trademark eloquence , but also grace and perspective .
But instead of a somber chief executive offering reassuring words and expressions of sympathy and compassion , viewers saw a wildly disconnected and inappropriately light president making introductory remarks .
At the event , a Tribal Nations Conference hosted by the Department of Interior 's Bureau of Indian affairs , the president thanked various staffers and offered a " shout - out " to " Dr. Joe Medicine Crow -- that Congressional Medal of Honor winner . "
Three minutes in , the president spoke about the shooting , in measured and appropriate terms .
Who is advising him ?
Anyone at home aware of the major news story of the previous hours had to have been stunned .
An incident like this requires a scrapping of the early light banter .
The president should apologize for the tone of his remarks , explain what has happened , express sympathy for those slain and appeal for calm and patience until all the facts are in .
That 's the least that should occur .
Indeed , an argument could be made that Obama should have canceled the Indian event , out of respect for people having been murdered at an Army post a few hours before .
That would have prevented any sort of jarring emotional switch at the event .
Did the president 's team not realize what sort of image they were presenting to the country at this moment ?
The disconnect between what Americans at home knew had been going on -- and the initial words coming out of their president 's mouth was jolting , if not disturbing .
It must have been disappointing for many politically aware Democrats , still reeling from the election two days before .
The New Jersey gubernatorial vote had already demonstrated that the president and his political team could n't produce a winning outcome in a state very friendly to Democrats ( and where the president won by 15 points one year ago ) .
And now this ?
Congressional Democrats must wonder if a White House that has burdened them with a too - heavy policy agenda over the last year has a strong enough political operation to help push that agenda through .
If the president 's communications apparatus can't inform -- and protect -- their boss during tense moments when the country needs to see a focused commander - in - chief and a compassionate head of state , it has disastrous consequences for that president 's party and supporters .
All the president 's men ( and women ) fell down on the job Thursday .
And Democrats across the country have real reason to panic .

When developers get their hands on a social media platform , amazing things tend to happen .
For example , Facebook transformed web apps when it launched the Facebook platform .
The result has been everything from Facebook Connect to FarmVille .
Twitter 's an even better example when you start thinking of the countless Twitter apps for mobile phones and the desktop .
That magic is exactly what LinkedIn is hoping will happen with today 's launch of the LinkedIn Platform , which opens up outside applications to use LinkedIn 's data .
Oh , and TweetDeck will be launching Linked In integration this week .
The company has been experimenting with a developer platform for a while .
Most recently , Linked In announced integration with Microsoft Outlook 2010 .
However , until today only select developers could access LinkedIn APIs .
Now any developer can work with the data , much like Facebook and Twitter .
You 're about to see a whole new wave of Linked In web applications .
When I spoke with LinkedIn , I learned that a little less than a dozen apps would be launching Linked In integrations this week , including TweetDeck , Twitter 's most popular app ( we 'll have another post detailing the new features soon , along with screenshots ) .
This is an important but long overdue move for Linked In .
We can understand why it took longer — business users would have likely reacted badly to this a year ago , but with social media permeating the workplace , it 's probably the right time now .

It ’s not enough the government has its hooks in America ’s children most of the year .
Now Obama wants to do away with summer vacation and have children spend more time in the government ’s indoctrination centers .
Barack and Michelle Obama have their children in a private school that caters to the elite .
“ Obama says American kids spend too little time in school , putting them at a disadvantage with other students around the globe , ” reports the Associated Press .
“ Now , I know longer school days and school years are not wildly popular ideas , ” the president said earlier this year .
“ Not with Malia and Sasha , not in my family , and probably not in yours .
But the challenges of a new century demand more time in the classroom . ”
It ’s interesting Obama would use his kids to make a point about children around the country in public schools .
Obama ’s kids attend Sidwell Friends School in Washington , D.C. , a private school that charges $ 29,000 a year in tuition .
Theodore Roosevelt , Richard Nixon , and Bill Clinton sent their children to Sidwell .
Vice President Al Gore ’s son , Albert Gore III , also graduated from Sidwell Friends .
It ’s an exclusive school that prepares the children of the elite to lord over the rest of us .
In addition to eliminating summer vacation , the government wants to increase the hours kids spend in government indoctrination camps every day .
Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan told the AP kids need to be in school and away from their parents more because of dismal academic performance .
In fact , as H. L. Mencken noted in 1924 , compulsory education is not about test scores and academics — it ’s about state control of children .
Mencken said the aim of public education is not “ to fill the young of the species with knowledge and awaken their intelligence … .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
The aim … is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level , to breed and train a standardized citizenry , to put down dissent and originality .
That is its aim in the United States … and that is its aim everywhere else . ”
Former teacher John Taylor Gatto explains that the purpose of so - called public education is to teach children to follow orders and not question authority .
Public education is about undermining the autonomy of the family .
“ Institutional leaders have come to regard themselves as great synthetic Fathers to millions of synthetic Children , by which , I mean , to all of us .
This theory sees us bound together in some abstract family relationship in which the State is the true Mother and Father , hence it insists on our first and best loyalty , ” writes Gatto in his essay , We Need Less School , Not More .
John Taylor Gatto , a retired school teacher , talks about the real purpose of public eduction — state controlled consciousness .
In a review of Gatto ’s book , Dumbing Us Down , Ron Miller writes that the crux of Gatto ’s critique is that
in the past 125 years , social engineers have sought to keep American life under tight central control .
Compulsory schooling is a deliberate effort to establish intellectual , economic , and political conformity so that society can be managed efficiently by a technocratic elite .
“ School , ” claims Gatto , “ Is an artifice that makes …. a pyramidal social order seem inevitable , although such a premise is a fundamental betrayal of the American Revolution . ”
Along with the media — especially television , which Gatto criticizes harshly in another essay — schooling removes young people from any genuine experience of community , any genuine engagement with the world or immersion in lasting relationships .
It robs them of solitude and privacy .
Yet these experiences are what enable us to develop self - knowledge and to grow up “ fully human , ” argues Gatto , and he asserts that our most troubling social pathologies , such as drug abuse and violence , are the natural reaction of human lives subjected to mechanical , abstract discipline .
As a social engineer for the global elite , Education Secretary Arne Duncan wants to place state indoctrination at the very center of society .
“ Aside from improving academic performance , Education Secretary Duncan has a vision of schools as the heart of the community , ” the AP reports .
Obama ’s message is clear — the state owns your children and now demands they spend more time in dangerous and often violent indoctrination centers that teach them not only how to become obedient robots and docile workers on the global slave plantation , but also teaches them about sex , suicide , and situational ethics instead of rational and independent thought .

SAN FRANCISCO – Motorola today introduced the Cliq , the company 's first phone based on the Android mobile operating system .
The device will have a custom interface called Moto Blur that will bring together e-mail messages , text messages , Facebook and Twitter feeds , and photos into a single interface .
The phone has a touch screen and a physical slide - out keyboard , a 5 - megapixel camera , Wi-Fi , 3G connectivity , the ability to shoot video at 24 frames per second , a standard headphone jack and GPS capability .
The phone will be available on T - Mobile 's network in the fourth quarter .
Motorola officials did not disclose the price for the phone and would not let any attendees at the Mobilize conference , where they announced the phone , examine it closely .
" This is the first phone with social skills , " said Cole Brodman , chief technology officer at T - Mobile .
" Cliq and Moto Blur is the start of the next chapter of Android and shows significance of the platform . "
The phone will also be available internationally under the name Moto Dext .
Motorola also plans to introduce another phone in the next few weeks , in time for holiday season sales .
Motorola needs a hit .
Financial problems over the last two years have forced the company to slash its workforce .
The company has said it will focus on creating Android - based handsets but this is the first glimpse of what the company has been working on .
The Cliq also helps establish momentum for the Google - designed Android operating system .
Last October HTC and T - Mobile released the first phone based on the new OS .
Since then HTC has announced three more phones that run Android OS .
Other handset makers such as Sony and Samsung are also reportedly working on Android phones .
The new Motorola phone 's biggest asset will be its custom - designed user interface , Moto Blur .
" The Blur makes text , e-mail , Facebook , Twitter feeds and photos from sources like MySpace , Gmail , Yahoo and corporate e-mail appear in a single stream and sync them together with no different logins , " says Sanjay Jha , co-CEO of Motorola .
" This means you can focus on what people have said instead of how and where they said it . "
The Blur also backs up user contacts , log - in information , home - screen customizations , e-mail and social network messages on Motorola 's Blur servers .
If you lose your phone , Motorola says you 'll be able to locate it through their online portal using the integrated GPS , and you can even wipe its data remotely .
Both features are similar to what Apple offers iPhone users through the Mobile Me service .
Motorola is not the only handset maker that 's seeking to piggyback on the popularity of social networking sites among consumers .
While Apple may have kicked off the mobile apps trend , the iPhone puts different services into different buckets and fails to offer its users a smooth and easy way to access all information .
For instance , the iPhone makes it difficult for users to get their Facebook and Twitter feed in a single screen .
Apple 's rivals see that lack of integrated social media features as the iPhone 's Achilles heel .
And they are trying to fight back by integrating information and add social context for their customers .
Earlier this year , U.K. - based INQ released a phone designed around Facebook .
Palm has also designed the user interface in its recently introduced Pre phone around integrated contacts , messaging and Facebook feeds .
But the Moto Blur and Cliq goes one step further .
" The phone is really cool , " says Sean Galligan , vice - president , business development at Flurry , a mobile analytics company that has partnered with Motorola .
" We have seen apps and other handsets take on content aggregation and deliver personalization to users but the Blur offers a level of deep integration that is not available in other devices , " says Galligan .
Motorola is also counting on the success of the Android apps marketplace to attract customers .
" By the year end we will have a really good idea of what the consumer thinks .
The Android apps are there and growing and social aggregation is clearly the new trend in mobile phones , " says Galligan .
" But the true test will be when the consumer decides whether to buy these devices or not . "

Just finished reading the Guru and the Pandit transcript of Ken and Andrew ’s Integral Naked dialogue : Immortality and Enlightenment .
( via numinous dawg )
The best part of the dialogue was when Ken and Andrew differentiated the notion of immortality , from body , mind , soul , to spirit .
Awesome .
I agree with them when they pointed out people ’s confusion with immortality — " when you want the finite realm to be infinite . "
Props to them for doing that .
They should ’ve stopped there and explored ways on how to best embrace life extension technology and merge it with 2nd - tier thinking .
But NO , they did n’t .
The dialogue degenerated into the classic Spirituality vs. ( materialistic ) Science game — " … breaking some fundamental law of the universe — tampering with natural structures in the creative process " .
Jesus Jones !
Do you guys really believe this crap ?
Do n’t you guys think that maybe , just maybe , that technological advancement ( including life extensions ) IS an expression of the " creative process " ?
Where ’s the fluffy love ?
The dialogue had obvious bias towards spirituality and the interior
domain .
The lack of imagination was obvious when they touched on the
subject of consciousness downloading .
Assuming this technology will be possible , yes , the level of consciousness of the person is still the same when it ’s downloaded to a machine — garbage in , garbage out .
BUT , BUT , BUT , the Law of Accelerating Returns ,
will make it possible for that consciousness to " develop into higher
levels " at an " exponential " rate .
Even hyper - speed does n’t quite cut
it .
We ’ve all seen Dark City , and The Matrix where Neo learned all the cool stuff in
one sitting .
What if , in the future , Ken and Andrew , will be part of a
computer program where they would continue to do their pointing out
instructions , evolutionary imperative injunctions , and boring
philosophical jargons ?
What if ILP ver 2045 is packaged as a download
program instead of a long and tear - jearking 1 - 2 - 3 shadow workout ?
Heck , it
would probably only take 90 - minutes of practice instead of 90 days of inebriation .
Would n’t this technology help accelerate the consciousness of Humanity 2.0 into integral - aperspectival levels and beyond ?
A better theme for the dialogue should be :
What ways can 2nd - tier thinking embrace technology to ensure that they only cause self , culture , and nature the least amount of suffering ?
As for Andrew being afraid of life extensions , I have one word for you sir : Singularity .
The singularity challenges us to redefine our notion of EVERYTHING ,
even enlightenment itself .
Brush up on that and transcend and include
it in your evolutionary imperative model .
And c’mon , Ken .
At least in Boomeritis you posited a race between carbon - based and silicon - based consciousness : " … development
in the world of Carbon is heading toward a great Omega point , then when
Silicon becomes conscious , it will also start heading toward this
ultimate Omega point .
So he becomes obsessed with the thought :
Who will
first discover God on a widespread scale : Carbon or Silicon ?
Now that is more , shall we say , integral .
Those are just some of the reasons why , IMHO , the dialogue , as
valuable as it was , was very partial .
It avoided flatland but somewhow
got stuck in " wonderland "
— collapsing the exteriors in favor of the interiors .
That ’s why I
think that instead of just the Guru and the Pandit , when it comes
controversial topics on the exterior domains , they should ’ve included fluffy scientists in the discussion .
The discussion would ’ve been more interesting if Ray Kurzweil , and Aubrey De Grey were invited and the four of them went at it on All Quadrants regarding radical life extensions .
Now that would be pay - per - view material .
There .
I think I could use a sponge bath in my favorite spot .
Results of the first study evaluating the use of human urine mixed with wood ash as a fertilizer for food crops has found that the combination can be substituted for costly synthetic fertilizers to produce bumper crops of tomatoes without introducing any risk of disease for consumers .
The study appears in the current issue of ACS ' Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry , a bi-weekly publication .
In the study , Surendra Pradhan and colleagues point out that urine , a good source of nitrogen , has been successfully used to fertilize cucumber , corn , cabbage , and other crops .
Only a few studies , however , have investigated the use of wood ash , which is rich in minerals and also reduces the acidity of certain soils .
Scientists have not reported on the combinaton of urine and wood ash , they say .
The new study found that plants fertilized with urine produced four times more tomatoes than nonfertilized plants and as much as plants given synthetic fertilizer .
Urine plus wood ash produced almost as great a yield , with the added benefit of reducing the acidity of acid soils .
" The results suggest that urine with or without wood ash can be used as a substitute for mineral fertilizer to increase the yields of tomato without posing any microbial or chemical risks , " the report says .

China ’s newest nuclear submarines are noisier than 1970s - era Soviet nuclear submarines .
.
By Hans M. Kristensen
China ’s new Jin-class ballistic missile submarine is noisier than the Russian Delta III - class submarines built more than 30 years ago , according to a report produced by the U.S. Navy ’s Office of Naval Intelligence ( ONI ) .
The report The People ’s Liberation Army Navy : A Modern Navy With Chinese Characteristics , which was first posted on the FAS Secrecy News Blog and has since been removed from the ONI web site [ but now back here ; thanks Bruce ] , is to my knowledge the first official description made public of Chinese and Russian modern nuclear submarine noise levels .
Force Level
The report shows that China now has two Jin SSBNs , one of which is based at Hainan Island with the South Sea Fleet , along with two Type 093 Shang - class nuclear - powered attack submarines ( SSN ) .
The Jin was first described at Hainan in February 2008 and the two Shangs in September 2008 .
The second Jin SSBN is based at Jianggezhuang with the North Sea Fleet alongside the old Xia-class SSBN and four Han-class SSNs .
The report confirms the existence of the Type 095 , a third - generation SSN intended to follow the Type 093 Shang - class .
Five Type 095s are expected from around 2015 .
The Type -95 is estimated to be noisier than the Russian Akula I SSN built 20 years ago .
Missile Range
The ONI report states that the JL - 2 sea-launched ballistic missile on the Jin SSBNs has a range of ~ 4,000 nautical miles ( ~7,400 km ) “ is capable of reaching the continental United States from Chinese littorals . ”
Not quite , unless Chinese littorals extend well into the Sea of Japan .
Since the continental United States does not include Alaska and Hawaii , a warhead from a 7,400 - km range JL - 2 would fall into the sea about 800 km from Seattle .
A JL - 2 carrying penetration aids in addition to a warhead would presumably have a shorter range .
Julang - 2 SLBM Range According to ONI
Although the ONI report states that the Julang - 2 can target the Continental United States , the range estimate it provides is insufficient to reach the lower 48 states or Hawaii .
.
Alaska would be in range if the JL - 2 is launched from the very northern parts of Chinese waters , but Hawaii is out of range unless the missile is launched from a position close to South Korea or Japan .
The U.S. Defense Department ’s 2009 report to Congress on the Military Power of the People ’s Republic of China also shows the range of the JL - 2 to be insufficient to target the Continental United States or Hawaii from Chinese waters .
The JL - 2 instead appears to be a regional weapon with potential mission against Russia and India and U.S. bases in Guam and Japan .
Patrol Levels
The report also states that Chinese submarine patrols have “ more than tripled ” over the past few years , when compared to the historical levels of the last two decades .
That sounds like a lot , but given that the entire Chinese submarine fleet in those two decades in average conducted fewer than three patrols per year combined , a trippling does n’t amout to a whole lot for a submarine fleet of 63 submarines .
According to data obtained from ONI under FOIA , the patrol number in 2008 was 12 .
Since only the most capable of the Chinese attack submarines presumably conduct these patrols away from Chinese waters – and since China has yet to send one of its ballistic missile submarines on patrol – that could mean one or two patrols per year per submarine .
Implications
The ONI report concludes that the Jin SSBN with the JL - 2 SLBM gives the PLA Navy its first credible second - strike nuclear capability .
The authors must mean in principle , because in a war such noisy submarines would presumably be highly vulnerabe to U.S. or Japanese anti-submarine warfare forces .
( The noise level of China ’s most modern diesel - electric submarines is another matter ; ONI says some are comparable to Russian diesel - electric submarines ) .
That does raise an interesting question about the Chinese SSBN program : if Chinese leaders are so concerned about the vulnerability of their nuclear deterrent , why base a significant portion of it on a few noisy platforms and send them out to sea where they can be sunk by U.S. attack submarines in a war ?
And if Chinese planners know that the sea - based deterrent is much more vulnerable than its land - based deterrent , why do they waste money on the SSBN program ?
The answer is probably a combination of national prestige and scenarios involving India or Russia that have less capable anti-submarine forces .

The statements made and views expressed are solely the responsibility of the author .
People believe what they see , and they 're willing to punish each other for it — apparently even when what they 're seeing is a fake video that does n't jibe with real - life experience .
Psychologists have long known that our memories of past events can be influenced by misleading information , but now they 've proven that doctored video evidence can convince people to offer false eyewitness testimony .
In a study of 60 college students performing a computerized gambling task , nearly half were willing to testify that they saw their partner cheat in real life after watching fabricated video evidence .
Of students who were told that video evidence existed but did n't watch the footage themselves , only 10 percent gave false testimony .
" Our participants were willing to sign a statement to say that they witnessed another person cheating in an experiment , when in fact , that person never cheated , " psychologist Kimberley Wade of the University of Warwick wrote in an e-mail .
" So we now know that digitally altered footage can change people ’s perceptions of an event , and have serious consequences for how people behave . "
Wade and her team published their findings this month in Applied Cognitive Psychology .
Most eyewitness studies have been carried out in a setting where there were no consequences for reporting that a person had cheated , but in this study , participants were told that their partner would be disciplined for cheating if they signed the testimony .
In the study , each student was paired with a member of the research team disguised as another participant .
The pair sat side - by - side and played a computerized gambling game , which involved betting fake money based on the likelihood of answering a multiple choice question correctly .
Each person was in charge of keeping track of their own wins ; when a subject correctly answered a question , they got to take money from a shared " bank , " and when they incorrectly answered a question , they had to put money back .
Participants were told that at the end of the game , the person who made the most money would win a prize .
After the gambling concluded , the researchers used Final Cut Pro to alter a video recording of the game and make it look like the partner had cheated .
Five to seven hours after the first task , students were called back to the lab and told that their absent partner was suspected of cheating .
One - third of the students were also told that the researchers had video evidence of the cheating , and another one - third got to watch the doctored video themselves .
Before asking participants to sign an eyewitness testimony , the researchers emphasized that no one should testify unless they were 100 percent sure they had seen their partner cheat , and they emphasized that the cheater would be punished .
Students who watched the fake video were far more likely to give false testimony than students who heard about the video or were simply told that their partner was suspected of cheating .
When asked to describe what they had seen , some participants even invented memories .
" One subject told us that the other person had acted suspiciously and taken money from the bank when there was clearly a cross on the screen , " Wade wrote .
" So we are confident that a significant portion of people who saw the fake video genuinely believed — or even falsely remembered — that they had witnessed the cheating . "
The scientists offered several possible explanations for why video had such a strong effect on memory .
" First , people still view photos and videos as reliable records of the past , " psychology graduate student Robert Nash wrote in an e-mail .
" Around 75 percent of the people who participate in our research know something about photo or video editing software , yet many of the people in this study were convinced by our edited footage . "
In addition , watching a person cheat on video makes the cheating incident feel familiar , and when an event feels familiar , it 's often confused for something that was really witnessed .
" So our participants may have misremembered seeing our confederate cheat , " Nash wrote , " because when they were asked about the cheating incident they may have thought , ' Well , now that you mention it , that sounds kind of familiar to me , so perhaps I did see that happen . ' "
Upon debriefing , participants in the study expressed complete surprise that the video had been fake and that their memory was false .
" I believe these results , definitely , " said memory expert Elizabeth Loftus of the University of California , Irvine , who was not involved in the research .
" The whole body of work with doctored photos and videos is kind of scary ; it is very visual and it is powerful evidence .
And now we know it can contaminate the memory and make someone accuse another person of doing something wrong . "
In an era of easily manipulated photo and video evidence , the researchers say their findings have major implications for law enforcement officials and policy - makers , adding yet more evidence that eyewitness testimony cannot always be accepted as fact .
" We need to remember that witnesses ' memories should be treated like fingerprints , DNA , and other physical evidence — with a lot of care , " wrote Wade .
" If we do n’t treat them with care , then we run the risk of contamination . "

Als Ermittler holten sie für den Staat Millionen , auch bei den großen Banken .
Doch plötzlich war Schluss .
Plötzlich störten sie die Geschäfte und wurden als Querulanten aus dem Dienst gemobbt .
Die Geschichte von Rudolf Schmenger und seinen Kollegen von der Steuerfahndung Frankfurt , die jetzt auf Gerechtigkeit hoffen .
Von Frauke Hunfeld
Es ist aber auch zum Verrücktwerden , denkt Rudolf Schmenger , und dann muss er selbst lachen .
Schon wieder so eine abenteuerliche Geschichte .
Schon wieder ganz nah dran .
Endlich mal einen Großen angeklagt , einen , von denen es sonst immer heißt , man ließe sie laufen .
Klaus Zumwinkel , Ex-Postchef , soll Steuern hinterzogen haben , mithilfe einer Stiftung in Liechtenstein .
Und gerade hat der Bundesgerichtshof entschieden , dass ab einer Million Euro hinterzogener Steuern nur in Ausnahmefällen eine Bewährungsstrafe zulässig sei .
Und ausgerechnet jetzt kommt heraus :
Weil ein Amtsrichter den Durchsuchungsbeschluss für Zumwinkels Haus einen
Tag zu spät unterschrieb , sind Taten vor 2002 womöglich verjährt .
Damit sinkt die Summe der Zumwinkel zur Last gelegten Steuerhinterziehungen von 1,18 Millionen auf 996.000 Euro - knapp unter die magische Million .
Da kann Rudolf Schmenger nur den
Hut ziehen .
Vor den Anwälten des Herrn Zumwinkel , die auf die Fristüberschreitung gekommen sind .
" Profis " , sagt er. Profis wie er selbst mal einer war .
Allerdings auf der anderen Seite .
Schmenger war Steuerfahnder .
Bis man ihn für verrückt erklärte .
Aber vielleicht ist er ja bald wieder " normal " .
Zwielichtige Gutachten
Der Anruf , mit dem er nicht mehr gerechnet hatte , erreicht ihn in der Frankfurter Krankenhauskantine .
Sein Vater ist in der Klinik , er hatte einen Herzinfarkt , Rudolf Schmenger hat ja Zeit und besucht ihn jeden Tag.
Der Mann am Telefon heißt Rainer Raasch und war bis vor Kurzem Richter am Frankfurter Landgericht .
Jetzt führt er für die Landesärztekammer Hessen die berufsrechtlichen Ermittlungen gegen den Psychiater , der Schmenger und dessen Kollegen für dienstunfähig erklärt hat .
Raasch untersucht den dringenden Verdacht , dass dieser Psychiater durch Gefälligkeitsgutachten der hessischen Finanzbehörde geholfen hat , unbequeme Beamte loszuwerden .
Richter Raasch hat eine Menge abenteuerlicher Geschichten gehört in seinem langen Berufsleben .
Trotzdem fragt er immer wieder nach , so als könne er kaum glauben , was er da hört .
Schmenger versteht ihn .
Denn seine Geschichte klingt nicht wie ein Fall aus einer deutschen Finanzbehörde .
Sondern wie von Franz Kafka .
Und er ist nicht allein .
Die Geschichte der Steuerfahnder Rudolf Schmenger , Heiko und Tina Feser , von Sven Försterling , Marco Wehner , Frank Wehrheim , Dieter Reimann , Eckard Pisch , Wolfgang Schad und den anderen beginnt im Sommer 2001 .
Bis dahin galten die Steuerfahnder des Finanzamtes Frankfurt V als untadelige Finanzbeamte , manche von ihnen mit jahrzehntelanger Erfahrung , andere als junge Kräfte mit großem Potenzial und besten Beurteilungen .
Manchen in der Fahnderszene galten sie gar als Stars .
Sie machten in einem Verfahren gegen eine Großbank wegen Beihilfe zur Steuerhinterziehung auch vor den Vorstandsetagen nicht halt , und sie zwangen Großbanken dazu , die Steuern der Kunden nachzuzahlen , deren Namen sie nicht nennen wollten oder konnten .
Geschätzt und belobigt
Die Commerzbank und die Deutsche Bank hatten , unter anderen , Gelder reicher Kunden über Transferkonten anonym ins Ausland geschafft , und sie hatten gewusst , dass dies illegal ist .
Die Frankfurter Fahnder schleppten kistenweise das Material aus den Banken und brachten reichen Steuerhinterziehern und deren Helfern in den Banken das Fürchten bei , dem kleinen Mann den Glauben an die Gerechtigkeit , und nebenbei brachten sie dem Land Hessen Zusatzeinnahmen von rund 250 Millionen und bundesweit rund eine Milliarde Mark zusätzlicher Steuergelder .
Sie wurden geschätzt und ganz offiziell von ihrem Dienstherrn belobigt .
In ihren Büros lagerte in Banken beschlagnahmtes Material , das bei Auswertung weitere Steuermehreinnahmen in Millionenhöhe erwarten ließ .
Aber dann geschah in diesem Sommer der Euphorie etwas Seltsames : Eine Amtsverfügung wird den Fahndern in verschlossenem Umschlag überreicht , in der der Leiter des Finanzamts , Jürgen Schneider - Ludorff , etwas verlangt , was in den Augen der Fahnder ungeheuerlich ist : Ein steuerstrafrechtlicher Anfangsverdacht soll ab sofort in der Regel nur noch dann bestehen , wenn " nach dem vorhandenen Belegmaterial ein Transfervolumen von DM 500.000 oder ein Einzeltransfer von DM 300.000 vorliegt " .
Auch ergäbe sich " insbesondere für Bankenfälle , welchen Kapitaltransfers in das Ausland in den Jahren 1992 bis 1994 zugrunde liegen und die strafrechtlich nicht mehr verfolgbar sind , nicht zwingend ein Anfangsverdacht für strafrechtlich noch nicht verjährte Folgejahre " .
Die Fahnder wollen da nicht mitmachen .
Sie befürchten Strafvereitelung im Amt .
Sie wissen ja , dass Vermögen , das der Steuerpflicht entzogen wird , stets in kleine Tranchen gestückelt wird .
Und sie kennen die Leute , die Millionen mit Autos oder in Koffern über die Grenzen schaffen , die Geldbündel , kiloweise eingenäht ins Bettzeug , in Steueroasen bringen , selbst oder mit Mittelsmännern , und sich auf der sicheren Seite wähnen .
Und dann , nur ein kleiner , dummer , aber folgenschwerer Fauxpas , überweisen sie die Depotgebühren von ihrem Privatkonto nach Liechtenstein .
So ein Einzelbeleg umfasst vielleicht gerade einmal ein paar Tausend Euro .
Dahinter stehen jedoch oft Millionen .
Immer haben die Fahnder ja nur einzelne Puzzleteile , aus denen sie das große Ganze erst zusammensetzen müssen .
Und damit soll jetzt Schluss sein ?
Strafversetzung
Der Steuerfahnder Regierungsoberrat Eckard Pisch erfährt nach Rückkehr aus seinem Urlaub von der neuen Verfügung .
Er ist ein erfahrener Mann , seit mehr als 20 Jahren Beamter , der von der Kriminalpolizei über ein Jurastudium in die Steuerfahndung kam und als Sachgebietsleiter und Koordinator der Bankenverfahren tief mit der Materie vertraut ist .
Seine Argumente haben Gewicht - normalerweise .
In diesem Fall jedoch entledigt man sich seiner auf andere Weise : Nach seinem elfseitigen schriftlichen Protest , in dem er rechtliche und organisatorische Bedenken detailliert darlegt , wird ihm an einem Montag mitgeteilt , dass er ab Donnerstag aus der Steuerfahndung ans Finanzamt nach Darmstadt abgeordnet sei .
Das ist eben der Preis des sicheren Arbeitsplatzes , und jeder Beamte , der meckert , kennt die Gefahr :
Wenn du heute das Maul aufmachst , bist du morgen vielleicht in Hintertupfingen .
Oder in Darmstadt .
Auch die Staatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt erfährt von der Amtsverfügung und protestiert .
Der für die Bankenverfahren zuständige Staatsanwalt Markus Weimann verbittet sich " die Veränderung der Beweismittelerhebung in laufenden Verfahren " und verweist auf das Legalitätsprinzip :
Wenn man den einen wegen einer Steuerhinterziehung von 100.000 Euro oder der Beihilfe drankriegt , kann man den nächsten nicht bei gleichem Sachverhalt laufen lassen .
Seine Bedenken verpuffen .
Wer genau mit diesen Aktionen was bezweckt , erfahren die Fahnder nicht .
Offiziell lautet die Begründung : Personalnot .
Man werde von den Bankenfällen überrollt , man habe zu viele Fälle und zu wenig Leute , und irgendwann müsse auch mal Schluss sein .
Viele der Fahnder allerdings spekulieren , es sei eher die Angst um den Finanzplatz Frankfurt .
Man wolle es sich mit den Banken und ihren wohlhabenden und einflussreichen Kunden nicht völlig verderben .
Andere erinnern daran , dass gerade die hessische CDU ja ihre ganz eigenen Erfahrungen gemacht hat mit illegalen Vermögenstransfers in eine Liechtensteiner Stiftung namens " Zaunkönig " , die die Parteispendenaffäre ausgelöst hat .
Vielleicht hat der Zaunkönig Kinder bekommen ?
Wieder andere glauben , die Politiker sähen eben vor allem die unmittelbaren Landesinteressen und hätten eine simple Rechnung aufgemacht : Die Steuerfahnder und das Hilfspersonal muss das Land Hessen bezahlen .
Die Mehreinnahmen gehen zum Großteil in den Länderfinanzausgleich .
Will man wirklich die Großbanken und ihre vermögenden Kunden weiter an die Kandare nehmen , obgleich man selbst fast nichts davon hat ?
" Lass gut sein , sonst machen die dich fertig "
So leicht jedoch wollen sich die Fahnder nicht abwimmeln lassen .
Sie fürchten um den Erfolg dessen , was sie in jahrelanger Arbeit aufgebaut haben .
Wenn der Grund ist , dass man seitens des Dienstherren Bedenken hat , die Vielzahl der Fälle aus Personalnot nicht bearbeiten zu können , dann muss doch mehr Personal her , statt dass man die Steuerhinterzieher laufen lässt .
Die Ahndung eines Banküberfalls hänge schließlich auch nicht von der Höhe der Beute ab .
Als einer der Rädelsführer der Kritik wird nach der Versetzung des Bankenkoordinators Pisch von der Obrigkeit Rudolf Schmenger ausgemacht .
Immer wieder erklärt er seine Bedenken , immer wieder bringt er Beispiele an , der Mann wird ziemlich lästig .
Seine Beurteilungen verschlechtern sich abrupt , seine Fallhefte werden inspiziert , seine Wochendienstpläne kontrolliert , und es gibt nicht wenige , die ihn warnen : " Schmenger , lass gut sein , sonst machen die dich fertig . "
Genauso kommt es. Gegen Rudolf Schmenger , Steuerfahnder , Amtsrat , 41 Jahre alt , seit 24 Jahren untadeliger Beamter , seit elf Jahren in der Steuerfahndung , stets mit den besten Beurteilungen , wird von seinem Vorgesetzten Schneider - Ludorff ein disziplinarisches Vorermittlungsverfahren eingeleitet .
Die Vorwürfe :
Hier sei ein Formular nicht richtig ausgefüllt , dort eine Telefonnummer unleserlich geschrieben , an einem Tag habe er sich zwischen 7.30 und 8.25
Uhr unerlaubt vom Arbeitsplatz entfernt oder habe mit einem Kollegen auf dem Flur über ein Verfahren geredet , das ihm nicht zugeschrieben war .
Dass Schmenger später vor dem Verwaltungsgericht siegt und keiner der Vorwürfe haltbar bleibt , nützt dem unbequemen Staatsdiener nichts : Schmenger muss die Steuerfahndung verlassen und wird zum 31 .
März 2003 in die Großbetriebsprüfung versetzt .
Das Namensschild an seinem Büro wird abmontiert , der Netzzugang zu seinen elektronischen Daten gekappt , und was aus den zuletzt von ihm bearbeiteten Ermittlungsverfahren wird , weiß er nicht .
Später findet sich ein Fax des Behördenleiters Schneider - Ludorff an die Oberfinanzdirektion , in dem gefordert wird , " dass die Verwaltung in der Personalangelegenheit Schmenger eine Lösung finden muss , die der engagierten ( …) Behördenleitung und mir als Finanzamtsvorsteher den Rücken stärkt .
Außerdem sollten die von einer zu findenden Lösung ausgehenden Signale in den Bereich der Fahnder / innen nicht unterschätzt werden " .
Welcher Art die Signale sein sollen , ist unschwer zu erkennen : Haltet das Maul , sonst geht 's euch wie dem .
Die 70 Fahnder der Steuerfahndung des Finanzamts Frankfurt V sind bestürzt über diese und andere Versetzungen und beschließen zu handeln .
Im Sommer 2003 treffen sich 48 von ihnen - aus Angst nicht in der Behörde , sondern in einem Saal des Landessportbundes .
Den hat Fahnder Wolfgang Schad organisiert , der nebenbei Präsident des Hessischen Leichtathletik - Verbandes ist .
Angst vor Konsequenzen
Die Fahnder wollen alles richtig machen .
Sie sammeln Geld für einen Rechtsanwalt , der ihnen einen beamtenrechtlich korrekten Weg aus ihrem Dilemma aufzeigen soll : Einerseits sind sie weisungsgebunden , andererseits haben sie erhebliche Bedenken , ihrer Pflicht nachkommen zu können und ihren Eid zu erfüllen .
70 Beamte steuern ihr Scherflein bei .
Immer noch glauben sie in ihrer Mehrheit nur an ein großes Missverständnis , immer noch glauben sie , dass , wenn ihr oberster Dienstherr , Ministerpräsident Koch , erst richtig informiert wäre , dass dann alles gut werden würde .
Sieben Fahnder gehen im Auftrag der anderen zum Anwalt , und das Ergebnis tragen sie ihren Kollegen vor : Einen Brandbrief an den Ministerpräsidenten Roland Koch : " Wir sind Steuerfahnder und Steuerfahndungshelfer des Finanzamts Frankfurt V und wenden uns an Sie , weil wir begründeten Anlass zu der Sorge haben , dass die Steuerfahndung Frankfurt am Main ihren Aufgaben nicht mehr gerecht werden kann , weil Steuerhinterzieher nicht in gebotenem Maße verfolgt werden können . "
Seitenlang schildern die Fahnder die Vorfälle ihrem obersten Dienstherrn .
48 Fahnder unterschreiben den Brief , die anderen sollen folgen .
Abgeschickt jedoch wird er nicht .
Denn nach einem Wochenende Bedenkzeit zieht ein Großteil der Fahnder die Unterschrift zurück .
Der eine sagt , er habe ein Haus abzuzahlen , der andere hat Kinder im Studium , ein dritter pflegebedürftige Eltern .
Kaum einer will riskieren , für immer und ewig auf dem Abstellgleis zu versauern .
Und dass dies passieren kann , das hat man ja gesehen .
Dubiose Umstrukturierung
Da hilft alles Reden nichts , dass man nur gemeinsam stark sei und man schließlich nicht 70 Fahnder auf einmal strafversetzen kann und all das .
Nur ein kleines Häuflein lässt sich den Schneid nicht abkaufen .
Tief enttäuscht schickt Steuerfahnder Dieter Reimann , einer der sieben Beauftragten , wenigstens eine Kopie des Briefes an alle , die Geld gegeben haben , " das auch als Erinnerung an den heißen Sommer 2003 , verbunden mit der Hoffnung , dass unsere Dienststelle irgendwie den Herbst und den Winter überlebt " .
Aber auch diese Hoffnung erfüllt sich nicht .
Zum Jahreswechsel wird die Steuerfahndung Frankfurt V zum Entsetzen aller aufgelöst , eine Umstrukturierung , die zunächst die Steuerfahndungen in ganz Hessen betreffen soll , die dann aber seltsamerweise doch nur auf die Frankfurter Steuerfahndung beschränkt bleibt .
Ein Teil der Fahnder darf in die Steuerfahndung anderer Ämter wechseln .
Die kritischen Geister jedoch und jene , die man dafür hält , müssen die Steuerfahndung verlassen .
Ein Teil von ihnen wird in die " Servicestelle Recht " versetzt , wo dringend " erfahrenes Personal benötigt wird " , so die Behördenleitung .
Steuerfahnder hingegen gebe es viel zu viele - obwohl man gerade noch die umstrittene Amtsverfügung durchgesetzt hatte , um aus Personalnot nicht von der Vielzahl der Bankenfälle erstickt zu werden .
Archipel Gulag
Die Servicestelle Recht ist eine Geisterstation .
" Wir kamen da an " , erzählt einer von denen , die nicht mit Namen im stern stehen möchten , " da waren keine Computer , keine Akten , kein Chef .
Es gab nichts zu tun .
Wir haben aus dem Fenster geguckt und Urlaubsfotos sortiert . "
Für die erfolgsverwöhnten Steuerfahnder ist das ein Schock .
Sie , die nach jahrelanger Fahndungsarbeit , hohem Arbeits - und Zeitdruck oft nicht wussten , was sie zuerst tun sollten , sind auf einmal verurteilt zum Däumchendrehen .
" Da saß ich da , nach all den Jahren , nach all den Dramen , nach all den aufregenden Schichten , und war froh , einen Kirchensteuerfall zu bearbeiten , da ging es um 70 Euro " , erzählt Fahnder Frank Wehrheim , der Mann , der jahrelang die Frankfurter Prominenz das Fürchten lehrte .
Und dann das Getuschel und Gewisper auf den Gängen .
" Man nannte die Servicestelle Recht behördenintern auch ‚ Strafbataillon ‘ oder ‚ Archipel Gulag ‘ .
Wenn wir in die Kantine kamen , verstummten die Gespräche " , erzählt Tina Feser .
" Viele wussten nicht , was passiert war .
Wir waren die , die irgendwie Dreck am Stecken hatten . "
Andere Fahnder erwischt es noch schlimmer .
Heiko Feser zum Beispiel .
Sein Gehalt bleibt das gleiche , aber seine Arbeit nicht .
Er verliert seine Zeichnungsberechtigung und seinen eigenen Zuständigkeitsbereich .
Er darf keinen Brief mehr unterschreiben , hat keinen eigenen Schreibtisch mehr , und morgens , wenn er kommt , weiß er nicht , wo er seinen Mantel aufhängen soll .
Er soll andere Sachbearbeiter bei simplen Steuererklärungen " unterstützen " , ein Job , den normalerweise die Frischlinge von der Verwaltungsfachhochschule übernehmen , um in den Beruf hineinzuschnuppern .
Ein anderer Fahnder , den man als Springer in einer Veranlagungsstelle einsetzt , hat nicht mal einen Computer .
Auf seinem Schreibtisch steht zwar ein Telefon , aber er bekommt den Nummerncode nicht , um es zu bedienen .
Rudolf Schmenger sitzt derweil in der Konzernbetriebsprüfung und bearbeitet " Nullfälle " : " Ich bekam die , von denen man schon vorher weiß , dass es nichts zu prüfen gibt . "
Die ausgebremsten Fahnder leiden .
Ohnmachtsgefühle wechseln mit Wut , Selbstzweifel mit tiefer Traurigkeit - kaum einer von ihnen bleibt verschont .
Manchmal sitzen sie da und fragen sich :
Wie sind wir nur in diese Situation geraten ?
Sie verstehen die Welt nicht mehr und nicht mehr diesen Staat , an den sie geglaubt und auf den sie einen Eid abgelegt haben .
War das alles ein großer Irrtum ?
Spontane Blackouts
Dem " Spiegel " und anderen Medien fällt der Brandbrief um die Amtsverfügung in die Hände .
Die Berichterstattung führt zu einem Untersuchungsausschuss im Landtag , der klären soll , wie hoch der Schaden durch die " Umstrukturierungen " und die umstrittene Amtsverfügung ist , der dem Land Hessen entstand .
Spätestens jetzt ist Ministerpräsident Koch umfassend auf dem Laufenden .
Der Steuerfahnder Schad , jener Sportsfreund , der einst den Raum im Landessportbund organisierte , in dem die Fahnder den Aufstand probten , soll als Kronzeuge der Fahnder aussagen .
Er wird ins Finanzministerium eingeladen .
Man eröffnet ihm " neue berufliche Perspektiven " .
Bei seiner Aussage im Untersuchungsausschuss kann er sich plötzlich an vieles nicht mehr erinnern .
Er erleidet einen " Blackout " , wie er seinen Fahnderkollegen später erklärt .
Dem stern sagt er heute , das sei schließlich auch schon vielen berühmten Politikern passiert .
Warum er seine Aussage nicht korrigiert habe , als sie ihm , wie üblich , zur Korrektur zugeschickt wurde ?
" Ich habe sie nicht noch mal gelesen . "
Die CDU hält die Vorwürfe damit für ausgeräumt .
Die SPD gibt ein Minderheitenvotum ab , weil sie den Zeugenaussagen das Gegenteil entnimmt , aber das erregt kein großes Aufsehen .
Es ist ja auch wahr :
Wie soll man einen Schaden beziffern , wenn man die Fälle gar nicht ausermittelt .
Die Annahme , dass , wenn gleichgelagerte vorangegangene Fälle Millionen brachten , auch die nachfolgenden Fälle Millionen bringen werden , entspricht zwar dem gesunden Menschenverstand - aber beweisen kann man das nicht .
Der Ausschussobmann der SPD , Norbert Schmitt , erklärt das Scheitern des Untersuchungsausschusses heute auch damit , dass ein Großteil der Zeugen Beamte waren : " Wir hatten das Gefühl , dass Leute unter Druck gesetzt wurden .
Einige Zeugen hatten einfach Angst " , sagt Schmitt .
Verbittert sagt ein Fahnder , der seinen Namen nicht nennen möchte : " Aus meiner Sicht hat der Ausschuss nichts gebracht und fast tatenlos zugesehen , wie nicht nur eine Person , sondern fast ein ganzes Dutzend von ihren Vorgesetzten gemobbt wurde .
Ich persönlich habe einen Großteil an Vertrauen in das System verloren und werde mich zukünftig auch bestimmt nicht mehr so engagieren , wie ich das damals getan habe . "
Nach seiner Aussage im Ausschuss darf Ex - Fahnder Schad aus dem " Archipel Gulag " ins Innenministerium wechseln und sein Hobby zum Beruf machen .
Er wird Referent für Leistungssport .
Dem stern gegenüber erklärt er , dass diese Chance mit seinem Blackout nichts zu tun gehabt habe , auch wenn Ex-Kollegen das wohl anders sehen würden .
Einige der abgeschobenen Fahnder werden krank .
Rudolf Schmengers Nieren spielen verrückt , Heiko Fesers Leberwerte steigen ins Unermessliche , einer bekommt Depressionen , ein anderer unberechenbare Wutanfälle .
Manche wollen nicht wahrhaben , was mit ihnen geschieht .
Andere versuchen den Ausbruch .
Sie bewerben sich auf andere Stellen : Verfassungsschutz , Landesbehörden , Zoll , Amtsanwaltschaften , egal , alles ist recht , nur weg aus dem " Archipel Gulag " .
Aber ihre Bewerbungen sind erfolglos , manche verschwinden auf dem Dienstweg , manche werden nicht berücksichtigt , bei anderen kommt in allerletzter Sekunde irgendetwas dazwischen .
Ein Fahnder fragt eine ehemalige Kollegin aus dem Finanzamt , die jetzt im Personalamt arbeitet , wie das zusammenhänge , und die bedeutet ihm , dass er sich jede Bewerbung sparen kann :
Das werde nichts , das hänge mit " der Sache " zusammen , mehr könne sie ihm nicht sagen , ohne selbst in Ungnade zu fallen .
Alle Möglichkeiten ausgeschöpft
Steuerfahnderstellen werden ausgeschrieben , obwohl man doch angeblich zu viele davon hat .
Als sich die Fahnder aus dem Strafbataillon darauf bewerben , wird schnell die Ausschreibung geändert .
Kleines " redaktionelles Versehen " , so die Behördenleitung in einem Schreiben .
Für die Steuerfahndung Frankfurt suche man Kollegen aus ganz Hessen - außer aus Frankfurt .
Wieder nichts .
Rudolf Schmenger und die anderen beschreiten alle offen stehenden Wege .
Sie schreiben Petitionen und Einsprüche , sie klagen gegen ihre Versetzungen , sie bewerben sich weg .
Sogar der Personalrat wendet sich 2005 an den Finanzminister Karlheinz Weimar , CDU - aber der antwortet einfach nicht .
Der FDP - Landtagsabgeordnete Roland von Hunnius beklagt in einer Rede im November 2005 " eine Verkettung von Merkwürdigkeiten und Absonderlichkeiten , die aufhorchen lässt " .
Die Abfolge von Kritik an einer Amtsverfügung , Versetzungen , Auflösung der Steuerfahndung Frankfurt V , die plötzliche Änderung von Ausschreibungen , das " Verlorengehen " von Bewerbungsunterlagen auf dem Dienstweg , die Verschleppung von Unterlagen für den Petitionsausschuss - all das findet selbst der Koch - Freund Hunnius " ein bisschen viel Zufall " .
Der CDU - Landtagsabgeordnete Hans - Jürgen Irmer , der mit der Mutter eines Fahnders persönlich bekannt ist , schreibt an den " Sehr geehrten Herrn Minister , lieber Karlheinz " , über seine Verwunderung , dass Steuerfahnder im Dezember 2003 entbehrlich sind und umgesetzt werden und man schon im April neue Leute suche .
" Dies ist logisch nicht nachzuvollziehen . "
In einer Stellungnahme schreibt der Sprecher des Finanzministeriums , dass die Versetzung der Fahnder eine rein organisatorische Maßnahme gewesen sei .
Ein Zusammenhang mit ihrer kritischen Haltung bestehe nicht .
Unglaubliche Diagnose
Doch die Merkwürdigkeiten hören nicht auf .
Mitte 2006 bekommt Rudolf Schmenger eine Aufforderung der Oberfinanzdirektion , sich medizinisch begutachten zu lassen .
" Ich hab gehofft , dass ein Arzt feststellt , dass ich trotz meines Nierenleidens absehbar wieder voll einsatzfähig sein werde und in die Steuerfahndung zurückkehren kann . "
Aber als er ankommt , sitzt da kein Nierenarzt , sondern der Psychiater Dr. med .
Thomas Holzmann .
" Dass ein Nervengutachten in Auftrag gegeben worden war , erfuhr ich erst dort .
Ich übergab ihm meine Krankengeschichte und bat ihn , alles dafür zu tun , dass ich weiterarbeiten kann . "
Rudolf Schmenger wird wegen einer paranoid - querulatorischen Entwicklung in den Ruhestand versetzt .
" Da es sich bei der psychischen Erkrankung um eine chronische und verfestigte Entwicklung ohne Krankheitseinsicht handelt , ist seine Rückkehr an seine Arbeitsstätte nicht denkbar und Herr Schmenger als dienst - und auch als teildienstunfähig anzusehen . "
Der Gutachter ist sich seiner Sache absolut sicher , seine Diagnose gilt auch für die Zukunft .
" An diesen Gegebenheiten wird sich aller Voraussicht nach auch nichts mehr ändern lassen , so dass eine Nachuntersuchung nicht als indiziert angesehen werden kann " , schreibt er .
Schmengers Protest nützt nichts .
Auch Heiko Feser , gerade mal 37 Jahre alt , wird aufgrund fast gleichlautender Diagnose des gleichen Gutachters zwangspensioniert .
Ebenso ein weiterer Steuerfahnder .
Gutachter Holzmann bestätigt den Vorgang auf Anfrage , sieht aber die ärztliche Sorgfaltspflicht erfüllt .
Im Februar , kurz nach der Durchsuchung in Postchef Zumwinkels Haus , stellt der SPD - Politiker Reinhard Kahl , der hofft , unter Andrea Ypsilanti Finanzminister zu werden , eine Anfrage im Landtag :
Was eigentlich aus den 326 Kisten und 357 Ordnern mit Liechtensteiner Steuerakten geworden sei , die die Frankfurter Fahnder in den Vorjahren aus den Banken geholt haben .
Die Antwort des Finanzministers Karlheinz Weimar : Alle abgearbeitet .
Steuermehreinnahmen pro Fall : durchschnittlich 208 Euro .
Zweihundertacht Euro !
Die Ex -Fahnder , die die Sache im Landtag verfolgen , wissen nicht , ob sie lachen oder weinen sollen .
208 Euro durchschnittliche Steuermehreinnahmen pro Stiftungsfall ?
Für einen Zeitraum von zehn Jahren ?
Wie wahrscheinlich ist das denn ?
Experten der Steuerfahndung aus Nordrhein - Westfalen , die die aktuellen Liechtenstein - Fälle bearbeiten , halten das alles für einen Witz : " Es ist doch nicht Omi Meier , die ihren Sparstrumpf nach Liechtenstein bringt " , sagt einer , der namentlich nicht genannt werden möchte .
" Das lohnt sich doch alles erst ab einer Million . "
Der erste Liechtenstein - Prozess , den die Bochumer Staatsanwaltschaft mit dem Material der vom BND gekauften Liechtenstein - CD führt , ging im Juli dieses Jahres zu Ende .
Das Urteil : 7,5 Millionen Euro Strafe , zwei Jahre auf Bewährung .
Der Verurteilte : Ein Kaufmann aus Bad Homburg , keine 20 Kilometer nördlich von Frankfurt .
Neue Wege gehen
Ex -Fahnder Heiko Feser schreibt derweil an einem Kinderbuch .
Er fühlt sich zum Irren abgestempelt und fürs Leben gebrandmarkt .
Am liebsten würde er auswandern .
Tina Feser studiert Malerei und versucht , die ständigen Selbstzweifel zu besiegen und die bohrenden Fragen , ob der bequeme Weg nicht der Bessere gewesen wäre .
Ein anderer Kollege hat die Fahrlehrerprüfung gemacht und hilft ehrenamtlich in einer Fahrschule , weil ihm sonst die Decke auf den Kopf fällt .
Ihre lebenslangen Pensionen muss der Steuerzahler aufbringen .
Frank Wehrheim hat sich in die Altersteilzeit verabschiedet .
Rudolf Schmenger arbeitet jetzt als Steuerberater .
Er hat viele Anfragen von Klienten mit Liechtenstein - Fällen .
Er kennt ja alle Tricks .
Für die Zulassung zum Steuerberater musste Schmenger sich übrigens psychiatrisch begutachten lassen .
Ergebnis : Rudolf Schmenger ist ein freundlicher , kommunikativer , zugewandter Mensch und psychisch kerngesund .
IBM 's claim that it has designed the first brain simulation to exceed the scale of a cat 's cortex is being dismissed as " a hoax and a PR stunt " by a rival scientist .
IBM researcher Dharmendra Modha last week hailed his company 's new simulations as a " tremendous historic milestone " that will ultimately point the way to human - scale brain simulations .
But his boast was criticized in an open letter issued by Henry Markram , director of the Blue Brain Project in Switzerland , which is also attempting to reverse - engineer mammalian brains .
" This is light years away from a cat brain , not even close to an ant 's brain in complexity , " Markram wrote in an open letter which was sent to IBM Fellow and CTO Bernard Meyerson and reprinted on IEEE Spectrum .
" It is highly unethical of Mohda to mislead the public in making people believe they have actually simulated a cat 's brain .
Absolutely shocking . "
Cray blows by IBM to regain supercomputing crown
IBM voiced support for Modha ’s work in a statement e-mailed to Network World .
" IBM stands by the scientific integrity of the announcement on cognitive computing led by IBM in collaboration with Stanford University , University of Wisconsin - Madison , Cornell University , Columbia University Medical Center , University of California - Merced and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , " the IBM statement reads .
" The cognitive computing team has achieved two milestones that indicate the feasibility of building a computing system that requires much less energy than today 's supercomputers , and is modeled after the cognition of the brain .
This is important interdisciplinary exploratory research bringing together computational neuroscience , microelectronics and neuroanatomy , and this work has been commented on favorably by others in the scientific community . "
Despite the disagreement between Markram and Modha , the Blue Brain Project counts IBM as one of its technology partners .
Modha is the lead researcher on IBM 's cognitive computing project .
In an interview with Network World before last week 's announcement , Modha did clarify that the cat cortex simulation falls short of totally replicating a feline 's brain .
" It 's really not as powerful as a cat 's brain in terms of function , " he said .
" What we have developed is an instrument of scientific discovery that can allow us to test various hypotheses of structures , dynamics and functions about the algorithms of the brain . "
The cat brain simulation involved 1 billion spiking neurons and 10 trillion individual learning synapses , and was performed on an IBM Blue Gene / P supercomputer with 147,456 processors and 144TB of main memory .
Modha said the point is not to create robots that act like humans , but rather to use brain - like capabilities to create systems that can analyze streams of continually changing raw data in real time , and thus help businesses make better decisions .
" This is a tremendous historic milestone , " Modha said before last week 's IBM announcement .
" It shows that if we build a supercomputer with 1 exaflop computing power and 4 petabytes of main memory -- which might be possible within the decade -- then a human - scale simulation in real time will become possible . "
Markram , however , said the cat brain simulation involves only " point neurons , " which are " missing missing 99.999 % of the brain ; no branches ; no detailed ion channels ; the simplest possible equation you can imagine to simulate a neuron , totally trivial synapses . "
A paper on the cat cortex simulation titled " The Cat is Out of the Bag , " authored by Modha and several colleagues , was awarded the Gordon Bell Prize at last week 's SC09 supercomputing conference .
The prize , issued by the Association for Computing Machinery , recognizes achievement in high - performance computing applications .
Markram objected to the Bell Prize decision , writing that " I never realized that such trivial and unethical behavior would actually be rewarded . "
He went on to call the cat brain research an " outright deception of the public . "
" All these kinds of simulations are trivial and have been around for decades , " Markram wrote .
" There is no qualified neuroscientist on the planet that would agree that this is even close to a cat 's brain . "
In response to a query from Network World , Markram reiterated that he believes IBM 's announcement is " a clear case of scientific deception of the public " and gave additional reasons supporting his contention .
" They claim to have simulated over a billion neurons interacting , " Markram wrote in an e-mail to Network World .
" Their so - called ' neurons ' are the tiniest of points you can imagine , a microscopic dot .
Over 98 % of the volume of a neuron is branches ( like a tree ) .
They just cut off all the branches and roots and took a point in the middle of the trunk to represent a entire neuron .
In real life , each segment of the branches of a neuron contains dozens of ion channels that powerfully controls the information processing in a neuron .
They have none of that .
Neurons contain tens of thousands of proteins that form a network with tens of millions of interactions .
These interactions are incredibly complex and will require solving millions of differential equations .
They have none of that . "
Markram went on to say that " These points they simulated and the synapses that they use for communication are literally millions of times simpler than a real cat brain .
So they have not even simulated a cat 's brain at one millionth of its complexity . "

The unfolding secret story of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon is being told today when more than 500,000 intercepted pager messages , many from US officials , are published online in the order in which they were sent .
The mass live leak began at 8 am GMT and will continue for 24 hours until all of the messages are seen as they were sent on September 11 .
The experiment by whistleblowing website Wikileaks includes pager messages sent on the day by officials in the Pentagon , the New York police and witnesses to the collapse of the twin towers .
Wikileaks said the messages would show a " completely objective record of the defining moment of our time " .
It added : " We hope that its entry into the historical record will lead to a more nuanced understanding of how this tragedy and its aftermath may have been prevented . "
The post said the release of the messages at times corresponding to when they were sent would help " foster a deeper understanding " .
A preview of some of the messages to be leaked suggests they show how panic and rumour began to spread on the day , and are likely to fuel conspiracy theories about the attacks .
One message from a New York City official sent just minutes after the first attack said : " WTC has been hit by an airplane and a bomb . "
Another says : " It 's reported that a US military helicopter circled the building then crashed into or next to the Pentagon . "
Later in the day , a message presciently says : " We are bombing Afghanistan . "
One message from a witness reads : " Still in my apt , nowhere to go ...
This is the end of the world as we know it . "
Wikileaks would not reveal the source for the leak , but hinted : " It is clear that the information comes from an organisation which has been intercepting and archiving US national telecommunciations since prior to 9/11 .
Wikileaks has a good track record in releasing authentic official documents , but its website tends to get overloaded at busy times .
It is encouraging readers to follow the leaks on Twitter .
How to create and apply a patch with Git
Creating a patch file with git is quite easy to do , you just need to see how it ’s done a few times .
This article will show you how to create a patch from the last few commits in your repository .
Next , I ’ll also show you how you can correctly apply this patch to another repository .
Before you start
To make creating patches easier , there are some common git practices you should follow .
It ’s not necessary , but it will make your life easier .
If you fix a bug or create a new feature – do it in a separate branch !
Let ’s say you want to create a patch for my imdb gem .
You should clone my repository and create a new branch for the fix you have in mind .
In this sample we ’ll do an imaginary fix for empty posters .
git clone git://github.com/ariejan/imdb.git cd imdb git checkout - b fix_empty_poster
Now , in the new fix_empty_poster branch you can hack whatever you need to fix .
Write tests , update code etc. etc .
When you ’re satisfied with all you changes , it ’s time to create your patch .
FYI : I ’m assuming you made a few commits in the fix_empty_poster branch and did not yet merge it back in to the master branch .
Creating the patch
Okay , I ’ve made some commits , here ’s the git log for the fix_empty_poster branch :
git log -- pretty = oneline - 3 * ce30d1 f - ( fix_empty_poster )
Added poster URL as part of cli output ( 7 minutes ago ) * 5998b80 - Added specs to test empty poster URL behaviour ( 12 minutes ago ) * aecb8 cb - ( REL - 0.5.0 , origin / master , origin / HEAD , master )
Prepare release 0.5.0 ( 4 months ago )
In GitX it would look like this :
Okay , now it ’s time to go and make a patch !
All we really want are the two latest commits , stuff them in a file and send them to someone to apply them .
But , since we created a separate branch , we do n’t have to worry about commits at all !
git format - patch master -- stdout > fix_empty_poster.patch
This will create a new file fix_empty_poster .
patch with all changes from the current ( fix_empty_poster ) against master .
Normally , git would create a separate patch file for each commit , but that ’s not what we want .
All we need is a single patch file .
Now , you have a patch for the fix you wrote .
Send it to the maintainer of the project …
Applying the patch
… who will apply the patch you just sent !
But , before you do that , there are some other steps you should take .
First , take a look at what changes are in the patch .
You can do this easily with git apply
git apply -- stat fix_empty_poster.patch
Note that this command does not apply the patch , but only shows you the stats about what it ’ll do .
After peeking into the patch file with your favorite editor , you can see what the actual changes are .
Next , you ’re interested in how troublesome the patch is going to be .
Git allows you to test the patch before you actually apply it .
git apply -- check fix_empty_poster.patch
If you do n’t get any errors , the patch can be applied cleanly .
Otherwise you may see what trouble you ’ll run into .
To apply the patch , I ’ll use git am instead of git apply .
The reason for this is that git am allows you to sign off an applied patch .
This may be useful for later reference .
git am -- signoff < fix_empty_poster.patch
Applying : Added specs to test empty poster URL behaviour Applying : Added poster URL as part of cli output
Okay , patches were applied cleanly and your master branch has been updated .
Of course , run your tests again to make sure nothing got borked .
In you git log , you ’ll find that the commit messages contain a “ Signed - off - by ” tag .
This tag will be read by Github and others to provide useful info about how the commit ended up in the code .
That ’s all folks !
Are there any other git topics you ’d like covered here ?
Please let me know !

“ I ’m as mad as hell , and I ’m not going to take this anymore ! ”
That famous declaration by Howard Beale in the movie “ Network ” is the implicit and sometimes explicit message of the many hundreds of responses to last week ’s column on phrases and announcements that make your heart sink and make you want to commit mayhem .
“ Rage ” was a word often used as readers accepted my invitation to add their own ( non ) favorites to my small list .
By my count , the top preferred un - preferred phrase was “ No problem ” in response to “ Thank you ” ( disliked either because it suggests a problem caused by you will be graciously ignored or that no problem existed when you know it did ) .
That was followed by “ Batteries Not Included , ” “ Are you still working on that ? ” ( asked by a waiter who wants to get rid of you ) , “ For your convenience ” ( always a preliminary to inconvenience ) , “ Have a nice day ” and one I did cite , “ Your call is important to us . ”
Many more posters than usual signed their own names rather than using initials or pseudonyms .
I take that to be an indication of the strength of their feelings ; they wanted to acknowledge and own their personal anger .
One respondent requested a list of phrases we love to hear .
That was hard ( what does this tell you about life ? ) , but I did come up with a few : “ You are right , ” “ It ’s a girl , ” “ It ’s a boy , ” “ Great job , ” “ No charge ” and “ Sunshine all day . ”
Sunshine came into my day when a bank executive e-mailed me to say that he has sent the column to his branch presidents in the hope that it would help employees “ avoid making people feel the pain associated with the examples you cite . ”
Makes you believe in journalism .
Here is a selection by me and the editors of comments that hit the mark .
Where to start !
The Victorians thought they were living in the great age of cant ; their jaws would drop in sight of the vast stinking swamp of it we wade through every day .

My favorites … “ I do n’t mean to be rude , ” when you know full well they are going to be .
Also under that heading comes , “ I do n’t mean to criticise ” or … ” I do n’t mean to be nasty . ”
And of course that is exactly what the offender does .

It seems that irritating utterances make up ninety percent of human interactions whether verbal , written or virtual .
The to - be -continued is especially annoying with the weather report on any television station .
The announcer invariably says something like : “ Category 5 hurricane on its way , see what it does to your weekend weather later on in this program . ”

There ’s one expression that really , really irks me , and I doubt it ever arose through any sort of design , although I suspect it may have evolved from an older expression that tends to irritate me as well .
“ It ’s all good . ” I consider this phrase to be the evil offspring of “ Have a nice day . ”
I am always tempted to reply , “ No , it is n’t , ” and “ Make me ! ” or much cruder words to that effect .

“ This is a courtesy call … ”
I absolutely want to strangle telemarketers or service providers who interrupt my life with their ‘ courtesy calls ’ .
The real courtesy would be not to call in the first place , or not to label it as such .

“ Thank you for calling .
Your call is very important to us .
All of our associates are busy serving other customers .
Please stay on the line and your call will be answered in the order received ” .
Translation : “ We ’ve put you on indefinite hold , and wo n’t tell you where you are in the queue or your expected wait time .
We do n’t want to spend a lot of money on staff since that cuts into our profits .
So you get to listen to prerecorded music with frequent repetitions of this message until you get frustrated and hang up .
If you do get through , you ’re going to talk to someone sitting in a call center halfway around the world who will spend the first five minutes verifying your identity .
We know that we have no competition , so you ’re going to have to deal with us on our terms .
Sucka ! ”

Any sentence that involves my so - called patience : “ Thank you for your patience ” et al .
I ’m not patient , I ’m not being patient , and I ’m not about to start now .
Also , “ No problem ” means “ There ’s no need to apologize . ”
It does not mean “ You ’re welcome . ”
When a waiter or any person working in any kind of service industry says “ No problem , ” I always think to myself “ well , I ’m glad it ’s not a problem since it ’s your freakin ’ job to do this for me . ”

In a restaurant , while having a good , and perhaps intimate , conversation , a waiter comes over and says , “ Is everything all right ? ”
The correct answer would be , “ Yes , it was , until we were interrupted . ”
Of course , that would lead to an apology , which would further delay our conversation .

The phrase at the top of my “ most annoying ” list at the moment is anything done “ to perfection . ”
Grilled to perfection … broiled to perfection … pan-seared to perfection .
This construction is so terribly overdone ( as opposed to rare , or even medium rare ) by those who write menus and otherwise promote restaurants that it might actually be pushing me away from the items described .
Just do what you have to do to my food ( I must trust you , or I would have gone elsewhere to eat ) and be done with it .
And please do n’t stop aspiring to perfection , but also cease trying to convince us that you ’ve reached it .

Would someone PLEASE tell the Chucks of the world that we ’re aware of what his function in the restaurant is and that it does n’t include intruding on our evening by imposing his acquaintance on us — as though we ’d come to the establishment to make friends rather than have dinner .
If we needed Chuck ’s help at some point when he is absent from our table , it would be easy to summon him if we knew his name from a name tag or a button that had “ 23 ″ on it .
Are we forever doomed to the phony - egalitarian bonhomie of the You - can - call - me - Chuck , who will doubtless ask someone “ Are you still working on that ?!? ” during the meal , or can we perhaps have a dinner we ’re paying for ( and paying him to serve ) in relaxed anonymity ? —

Here 's a major oil deal to keep on your radar :
Dealbook : Devon Energy , the independent oil and gas firm , surprised many on Monday by announcing its plans to divest all of its offshore and international energy properties to concentrate on its domestic onshore energy businesses .
The sale , which the company estimates could generate after - tax proceeds of between $ 4.5 billion to $ 7.5 billion , would be one of the largest sales in the Gulf of Mexico in recent history and could draw some major bidders with deep pockets , ranging from the major oil companies to foreign competitors , including the Chinese .

A homeowner in Golden held a burglary suspect in stolen boxer shorts at gunpoint last week , police said today .
The homeowner , who was not named by police , said he came home at 5 p.m. on Nov. 9 and found Timothy P. Gonzales , 24 , of Golden in his home wearing only the homeowner ’s underwear .
The homeowner said when he arrived at his house in the 1200 block of Mesa Court he found a white Lexus parked in his garage and items in his home that were out of place .
He fetched his pistol from a bedroom and called out , police said .
Gonzales answered , he told police .
The man confronted Gonzales and ordered him to leave the house .
Gonzales allegedly argued that the pistol was not real and “ moved aggressively ” toward the homeowner , who fired a warning shot , police said .
When police arrived the homeowner was still holding Gonzales at gunpoint .
Police said investigators think Gonzales had been in the home most of the day .
He showered , did laundry and put food he bought in the refrigerator , police said in a statement .
The home is for sale , and Gonzales pretended to be the home owner when two real estate agents brought by clients who wanted to look at the home , police said .
Police also said they found materials used to make methamphetamine on a work bench in the garage .
Gonzales remains in the Jefferson County Detention Center under $ 50,000 bond .
The charges against him include burglary , menacing , possession of burglary tools , possession of a controlled substance and resisting arrest .
Public records show Gonzales has been arrested several times before on drug , burglary , domestic violence and other charges .
Somewhere in New York an auto dealership employee is almost certainly looking for a job now that he 's wrecked one of the world 's rarest supercars .
The car in question is an 806 - horsepower Koenigsegg CCX , a car so exclusive the Swedish boutique automaker – which , by the way , is buying Saab from General Motors – builds just 25 annually .
Of those , a mere 10 arrive in the United States .
They go for about one mil apiece .
According to WreckedExotics.com , the owner of this 2008 model left it at the dealership , presumably to have some work done .
That 's when an employee with more stones than skills took it for a spin and hit a guard rail .
As if that were n't enough , he also took out a new Porsche GT2 .
Thanks to WreckedExotics for the pic .

SEDS Students Host SpaceVision 2009 Conference at UA UA students have organized what looks to be one of the year 's premier space conferences .
They 're hosting it at the Lunar and Planetary Lab .
By Lori Stiles , University Communications
Leading space industry entrepreneurs , an astronaut , a private citizen space traveler , a Congresswoman , distinguished astronomers and space scientists , NASA officials and a giant telescope mirror maker are among 25 featured speakers at the SpaceVision 2009 Conference to be held at the University of Arizona Nov. 12-15 .
UA student members of SEDS , or Students for the Exploration and Development of Space , organized SpaceVision 2009 as the organization 's 2009 national meeting .
Activities are based at the UA Lunar and Planetary Laboratory and other locations on campus .
The conference agenda can be downloaded from the SpaceVision 2009 Web site .
Anyone can register and attend the conference for a registration fee .
Â
Registration can be made online at the SpaceVision Web site until Nov. 11 and at the conference registration desk in the Kuiper Space Sciences Building thereafter .
Registration costs $ 90 for the general public , $ 30 for students , and $ 70 for members of affiliate organizations that include the National Space Society , the American Astronomical Society and Space Frontier Foundation .
" What separates SEDS from other professional space societies is that ours is a 100 - percent student - run organization , " said Joshua Nelson , a recent UA graduate and president of the national organization , SEDS - USA .
The annual national SEDS conference is the largest fully student - run space conference in the nation .
It is dedicated to facilitating networking between college students , professionals and the public , furthering the development of SEDS - USA , and fostering the exchange of ideas through professional speakers and workshops .
" We want the public to understand that there 's more to space than NASA , " said Kyle Stephens , conference organizer .
Stephens , a junior majoring in optical sciences and engineering , is president of the 60 - member UA chapter of SEDS .
" Although NASA does play a large role in space exploration , the private space industry is doing a lot for space exploration and development that people do n't often hear about . "
Background on all scheduled speakers can be viewed online .
Speakers include :
Peter Diamandis , chairman and founder of the X PRIZE Foundation
Chris Lewicki , chief engineer , LewickiDyne Systems .
Lewicki , an alumnus of the UA and former chairman of the national board for SEDS , was flight director for NASA 's Mars rovers " Spirit " and " Opportunity " and surface mission manager for the Phoenix Mars Lander
Richard Garriott , who in October 2008 became the sixth private citizen to travel in space
Taber MacCallum , chief executive officer and co-founder of Paragon Space Development Corp .
Lynn Cline , NASA 's deputy associate administrator for space operations
Gabrielle Giffords , U.S. Congresswoman for Arizona 's 8th District , chair of the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee

" We not only know placebos work , " Dr. Harriet Hall explains in a fascinating , well - researched article in Skeptic , " we know there is a hierarchy of effectiveness " :
* Placebo surgery works better than placebo injections
* Placebo injections work better than placebo pills
* Sham acupuncture treatment works better than a placebo pill
* Capsules work better than tablets
* Big pills work better than small
* The more doses a day , the better
* The more expensive , the better
* The color of the pill makes a difference
* Telling the patient , " This will relieve your pain " works better than saying " This might help .
To help convey the power of that doctors routinely wield , Dr. Hall 's article opens with a treatment anecdote that gives a flavor of the article to come :
" Jane D. was a regular visitor to our ER , " she recalls , " usually showing up late at night demanding an injection of the narcotic Demerol , the only thing that worked for her severe headaches .
One night the staff psychiatrist had the nurse give her an injection of saline instead .
It worked !
He told Jane she had responded to a placebo , discussed the implications , and thought he'd helped her understand that her problem was psychological .
But as he was leaving the room , Jane asked , " Can I get that new medicine again next time instead of the Demerol ?
It really worked great ! "
In short , when we think something will work , its chances of doing so increase dramatically .
Dr. Hall then refines that idea by giving it a sharper explanation : " What ’s effective is not the placebo , " meaning the benefit patients derive from a " dummy " pill , " but the meaning of the treatment . "
She hypothesizes that the power of the effect depends on four variables : patient expectancy ; ( the desire to improve one 's health ) ; a certain amount of conditioning , including from ; and endogenous , or pain - relieving chemicals produced in the brain , which copy the effect of pain - relievers such as opiates .
To that end , it is n't so surprising to hear her claim : " A substantial percentage of the effects from antidepressants may be placebo effects . "
Her assertion jibes with one that PT blogger Dr. Philip Newton made on this site last December : " In some controversial cases , such as ( SSRI ) anti-depressants , " he wrote , " placebo effects are thought to account for a major proportion of the positive effects of a drug . "
Researchers have of course long - known and long - studied the effect of placebos , and just as obviously try to minimize the effect by controlling for it .
In " Listening to Prozac but Hearing Placebo , " however , a significant meta- analysis of SSRI antidepressants given to 2,318 patients with , Drs. Irving Kirsch and Guy Sapirstein found in 1998 that " the placebo response is a predictor of the drug response , " which is rather telling , and a relation they chart quite dramatically on the following graph :
Not only that , but " the placebo response was constant across different types of ( 75 % ) , and the correlation between and drug effect was .90 . "
As they put it , " These data indicate that virtually all of the variation in drug effect size was due to the placebo characteristics of the studies , " which calculated placebo as the single largest factor , accounting for 50.97 % of SSRI efficacy .
" Our results are in agreement with those of other meta - analyses , " Kirsch and Sapirstein explained , " revealing a substantial placebo effect in antidepressant medication . "
" They also indicate that the placebo component of the response to medication is considerably greater than the pharmacological effect . "
Kirsch and Sapirstein 's study never got the airtime it deserved .
A serious , well - executed meta- analysis , it was quickly drowned out by a litany of other studies that assessed the efficacy of antidepressants in comparative terms with each other , rather than as a base - level investigation of efficacy , with each drug studied relative to placebo alone .
The shift in emphasis played a big role in tilting interest more toward comparative pharmacology , shunting the effect of placebos aside .
Still , Dr. Hall 's striking article hopefully will return our to the exciting opportunities and real quandaries ( medical and ethical ) that the placebo effect poses , in so far as it can have a documented , substantial , and lasting impact on patients without costs or side effects .
Hence the pun in my title : placebos do work — which is to say , they have effects that are part of the treatment process and should not be discounted as such .
The placebo indicates that the mind and its sometimes effects are incredibly powerful instruments in treatment , and that we 're getting but half the story in focusing so relentlessly on biology and , to the expense of so much else .
Granted , offering placebo alone to patients ( something I 'm not advocating ) would raise charges of quackery and suspicions that the doctor or psychiatrist is inherently against medication , a position viewed with great skepticism today .
To put that another way , patients so often expect medication that if the doctor or psychiatrist does n't prescribe any the patient can view that outcome ( and physician ) negatively , as minimizing their problem and even as hinting that they 've wasted time .
With that level of expectancy , however , the placebo effect is doubtless ramped up even more , accounting for still - greater pharmaceutical effects , something that 's worth taking into consideration , not least because it adds a benefit or a wrinkle — depending on perspective — to the treatment options available .
I am suggesting that we pay a lot more attention to how those forms of persuasion influence medical and practice across the board .

Mr Souza turned himself over to local justice ministry officials and is being held in solitary confinement .
Authorities do not want to put him with other prisoners , some of whom could have been jailed thanks to his show .
That warm flood of outrage through the veins is addicting — but it also runs the danger of being addictive , and of being too easy .
As the news broke this week about the " Internet provisions " in the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , it did n't take long for the outrage to emerge .
For instance , the popular blog Boing Boing ( we love you , Cory ! ) announced that , under the proposed ACTA provisions being drafted by the US , " ISPs have to proactively police copyright on user - contributed material .
This means that it will be impossible to run a service like Flickr or YouTube or Blogger , since hiring enough lawyers to ensure that the mountain of material uploaded every second is n't infringing will exceed any hope of profitability . "
It also asserted that " ISPs have to cut off the Internet access of accused copyright infringers or face liability . "
The EFF said that " contrary to current US law and practice , the US text apparently conditions the safe harbors on Internet intermediaries adopting a Graduated Response or Three Strikes policy ISPs would be required to automatically terminate a customer upon a rightsholders ' repeat allegation of copyright infringement at a particular IP address . "
The leak
The statements are strong , but the document they are based on is not .
As the ACTA countries ( Australia , Canada , the EU , Japan , Korea , the US , etc. ) meet in South Korea this week to hash out the provisions of the treaty dealing with the Internet , multiple reports began to circulate based on " sources " and a leaked document from the EU .
Turns out , though , that all of these sources were actually the same one : the leaked EU document , which is now widely available for download ( PDF ) .
The US ACTA delegation is drafting the Internet provisions that were debated this week , but they briefed the Europeans on the draft 's progress when an EU delegation was in Washington back in September .
The Europeans then wrote up an account of that discussion , which became the leaked document .
So , what we 're left with is a written account of an oral report on a draft document that was itself still being altered .
In fact , we know it was still being altered at the time because lawyers for groups like CCIA and Public Knowledge were invited to see the draft , comment on it , and later see it again when some changes had been made .
The leaked EU document is short , only two pages of text , and most of the first page explains how the document came to be written .
The document describes the US draft text as having five sections , and the problems begin with section two : " ACTA members have to provide for third - party liability . "
In other words , ISPs can be held liable for copyright violations committed using their networks , in at least some circumstances .
Section three says that " safe harbor " limits on this liability will be available , but to benefit from them , ISPs have certain obligations .
" To benefit from safe harbors , " says the document , " ISPs need to put in place policies to deter unauthorized storage and transmission of IP infringing content ( ex : clauses in customers ' contracts allowing , inter alia , a graduated response ) . "
Taken together , sections two and three sound terrifying , conjuring up the nightmare world described above , in which every ISP is required to adopt " three strikes " provisions and will be liable for copyright violations on its network .
So , long , YouTube , Flickr , and every other user - generated content site on the Web !
This may be the eventual result of ACTA , but it 's not what the EU document says .
In fact , for US Internet users , the document sounds a whole lot like existing law — specifically , the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , rather than a big new power grab .
That 's not a coincidence ; the EU document actually says that the section on " safe harbors " for ISPs is " based on Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) , including a preamble about the balance between the interests of Internet service providers ( ISPs ) and rights - holders . "
The DMCA has big problems — most notably , no anticircumvention of DRM even for fair use purposes — but Section 512 actually made sites like Flickr and YouTube possible by shielding them from most lawsuits .
But what about the mandated " three strikes " policies ?
Again , that 's not what the document says .
It says that ISPs must " put in place policies to deter unauthorized storage and transmission of IP infringing content " and that three strikes rules are one option among many ( hence the " inter alia " quoted above ) .
This might sound scary , but it 's already in the DMCA and all US - based websites already adhere to its provisions .
As Section 512 makes clear , a safe harbor will only be granted to an ISP who has " adopted and reasonably implemented , and informs subscribers and account holders of the service provider 's system or network of , a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers and account holders of the service provider 's system or network who are repeat infringers . "
Yet that provision has not created any sort of three strikes regime among the major US ISPs .
The leaked EU document also points out that the US " will not propose that authorities need to create such systems .
Instead , they require some self - regulation by ISPs . "
That is , this wo n't create any new government mandate , but would leave in place the current system .
The DMCA goes globe - trotting
The ACTA Internet provisions can be better seen not as a call for secret new powers , but a " DMCA for the rest of the world . "
That 's why section four of the US draft brings the " anti-circumvention " principles to the table , though even here the EU notes that " ' fair use ' will not be circumscribed " and " there will be exceptions to these prohibitions available to ACTA members . "
And that 's it ; the document is remarkably brief , and appears to pose no novel issues to US residents worried that ACTA would come down hard on ISPs and end users .
Given that these notes are based on a draft of a draft , however , one that was certainly modified during this week 's ACTA meeting in Seoul , it 's unclear how this section will evolve ; we look forward to seeing a full draft of the relevant sections before passing judgment on it .
The real problem here is not for US residents , but for everyone else .
ACTA is clearly an attempt to bring DMCA ideas like " notice and takedown " to other countries that do n't currently use them .
For instance , some other countries currently use and prefer a " notice and notice " scheme in which an ISP is not required to takedown allegedly infringing material after receiving a simple notice , but only to forward that notice on to the relevant subscriber .
Extending the anticircumvention language to the rest of the world will also be novel ( in a bad way ) for other countries , which could follow the US path of allowing DRM to trump copyright law and fair use rights .
( Which is why it 's pleasing to see that the US negotiators are open to fair use and to country - by - country exceptions to such rules . )
When it comes to the Internet provisions , the US clearly intended to show up in Seoul with an outline for " Taking the DMCA on a world tour ! "
How did this idea fare when presented to the other countries ?
Hard to say , since the official account of the negotiations is the sort of obfuscatory say - nothingness people hate to hear from bureaucrats .
" The discussions at the meeting were productive and focused on enforcement of rights in the digital environment and criminal enforcement , " said the statement .
" Participants also discussed the importance of transparency including the availability of opportunities for stakeholders and the public in general to provide meaningful input into the negotiating process .
Participants in the meeting agreed that the next meeting would be hosted by Mexico in January 2010 .
Participants also reaffirmed their commitment to continue their work with the aim of concluding the agreement as soon as possible in 2010 . "
So ACTA 's not coming in the next few months , and the negotiators have suddenly discovered the need for " meaningful input " from the public .
Wonderful — but far too late after everything has been drafted , negotiated , and agreed - upon .
Also , we 've heard that song before .
ACTA is looking a good deal less scary than when it first appeared , but that 's no reason for the public to back off its attempts to see what 's being negotiated in its name .
Yes they do but it 's rare .
My dog is constantly looking up and I 've never seen anything like it .
He will look up and run after birds .
One time he even chased a kite that looked like a giant bird and ran until he was exactly under it and looked straight up in amazement , until I finally made him leave .
Anytime a big bird flies overhead he will bark and gallop after it but my female dog rarely realizes what he 's chasing because she does n't look up as high as he does .
Banks around the world have been battered in the past year , but most have not responded by turning over control of their businesses to their borrowers .
Yet this is what creditors at the International Monetary Fund moved closer to doing at the G - 20 meeting in Pittsburgh last month .
We understand why fund borrowers want more power , but why would creditor nations , especially Uncle Sam , cede it ?
The terms " debtor " and " creditor " may seem foreign to anyone who reads IMF press releases for the first time .
The fund prefers the terms " emerging and developing markets " to describe countries that traditionally borrow hard currency , and " advanced countries " to describe those that provide it .
But there 's no getting around the reality that only a fraction of the IMF 's 186 members are long - term creditors .
That became clear earlier this year when the G - 20 passed the hat to collect $ 500 billion for a lending facility known as " new arrangements to borrow . "
Major emerging countries led by Brazil quickly made clear they would only contribute if the fund issued short - term bonds that could be traded in the secondary market .
In other words , no long - term commitments from them .
Creditor countries have always enjoyed more voting power at the fund because without them there would be no reliable pool of money .
But several years ago borrower nations , led by members from Asia and Latin America , began clamoring for a greater voice in fund decisions .
They argued that since their economies have grown and now represent a larger share of total global GDP , a " democratic " IMF ought to give them a greater share of voting rights .
Creditors might have replied that the fund is not a democracy and that anyone who wants more votes can get them by ponying up more real money .
Instead , in 2008 the board approved a 5 % shift in voting rights from what it called " over - represented " creditors to " under - represented " countries .
Among the biggest beneficiaries of the 2008 change , once it is ratified , will be China , Korea , India , Brazil , Mexico , Spain , Singapore and Turkey .
The eight biggest losers will be the U.K. , France , Saudi Arabia , Canada , Russia , Netherlands , Belgium and Switzerland .
Janet Tavakoli is On The Edge With Max Keiser .
Tavakoli says the Risk of deflationary collapse greater now than in 2007 .
We ’ve just interviewed Janet Tavakoli for our first episode of The Keiser Report .
If you do n’t know her , you should .
She wrote a fantastic book , Dear Mr. Buffett .
Max and I are on our second read of it .
You really must get this book if you want to understand derivatives from one of the foremost experts on it who writes in plain English about how these financial tools became instruments for widespread fraud that then led to financial crisis .
She also gives loads of positive advice and insight .
Here is a summary she provided for MaxKeiser.com on where she thinks we are today two years since the crisis began :
" Regarding the outlook , my analysis is grim .
I am not a doomsayer , I follow the cash , and so far , I ’ve been correct , and the government has been wrong .
Here ’s the situation .
We are at greater risk of a total meltdown due to a deflationary collapse than we were in 2007 .
After the greatest Ponzi scheme in the history of the capital markets , we ’ve seen history ’s greatest fiscal and monetary expansion , but it has n’t worked .
Debt levels of consumers and business exceed the capacity to repay . "
Our fundamental financial and economic problems , i.e. overleveraging , lack of transparency , have not been solved .
Since 2008 , capacity utilization has plummeted ; businesses have no pricing power ; U.S. lost 6.7 million jobs but numbers are underreported ; personal income tax receipts are down 21 % ; corporate tax receipts are down 58 % ; U.S. deficit will exceed $ 1.8 trillion ; govt .
spending is now 185 % of tax receipts ; 13 % of mortgages are seriously delinquent and / or in foreclosure ; huge decrease in personal net worth ; 15 million mortgages exceed the home value .
We ’re on a massive debt spending spree .
Income on all levels is not sufficient to make debt payments .

Brett Steenbarger Book Review
" At its core , " Tavakoli observes , " the mortgage crisis is no more sophisticated than a schoolyard swindle , and the SEC is the principal . "
She effectively contrasts the imprudent use of leverage across investment banks , government sponsored enterprises , and hedge funds with the value investing philosophy of Warren Buffet , driving home the point that much of our recent economic activity has been destructive of wealth .
" Price is what you pay , " Buffett explained , " Value is what you get . "
Our recent financial system , Tavakoli asserts , has paid high prices for little value .
Her book is an excellent , readable overview and explanation of what 's gone wrong and also a warning about what may be to come .
She explains :
" As long as Wall Street enhances revenues with leverage to prop up kingly bonuses , as long as there are few personal consequences for CEOs ( and board members and other top executives ) for shoddy risk management , as long as CEOs are allowed to walk away with millions , nothing will change .
The fact that shareholders are wiped out is no deterrent , and moral hazard will live on ( p. 206 ) . "

Two people in dark clothes follow you for several blocks .
It 's after midnight .
You look back several times at them .
They say nothing , but they continue to follow .
What to do ?
Well , do n't even think about menacingly gripping that pocket knife you 're carrying to scare them off .
They could be undercover cops conducting a training exercise .
A Kensington man was found guilty of criminal threatening for holding an open pocket knife at his side while asking two people who were walking behind him at midnight , " Why are you following me ? "
The pair walking behind Dustin Almon , 28 , of 27 Wild Rose Lane , were state Liquor Enforcement cops , both in plain clothes without any indicators that they were members of law enforcement , according to testimony during a Thursday Portsmouth District Court trial .
Both were also carrying concealed handguns and Tasers , they testified .
One of them , Officer Anthony Cattabriga , said he was walking behind Almon on Chapel Street on Nov. 8 , 2008 , when Almon turned around three times to look at him and a new officer he was training .
It was dark and Almon was twenty feet away when he displayed a knife with a two - inch blade the third time he turned around , said Cattabriga .
" He pointed it down by his side , " the liquor officer testified , while demonstrating with Almon 's seized pocket knife .
When he responded by yelling " police , " Almon folded the knife , clipped it to his belt and complied with all subsequent police orders , Cattabriga testified .
Almon was initially arrested on a charge of disorderly conduct , but the charge was later upgraded to criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon .
" I feared for my safety , " Cattabriga said from a District Court witness stand .
Police have launched a five - year plan to reduce violence against women and children in Victoria .
Today is White Ribbon Day , which aims to tackle domestic violence .
About 250 police , AFL figures and community leaders have attended a breakfast at the Victoria Police Academy , with some taking a pledge to become White Ribbon Day ambassadors .
Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Simon Overland used the breakfast to reiterate his commitment to fighting domestic violence .
The new police plan includes measures to help victims of violence come forward , and more support and counselling for perpetrators of violence .
Mr Overland says police want to improve their response to sex attacks and child abuse , and work better with indigenous communities .
He says domestic violence is a huge burden on the community , with about half of all women affected by violence at some stage in their lives .
" It 's an entrenched problem , it 's an enduring problem , " he said .
" We need to continue to focus on it and do everything that we can to eliminate violence against women and children , and the policy or the strategy that we 've launched today is the new framework that will help Victoria Police achieve that . "
The chief executive of the AFL , Andrew Demetriou , told the breakfast the AFL is committed to setting a positive example and taking a lead role in stopping violence against women .
" The recent news of rape charges brought against members of the Montmorency Football Club shocked all of us in the football community , " he said .
" As the chief executive officer of the AFL , I want to assure you that we are acutely aware of our leadership position in the community and of our obligation to tackle this important issue . "
Events to mark White Ribbon Day are being held across Victoria today .
Thomas Jones and Rob Gibson are acutely aware that they are setting themselves up for a barrage of " nature versus nurture " jokes whenever they tell people their son is a budding ballet prodigy .
So be it , though .
Their adopted offspring , James Gibson - Jones , appears destined for some species of ballet greatness , having been snapped up by the National Ballet of Canada this fall after just two years of lessons .
He began dabbling in dance at the urging of teachers and family friends in Bowmanville , who sensed an affinity for rhythm and performance in the charismatic 11 - year - old with the " classic Billy Elliot build . "
Gibson , for one , knows it 's going to raise eyebrows , bringing up the ( pink ) elephant in the room – actually a typical suburban backyard fraught with excitable golden retrievers – unprompted and in good humour .
" That was the first thing that I thought of , " he chuckles .
" Here are the two gay men and their son , the dancer .
There are those stereotypes : ` We 're recruiting . '
` Only gay men dance . '
Things like that .
I just find that incredibly funny .
We did n't even push him in dance .
We were thinking gymnastics because he was so flexible . "
" Nobody 's actually brought it up , " shrugs Jones .
" But if it happens , it happens .
So be it . "
Back to that in a minute .
First , though , let it be said that it is true young James probably would not have joined the National Ballet School this year if Jones and Gibson had n't adopted him seven years ago .
He and his biological half - brother Brandon ( now 13 ) were just 3 and 5 when they first met their fathers - to - be in 2002 .
Removed from a home plagued by abuse , addictions and mental - health issues when James was scarcely 18 months old , the two were living with their second set of foster parents when Gibson and Jones came their way .
At the time , Ontario law was only just warming to the idea of gay couples adopting and the Star followed the two would - be dads through the gruelling , nearly year - long process of interviews and uncertainties that eventually brought James and Brandon into their home .
" The acceptance of two women or two guys adopting was so out of the norm , " recalls Jones , who bounced among foster homes himself during a rough childhood .
" How could the children be parented successfully without a traditional family ?
In recent years , this notion has changed and the community is receptive .
When we moved from Brampton to Oshawa ( and then to Bowmanville ) we were initially on guard about how things would play out , but we were pleasantly pleased with how receptive the schools were , as were our neighbours . "
Gibson 's and Jones 's success as parents is evident in a host of ways , not least of which is James 's departure to the National Ballet School a mere seven years after being plucked out of dire circumstances .
Still , perhaps more painful than the irony of giving up James to nearly year - round boarding school after such a short time in their care is the knowledge that opponents of same - sex adoption might be tempted to use their son's gifts against them .
Gay parenting stereotypes and animosity do persist .
The state of Florida , for instance , is appealing a 2008 decision that overturned its ban on same - sex adoption .
However , beyond the plainly obvious fact that not all male ballet dancers are gay , the family has science on their side to silence potential critics .
" If you look at outcomes , kids who are raised by gay or lesbian parents are no more likely to be gay or lesbian themselves , " says Meg Gibson , a social worker and PhD student at the University of Toronto with a background in the history of medicine 's treatment of homosexuality , citing research supported by the American Psychological Association .
" There is also some evidence that they may be less strict in their interpretation of sexuality and gender than kids from strictly heterosexual backgrounds , " adds Gibson , herself a lesbian parent .
" So that might mean that a kid has a chance to explore a talent that may , in another context , have been squashed ...
If you have a family – whether that family is gay , heterosexual or a mix of the two – that says follow your own interests , follow your own talents regardless of what everybody says you should be doing , that 's phenomenal .
And that may be more likely in a family where people have already had to deal with those stereotypes and question them and challenge them . "
This month , the American Library Association named the children 's book And Tango Makes
Three – based on the true story of two male penguins in the Central Park Zoo who bonded as mates , attempted to hatch a rock and were eventually given a transplanted egg of their own that resulted in a chick – the " most banned " title of the year .
And this nearly five years after its first publication , in 2005 .
The book 's authors , Justin Richardson and Peter Parnell , became parents themselves 7 1/2 months ago , when their daughter , Gemma , was born to a surrogate mother .
The generally positive response to And Tango Makes
Three , which has racked up a number of awards and continues to fly off shelves ( especially since its widespread banning was publicized ) , has them hopeful that non-traditional parenting arrangements will eventually cease to raise eyebrows .
Much of the good feedback comes from children who say the book gives voice to a family " that was n't being written about but with which they were already familiar because they went to school with kids who had two moms or two dads , " says Parnell .
Parnell and Richardson live in New York City , where unconventional families are common .
Elsewhere , it can be a different story .
" What we 'll hear about are families who are more actively persecuted in other areas of the country – a two - mom family that is being made to feel like true outsiders and whose child is being made to feel like an outsider and that is therefore grateful to the book and wants the book to serve as an example and , as we were talking about , be a help . "
James Gibson - Jones has already learned to brush aside the schoolyard taunts that inevitably await any boy who heeds the call of the slippers .
He went to elementary school wearing a brooch in the shape of a ballerina , despite the teasing it invited .
So , fending off protests of those who might believe that a child brought up with two fathers has been " sissified " into Swan Lake should be a cakewalk .
He 's smart enough , anyway , to point out that ballet requires incredible athletic discipline and that his classes are swarming with girls .

" He has a bit of the diva in him , which gives him the edge he needs , " says Gibson .
That he does .
James was , as Jones recalls , the kid who'd be " up on the desk , singing , the moment the teacher left the room " and a rambunctious handful from time to time until he discovered dance .
" I have a lot of energy and I like to prance around , " says James .
He 's also determined .
Already smitten with dance after a year in classes , he was watching The Nutcracker with " Pop and Dad " last December when he decided , as he recalls : " That 's it .
That 's what I want to do . "
Jones and Gibson were stunned when , mere weeks later , he was the fourth child out of more than a thousand tryouts for the National Ballet called back for a longer weeding - out process in July .
And stunned again when he got another callback at the end of that month .
Such a brisk trajectory is n't unheard of in National Ballet circles , although it 's definitely uncommon .
James 's story touched enough Bowmanville residents familiar with his talents and his past that they were ready to mobilize a fundraiser to help cover the $ 26,000 in tuition fees .
The two dads said thanks , but no thanks , even though it meant going into debt .
James excitedly dashed off to residence at the National Ballet School in September while his parents temporarily suppressed nightmares of looming insolvency and early - onset " empty - nest syndrome " to concentrate on the smile lighting up their son 's face .
He 's only come home for two weekends since .
And then , just Friday , came the best news yet : James already has a role in this year 's National Ballet Christmas production of The Nutcracker .
Pop and Dad are floored .
" I just think it 's great that he set his sights on wanting to be part of the National Ballet last December and here we are , 10 months later , and he has a part in The Nutcracker , " marvels Jones .
" I wish I had some of that conviction . "
James , meanwhile , looks forward to further chasing his own dreams – being a ballet teacher or the founder of his own dance company .
" It makes me feel known , " he says .
" It 's my moment , onstage . "

The number of Down 's syndrome pregnancies has risen by more than 70 % over the last 20 years , University of London researchers say .
The sharp rise reflects the growing number of older women becoming pregnant , when there is a higher risk .
An increase in the number of subsequent abortions and more antenatal diagnoses means slightly fewer children are being born with Down 's syndrome .
Campaigners say better education about the condition will reduce abortions .
The number of Down 's syndrome pregnancies rose from 1,075 diagnoses in 1990 to 1,843 by 2008 in England and Wales .
Despite the higher number of Down 's pregnancies , the number of babies with Down 's syndrome has fallen by 1 % , from 752 to 743 .
This is because improved antenatal screening means more Down 's pregnancies are being spotted and more abortions are taking place .
Without the improved screening , the number of babies born with Down 's would have risen by 48 % , according to the study .
Down 's syndrome A genetic disorder named after the British physician John Langdon Down , who identified it in 1866 .
Inhibits the ability to learn and develop mentally .
About 60,000 people have Down 's syndrome in the UK .
Parents ' experiences
My Down 's dilemma
The proportion of couples diagnosed with a baby with Down 's syndrome who decided to terminate has remained constant at 92 % , say researchers at Queen Mary .
Older mothers
The risk of having a baby with Down 's syndrome is one in 940 for a woman aged 30 .
But by age 40 , the risk rises to one in 85 .
Joan Morris , professor of medical statistics at Queen Mary , led the research and she said : " What we 're seeing here is a steep rise in pregnancies with Down 's syndrome but that is being offset by improvements in screening .
" It was thought that these improvements would lead to a decrease in the number of births with Down 's syndrome .
However , due to increases in maternal age this has not occurred . "
Professor Morris said the Down 's screening test had become more widely available over the last 20 years .
The report was published in the British Medical Journal .
Doctors told Natasha and Eddie Batha that there was a one - in - 170 chance that their daughter Mia , who is now three , would be born with the condition .
Mr Batha told BBC
Breakfast that their shock of learning that Mia did have Down 's syndrome soon gave way to the realisation that the condition was not as bad as they feared .
' Another human being '
He said : " You 're led to believe that it 's the worst thing that could possibly ever happen to you .
" And then you realise it 's just another human being who happens to be a little bit different .
" She just takes a bit more effort and she is a bit slower to pick up on things . "
His wife agreed that many people were misinformed about Down 's syndrome and she thinks this has contributed to the high abortion rate .
She said : " Because you have a test [ during pregnancy ] you think that it must be a terrible thing if it happened .
" There 's no qualifying information and I think that would be really useful to get that and it might affect a lot of people 's decision as to whether they could live with that . "
Carol Boys from the Down 's Syndrome Association said the number of abortions would be reduced if parents were better informed about Down 's syndrome .
She said : " We realise that tests will continue to become more accurate at increasingly earlier stages of pregnancy .
" It is therefore even more important that families undergoing the screening process are given non-directive counselling and accurate , up - to - date information about Downs ' syndrome . "

Global Warming in SuperFreakonomics : The Anatomy of a Smear
1 . Let the wild rumpus start .
Yes , it ’s an ancient cliché : a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes .
But it ’s still accurate .
The final chapter in our forthcoming book , SuperFreakonomics , is about global warming : the risks , uncertainties , misperceptions , and proposed solutions .
It has already come in for steep criticism by , among others , a prominent environmental blogger and a well - known environmental advocacy group .
Their criticism has radiated into the blogosphere , producing many further stories with headlines like “ SuperFreakonomics Gets Climate Change Super Freaking Wrong . ”
They have given the impression that we are global - warming deniers of the worst sort , and that our analysis of the issue is ideological and unscientific .
Most gravely , we stand accused of misrepresenting the views of one of the most respected climate scientists on the scene , whom we interviewed extensively .
If everything they said was actually true , it would indeed be a damning indictment .
But it ’s not .
2 . What we actually say in the book .
Our global - warming chapter has several sections .
We discuss how it ’s a very hard problem to solve since pollution is an externality – that is , the people who generate pollution generally do n’t pay the cost of their actions and therefore do n’t have strong incentives to pollute less .
We discuss how even the most sophisticated climate models are limited in their ability to predict the future , and we discuss the large measure of uncertainty in this realm , given that global climate is such a complex and dynamic system .
We discuss some of the commonly held misperceptions about climate and energy , including the fact that the historic relationship between global temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide is more complicated than is generally thought .
The real purpose of the chapter is figuring out how to cool the Earth if indeed it becomes catastrophically warmer .
( That is the “ global cooling ” in our subtitle .
If someone interprets our brief mention of the global - cooling scare of the 1970 ’s as an assertion of “ a scientific consensus that the planet was cooling , ” that feels like a willful misreading . )
To think we are “ deniers , ” would obviate the chapter ’s central point : if we were n’t convinced that global warming was worth worrying about , we would n’t have written a chapter about proposed solutions .
The core of the chapter concerns Intellectual Ventures , a Seattle - based invention and patent company headed up by Nathan Myhrvold .
While I.V. employs several climate scientists , it generally operates outside the climate - change establishment .
We present I.V. ’s views on climate change in general , the limitations and costs of carbon mitigation , questions about the scalability of alternative energy sources , and the company ’s proposed global - warming solutions .
The most controversial of these solutions – a “ stratoshield ” — involves the controlled injection of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to cool ground temperatures , which mimics the natural cooling effects of a big volcanic eruption like Mount Pinatubo .
This sort of “ geoengineering ” solution is intensely disliked within environmental circles , and we discuss the reasons why .
And we discuss why , if global warming gets worse , it might still be a good idea to consider further research on the stratoshield .
We also discuss a much more environmentally friendly anti-warming solution from I.V. that uses salt - sea spray to increase cloud reflectivity .
3 . Where this material came from
We visited Intellectual Ventures in early 2008 for a daylong discussion with roughly a dozen of its scientists and inventors .
Among them were Myhrvold and Ken Caldeira , who , as we write , “ is among the most respected climate scientists in the world , his research cited approvingly by the most fervent environmentalists . ”
Caldeira is featured throughout the chapter .
Here is how we characterize his view of global warming and carbon emissions :
“ Caldeira is thoroughly convinced that human activity is responsible for some global warming and is more pessimistic than Myhrvold about how future climate will affect humankind .
He believes ‘ we are being incredibly foolish emitting carbon dioxide ’ as we currently do . ”
We also explain how some of Caldeira ’s research and views complicate the common views on atmospheric carbon dioxide .
These include :
As greenhouse gases go , carbon dioxide is n’t particularly efficient , and furthermore is governed by the law of diminishing returns .
The level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is n’t as meaningful a yardstick as is commonly perceived .
“ There ’s nothing special about today ’s carbon - dioxide level , ” Caldeira says , “ or today ’s sea level , or today ’s temperature .
What damages us are rapid rates of change .
Overall , more carbon dioxide is probably a good thing for the biosphere – it ’s just that it ’s increasing too fast . ”
Also , we write : “ As much as Caldeira personally lives the green life – his Stanford office is cooled by a misting water chamber rather than air - conditioning — his research has found that planting trees in certain locations actually exacerbates warming because comparatively dark leaves absorb more incoming sunlight than , say , grassy plains , sandy deserts , or snow - covered expanses . ”
We describe how when Caldeira first heard about the stratoshield from Lowell Wood , another I.V. scientist , he “ disliked the concept ” but nevertheless “ ran a climate model to test Wood ’s claims . ”
Furthermore : “ his model backed up Wood ’s claims that geoengineering could stabilize the climate even in the face of a large spike in atmospheric carbon dioxide , and he wrote a paper saying so .
Caldeira , the most reluctant geoengineer imaginable , became a convert — willing , at least , to explore the idea . ”
That is why Caldeira was in the room with his I.V. colleagues that day – talking to us , exploring the idea – and that is one reason that we gave as much credence to I.V. ’s climate and geoengineering proposals as we did : because Ken Caldeira is not a climate - change - denying know - nothing , but quite the opposite .
Because even though Caldeira would like to see us become a zero- carbon society , he seemed to agree with Nathan Myhrvold ’s assessment that if global warming is as real a problem as they think it may be , then an overreliance on carbon mitigation may be “ too little , too late , and too optimistic . ”
How could a devoted environmentalist who wants a zero- carbon society believe this ?
Because , as we wrote ( with input from Caldeira ) , “ the half - life of atmospheric carbon dioxide is roughly one hundred years , and some of it remains in the atmosphere for thousands of years .
So even if humankind immediately stopped burning all fossil fuel , the existing carbon dioxide would remain in the atmosphere for several generations . ”
After the day we spent at I.V. , our further research included hundreds of follow - up inquiries with a number of its scientists , including Caldeira , via phone , e-mail , and face - to - face interviews .
The supporting scientific literature is cited in the endnotes of the finished book , on pages 250 - 255 .
4 . So what happened next ?
As part of our fact - checking procedure , we asked Myhrvold , Caldeira , Wood , and others to review the first draft of our chapter and give us any and all feedback and corrections .
We incorporated many of their suggestions into our next draft .
For instance , following a sentence we had written saying that “ [ Caldeira ’s ] research tells him that carbon dioxide is not the right villain in this fight , ” Caldeira had added the following qualification :
“ My views differ significantly from Lowell ’s and Nathan’s .
I do think we are being incredibly foolish emitting CO2 and that avoiding all of this environmental risk is a good way to invest a few percent of our GDP .
My pessimism stems from the apparent difficulties of solving the ‘ prisoner ’s dilemma , ’ ‘ tragedy of the commons ’ type aspects of this problem . ”
As noted above , we incorporated this sentiment into the text .
We also sent an amended draft to I.V. for further feedback , and incorporated a further round of small changes .
So given this back and forth , it was pretty strange when , last week , a blog post on ClimateProgress.org appeared with this headline :
“ Error-riddled ‘ SuperFreakonomics ’ :
New book pushes global cooling myths , sheer illogic , and ‘ patent nonsense ’ – and the primary climatologist it relies on , Ken Caldeira , says ‘ it is an inaccurate portrayal of me ’ and ‘ misleading ’ in ‘ many ’ places . ”
The post ’s author is Joseph Romm , the editor of ClimateProgress.org , which is “ dedicated to providing the progressive perspective on climate science , climate solutions , and climate politics . ”
It is not surprising that someone in Romm ’s position might disagree with much of what we wrote about global warming .
In this first post – he has since written several more – he had some particularly dismissive things to say about Nathan Myhrvold ’s dismissal of solar power as unscalable .
( More on that soon , in a following post . )
But more broadly , he made it sound as if we had distorted Ken Caldeira ’s views in the worst way : “ He [ Caldeira ] has responded to many e-mail queries of mine over the weekend , ” Romm wrote .
“ He simply does n’t believe what the Superfreaks make it seem like he believes . ”
This was the blog post that launched a thousand more .
The headlines varied a bit but the general thrust , perhaps inspired by Romm ’s exciting headline , was always the same : two guys who are n’t climate scientists wrote a book with a chapter about climate science and one of the main climate scientists in this chapter is saying they badly misrepresented his views .
Yikes .
If that were true , I would come after us with pitchforks too .
5 . So what really happened ?
Last week , a few days before Romm ’s post , Caldeira sent an e-mail to Myhrvold and cc’d me as well .
It included a chain of earlier e-mails between Caldeira and Romm .
The chain begins with Joseph Romm telling Caldeira that he had read SuperFreakonomics and “ I want to trash them for this insanity and ignorance . ”
Romm adds that “ my blog is read by everyone in this area , including the media ” and tells Caldeira that “ I ’d like a quote like ‘ The authors of SuperFreakonomics have utterly misrepresented my work , ’ plus whatever else you want to say . ”
I understand that blogging , especially advocacy blogging , does n’t operate under the rules of journalism ( where you do n’t feed quotes to people ) , but still : that ’s quite a quote to feed to someone .
Caldeira did n’t give him the quote .
He did , however , respond point - by - point to a series of statements about him in the book .
“ The only significant error , ” he wrote to Romm , “ is the line : ‘ carbon dioxide is not the right villain in this fight . ’
That is just wrong and I never would have said it .
On the other hand , I f&@?ed up .
They sent me the draft and I approved it without reading it carefully and I just missed it .
I think everyone operated in good faith , and this was just a mistake that got by my inadequate editing . ”
Romm still managed to get his point across , in the headline and elsewhere :
“ One sentence about Caldeira in particular is the exact opposite of what he believes ( page 184 ) : ‘ Yet his research tells him that carbon dioxide is not the right villain in this fight . ’
Levitt and Dubner did n’t run this quote by Caldeira , and when he saw a version from Myhrvold , he objected to it . ”
Except of course Caldeira did see that line , and the rest of the chapter too , not once but twice .
But that did n’t seem to matter .
While Romm ’s post never actually delivered the Caldeira quotes teased in the headline – that it was “ an inaccurate portrayal of me ” and “ misleading ” – the point was clear to any reader : everything SuperFreakonomics says about global warming must be wrong because the main climate scientist they write about has refuted what he said .
It ’s hard to blame the bloggers who subsequently repeated this story : if you did n’t know it was false , it would have seemed pretty newsworthy .
It ’s also hard to misinterpret what ’s going on here .
Now that global warming has transcended science to become a political issue , the rules of politics apply : if you do n’t like someone ’s position , attack their credibility .
I understand why Caldeira now feels that the “ villain ” line overstates his position .
I certainly wish we had discussed amending it earlier , and it ’s probably a good idea to change that line in future editions of the book .
That said , why did Romm think that Levitt and I had distorted his views throughout ?
I wrote to Caldeira to ask him this , and he replied : “ I do think there are a bunch of things in the chapter that give misimpressions . ”
In a later e-mail , he explained further :
“ I was drawn in by Romm and Al Gore ’s assistant into critiquing other parts of the chapter .
Rather than acting deliberately , I panicked and commented on things that I now wish I would have been silent on .
It was obviously a mistake to let myself get drawn into this , and I learned a quick and hard lesson in public relations . ”
Caldeira then sent along another , more recent e-mail he ’d written to a British journalist who asked for comment on his portrayal in SuperFreakonomics .
“ I believe all of the ideas attributed to me are based on fact , with the exception of the ‘ carbon dioxide is not the right villain ’ line , ” he wrote .
“ That said , when I am speaking , I place these facts in a very different context and draw different policy conclusions . ”
He added that “ I believe the authors to have worked in good faith .
They draw different conclusions than I draw from the same facts , but as authors of the book , that is their prerogative . ”
6 . There is much more to be said .
Levitt and I – and Nathan Myhrvold , and maybe even Ken Caldeira – look forward to debating the content of the chapter itself , the actual ideas and conclusions .
Will a lot of people argue with them ?
Absolutely .
Some critics claim that we are too pessimistic about carbon mitigation , that we understate the probability of catastrophic climate change , that we are wrong to write that “ the movement to stop global warming has taken on the feel of a religion . ”
Fair enough : we will debate those issues .
But it would be good if the debate were inspired by the content of our chapter rather than a partisan attack built around a faulty central premise : that we twisted a leading climate scientist ’s words to suit our own purposes .
After all , if the idea is to actually fight global warming , does n’t it make sense to think about solutions beyond carbon mitigation ?
Much of the outcry was made by people who had read Romm but not our book — which is n’t surprising , since the book is n’t out until October 20 .
As the noise grew , Romm added on the charge that
“ the publisher has stopped Amazon from allowing people to search the book ” – that is , to read the actual text online .
Smells like a conspiracy theory , no ?
But nobody stopped anything .
The text was never searchable on Amazon for the simple reason that the book was n’t yet published , which is standard procedure .
I do n’t know where Romm got this fact – or if perhaps it was just too good a rumor to not be true .
It ’s an easy bet that Romm and others like him will keep it up .
That ’s their job .
We should probably sleep with our shoes on for a while .
[ ADDENDUM ( Oct. 21 , 2009 ) :
It turns out I was wrong when , two paragraphs above , I wrote above that “ the text was never searchable on Amazon . ”
I had asked our publisher if the book had been searchable prior to publication and was told the answer was no .
But a few days after I wrote this post , the publisher informed me that I ’d been given wrong information .
Here ’s a statement from them :
“ Stephen Dubner asked us if his book SuperFreakonomics had been posted on Amazon Search Inside the Book , and we told him it had n’t been , ” said a HarperCollins spokesperson .
“ But the search function was accidentally enabled for a brief time last week .
As soon as we saw this , it was disabled because it is generally our policy not to allow search until after the book goes on sale . ”
I apologize for this error , and especially to Romm for the accusation .
( To our friends at Harper who fed me the wrong information — I know who you are and , believe you me , I ’ll be stuffing your Christmas stocking with some lumps of coal non-carbon heating fuel . )
Now that the book has been published , the Amazon page is searchable .
If you 've got a jailbroken iPhone , listen up : a worm is reported to have broken out in Australia that targets owners who have not changed the default password after installing SSH .
The worm 's behavior is somewhat amusing : it changes your background to a photo of Rick Astley , then looks for other phones on the network to infect .
That said , the exploit could easily be used by hackers with malicious intent for more nefarious purposes .
If you have a jailbroken iPhone and you 've installed SSH without changing the default password ( from " alpine " ) you need to do so to avoid such attacks .
If you have not jailbroken your iPhone or iPod Touch and installed SSH , you are not affected .
Sophos writes of the exploit :
SophosLabs is analysing the worm 's code , which suggests that at least four variants have been written so far .
One of the attributes of the latest variant ( labelled the " D " version ) is that it tries to hide its presence by using a filepath suggestive of the Cydia application .
The source code is littered with comments from the author suggesting the worm has been written as an experiment .
One of the comments berates affected users for not following instructions when installing SSH , because if they had changed the default password the worm would not have been able to infect them .
You have been warned !
From a wikipedia article on hard hats :
In his last book , Managing in the Next Society , management professor Peter Drucker credits Franz Kafka , the writer , for developing the first civilian hard hat , to be used in steel mills , when Kafka was employed at the Worker ’s Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia ( 1912 ) .
Whether or not Kafka actually invented the hard hat is open to debate , but he apparently was the first bureaucrat and insurer to demand its use by civilians .
When it comes to reforming marijuana laws , one of our greatest remaining obstacles is the fact that many people just can’t picture what a sensible marijuana policy would look like .
The reformer 's utopian view of a regulated marijuana economy operates in stark contrast to the pungent smoldering apocalypse that exists in the nightmares of our opposition .
It 's like we 're not even speaking the same language .
So I 'd like to share a vision of what is possible when cannabis is provided by responsible people :
It 's a triumphant statement that cannabis , like other valued commodities , can be handled with accountability to the consumer and the public .
So much of the ugliness that clouds this issue ( drug gangs , violence , environmental harm ) is just a symptom of our failure to let the best people supervise it .
Through regulation , we encourage responsible business practices and create an environment in which providers will constantly strive to maintain a healthy relationship with their community .
The time has come for opponents of legalization to stop obstructing reform and start actively participating in it .
Once it 's understood that marijuana laws are changing , we must all begin working together to develop a system that addresses as many different concerns as possible .
Instead of trying to block any form of legalization , skeptics should be thinking about what distribution model they'd be most comfortable with .
The excellent example depicted above can be replicated elsewhere , but only if everyone works together instead of fighting it out to the bitter end .
This is what real drug control looks like and there 's nothing here for anyone to be afraid of .

At a video arcade in the center of Venezuela ’s capital , the sound of tapping buttons and the rattle of virtual gunfire fills the room as young boys battle mercenaries and zombies on games such as " Target : Terror Gold " and " House of the Dead 2 . "
But in a few months this busy arcade will likely stand silent and empty , thanks to a new law here that would ban the sale and playing of violent video games and toys .
The law is an attempt to tackle the epidemic levels of violence that plague this South American country .
Homicides have reached record levels in recent years .
Caracas — with 2,710 murders , or 130 per 100,000 citizens in 2007 — has one of the highest homicide rates in the world .
The law was based on several studies in the United States and Japan that conclude violent video games increase aggressive tendencies in children , said National Assembly lawmaker Wilmer Iglesias of Fatherland For All , a party allied with President Hugo Chavez .
( The assembly has approved the law but it may be altered before being signed by the president . )
But many dispute the link between the games and actual violence , saying the law will do little to address the real roots of crime .
And they say the law goes too far in banning even adults from playing .
In addition , critics point to some discrepancies in the law : a potential three - to five - year prison sentence for selling or distributing violent video games is a harsher punishment than the sentence for selling real guns to children , which currently stands at one to five years .
Venezueala's game development industry is small so most of the games are imported from abroad .
Popular online games here include " Counter - Strike " and " World of Warcraft , " a multiplayer role - playing game set in the fictional world of Azeroth , where avatars kill monsters and complete quests .
For consoles there is " The Legend of Zelda " and " Super Smash Bros , " where players choose from various Nintendo characters such as Mario and Pokemon and try to knock out their opponent .
In addition to video games , toys that include any kind of weapon or that imitate the armed force or state security apparatus would be banned .
Toys that do n't promote a situation of war , but still " establish a type of game that stimulates aggression and violence " would also fall under the ban .
“ We ’re not saying that this law pretends to solve the problem of violence but we believe that there are great problems and their solution is complex , cultural and multifaceted , and if that is true we need to attack it from all points of view that can influence it , ” Iglesias said .
But other studies say that there is no evidence of a connection between adolescent violence and video games .
Cheryl K. Olson , co-author of " Grand Theft Childhood : The Surprising Truth About Violent Video Games and What Parents Can Do , " said that in her study of the influences on " school shooters " in the United States , the only commonality was male gender and a tendency toward depression .
“ The more closely you look at the problem , the more it crumbles , ” she said .
A lot of politicians may be sincere , she said , but concentrating on violent video games “ takes attention away from things we know can really make a difference . ”
Violent video games can even be beneficial because they can have a cathartic influence by allowing children to release aggression in a safe environment , she added .
Venezuelan lawmakers were aggrieved by a 2006 video game developed by Los Angeles - based game developer Pandemic Studios .
“ Mercenaries 2 : World in Flames ” featured a plot in which “ a power hungry tyrant uses Venezuela ’s oil supply to overthrow the government and turns the country into a war - zone . ”
Venezuelan authorities said the game was a barbed reference to the controversial Chavez and that it was a coded plot to stir up support for an invasion of Venezuela .
Game developers in Venezuela say they agree that children should be protected from some violent video games but that the law is excessive in banning even adults from playing .
Ciro Duran , coordinator of the National Industry of Video Games , Entertainment and Digital Arts , said the wording of the law would open interpretation for banning even apparently innocent video games .
“ As video game developers , we are basically going to have to go to the government and ask them ‘ what is a violent video game ? ’ ” he said .
“ We ’re talking about a much more profound problem here .
The kids who turn violent from playing violent games are kids who are already violent .
There is a very real problem which is , ' What is the true cause of child violence ? ' ”
Venezuela does not have a classification system like the one in the U.S. that ranks video games from " E " for everyone to " A " for adults only .
Iglesias said they considered that route but decided an outright ban was more appropriate because of Venezuela ’s extensive network of pirate vendors .
“ I ’d like to see someone protest about their right to kill virtually , ” he said .
“ We hope this law will provoke an awareness and debate in society on the subject of violence . ”
At the video arcade in Sabana Grande , the principal shopping street in Caracas , the manager , who requested not to be named for fear of reprisal by the government , said the premises would close down by February , leaving its five employees jobless .
He complained that the government was doing little to control real violence outside the arcade when police officers abandon the area to criminals after eight in the evening and over weekends .
Criminals broke into the arcade and stole televisions and a cash register a month ago , he said .
Video game player Eduard Reina , 19 , thought video games did not make him aggressive .
“ If they close down places like this one , I ’ll play video games at home on my X - Box , ” he said , while shooting at computer - generated mercenaries with a virtual gun .
In 1992 , seminal nanotechnology pioneer Dr. K. Eric Drexler introduced the term " molecular manufacturing , " which he defined as the " chemical synthesis of complex structures by mechanically positioning reactive molecules , not by manipulating individual atoms . ”
( See the h+ article “ How Close Are We to Real Nanotechnology ? ” in Resources )
Drexler described nanofactories in which nanomachines ( resembling molecular assemblers , or industrial robot arms ) combine molecules to build larger atomically precise parts .
These parts , in turn , can be assembled by positioning mechanisms of assorted sizes to build macroscopic ( visible ) but still atomically - precise products .
The concept is that a functioning nanofactory will create virtually any product at the cost of only the input raw material and energy .
Here ’s an animated video that illustrates potential nanofactory operations :
“ Nanomanufacturing ” refers to the production of structures " bottom up " from nanoparticles ( materials at the nanoscale of 10 - 9 meters ) or " top down " in steps for high levels of precision .
Unlike molecular manufacturing , it does n’t necessarily require chemical synthesis .
Nanoparticles provide numerous possibilities for applications in nanotechnology due to their amazing properties .
However , realizing their potential versatility requires assembly of nanoparticles in regular patterns on surfaces and at interfaces .
Assembling nanoparticles generates new nanostructures , which in turn have unforeseen collective , intrinsic physical properties .
These properties can be exploited for multipurpose applications in nanoelectronics , spintronics , sensors , and so forth .
Recently , a team led by Dr. Ting Xu at the U.S. Department of Energy ’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory made an important advance towards this nanotechnology goal .
They found a simple and yet powerful way to induce nanoparticles to assemble themselves into complex arrays .
By adding specific types of small molecules to mixtures of nanoparticles and polymers , Dr. Xu’s group directed the self - assembly of the nanoparticles into arrays of one , two and three dimensions with no chemical modification of either the nanoparticles or the block copolymers .
In addition , they found that the application of external stimuli – light and / or heat – can be used to further direct the assemblies of nanoparticles for even finer and more complex structural details .
This video produced by Northern California ’s KQED describes some of the ongoing nanotechnology research at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory :
Small as they are , nanoparticles are essentially all surface .
According to the Berkeley Lab News Release on Dr. Xu’s research , any process that modifies the surface of a nanoparticle can profoundly change the properties of that particle .
Precisely arranging these nanoparticles is critical to tailoring the macroscopic properties during nanoparticle assembly .
While chemical DNA can be used to induce self - assembly of nanoparticles with a high degree of precision , it only works well for organized arrays that are limited in size – it is impractical for large - scale fabrication .
Dr. Xu ’s approach is to use block copolymers – long sequences or blocks of one type of monomer molecule bound to blocks of another type of monomer molecule .
Like soldiers lining up in formation , the block copolymers assemble at densities of 10 trillion bits per square inch .
Dr. Xu ’s technique promises to revolutionize the data storage industry , eventually leading to the contents of hundreds of DVDs — or its equivalent — fitting into a space the size of a thumbnail .
By adding specific types of small molecules to mixtures of nanoparticles and polymers , Dr. Xu’s group directed the self - assembly of the nanoparticles
Dr. Xu , an assistant professor of materials science and engineering and of chemistry at UC Berkeley , is being honored as one of the " Brilliant 10 " young researchers in the November 2009 issue of Popular Science .
Her group is now working on applying the nanoparticle self - assembly technique to paper - thin , printable solar cells , and ultra -small electronic devices .
" We ’ve advanced the technique to make the nanocomposites responsive to light , which could enable the development of photovoltaic cells that are more energy efficient , " says Xu .
The nanofactories of tomorrow will likely require both molecular manufacturing as envisioned by Dr. Drexler using chemical synthesis and nanomanufacturing techniques like Dr. Xu’s .
Nanoparticles can now be induced to self - assemble non-chemically using block copolymers in regular patterns on surfaces and at interfaces to provide better data storage , solar cells , and tiny electronics .
Silvio Berlusconi has called himself the world 's most persecuted person
Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi has come under fire after a TV channel he owns secretly filmed a judge who ruled against him in a bribery case .
Mr Berlusconi's Canale 5 channel aired footage of the judge taking a walk , smoking and visiting a barber shop .
A lawyers ' association reported the incident to Italy 's privacy watchdog and declared a " state of protest " .
Earlier this month , Judge Raimondo Mesiano found Mr Berlusconi " co-responsible " of bribing legal officers .
In the hidden camera footage - which was aired on Thursday - the narrator calls the judge 's behaviour " eccentric " .
He points to him smoking the " umpteenth " cigarette , and calls his turquoise socks " strange " .
The narrator adds : " He 's impatient ... he can only relax at the barber's " .

We do n't think there are similar precedents in Italy of denigrating a person and de-legitimising an essential and delicate function
Italian National Association of Magistrates
In pictures : PM 's annus horribilis Q&A : Berlusconi v the courts
Lawyers and civil rights groups said the secret filming was an unprecedented violation of privacy of a member of the judiciary .
" We do n't think there are similar precedents in Italy of denigrating a person and de-legitimising an essential and delicate function , " the Italian National Association of Magistrates said in a statement .
The leader of the opposition Democratic Party , Dario Franceschini , reportedly wore a pair of turquoise socks on Sunday to show solidarity with the judge .
' Notoriety '
Mediaset , which owns Canale 5 , defended the broadcast , saying it showed a magistrate who " has acquired national and international notoriety " .
On 5 October , Judge Mesiano found Mr Berlusconi " co-responsible " for the bribery of a judge who decided in favour of his holding company , Fininvest , in a business takeover deal .
Fininvest was ordered to pay 750 m euros ( $ 1.1 bn ; £ 685 m ) in compensation to its rival company .
Mr Berlusconi claims that Italy 's legal system is packed with left - wing magistrates who are out to get him .
Earlier this month , Italy 's top court lifted a law granting him immunity while in office .
Correspondents say the ruling means the 73 - year - old billionaire may have to face a number of trials for corruption and bribery within months .
The depth of anger felt by Brawn at Jenson Button 's move to McLaren was put on public display today when the team announced they would hold him tightly to the letter of his contract until the end of the year .
Button signed for McLaren this week after negotiations to remain with Brawn seemed to be dragging on for what the 29 - year - old driver and his management team concluded was an excessively protracted period .
Brawn have responded in the only way remaining to them by forbidding Button even to take part in a press conference with McLaren , their sponsors or his new team - mate Lewis Hamilton until the end of 2009 .
Over the years it has generally been the convention among Formula
One teams to permit drivers who are leaving them at the end of any particular season to start working for their new employer after the final race of the year .
As an example , Fernando Alonso was permitted to attend a Ferrari celebration day ahead of joining the Italian team at the start of 2010 despite being contracted to Renault until December 31 .
Brawn , however , have insisted that Button will not be permitted to assume any duties for McLaren , whether on or off the track , before the end of next month .
" Jenson will not be doing anything at all for McLaren until the end of this calendar year , " said Nick Fry , the Brawn team 's chief executive officer .
" And if he does , we will be looking on it very dimly .
He did n't have any obligations to us in 2010 , but there are issues with regard to the [ McLaren contract ] signing process on which we are in discussion with him at the moment .
There are other constraints on what Jenson can do between now and the end of the year which we will be rigorously enforcing . "
Fry had earlier claimed on autosport.com that Button had not received a better financial offer from McLaren and might even be moving to Brawn 's Woking - based rivals for less money than the winners of the world championship constructors ' title had tabled .
" I am actually earning less that I 've been paid with Brawn , " Button said on BBC Radio 5 yesterday afternoon said .
" But things change and people move on .
I always want a new challenge and I know that it is going to be difficult going up against Lewis .
" Either of the teams would have been able to give me a car capable of defending my world championship but I feel I need something else .
It 's definitely not for the money but because I want to experience something new . "
Nevertheless , it is clear that Fry considers Button to have been disloyal over his new career move and concedes that they feared the possibility of doing a deal with him began to evaporate last weekend after his Friday visit to the McLaren headquarters , as revealed exclusively by The Guardian .
" Clearly loyalty would be nice , " said Fry waspishly , " but in this day and age you do n't expect too much of that .
I am always happy when any employee leaves our company if they are going to a better job , and they always go with our blessing if that is the case .
In this situation we do n't see the logic of the decision and I think Jenson is going to have to up his game if he is going to beat Lewis on home territory . "
It was reported tonight that Brawn have held preliminary talks with Michael Schumacher about a return to Formula One .
The seven - time world champion is said to be a target for Mercedes , which this week took a 75.1 % share in Brawn GP .
Schumacher abandoned plans to drive for Ferrari last season because of a neck injury .
If there is a lecturer in TCD ’s CS department that does n’t know of the problems and issues Joel just raised in his Capstone Projects post , they ’re a rare bird indeed .
But what Joel has n’t mentioned — and what those lecturers can tell you because they ’ve been debating it for decades , writing papers on it , holding conferences and have published peer - reviewed journals on the topic , as opposed to Joel ’s one blog post — are that there are very specific and very good reasons why CS and CEng undergraduate courses do n’t get to cover all the industry tools Joel uses .
To give a brief and inexhaustive list :
Undergraduate courses in CS and CEng are not there to teach industrial tools , but basic principles , ususally ab initio to students just out of secondary school ( high school for the US equivalent courses ) .
This has implications : Everyone must work solo .
You can learn to work in teams later ( and certainly there are team projects all through the four years of the CS and CEng courses in TCD ) but until you have a grasp of the fundamentals , team projects are worse than useless as they mask the student ’s problems with the basics .
No student is expected to graduate and be able the next day to walk into an industrial role without supervision or training , and no student has ever been expected to do that in Engineering since the first undergraduate course started in TCD in 1841 .
That ’s why we have mentoring , why we have CPD processes , why we have Chartered Engineer ( or Professional Engineer ) titles granted by postgraduate programmes , it ’s why there ’s an entire structure there that ’s been built up over hundreds of years of experience .
Experience that we have paid for with lives in many cases .
Everyone needs to work on the “ interesting 10 % ” and leave the boilerplate code for later .
If we had ten years for an undergrad degree , you can be very sure it ’d be covered in detail , but we do n’t .
And four years only sounds like a long time because you ’ve never taught such a course before , and are missing details like the coverage of the entire field of Computer Science being necessary in that four years .
Undergraduate courses lose their technical currency in something like five years on average ( obviously different sectors age at different rates – web programming has a very fast cycle , embedded systems a very slow one ) .
If we started students off on the latest fad language in year one , they ’d graduate with an obsolete skill in year four .
So instead we ’re better serving students by choosing languages which allow the lessons to be taught clearly , or which are at least well - established and unlikly to vanish into obsolesence before they can graduate .
That ’s why moving basic courses to Erlang or Haskell is probably a poor idea .
There is no such thing as the agreed best practise in industrial work .
Some favour Agile methods , some regard them as toxic .
What works in one sector of the industry will leave your business uncompetitive in another .
What is a minor issue in one application will actually kill people in other applications .
And different industry sectors have different governing legislation .
So if Industry , that much - vaunted crucible where only the best practices survive the trial of the invisible hand of the free market , cannot come up with a single code of practice , what exactly would Joel have the universities teach ?
There is a duty of care to the students .
There are many evangelicalists out there who promote one form of Agile methodology over another , who promote unit testing , who promote pair programming , who promote Scrum , and so forth .
These methodolgies are without doubt all very interesting – but they ’re also unproven .
If I ’d started teaching students in 2005 with whatever the Agile Methodology De Jour was , by the time they graduated in 2009 , that methodology had a fairly low probability of being unaltered , let alone the dominant industry methodology .
That ’s four years of a student ’s life , committed to a methodology based solely on the hype its originators could muster together .
That ’s not just poor teaching and an invitation for justified lawsuits , it ’s downright unethical and wrong .
Normally in an article ( or blog post in this case ) like Joel ’s , the last few paragraphs are where traditionally the author is meant to show a solution to an elucidated problem .
Joel has highlighted a perceived lack of experience with current industrial tools and practices amongst college students ( a faulty perception , but nonetheless ) .
He ’s pointed out a root cause ( poor time management ) which is fair enough – it ’s not the sole cause , it ’s not even a primary one in most professional evaluations , but it ’s a valid contributing factor .
So now ’s the time for the solution , yes ?
But here is where Joel merely says “ have the students use my product to track their usage of an unproven methodology ” .
No indications as to how we would approach the problem of explaining the relevant industrial methods , or how we ’d select the specific one we ’d teach , or why we should select it , or where it ’s best applied and where it ’s best avoided , what it ’s strengths and weaknesses are , and so forth — just pure old - fashioned , ladies - and - gentlemen - this - product - cures - all - that - ails - ya , snake oil salesmanship .
Our students may indeed have poor time management skills on long timescales ( a failing which comp.risks and The Daily WTF and IT Project Failures have been pointing out in industrial programmers for many years now , which to me indicates that industry does not necessarily have much to teach here ) .
At least when Limoncelli wrote Time Management for Systems Administrators he was putting forward a set of skills that had proven to work for him in the field , and he was trying to pass on lessons learnt the hard way .
I might not use the book as a college textbook ( though I do use it myself personally ) , but I can at least respect his intent there .
But Joels solution is n’t to teach better skills ; it ’s to sell his software tool to those students .
Let ’s throw ethics out the window for a moment and say we do just that .
Now what ?
I can sell you the best chisel in all creation Joel , but I ca n’t make you into Michaelangelo by doing so – I can just take some of your money and give you a tool you do n’t know how to use in return .
Frankly , when I teach the CS7004 students how to use VCS and ticket tracking , it wo n’t be using FogBugz or any other proprietary system , it ’ll be using systems they can explore without having to pay fees for , like Mercurial and Trac .
And if afterwards they need to go learn Git or Jira , they ’ll know the fundamentals and it ’ll take them less than a few hours to make the transition .
That is what university courses are for , to teach the fundamentals so that the students can pick up specific skills far more rapidly and evaluate tools according to their proposed use .
Not to act as a captive and uncynical market for proprietary software tools .
And even after that , in the final paragraph , he admits himself that it wo n’t work – that you still require a manager to come in and do time management even in industry .
That Scrum wo n’t teach you time management .
That the only difference between college students and industrial programmers is that the latter have time management enforced upon them by a manager – in which case , were that the truth ( and it ’s not a universal truth , and I ’ve witnessed that first - hand ) , then there would be no problem with college students whatsoever .
Gah .
Well , perhaps it ’s time I should exercise some time management techniques that I should have used years ago — and simply stop reading Joel .

Many words come to mind when you hear the name Cannibal Corpse , but one truly defines the soon - to - be thirty - year death metal veterans : Unstoppable .
Returning with their 14th full - length , the monstrous Red Before Black , serves to not only reiterate this but to once more raise the stakes , making it very clear who sets the standard when it comes to always compelling music that is equally brutal and complex .
Moreover , the band have pushed themselves again , ensuring that it stands out from their catalog .
" Throughout our career we 've tried to improve the precision of both our musical execution and our album production , while still maintaining full - on aggression .
' Red Before Black ' continues in that direction , but might go even further on the aggressive side of things .
It 's definitely precise , but it has a rawness to it that goes beyond anything we 've done recently , " asserts bassist Alex Webster .
" We really worked super hard crafting these songs , practicing them , and getting them where we wanted to be more so than on any of our previous albums , " adds drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz .
" And as Alex said , musically I think it 's the most raw sound we 've had - and at the same time I think it 's our most focused , tightest and catchiest record . "
Having played in the region of two hundred shows around the globe in support of the titanic A Skeletal Domain , the quintet - rounded out by guitarists Rob Barrett and Pat O'Brien , and vocalist George " Corpsegrinder " Fisher - settled down to begin writing after completing their successful run on 2016's Summer Slaughter tour .
As has always been the case , there was no blueprint for what they wanted the full - length to be , rather letting it develop naturally with instruments in their hands .
" Towards the end of the ' A Skeletal Domain ' cycle we did talk about having some riffs that breathe a little more , but that was about it .
When everybody started writing I believe it actually became a feel thing more than it ever has been with us , " says Mazurkiewicz .
" That it wound up being a really raw , mostly straightforward kind of album was n't part of a big plan or anything , " Webster asserts .
" We just tried to write the best songs we could , and this is how they turned out . "
The aforementioned aggression , rawness and catchiness leap out from the speaker as soon as the listener hits play , " Only One Will Die " perhaps the most ruthless yet immediate album opener 2017 has seen .
What follows is a relentless barrage of ferocious music that maintains the insanely high standards the unit have long held themselves to , and while there is a great diversity in dynamics there is never a let up in intensity .
The devastating " Firestorm Vengeance " , for instance , sounds like the work of men only the most foolhardy would choose to mess with , likewise the title track and ultra- belligerent " Destroyed Without A Trace " .
The vile , lurching passages of " Code Of The Slashers " play menacingly off against bloodthirsty thrashings , while " Scavenger Consuming Death " stands out as one of the heaviest additions to one of the weightiest catalogs in extreme music .
With " Remaimed " - penned by O'Brien - unleashing some sickening tones that sound wrought from an instrument designed to devastate everything and the eerie droning breaking into " Hideous Ichor " , new flavors have been introduced to their sonic palette this time out .
" We 're always looking for ways to move our sound forward while maintaining the style we 've developed over the years , " Webster states .
" I think we managed to do that with ' Red Before Black ' - it has some new ideas , but you 'll also hear things on this album that would sound at home on our earlier releases .
We want to grow as a band while staying true to our roots " .
With 2006's Kill and the two releases that followed it - 2009 's Evisceration Plague and 2012's Torture - the band forged a tight bond with renowned producer Erik Rutan ( Hate Eternal , Goatwhore ) , and for Red Before Black they chose to reunite with him .
Comfortable and confident in his company , Webster asserts that " he understands death metal better than just about anyone , both as a producer and as a musician " , and with his Mana Studios located not far from their home base in Florida it was also very convenient for one of the hardest touring bands in metal .
" We of course love working with Erik and he did an awesome job on the albums he did for us , but we just finished a long tour cycle and then worked extremely hard on writing and practicing these songs , so being close to home for the recording was a compelling factor too , " says Mazurkiewicz .
" These days , we do n't all have to be there for the whole process any more , but if one of us was needed at the studio we could get there fairly quick . "
Under Rutan 's watchful eye the sessions went smoothly and without a hitch , the only thing slowing them down being the attention to detail exercised by all involved , intent on perfecting their vision .
With Vince Locke once more handling the artwork , fans can be assured that it suitably reflects the music lurking behind it .
" Vince 's style has been a huge part of our band 's visual image since our very first album .
With ' Red Before Black ' he 's made another killer piece , and this time the viewer has the victim 's perspective , which is a little different for us . "
With 2017 seeing a slew of stunning new releases from death metal 's old guard - including Suffocation , Obituary and Dying Fetus - it 's been a landmark year both for the genre and its early innovators , and with Red Before Black Cannibal Corpse stand strong alongside their peers .
" We 're proud to be part of a scene that has great , experienced bands that stick to their guns , " affirms Webster .
" Death metal is an established form of underground music that 's here to stay , and the leadership bands like these have shown by staying true to the genre is no doubt part of the reason it has such longevity . "
That Cannibal Corpse have carved out a career spanning almost three decades is testament to their work ethic , innovative songwriting , passion and devotion to extreme music - though it still remains an astounding feat to the members , as Webster makes humbly clear .
" Who could have imagined this ?
When we started , even Black Sabbath had n't been around for three decades .
There simply was no precedent for a lifelong career in metal , of any kind , let alone a relatively new form like death metal .
We 've been unbelievably lucky , and we are so grateful to our fans for making it possible . "
In typically grounded fashion , they continue to forge ahead , seeing no end in sight , Webster stating he likes to think they have yet to write their best record , while Mazurkiewicz outlines their goals : " I would say we just want to keep it going , try to better ourselves - and finally open for Slayer ! "

The invisible structures of space are becoming less so , as scientists look out to the far edges of the solar wind bubble that separates our solar system from the interstellar cloud through which it flies .
Using the High Energy Neutral Atom Imager , led by Los Alamos National Laboratory , the NASA Interstellar Boundary Explorer ( IBEX ) mission has sent back data that indicates a " noodle soup " of solar material has accumulated at the outer fringes of the heliosphere bubble .
As the solar wind streams out far beyond Pluto , racing a million miles per hour , it reaches the edge of our bubble and collides with the material between the stars , the interstellar medium .
A shock wave forms at that intersection point .
The Los Alamos camera is designed to detect the particles that are heated and stream away from that boundary , specifically the density and temperature of atoms that form the core of that layer .
The High Energy Neutral Atom Imager instrument is particularly important because its design parameters are well matched to the temperature of most of the soup ; about a million degrees centigrade ( 1.8 million degrees Fahrenheit ) .
One of the five IBEX papers appearing in Science this week , LANL 's lead contribution is " Structures and Spectral Variations of the Outer Heliosphere in IBEX Energetic Neutral Atom Maps . "
In the paper , author Herbert Funsten notes " We have discovered an arc - shaped ribbon of high - pressure material that looks to be piled - up material from the Sun .
The IBEX maps and the discovery of the ribbon are completely different from what we thought it should look like . "
" We were expecting tie - dye and instead found noodle soup , " Funsten said .
What the mission has not found is what they were expecting , that is , evidence of large - scale dynamic processes that might be analogous to storms and tornados from the collision of a cold front and a warm front .
A striking result is that " our maps show structure and energy spectra that are completely different from what any model has predicted , " he noted .
" The ribbon follows a circular arc of high pressure that we believe is centered on the direction of the magnetic field of the interstellar cloud through which we are moving , " Funsten said .
This magnetic field seems to fundamentally organize the interaction region .
The results of IBEX not only reveal fundamental properties of the heliosheath but also provide key information about the properties of the interstellar cloud through which our galaxy is moving .
We will be moving out of the cloud in about 10,000 years ; the IBEX results will help us understand how the Earth 's space environment might be different when this happens .
IBEX is the latest in NASA 's series of low - cost , rapidly developed Small Explorers space missions .
Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio , Texas , leads and developed the mission with a team of national and international partners .
NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland , manages the Explorers Program for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate in Washington .
For IBEX , SwRI is partnering with Orbital Science Corporation , Los Alamos National Laboratory , University of California , Riverside , Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center , NASA Goddard Space Flight Center , the University of New Hampshire , the Applied Physics Laboratory and the University of Southern California .
The team also includes a number of American and international scientists from universities and other institutions , as well as Chicago 's Adler Planetarium , which is leading education and public outreach for the mission .

The US manufacturer is under federal investigation for allegedly using illegal rosewood from Madagascar to make its guitars
Gibson Guitars is under invesigation for alleged use of smuggled wood .
US federal agents raided a Gibson factory on Tuesday , claiming that they may have used illegal rosewood to make their guitars .
The US Fish and Wildlife Service seized wood , computers , files and guitars from Gibson 's Massman Road manufacturing facility in Nashville , Tennessee .
They are seeking evidence that Gibson shipped illegal rosewood from Madagascar via Germany .
Rosewood is expensive – more than double the cost of mahogany – and a crucial component in many guitars .
Even at £ 3,000 per cubic metre , it can be found in acoustic guitar bodies and fingerboards .
The troubled east African island of Madagascar , is a prime exporter of the hardwood .
But due to corruption and environmental issues , Madagascan rosewood is a dubious proposition , and America 's Lacey Act bars firms from bringing it into the US .
Gibson promised that they are " fully co-operating " with the federal investigation .
" Gibson is a chain of custody certified buyers that purchases wood from legal suppliers who are to follow all standards , " the company said .
Gibson CEO
Henry Juszkiewicz sits on the board of the Rainforest Alliance , which lobbies for sustainable forestry .
Woodworking carries a lot of passion and I assume you already know that .
I have been very passionate about woodworking for as long as I can remember .

Sometime Reason magazine contributor William L. Anderson at Lew Rockwell.com delivers an infuriating tale of a lawyer , Johnny Gaskins , who had often succeeded against state prosecutors .
Gaskins has been convicted and faces possible lifetime imprisonment for violating federal law against " structuring " financial transactions .
In real - world terms , this means he 's screwed for depositing money in his bank in increments of less than $ 10,000 per deliberately in order to avoid reporting requirements triggered by that amount .
Was he doing this to hide some criminal activity ?
Not even the prosecutors thought so .
As Anderson relates , quoting a Raleigh News and Observer story :
This law was passed as an " ancillary crime " to give prosecutors leverage in cases where people had amassed huge amounts of cash via drug sales or other illegal activities and were trying to avoid detection as well as avoid paying taxes on their money .
However , that clearly was not the case here , as the N&O continues :
Gaskins filed forms to the IRS accounting for more than $ 450,000 in cash payments , according to evidence at trial .
Prosecutors agreed that he had filed and paid his taxes .
He did n't dispute that he intentionally divided his money , but he testified that it was for innocent reasons .
His habits , he said , were born of an exposure to a criminal world that most people only see on television dramas .
Prosecutors did not offer evidence of any other motive for Gaskins ' behavior .
They said at trial that Gaskins should have known better .
" The point of the law is to make sure we do n't have people who try to fool the bank , " federal prosecutor Randall Galyon told jurors last week .
" The fact that he was trying is against the law . "
So , we had an attorney who was paid legally in cash , decided he might be robbed , so he deposited the money in a bank .
Furthermore , he already had paid taxes on his cash earnings , so it is clear that he had no criminal motives .
Furthermore , I can guarantee the readers that there was a motive that was not mentioned , but well should be : prosecutors would have tried to frame Gaskins had he deposited all of his money at once .
That kind of a deposit – which prosecutors insist that he had to make in order to be legal – would have sent alerts to the police and prosecutors , who would have tried to make a drug case against him , claiming he actually had received that money illegally .
The question is this :
Why were prosecutors hell - bent on going after him ?
The answer lies in the success that Gaskins had in his career :
And this means that the cost of many popular drugs has risen even faster .
Merck , for example , now sells daily 10 - milligram pills of Singulair , the blockbuster asthma drug , at a wholesale price of $ 1,330 a year — $ 147 more than last year .
Singulair is now selling at retail , on drugstore.com , for nearly $ 1,478 a year .
The drug companies “ can charge what they want — it ’s not fair , ” Eric
White , the 42 - year - old owner of a small jewelry store in Queens , said as he left a pharmacy recently .
Despite having drug insurance , Mr. White says he now pays $ 110 a month out of pocket for two brand - name allergy medicines , even as he has cut prices in his jewelry store by at least 40 percent to keep customers coming through the door .
He shook his head .
“ What can I do ? ” he said .
“ I need my medicines . ”
The drug industry has actively opposed some of the cost- cutting provisions in the House legislation , which passed Nov. 7 and aims to cut drug spending by about $ 14 billion a year over a decade .
But the drug makers have been proudly citing the agreement they reached with the White House and the Senate Finance Committee chairman to trim $ 8 billion a year — $ 80 billion over 10 years — from the nation ’s drug bill by giving rebates to older Americans and the government .
That provision is likely to be part of the legislation that will reach the Senate floor in coming weeks .
But this year ’s price increases would effectively cancel out the savings from at least the first year of the Senate Finance agreement .
And some critics say the surge in drug prices could change the dynamics of the entire 10 - year deal .

“ It makes it much easier for the drug companies to pony up the $ 80 billion because they ’ll be making more money , ” said Steven D. Findlay , senior health care analyst with the advocacy group Consumers Union .

BUENOS AIRES ( AP ) 
A trial began on Monday for Argentina ’s last dictator , Reynaldo Bignone , a retired general , as well as for five former generals and two others who are accused of kidnappings and murders that prosecutors say took place in the Campo de Mayo military base .
General Bignone is accused of holding ultimate responsibility for myriad cases of torture , illegal break -ins and deprivations of human rights from 1976 to 1978 , before he was appointed president by the military junta in the waning years of the dictatorship .
As president from 1982 to 1983 , General Bignone protected the military as Argentina returned to democracy ; he granted amnesty to human rights violators and ordered the destruction of documents related to torture and the disappearances of political opponents before he agreed to transfer power to a democratically elected president , Raúl Alfonsín .
Argentina ’s courts and Congress later overturned the amnesty , and President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner has made a high priority of prosecuting leaders of the dictatorship .
General Bignone was charged in 2003 , but the trial was delayed until now .

* * * Mainstream bookstores are just that - mainstream .
You will not find real gems inside them .
If you want to discover something worth your while , it is imperative you visit a second - hand bookstore .
Better yet , make sure you do it in places like New York and London .
You will discover so many pages to peruse , then immerse yourself in them ... all of that will leave you feeling like your mind has been sucked into a vortex of arcane knowledge .
There is this bookstore in Edgware I like .
To be honest , I am not really sure why .
It must be that emotional connection - every time I would visit a boot sale , I would then make my way to this very store .
London is even more beautiful when basked in the Indian summer Sun , with red and yellow maple leaves swirling around , directed by the omnipresent force of nature .
Playwright Neil Labute wrote , “ Go back to the theatre , audience members everywhere , and get your hands dirty .
Sit closer than you usually do .
Smell the actors and make eye contact and let a little blood splash on your hem .
Let us know that if we are brave enough to write about the stuff that matters , then you ’ll come and watch ... ” His words resonate profoundly with the mandate of Edmonton ’s Exposure Festival : exposing queer artists to new audiences , and exposing Edmonton audiences to new art .
By presenting these artists working in diverse media , Exposure seeks to question and inspire , celebrate and expand the spectrum of queer expression .
This requires something from both sides of the footlights : the courage to take risks and venture out to showcase your work , and a sense of adventure to see and hear both the emerging and the established artists that are shaping our culture .
This year marks the third for the festival and Dave Jackson , Exposure ’s Media Director , shares that they have been rapidly gaining national and international recognition .
“ This means that when we approach artists to present their work , that they have already heard of us and are usually eager to participate .
It also means that audiences have begun to hear about the Festival and we are growing in terms of interest and attendance .
It has always been a goal of Exposure to reach beyond just the gay , lesbian , bi , trans - gendered , two - spirited community and show Edmonton , Alberta , Canada and the world , the contributions that Queer artists are making .
” Their theme : Sexing Up and Sizing Up Queer Bodies , exemplifies some of the big issues and ideals that we encounter daily .
Todd Janes , Programming Chair for the Festival , says that this year , a lot of discussions with the programming team were wrapped around ideas of the Queer body .
“ The body as a site for protest and transgression , but also at the same time there is a duality of the theme , and we are situating much of the work around the body as a site for celebration and empowerment .
We are about queering concepts and offering multiple points of access into Queer communities and larger discussions .
Including issues of Trans surgeries and who pays for them ; issues of porn and the Queering of mainstream porn ; of the bodies that we not just occupy , but that we celebrate and sexualize .
When we draw power from our physical selves and when we falter because of our self - doubt or because of what the media tells us .
” The theme is the skeleton , but the presenting artists will be the flesh that makes it come alive .
Among them is Exposure ’s headliner , Buck Angel , the first female - to - male transsexual porn star .
“ Buck is so exciting and lovely and I feel that his energy is so infectious that it will be magical .
I think we are taking risks in different ways with bringing such a porn star into our festival and situating his work within a larger discourse around complex issues .
It is bound to generate stimulating discussions around bodies , power , sex and money , ” shares Todd .
Making its world premiere is the locally made documentary And the Rest is Drag .
Featuring Edmonton ’s own Alberta Beef Drag King Troupe , this film contemplates gender from the perspective of people who consciously and politically queer their gender .
Edmonton locals Danielle Pears and Melisa Brittain co-produced the film and shared the director ’s chair with accomplished novelist , Shani Mootoo .
Danielle and Melisa share that , through the film , “ we are hoping to encourage people to think less linearly about gender : to think about all of the shifting and complex intersections that constitute our genders .
These intersections include race , class , sexuality , size and ability , but also the political climates and sub-cultures in which gender is being performed . ”
It was very important to them to premiere at Exposure , because “ it is by , for , and about this community , and is the result of the work and support of members of Edmonton ’s queer , arts and academic communities ; communities that the Exposure festival brings together .
” Screening immediately after And the Rest is Drag is Invasion - Lesbian Beauty Queens , a look inside a series of beauty pageants that took place in the UK .
Overall winner Valerie Mason - John ( AKA : Queenie ) will be in attendance .
Valerie , an international artist / facilitator , will also be working with a local troupe of multi-disciplinary artists to present the “ Queerly I Am Nothing New ” Salon .
This performance event explores the idea that queerness has always been around .
“ There have been LGBTQ people in all communities since humanity evolved in this world , ” says Valerie , “ even the animal kingdom had its queer lifestyle .
We ’re not going to go away , we ’re in an era in the West that many of us can be Out and Proud .
Let ’s celebrate that , but remember that we are doing nothing new .
I hope that as many visible minorities as possible will come out of the Queer closet and take part in this exciting Salon .
Queer has always been more than white , able bodied , professional male .
” For the literary crowd , a Festival highlight will be a reading of the award winning Fruit : A Novel about a Boy and His Nipples , by Canadian author , Brian Francis .
Published in 2004 , Brian ’s story about a 13 - year - old boy and his talking nipples , captures the realities of puberty and budding sexuality in living colour .
A favourite of both teens and adults , Fruit went on to make the CBC Canada Reads list in 2008 .
Francis will also be in attendance for , Our Queer Bodies , a lively panel discussion focusing on issues of body image and queer - identified people .
In addition to providing a platform for seasoned artists , Exposure offers a safe space for new artists to cut their teeth and present their work to the public .
Ted Kerr , a founding member and the current Producer of Exposure , is excited about the involvement that local youth are taking in the Festival .
“ When I think of the queer youth in Edmonton , I am amazed and heart - warmed by how many great , open , productive , and awesome members there are in the community .
This year , the Queer Youth Curators show ( Printed Matters : Creating and Curating queer ) , received the highest amount of submissions in its 3 year history .
This speaks of the great work that Camp fYrefly does and the importance of festivals like Exposure to provide opportunities for Queer Edmonton youth to ‘ be queer ’ all year round , through their expression and passions .
” The very word , “ festival ” , evokes an image of many different people coming together , and the whole team at Exposure is quick to point out that the queer community has made their success and growth possible .
Jennifer Alabiso , Board Chair for Exposure , says that there is incredible support in Edmonton .
“ We have many friends among the downtown businesses .
They support us with space , by making both in - kind and cash donations , and by attending our events .
This is one of the most gratifying things about being a part of the festival , really , the ways that the Edmonton community responds .
” Nevertheless , finding funding is still the biggest challenge to any arts - based festival .
“ Especially in a recession , money can be hard to come by .
We ’re lucky , as I said , to have so many local supporters , but this has been a year where we all feel the pinch a bit , ” says Jennifer .
“ I think it ’s safe to say that the entire team feels that stress and they all bust a move to make it go .
It ’s amazing , incredible , and awe inspiring .
But trust me , we all break a sweat at least once during the lead up . ” Break your own sweat and get out to the Third Annual Exposure Festival .
Take Labute ’s advice ; get your hands dirty , sit closer that you usually do , and let them know that if they are brave enough to create stuff that matters , then you ’ll come and watch .

“ That goes along with the philosophy of the Dog Whisperer , ” the host added .
Brenna Hicks , a child therapist in Palm Harbor , Fla. , who writes an advice blog , The Kid Counselor , adapted Mr. Millan ’s central idea , that dogs take their cues from their masters , and misbehave only when the masters fail to carry themselves , in body language and tone of voice , like pack leaders .
In a post , “ Raising Kids : Wisdom From the Dog Whisperer , ” she wrote , “ When we present nervous , angry or scared energy in front of our kids , they pick up on those emotions . ”
Allison Pearson , author of the novel “ I Do n’t Know How She Does It , ” which explored the stresses of modern motherhood , explained how parents would naturally envy the authority of dog trainers .
“ My generation got itself in a muddle about parenting , ” she wrote by e-mail .
“ We thought that obedience was the enemy of love .
We did n’t want the kids to be afraid of us , but after a while we found ourselves wondering : do we have to do what they say the whole time ? ”
“ Unlike modern parents , ” she added , “ dog trainers do n’t think discipline equals being mean .
They understand that dogs are happiest when they know their position in the hierarchy . ”
So is it “ spare the rolled - up newspaper , spoil the child ? ”
Not exactly .
Many Dog Whisperer techniques  say , the push on the neck to get a dog ’s attention  are best left to the kennel , unless you welcome a visit from Child Protective Services .
But other measures may yield an obedient child .
Matthew Hranek , a photographer in New York , has a daughter , Clara , who is 6 , and a Patterdale terrier , Charlie , who is a handful .
Lately , Mr. Hranek said , he finds himself adopting Mr. Millan ’s trademark “ sshht ! ” sound  meant to snap dogs out of unconstructive patterns of thought or behavior  not just when Charlie jumps up on the kitchen counter , but also when Clara does .
A bit of a joke ?
Sure .
But it ’s efficient .
With none of the usual red - in - the - face parental haranguing , it reminds her who is boss in a syllable .
In this east - side Cleveland neighborhood , where gunfire and drug use are part of the landscape , there are no strangers to tragedy .
But what police discovered inside a cream - hued duplex on Imperial Avenue was horrific even here : the bodies of six women -- two stuffed into crawl spaces , some decayed beyond recognition -- in the home of a convicted rapist .
On Sunday , a day after police arrested Anthony Sowell , 50 , the Cuyahoga County coroner declared what most people had surmised :
All six were homicide victims .
The bodies have not been identified , and Sowell has not been charged in any of the deaths .
The shocked community is grappling with self - recrimination .

“ One of my neighbors has been missing since May , and now I wonder if she was in there , ” said Teresa Brown , 54 , an usher at the nearby Perfect Peace Baptist Church .
“ If I ’d done something , called someone , would it have made a difference ? ”
Cleveland police found the bodies almost by accident .
Officers arrived at the property Thursday to arrest Sowell on a separate rape charge .
He was n’t there , but the smell of decay was so thick that officers headed upstairs .
They found two bodies on the living room floor .

As the days passed , investigators found another body in a freshly dug grave underneath a set of stairs in the backyard .
Two more were crammed into a crawl space inside the house .
The sixth was in a shallow grave in the basement .
“ The stench of decay was overwhelming , ” said Lt. Thomas Stacho , spokesman for the police department .
“ The closest I got was 15 feet from an open door , and it was more than bad enough .
I ca n’t figure out how the neighbors did n’t know something was wrong . ”
They did .
For months , they said , they gagged whenever they walked past the wood - framed house , with its listing porch and neatly mowed lawn .
Some recalled that Sowell ’s clothing smelled bad enough to make their eyes water .

“ He came into my store last week and reeked so bad , I had to open the front and back doors , ” said Eli Tayeh , who owns the Amira Imperial Beverage convenience store across the street .
“ I asked why he stunk .
He shrugged , bought his beer and walked out . ”
Neighbors blamed the smell on mundane causes : body odor , the garbage bins Sowell picked through for scrap metal , the raw meat next door at Ray ’s Sausage Shop .
No one called the authorities .
No one , they said , even thought to do so .
After all , in Cleveland these days , help can be hard to find .
The city has been reeling from the foreclosure crisis for several years .
Its unemployment rate was 10.3 % in September , and it has one of the nation ’s highest poverty rates .
Hard hit by the collapse of the steel and auto industries , Cleveland has seen its population fall by half since 1960 .

On Sunday , as police guarded the property , locals and the morbidly curious walked past and took pictures .
Some stopped to pray .
They stared at the upper floors , where investigators had left the windows and porch door open .
Standing across the street , Tamica Pierceton wrinkled her nose in disgust .
“ We kept away from him and he kept away from us , ” said Pierceton , 26 , who lives in the predominantly black area .
“ We should have said something to someone .
I wish I had . ”
Sowell moved into the duplex ’s upstairs unit in 2005 after serving 15 years in state prison for choking and raping a woman , investigators said .
The property was owned by family members , but only his stepmother lived in the house , local media reports said .

Neighbors said Sunday that Sowell had told them his stepmother was having difficulty walking up stairs and had moved to a nursing home about a year ago .
Investigators say they are trying to find her .
Police learned that she had tried to kick Sowell out after he refused to pay rent , and had not been heard from recently , Stacho said .
Sowell registered with the state as a sex offender , as required by state law , investigators said .
On Sept. 22 , deputies with the Cuyahoga County Sheriff ’s Department did a spot check on him to confirm that he was living at the address where he was registered , officials said .
Advertisement
Later the same day , a woman contacted police and told them Sowell had choked her with an extension cord and raped her inside the home .
On Thursday , police arrived to serve a warrant for his arrest and made their discovery .
Officers located and arrested Sowell on Saturday .
Only two victims were intact enough for the coroner to determine that they were black .
At least four were found to have died from strangulation .
Some of the bodies were so decomposed that investigators called in an entomologist from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History to gather evidence to help narrow down when the victims were killed .

Since police asked the public for help Saturday , three people have come forward with information about missing loved ones .
“ I have n’t seen my sister for a year , ” Denice Patton told local media , holding a crumpled photocopy of the missing woman ’s picture .
“ She lived in the neighborhood .
It ’s aggravating , it ’s stressful .
I just want to know where she is . ”

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says he has concerns about the Church of Scientology but wants to see what material independent senator Nick Xenophon has before committing to a parliamentary inquiry .
Senator Xenophon told Parliament today there was criminal activity within the church and has called for a Senate inquiry into Scientology ’s tax exempt status .
Senator Xenophon has also called for police to investigate the church after being contacted by a number of former Scientologists who accused the organisation of shocking crimes .
Senator Xenophon said their correspondence implicated the organisation in a range of crimes , including forced imprisonment , coerced abortions , physical violence , and blackmail .

( RFE/RL ) --
It is a story that has gripped both the Muslim and Western worlds .
It began in 2008 , in the German city of Dresden , when an Egyptian - born woman , Marwa al - Shirbiny , asked a man to make room for her 3 - year - old son on a children 's playground swing .
The man , Alexander Wiens , responded by calling al - Shirbiny -- who was wearing an Islamic headscarf at the time -- a " terrorist " and a " slut . "
Al - Shirbiny summoned the police , and Wiens was subsequently fined the equivalent of $ 480 on charges of verbal abuse .
When Wiens attempted to appeal the conviction this July , al - Shirbiny , then pregnant , attended the hearing .
As she was leaving the courtroom , the court records charge , Wiens leapt at her and stabbed her 18 times with a kitchen knife .
Her husband , Elwi Ali Okaz , tried to protect her , and also suffered multiple stab wounds .
To make matters worse , in the melee a policeman shot Okaz in the leg , apparently assuming that the Egyptian man was the attacker , rather than the German defendant .
The murder trial of Wiens , a 29 - year - old ethnic German born in Russia , began in Dresden October 26 in the same courtroom where the murder took place .
The dead woman 's husband , Okaz , attended on a pair of crutches .
Ayyub Axel Koehler , the head of Germany 's Central Muslim Council , told Reuters before the trial started that Muslims everywhere are intensely interested in this case .
" This trial is getting huge attention in the Muslim world , ” Koehler said .
“ There were riots in some Islamic countries because of this murder .
So it 's up to us Germans to defend our reputation . "
Koehler , a convert to Islam , was referring to demonstrations in Egypt and Iran , and Tehran 's request for the United Nations to become involved .
He also said that Germany 's Muslim community -- the biggest in Europe after France -- has been badly shaken by the affair .
" We 're looking at this trial with great anticipation , because our women and girls are obviously scared , ” he said .
“ They are already being discriminated against in public and looked down on . "
Koehler said Germany 's reputation has suffered badly , and that politicians have ignored Islamophobia and its consequences in society .
State prosecutor Christian Avenarius said in the course of the trial that it was clear the accused was motivated by a fanatic hatred of foreigners .
A top aide to German Chancellor Angela Merkel , Commissioner for Minorities Maria Boehmer , called on October 26 for calm , saying she knew that this " terrible deed " caused horror both in Germany and Egypt , as well as many parts of the Arab world .
She said it showed that Germans must " engage daily " to fight against racism , and work for peaceful coexistence .
Security is reported to be tight at the Dresden courthouse , with some 200 policemen surrounding the building .
The accused has his hands and feet chained together , and is sitting behind bulletproof glass .
Egypt 's ambassador to Berlin , Ramzy Ezzeldin , attended the opening of the trial , telling journalists as he arrived that he has " great trust " in German justice .
A poser from 1821 :
Mathematicians affirm that of all bodies contained under the same superficies , a sphere is the most capacious :
But they have never considered the amazing capaciousness of a body , the name of which is now required , of which it may be truly affirmed , that supposing its greatest length 9 inches , greatest breadth 4 inches , and greatest depth 3 inches , yet under these dimensions it contains a solid foot ?
Minnesota 's largest school districts have been able to save or add scores , even hundreds , of teaching jobs and other positions this year , thanks to federal stimulus funds , according to newly released state figures .
Breakdowns show that the state 's largest district , Anoka - Hennepin , owes the equivalent of 413 full - time jobs to the stimulus package .
For St. Paul and Minneapolis , those figures are 444 and 364 , respectively .
Overall , $ 643 million in stimulus money has been allocated to the state 's public schools .
Take those numbers away , some say , and cash - strapped districts would have suffered crippling classroom losses at a time when future state funding is uncertain .
Not having that money " clearly would have been just devastating , " said Scott Croonquist , executive director of the Association for Metropolitan School Districts .
" The layoffs would have been really severe . "
But some officials suggest that the numbers should be taken with a grain of salt .
Had stimulus funding not been there , the state may have found other ways to provide some of the money , they say .
Many jobs were saved indirectly , the result of a complex manipulation the Legislature designed to plug the state 's budget deficit .
In effect , $ 500 million was removed this year from state education funding to help erase the budget shortfall , then it was replaced by federal stimulus funds .
" I think it would have been a very difficult conversation " if the state had really cut that much without the stimulus money , said Matt Mohs , director of Title I programs for the St. Paul Public Schools .
Even without the cuts , the district had to deal with a $ 25 million deficit for this year , and that meant laying off 117 teachers .
Many education jobs that were reported as " saved " presumably would have been cut had the stimulus money not been available to plug the $ 500 million hole .
Instead , the Legislature kept education funding steady for this year and next .

Many of their plants are eaten raw and they also eat high proportions of apricots , cherries , grapes , plums and peaches .

These days it seems that as the rudes have gotten ruder — abetted by BlackBerries , cellphones and MP3 players — the scolds have gotten scoldier .
True , many people have grown complacent about having to endure others ’ musical tastes or conversations — or more accurately , half of their conversations .
But among the disapprovers , withering glances and artfully worded comments have given way to pranks and other creative kinds of revenge .
On Broadway , the actors Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman took turns breaking out of character during a September performance of their show , “ A Steady Rain , ” to admonish an audience member who refused to silence his cellphone .
Patti LuPone , too , has recently garnered some of the most enthusiastic ovations of her career for stopping shows to publicly berate people for similar offenses .
Celebrities have also been on the receiving end .
Last month , the Argentine opera singer Gabriela Pochinki was arrested at a French bistro on the Upper West Side when she allegedly scuffled with the restaurant ’s manager after several customers had complained about her loud cellphone chat .

Mr. Bartilucci did just that last summer at a McDonald ’s in lower Manhattan , soliciting the logical question :
What are you doing ?

Sept. 29 , 2009  -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. today proposed that banks prepay tens of billions of dollars in fees to bolster its insurance fund that has been depleted by a rash of bank failures during the recession .
As of the end of June , the FDIC 's insurance fund for depositors had dwindled to $ 10.4 billion , its lowest level in 15 years .
The agency now expects bank failures to cost the fund $ 100 billion over the next four years , with the bulk of the costs coming this year and next , and the fund balance to turn negative this month .
To replenish the fund , the FDIC wants banks to pay three years worth of fees , a move that could rake in $ 45 billion .
If the proposal is enacted , the agency 's 8,195 insured institutions would prepay by Dec. 31 their fees for the fourth quarter of this year and all of 2010 , 2011 , and 2012 .
" This proposal is really about how and when the industry fulfills its obligations to the insurance fund , " FDIC chief Sheila Bair said at a board meeting in Washington .
Bair explained why the agency selected the prepayment proposal over other options , such as tapping its $ 500 billion credit line with the Treasury Department .
" I do think that the American people would prefer to see an end to policies that look to the federal balance sheet as a remedy to every problem , " she stated .
" This is especially true in the case of this industry that has the resources to deal with these problems .
It is important for the industry to maintain public confidence by demonstrating that it will not reflexively fall back on the public safety net in a period of distress . "
" I never say never and there 's much we cannot control for , particularly the speed and strength of the economic recovery , " she added .
" While we are optimistic on the economy , if conditions unexpectedly worsen , we could reach a point where we would have to tap our Treasury line , but today is not that day .
Our analysis suggests that the industry can step up , so we are asking them to do so . "
As of the end of the second quarter , the agency had 416 institutions on its " problem list . "
Already this year , federal regulators have shut down 95 banks , with more sure to come .
As the proposal moves into a 30 - day period of public comment , Bair maintained that whatever happens next , depositors ' funds are safe .
The banks seem to prefer the advance approach rather than hitting them for money over and above what they would be expected to pay .
" The prepaid assessments represent money that the FDIC expects to receive from banks anyway over the next several years , but having the cash on hand sooner ... provides more flexibility for dealing with any contingencies over the foreseeable future , " James Chessen , chief economist of the American Bankers Association , said in a statement .
" Another special assessment would likely do more harm than good as it would directly reduce bank income , hinder capital growth , and make lending much more difficult . "
Over the past two weeks , an individual calling himself Steve Leone has attempted to leave about half a dozen variations of the following comment on my thread about the “ miracle ” of Fatima :
“ Oh yeah ?
Well , how did three illiterate Portuguese peasant children know that some strange atmospheric phenomenon was going to appear in the sky over Fatima at the exact date and time they predicted ?
Answer that , you smarty - pants atheists ! ”
Here ’s an entirely typical example from my moderation queue :

Comment :
Whatever the thousands of people witnessed at Fatima , one has to ask :
How did 3 peasant children know that something would occur at that time ?
Among all those in that varied crowd of people there was present newspaper reporters from Lisbon who witnessed and so reported the phenomenon that occurred .
Agnostics , Atheists , Fanatics , yes even Fools were also present in that crowd of THOUSANDS .
There can be no question that a spectacular event occurred .
Without computers , 3 children alerted all to the event at the predicted hour .
Solar activity was not in the mind of that crowd at that hour since it was rainy and overcast .
The children did not fantasize , did not profit materially , did not conspire etc .
Make of all this what you want but logic must prevail at the end .
While I do n’t demand that commenters agree with my viewpoint , I do insist that people who disagree with me take the time to read my posts and respond to the arguments I make .
Since it was obvious that this person had n’t bothered to read or comprehend the Fatima post – if he had , he would have known that his criticism is completely irrelevant to the explanation I actually propose – I did n’t approve any of these comments .
Then , in the past few days , I ’ve started getting comments of a much more disturbing nature , submitted by someone calling himself “ White Power Atheist ” .
Here ’s one example of the kind of garbage this individual routinely submits :
Author : White Power Atheist ( IP : 205.188.117.11 , cache- dtc-ae07.proxy.aol.com )
Comment :
We must assassinate all believers
For even more obvious reasons , none of these comments made it out of my moderation queue .
But it seems that “ White Power Atheist ” has suddenly become active on a variety of atheist blogs , as you ’ll see if you do a Google search for his handle .
See this thread , for example , to understand the sort of filth he spews .
( These comments were posted on Words of Wrath , a site run by an atheist blogger of color , which I ’m sure was intentional . )
Now , if you look closely at the header information for those two comments , you may notice something : Steve Leone and “ White Power Atheist ” have exactly the same IP address , an AOL proxy server .
Their comments also started being sent in to my site within a few days of each other .
Since AOL users all access the internet through these proxies , it might happen by coincidence that two separate people could leave comments from the same IP address .
That would be a reasonable explanation if this had only happened once .
But my suspicions were up , so I went back and scanned comments submitted to my moderation queue for the past two weeks .
Here are the IP addresses used by Steve Leone for the comments he submitted :
64.12.116.69 [ 18 August 20:21 ] 205.188.117.11 [ 24 August 17:03 ] 205.188.117.11 [ 24 August 19:45 ] 205.188.117.11 [ 25 August 11:07 ] 205.188.117.11 [ 25 August 15:10 ] 64.12.116.69 [ 5 September 16:14 ] 205.188.117.11 [ 6 September 12:50 ]
And here are the IP addresses used by “ White Power Atheist ” :
205.188.117.11 [ 4 September 22:15 ] 64.12.116.69 [ 6 September 16:00 ] 64.12.116.69 [ 6 September 16:03 ]
I also checked the database of existing comments .
These are the only two commenters any time within the past month who have used either of these IP addresses .
The fact that both of these commenters appeared within the same general time interval , as well as the fact that they both use these two IP addresses and no other current commenter on my site uses either of them , leads me to conclude that they are the same person .
The fact that the Christian - apologist comments appeared first , and with greater frequency , indicates to me that their subject material is the author ’s primary concern , which leads me to conclude that the Christian persona is the true one and the racist - atheist persona is a masquerade .
The implication is that this is a Christian pretending to be a racist atheist in an attempt to smear all atheists with the taint of racism .
The Neutralized Drift Compression Experiment - II ( NDCX - II ) is an energy - efficient induction accelerator that will focus beams of ions using the technique of neutralized drift compression developed at Berkeley Lab .
Transmission lines for creating high - voltage pulses contributed by Livermore , known as Blumleins , power the accelerator cells ( dark blue , top ) .
Beam - neutralizing plasma injectors and the drift chamber that focuses the beam on the target ( orange and red , right ) were developed in an earlier experiment , NDCX - I. Credit : Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
Imagine yourself at the core of Jupiter , a planet 300 times the mass of Earth .
At 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit , you and I might think it 's hot in here , but to a physicist it 's merely warm - warm dense matter , to be precise , stuff that has n't quite undergone thermonuclear fusion yet .
Warm dense matter exists not only in the interiors of gas giant planets but in other high - temperature , high - pressure regimes as well - in a just - triggered nuclear bomb , for example , or when a fuel capsule in an inertial fusion experiment starts to implode .
Given that the field of warm dense matter ranges from fundamental astrophysics to practical power production , physicists are eager to study it in the laboratory .
At the U.S. Department of Energy 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , the Accelerator and Fusion Research Division ( AFRD ) is building a specialized user facility so scientists can do just that .
Transformers
" Most accelerators are built to boost relatively small bunches of particles to very high energies , " says AFRD 's Joe Kwan .
" To study warm dense matter , we need a different kind of accelerator , one that can deliver very high currents - a great many particles - in short pulses of moderate energy . "
Kwan is Project Manager of the Neutralized Drift Compression Experiment - II ( NDCX - II ) , a project of the Heavy Ion Fusion Science Virtual National Laboratory ( HIFSVNL ) , which is a collaboration among Berkeley Lab , Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , and the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory ( PPPL ) .
Berkeley Lab's Grant Logan is Director of the HIFSVNL , and Livermore 's John Barnard , currently based at Berkeley Lab , and Ron Davidson of PPPL are Deputy Directors .
NDCX - II is a linear accelerator ( linac ) that operates on the principle of induction , in which electrical current in one winding induces a varying magnetic field in the second winding and thus transfers energy to a new current , as in a transformer .
" The NDCX - II is like a string of transformers , where the beam itself acts as the second winding , " says Kwan .
The beam in this case is made of lithium ions , the lightest of elements after hydrogen and helium .
When the charged beam reaches the end of the linac , eponymous " neutralized drift compression " takes over : plasma is injected to neutralize the ion beam ; the ion bunches are squeezed radially by magnetic fields while the tails of the bunches are allowed to catch up to their heads , forming a compact , focused beam at the precise moment it hits the target .
" A high - energy accelerator would send a particle beam through the target like a bullet through paper , " Kwan says , " but our ion beam is optimized to deposit most of its energy in the target itself , heating it instantly to warm dense matter . "
Says Barnard , " The object is to reach the warm dense matter stage quickly , giving us time to measure its properties before it boils away .
Even though the relationship of pressure , temperature , and density of hydrogen fusion - its equation of state - is fairly well understood , no one has ever confirmed the equation of state of warm dense matter . "
Combinations of temperature and density that yield warm dense matter exist throughout the Universe , sometimes briefly , sometime long - term .
Laser fusion experiments have briefly transited the warm dense matter regime at Livermore ’s NIF and the University of Rochester ’s Omega , as have special - purpose fusion experiments like Sandia ’s Z - Pinch .
Beam experiments like NDCX - II will create relatively long - lived warm dense matter for detailed study within the pressure - temperature region indicated by the red square on this diagram .

NDCX - II will hit its thin - film foil targets with 30 nanocoulombs of charge in pulses lasting one nanosecond .
These pulses carry energies of three MeV ( three million electron volts ) , focused to a spot one millimeter in diameter .
Through decades of research into heavy ion fusion , AFRD has long experience with induction accelerators - as does Livermore , which began building them in the 1960s for research into thermonuclear fusion ( for applications such as hydrogen bombs ) .
Fusion is the common factor .
While warm dense matter is a field in itself , fusion energy is much on the minds of NDCX - II 's builders .
" U.S. fusion - energy research has well - defined goals and programs , " says Logan .
" On the one hand , the U.S. is a major participant in ITER , the international tokamak project located in France that 's studying magnetic fusion . "
A tokamak , the most advanced magnetic fusion concept , uses magnetic fields in a donut - shaped ring to confine , heat , and squeeze plasma until it ignites , and then holds the burning plasma in place .
ITER will address whether tokamaks can maintain self - sustaining fusion reactions continuously , as required for power plants .
Controlled implosions
The other major approach to controlled fusion is inertial confinement , in which a fuel capsule is hit by energetic " driver " beams from all directions , causing it to implode and then ignite in a miniature thermonuclar explosion .
Currently the major U.S. research program in inertial confinement is Livermore 's National Ignition Facility ( NIF ) , a multibillion - dollar , stadium - sized facility optimized for studying nuclear stockpile stewardship , not power production , using powerful laser beams as drivers .
" NIF will be the first to demonstrate the scientific basis for inertial fusion energy through ignition , fusion , and energy production , " says Logan .
" At the moment , the big question in inertial confinement is capsule ignition . "
The process begins when the capsule , which contains frozen hydrogen isotopes , is struck by x-rays produced by the driver beams and undergoes a pre-pulse " that compresses it and gets it moving , " Barnard says .
A shock wave travels inward through the capsule , increasing the pressure and temperature - meanwhile traveling through the warm dense matter stage - until the hydrogen undergoes fusion , releasing energy outward .
NIF 's big glass lasers can only deliver a few shots a day without active cooling , but a power plant will need ignition at a high repetition rate .
Also , says Kwan , " The glass lasers ' final lenses can be damaged by debris when the capsules ignite . "
Berkeley Lab 's inertial fusion energy research has emphasized ion beams - focused by magnetic fields , not materials like glass , and accelerated by induction accelerators .
Induction acceleration is projected to use energy far more efficiently than the glass laser technology ; with ignition as its primary goal , NIF does n't have to be concerned with energy efficiency .
" Right now the emphasis is on understanding the fundamentals of capsule ignition and implosion , " says Barnard .
" Once that 's achieved in NIF , we 'll be prepared to look at more practical questions for future drivers . "
Construction of NDCX - II began in July , funded by DOE's Office of Science and aided by stimulus funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
Built alongside NDCX - I in Building 58 , it will use ion-source , target , and beam neutralization systems developed for NDCX - I .
Its accelerating cells will also employ two dozen transmission lines for creating high - voltage pulses , known as " Blumleins , " from Livermore 's retired Advanced Test Accelerator .
With these economies , NDCX - II is expected to be completed in March of 2012 at a cost of only $ 11 million .
That modest price will buy a unique , ion -driven user facility for studies of warm dense matter and the physics of inertial - fusion targets .

Key Democratic allies in the US health care battle warned Sunday that a Senate bill required major changes if it was to earn their support and give President Barack Obama a crucial victory on his top domestic priority .
Meanwhile , former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean told Huffington Post ’s Sam Stein that Democrats could be in “ big trouble ” because of delays in crafting health care legislation .

A knife - edge ballot Saturday saw Democrats scrape the 60 votes needed for debate to begin November 30 , but wavering senators Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson sent a strong message that they would not back the bill as it stands .
Lieberman , an independent senator from Connecticut who usually votes in line with the Democrats and did so on Saturday , opposes the creation of a government insurance program to compete with private firms , the so - called “ public option . ”
“ We have a healthcare system that has real troubles , but we have an economic system that is in real crisis , ” said Lieberman , who fears the government program would be too expensive for the cash - strapped US economy .
“ I don?t want to fix the problems in our healthcare system in a way that creates more of an economic crisis , ” he told NBC ’s “ Meet the Press ” .
On Monday , Huffington Post ’s Sam Stein reported , “ One of the leading progressive champions of health care reform is pessimistic about the state of the debate in the Senate , saying he sees virtually no path to passing strong legislation and predicting potential congressional losses for Democrats as a consequence . ”

Stein adds ,
Former DNC Chair Howard Dean told the Huffington Post on Monday that Senate Democratic leadership was “ in deep trouble ” on health care , even after Majority Leader Harry Reid cobbled together over the weekend the 60 votes needed to get legislation to the floor .
The problem was as much about politics as policy .
“ I think if you passed the Senate bill tomorrow it would be OK .
But then the problem is they do n’t have any defense for their members in 2010 , ” Dean said , noting that the public option would not become operational until 2014 .
“ On the other hand , if they drop the public option [ to placate moderate members ] , I think they lose seats . ”
“ So this is really tough .
I did n’t anticipate being in this position .
I thought it would pass .
Maybe Harry has some magic up his sleeve .
But I do n’t see how he gets those four votes [ Sens. Joseph Lieberman ( Conn. ) , Mary Landrieu ( La. ) , Blanche Lincoln ( Ark. ) and Ben Nelson ( Neb. ) ] without compromising the bill , ” Dean concluded .
The former Vermont governor warned that if the party allowed the four moderates to further water down the bill ( or defeat it altogether ) it could lead to primary challenges or a drop in fundraising from the party ’s base .
America ’s
Thanksgiving holidays are set to be marked by bitter debate over the nitty - gritty of the bill , from its costs in terms of tax increases and fees to the merits or not of the “ public option . ”
Divisive issues like abortion funding could also come to the fore while some Democrats may also seek funding for pet causes in their states in return for passing what amounts to the biggest shake - up of US health care in four decades .
ADVERTISEMENT
The leading Democrat in the Senate , Harry Reid , faced three possible defectors in addition to Lieberman , any one of whom could have deprived him the 60 votes necessary to prevent Republican parliamentary delaying tactics .
Those senators — Mary Landrieu of Louisiana , Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas , and Nelson of Nebraska — have signaled a willingness to join Republicans if their proposed changes to core provisions of the bill are defeated .
ADVERTISEMENT
Before eventually falling into party line on Saturday , Landrieu and Lincoln repeated their strong opposition to the “ public option . ”
Nelson indicated on Sunday that he could be open to persuasion on the issue , although he prefers states to be able to opt in to program rather than having to opt out .
“ We could negotiate a public option of some sort that I might look at , but I do n’t want a big government , Washington - run operation , ” he told ABC ’s “ This Week ” program .

Nelson has also demanded tougher restrictions on federal money subsidizing abortions , mirroring language the House of Representatives added to its version of the bill when it approved it in a 220 - 215 squeaker November 7 .
The New York Times reported that the Obama administration was continuing to court two moderate Republican senators from Maine , Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe , in the hope of winning them over and breaking up the united Republican opposition on health care .
Debate in the Senate is expected to last at least three weeks , but Republicans hope to kill the bill or delay the battle into next year with the expectation that the 2010 midterm elections may make it harder for moderate Democrats to support it .
Senators voted 60 - 39 Saturday to formally start debate on legislation aimed at extending coverage to some 31 million Americans .

As well as the public insurance option , the Senate bill includes restrictions on dropping care for pre-existing ailments .
It is estimated to cost 848 billion dollars through 2019 but cut the sky - high US budget deficit by 130 billion dollars over the same period .
A successful final vote — expected a month away at the earliest — would force the Senate and the House of Representatives to reconcile their rival versions of the bill and vote again on whether to send it to Obama .
The United States is the world ’s richest nation but the only industrialized democracy that does not provide health care coverage to all of its citizens , about 36 million of whom are uninsured .
Several US presidents since Theodore Roosevelt in the early 1900s have sought to overcome the traditional US suspicion of a wider government role in health care .

Washington spends more than double what Britain , France , and Germany do per person on health care , but lags behind other countries in life expectancy and infant mortality , according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) .

Shahid Bin Waheeds Lies Exposed : Paul Was Correct - Jesus IS FROM the Seed of David !
This article is a response directed towards Shahid Bin Waheeds ( SBW ) misinformation and slander against the Apostle Paul in the article Paul LIED : Jesus is NOT the Seed of David !
Normally , we would ignore such poor and incoherent attacks since we do not want to give the individuals who produce such material credibility in the eyes of the readers .
Yet , since SBWs specific attacks focused on Christs genealogy we decided to expose his gross errors in order to provide clarification on this issue for our readers .
SBW begins :
Let me expose another Christian Trojan Horse , the so - called claim of Jesus being the son of David or seed of David , well , he is not :
In Matthew 1:20 and Luke 1:35 we learn that Mary was made pregnant with Jesus not by Joseph , who was of the Davidic line , but by the Holy Ghost .
1:20 But while he thought on these things , behold , the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream , saying , Joseph , thou son of David , fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife : for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost .
1:35 And the angel answered and said unto her , The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee , and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee : therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God .
RESPONSE :
Let us read what the author conveniently omitted :
" A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ THE SON OF DAVID , the son of Abraham : Abraham was the father of Isaac , Isaac the father of Jacob , Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers , Judah the father of Perez and Zerah , whose mother was Tamar , Perez the father of Hezron , Hezron the father of Ram , Ram the father of Amminadab , Amminadab the father of Nahshon , Nahshon the father of Salmon , Salmon the father of Boaz , whose mother was Rahab , Boaz the father of Obed , whose mother was Ruth , Obed the father of Jesse , and Jesse the father of King David .
David was the father of Solomon , whose mother had been Uriah 's wife , Solomon the father of Rehoboam , Rehoboam the father of Abijah , Abijah the father of Asa , Asa the father of Jehoshaphat , Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram , Jehoram the father of Uzziah , Uzziah the father of Jotham , Jotham the father of Ahaz , Ahaz the father of Hezekiah , Hezekiah the father of Manasseh , Manasseh the father of Amon , Amon the father of Josiah , and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon .
After the exile to Babylon : Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel , Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel , Zerubbabel the father of Abiud , Abiud the father of Eliakim , Eliakim the father of Azor , Azor the father of Zadok , Zadok the father of Akim , Akim the father of Eliud , Eliud the father of Eleazar , Eleazar the father of Matthan , Matthan the father of Jacob , and Jacob the father of Joseph , the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David , fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon , and fourteen from the exile to the Christ .
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about :
His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph , but before they came together , she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit .
Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace , he had in mind to divorce her quietly .
But after he had considered this , an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said ,  Joseph SON OF DAVID , do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife , because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit .  "
Matthew 1:1-20
" The angel went to her and said ,  Greetings , you who are highly favored !
The Lord is with you .
Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be .
But the angel said to her ,  Do not be afraid , Mary , you have found favor with God .
You will be with child and give birth to a son , and you are to give him the name Jesus .
He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High .
The Lord God will give him the throne of HIS FATHER DAVID , and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever ; his kingdom will never end .
 How will this be ,  Mary asked the angel , since I am a virgin ? 
The angel answered ,  The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Most High will overshadow you .
So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God .  "
Luke 1:28 - 35 Jesus , when he began his ministry , was about thirty years of age , being the son ( as was supposed ) of Joseph , the son of Heli the son of Mele - a , the son of Menna , the son of Mattatha , the son of Nathan , the son of David the son of Amminadab , the son of Admin , the son of Arni , the son of Hezron , the son of Perez , the son of Judah , " Luke 3:23 , 31 , 33 RSV
The words , " as was supposed , " suggest that it is Mary 's genealogy which is being presented , with Joseph acting as the male representative .
This is supported by extrabiblical documents such as the Jewish tractate of the Talmud , Chagigah , where a certain person had a dream in which he saw the punishment of the damned .
There , " He saw Mary the daughter of Heli amongst the shades . " ( John B. Lightfoot , Commentary On the New Testament from the Talmud and Hebraica [ Oxford University Press , 1859 ; with a second printing from Hendrickson Publishers Inc. , 1995 ] , vol . 1 , p. v ; vol.
3 , p. 55 )
Neither Matthew nor Luke apparently had a problem with calling Jesus a Son of David while still affirming his virginal conception and birth .
Unlike SBW , they were aware that Christ truly became a full human being , and truly was Marys virgin born son , which meant that he truly had a human ancestry from his mothers side which linked him to King David and to the Patriarchs :
" who are Israelites .
To them belong the adoption as sons , the glory , the covenants , the giving of the law , the temple worship , and the promises .
To them belong the patriarchs , and from them , by human descent , came the Christ , who is God over all , blessed forever !
Amen . " Romans 9:4-5 NET
Bible
It is because of this that Apostolic Father Ignatius of Antioch , writing approximately AD.
110 , could say :
" For our God , Jesus Christ , was , according to the appointment of God , conceived in the womb by Mary , of the seed of David , but by the Holy Ghost ... ...
For the Son of God , who was begotten before time began , and established all things according to the will of the Father , He was conceived in the womb of Mary , according to the appointment of God , of the seed of David , and by the Holy Ghost ... ( Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians Chapter XVIII . - The Glory of the Cross ; http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-01/anf01-16.htm#P1093_206499)
The author continues :
But the Saul AKA Paul of Taurus said in Romans 1:3 the following : 1:3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord , which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh ;
And in Revelation 22:16 , Paul said : 22:16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches .
I am the root and the offspring of David , and the bright and morning star .
RESPONSE :
Let me correct SBWs gross error regarding the authorship of Revelation .
Paul didnt write it , THE APOSTLE JOHN DID :
" The revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave him to show his servants what must soon take place .
He made it known by sending his angel TO HIS SERVANT JOHN , who testifies to everything he saw - that is , the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ .
Blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy , and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it , because the time is near .
JOHN , to the seven churches in the province of Asia : " Revelation 1:1 - 4 " I , JOHN , your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in Jesus , was on the island of Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus .
On the Lord 's Day I was in the Spirit , and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet , which said :  Write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches : to Ephesus , Smyrna , Pergamum , Thyatira , Sardis , Philadelphia and Laodicea .  "
Revelation 1:9-11
" I , JOHN , am the one who heard and saw these things .
And when I had heard and seen them , I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing them to me . "
Revelation 22:8
Hence , Revelation provides independent attestation that the first Christians clearly believed that Jesus was a descendant of David .
Note for instance what John also wrote here :
" Then one of the elders said to me ,  Do not weep !
See , the Lion of the tribe OF JUDAH , THE ROOT OF DAVID , has triumphed .
He is able to open the scroll and its seven seals .  "
Revelation 5:5
John is nt the only one to claim that Jesus was from the tribe of Judah :
" For it is clear that our Lord descended from Judah , and in regard to that tribe Moses said nothing about priests . "
Hebrews 7:14
It is the consistent testimony of the Scriptures , starting from the earliest Gospel tradition , that Jesus is a son of David :
" Then they came to Jericho .
As Jesus and his disciples , together with a large crowd , were leaving the city , a blind man , Bartimaeus ( that is , the Son of Timaeus ) , was sitting by the roadside begging .
When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to shout ,  Jesus , Son of David , have mercy on me !
Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet , but he shouted all the more ,  Son of David , have mercy on me !  "
Mark 10:46 - 48
" David said about him :  I saw the Lord always before me .
Because he is at my right hand , I will not be shaken .
Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices ; my body also will live in hope , because you will not abandon me to the grave , nor will you let your Holy One see decay .
You have made known to me the paths of life ; you will fill me with joy in your presence .
Brothers , I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried , and his tomb is here to this day .
But he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place ONE OF HIS DESCENDANTS on his throne .
Seeing what was ahead , he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ , that he was not abandoned to the grave , nor did his body see decay . "
Acts 2:25 -31 " Remember Jesus Christ , raised from the dead , descended from David .
This is my gospel ... "
2 Timothy 2:8
SBW erroneously claims :
This creates a serious dilemma for Christians , since according to their own New Testament , Jesus is NOT of the seed of David , through Joseph ; who by the way was not Jesus biological father , and was of line of David .
Whereas the " Holy Ghost " is a spirit without blood and flesh .
Readers must know that Mary was a Levite and not from the house of David .
In fact Mary was from the house of Aaron , thus , " according to the flesh " could not have been referring to Mary 's flesh because she was not from David 's line .
We read in Luke 1:5 ( Readers are advised to read the complete chapter ) !
1:5 THERE was in the days of Herod , the king of Judaea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the course of Abia : and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth .
The above facts from the Bible , undeniably proves that Paul LIED , Jesus is NOT the Seed of David .
RESPONSE :
First , SBW erroneously thinks that Jesus can only be a descendant of David through Joseph , but fails to tell us why he cant be one through his mother Mary .
Second , NOWHERE DOES THE NT TEACH THAT MARY WAS A LEVITE .
The passage cited by SBW is referring to Elizabeth , Zechariahs wife , NOT MARY !
SBW seems to have erroneously concluded that since Elizabeth is said to be Marys relative , the latter therefore must have also been a Levite :
" Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age ... "
Luke 1:36
All this passage proves is that Elizabeth had Judean blood in her , since Levites were allowed to marry women from any of the twelve tribes :
" The woman he ( the Levitical Priests ) marries must be a virgin .
He must not marry a widow , a divorced woman , or a woman defiled by prostitution , but only a virgin from his own people . "
Leviticus 21:13-14
Ezekiel , in his vision of a restored priesthood and temple , further clarifies this point :
" They shall not marry a widow or a divorced woman , but only virgins of the offspring OF THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL , or a widow who is the widow of a priest . "
Ezekiel 44:22 ESV
The Holy Bible even provides an example of a priest who had married a woman from Judea , who was actually a descendant of king David :
" Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead , she arose and destroyed all the royal family of the house of Judah .
But Jehoshabeath , the daughter of the king , took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king 's sons who were about to be put to death , and she put him and his nurse in a bedroom .
Thus Jehoshabeath , the daughter of King Jehoram and wife of Jehoiada the priest , because she was a sister of Ahaziah , hid him from Athaliah , so that she did not put him to death . "
2 Chronicles 22:10-11
The foregoing demonstrates the plausibility of Elizabeth 's mother being from the line of David , from the tribe of Judah , accounting for her being related to Mary .
Third , the noncanonical Apocryphal writings provide further attestation that Christians considered Mary to be of Davidic stock , not of Levitical descent .
From the Gospel of the Nativity of Mary , Chapter 1 :
The blessed and glorious ever - virgin Mary , sprung from the royal stock and family of David ... ( http://wesley.nnu.edu/noncanon/gospels/natmary.htm)
From the Protevangelium of James , X.1 :
" Now there was a council of the priests , and they said : Let us make a veil for the temple of the Lord .
And the priest said : Call unto me pure virgins of the tribe of David .
And the officers departed and sought and found seven virgins .
And the priests called to mind the child Mary , that she was of the tribe of David and was undefiled before God : " ( http://wesley.nnu.edu/noncanon/gospels/gosjames.htm)
Fourth , EVEN MUSLIM SCHOLARS ADMIT THAT MARY WAS FROM THE HOUSE OF DAVID !
For instance , noted Muslim historian Al - Tabari goes so far as to " borrow " Matthews genealogy of Jesus and links Mary to David !
The Persians assert that sixty - five years after Alexander seized Babylonia , and fifty - one years after Arsacid rule began , Mary the daughter of  Imran gave birth to Jesus .
But the Christians assert that Jesus was born to her 303 years after Alexander conquered Babylonia , and that John the Baptist was born six months before Jesus .
They report that Mary was pregnant with Jesus when she was thirteen years old .
They also report that Jesus lived thirty - two years and a few days before his ascension , and that Mary lived six more years after his ascension , altogether over fifty years .
They assert that John and Jesus met in the Jordan River when Jesus was thirty years of age , and that John was slain before the ascension of Jesus .
Zechariah b. Berechiah , the father of Yahya b. Zechariah , and  Imran b. Matthan , the father of Mary , were married to two sisters .
One was married to Zechariah - she was the mother of John , the other was with  Imran b. Matthan , and she was the mother of Mary .
 Imran b.
Matthan died when the mother of Mary was pregnant with her .
When Mary was born , Zechariah provided for her after her mothers death , because her aunt , the sister of her mother , was with him .
The name of Marys mother was Hanna bt .
Faqud b. Qabil ; the name of the sister of Marys mother , that is , the name of Johns mother was Elizabeth bt .
Faqud .
Zechariah provided for Mary , and she was engaged to Joseph b. Jacob b. Mathan b. Eleazar b. Eliud b. Achim b. Zadok b. Azor b. Eliakim b. Abiud b. Zerubbabel , b. Shealtiel b. Jechonia b. Josiah b. Amon b. Manasseh b. Hezekiah b. Ahaziah b. Jotham b. Uzziah b. Joram b. Jehosaphat b. Asa b. Abijah b. REHOBOAM b. SOLOMON b. DAVID .
According to Ibn Humayd - Salamah - Ibn Ishaq :
As far as I could learn from her lineage , Mary was the daughter of  Imran b. Josiah b. Amon b. Manasse b. Hezekiah b. Ahaziah b. Jotham b. Azariah b. Amaziah b. Joash b. Ahaziah b. Joram b. Jehosaphat b. Asa b. Abijah b. REHOBOAM b. SOLOMON .
( The History of al - Tabari Volume IV - The Ancient Kingdom , Moshe Perlman trans .
[ The State University of New York Press ; Albany , 1987 ] , pp. 103-104 ; bold emphasis ours )
Hence , al - Tabari clearly states that both Joseph AND MARY were descendants of King David .
The other classical Muslim scholars shared al - Tabaris view regarding Marys ancestry :
The Quran informs us that the father of Mary was named  Imran and the classical Muslim scholars UNANIMOUSLY ACCEPT that she was from the line of the prophet David ...
Differences of opinion emerge , however , over the intervening genealogy , most probably due to a lack of familiarity with such foreign names and consequent error in recording them in the Arabic orthography .
According to the Spanish exegete al - Qurtubi ,  All these differences are mentioned because the Prophets and Messengers are all descendants one of the other . 
The following genealogy ( taking into account orthographic variations ) , which is attributed to Ibn Ishaq or directly to the Prophets ... companion Ibn  Abbas , is the most generally accepted : Mary bint  Imran ibn Yashim ibn Misha ibn Hazqiya ibn Yawish ( ibn Isha ibn Yahushafat ) IBN SULAYMAN IBN DAWUD ...
Although the name of her mother is not supplied in the Quran , it is universally accepted as Hanna bint Faqudh .
( Source : Aliah Schleifer , Mary The Blessed Virgin of Islam , Fons Vitae ; ISBN : 1887752021 ; July 1 , 1998 , pp. 22-23 )
One such scholar was Ibn Kathir who wrote in reference to Sura 19:16 that :
< And mention in the Book , Maryam , >
She was Maryam bint ` Imran from the family lineage of Dawud .
She was from a good and wholesome family of the Children of Israel .
Allah mentioned the story of her mother 's pregnancy with her in Surah Al `Imran , and that she ( Maryam 's mother ) dedicated her freely for the service of Allah .
This meant that she dedicated the child ( Maryam ) to the service of the Masjid of the Sacred House ( in Jerusalem ) .
Thus , they ( Zakariyya , Maryam 's mother and Maryam ) were similar in that aspect .

It is quite clear that Paul wasnt lying , but was faithfully and accurately reporting Jesus lineage , a lineage which he inherited from his biological mother Mary .

Congressman Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) , is a member of an influential evangelical network in Washington , D.C. known as " The Family . "
The network has very close ties to both Parliamentarians and the President in Uganda , who are currently championing an Anti-Homosexuality
Bill that will result in gay people being sentenced to death in Uganda .
Among other provisions , the Anti-Homosexuality Bill will imprison straight allies of gay people , imprison anyone who talks favorably about same - sex marriage , imprison parents who do n't out their gay or lesbian children , and murder any gay people who are caught in what the government considers " aggravated homosexuality . "
Rep . Stupak has clear connections to " The Family , " and " The Family " has clear connections to politicians in Uganda championing this draconian anti-gay legislation .
It 's time for Rep. Stupak to clearly come out against Uganda 's Anti-Homosexuality Bill , and repudiate any involvement by U.S. evangelicals abroad that could result in the murder or imprisonment of people because of their sexual orientation .
This petition will be sent to Congressman Bart Stupak , as well as his Chief of Staff , Scott Schloegel .
Poor Demon 's Souls players .
You guys sure do have it tough .
Publisher Atlus has decided one of the hardest games this generation is n't hard enough , apparently .
Starting on Halloween day , the game 's enemies will be stronger , but the rewards will be greater for the players online .
Aram Jabbari , Manager of PR offered up these words of warning .
" Early reports from the Kingdom of Boletaria indicate that the Old One 's power grows , " said Aram .
" We 've discovered that the nefarious Demon will seek to descend the land in pure blackness on All Hallow 's Eve .
His minions will be more powerful , but the rewards for those who seek to challenge them will be greater as well .

STUTTGART , Germany 
The clash between builders and preservationists is as old as architecture itself , but it reached a fever pitch in the recent gilded age .
And it is especially fraught in Germany , where the construction boom that began with the country ’s reunification sometimes seems like a convenient tool for smoothing over unpleasant historical truths .
Few current projects better illustrate this conflict than Stuttgart 21 , a plan to build an enormous new railway station , along with 37 miles of underground track , in the heart of this old industrial city .
The $ 7 billion development , which is expected to be approved by the end of the year , is part of an ever - expanding high - speed train network that planners hope will one day link the entire continent .
As one of the largest developments in Europe , it could radically transform the city center .
But the design shows a callous disregard for architectural history .
Its construction would require the partial destruction of one of the city ’s most recognizable landmarks : the Hauptbahnhof , Paul Bonatz ’s Stuttgart central rail terminal , a monument of early German Modernism built from 1914 to 1928 .
And in a particularly perverse gesture of “ facadism ”  a favorite tactic of bureaucrats and developers in which a few architectural elements are preserved while the rest of a structure is bulldozed  it would leave the station ’s main hall and tower standing like some architectural amputee .

for an update on typhoon parma( pepeng ) and typhoon melor , CLICK HERE
While Typhoon Parma made its way through the Philippines , it took out crops and infrastructure and produced damage in some of the towns and cities , but so far only 3 have been reported killed .
Some reports around the world claim that the storm is moving toward Taiwan .
Taiwan has even issued warnings and made evacuations .
But , I ’m not so sure that Parma is done with the Philippines .
A look at the Western Pacific Water Vapor Imagery Loop shows appears to show an eye reforming .
The official forecast from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center has been all over the place , indicating that there are lots and lots of variables .
Previously , we ’ve seen the long term track toward Taiwan , then to the northeast , then having it become quasi stationary just northwest of Manila , then having it move north - northwest before looping back around in the wake of Typhoon Melor ( JTWC Discussion ) and out to the northeast .
The new forecast reflects the fact that the storm has moved offshore to the north of the island and has been moving west or west northwest very slowly .
The idea is that the storm will meander offshore of the northwestern coast of the Philippines .
The boys at the JTWC acknowledge that the forecast is very difficult and acknowledge that there are other plausible scenarios .
Its extremely complicated because there is a typhoon to the east , a storm to the west , a ridge to the north and somewhere in between , there is a trof .
While I have no idea where its going to go , I think that it is entirely possible that the Philippines is not done with Parma .
If you look at the US Navy NOGAPS model , you see that at 18 Z Oct 5 , the storm is centered just west of Manila … offshore .
That would bring rain to the islands .
The GFS has the storm right over Manila at the same time .
The NOGAPS brings Parma right over the top of Manila at 18 Z on the 6th .
There are other solutions out there but most of them are not too good for the Philippines .
In fact , if the GFS solution verifies , which is probably wo n’t completely , then Japan would get brushed by Typhoon Melor and then 3 days later get brushed by Typhoon Parma .. both running right along the mouth of Tokyo Bay .
But … these storms have not been playing ball and all options remain on the table .

1. FOR METEOROLOGISTS .
2. 12 HOUR SUMMARY AND ANALYSIS .
A. TYPHOON 19W ( PARMA ) , LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 250 NM NORTH OF
MANILA , PHILIPPINES , HAS TRACKED WESTWARD AT 07 KNOTS OVER
THE PAST SIX HOURS .
THE SYSTEM HAS MOVED BACK OVER WATER IN THE
STRAIT OF LUZON AND HAS STARTED TO REGAIN ORGANIZATION AS SEEN IN
RECENT ANIMATED MULTISPECTRAL
IMAGERY .
A 032224Z SSMI 37GHZ IMAGE
SHOWS THE LOW LEVEL WITH GOOD STRUCTURE AND AN EYE -LIKE FEATURE OVER
WATER TO THE NORTHWEST OF LUZON .
THE SYSTEM IS LOCATED UNDER AN
UPPER -LEVEL RIDGE AXIS THAT IS PROVIDING EXCELLENT WESTWARD AND
EQUATORWARD OUTFLOW .
THE SYSTEM IS IN A RELATIVELY WEAK STEERING
ENVIRONMENT UNDER THE INFLUENCES OF THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE ( STR )
CENTER LOCATED TO THE NORTHEAST .
3. FORECAST REASONING
A. THE FORECAST PHILOSOPHY HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE
PREVIOUS PROGNOSTIC REASONING BULLETIN .
THE FORECAST HAS THE STR
OVER SOUTHERN CHINA BECOMING THE PREDOMINATE STEERING INFLUENCE ON
THE SYSTEM AFTER TAU 72 AND TRACKING THE 19W INTO THE SOUTH CHINA
SEA .
B. THE SYSTEM WILL SLOWLY DRIFT NORTHWESTWARD INTO THE LUZON
STRAIT AS THE STR TO THE NORTHEAST , LOCATED SOUTH OF JAPAN , ERODES
IN ADVANCE OF A MIDLATITUDE TROUGH .
THIS WILL LEAVE TY 19W IN A VERY
WEAK STEERING ENVIRONMENT , REMOVED FROM THE INFLUENCES OF THE STR TO
THE NORTHEAST AND THE STR LOCATED TO THE NORTHWEST OVER SOUTHERN
CHINA .
DUE TO THE LACK OF STEERING FLOW , THE SYSTEM WILL REMAIN
QUASI -STATIONARY THROUGH TAU 72 AND THE GENERALLY FAVORABLE
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
WILL FACILITATE FURTHER INTENSIFICATION .
HOWEVER , INTENSIFICATION
WILL BE LIMITED DUE TO UPWELLING OF COOLER
WATER , WHICH IS TYPICAL OF SLOW - MOVING SYSTEMS .
MODEL GUIDANCE SHOWS
VERY ERRATIC MOVEMENT OF THE SYSTEM THROUGH TAU 72 .
THIS IS
INDICATIVE OF A SYSTEM WITH WEAK STEERING INFLUENCES THAT IS
EXPECTED TO MEANDER AIMLESSLY .
THE ONLY MODEL THAT DOES NOT SHOW
THIS MOTION IS GFS , WHICH SUPPORTS STRENGTHENING OF THE STR TO THE
EAST AND A SHARP TURN AND ACCELERATION TO THE NORTHEAST BEHIND TY
20W . A TURN TO THE NORTHEAST IS STILL A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TRACK ,
ESPECIALLY IF THERE IS BINARY INTERACTION WITH THE APPROACHING TY
20W FROM THE EAST , BUT BECOMING MORE UNLIKELY AS 19W CONTINUES TO
TRACK NORTHWESTWARD .
C. AFTER TAU 72 , THE STR OVER CHINA IS EXPECTED TO BUILD AFTER
THE PASSAGE OF A ZONAL TROUGH IN THE MIDLATITUDES .
AS IT BUILDS , IT
WILL IMPART A WEAK INFLUENCE ON 19W THAT WILL SLOWLY DRAG THE SYSTEM
TO THE WEST INTO THE SOUTH CHINA SEA .
AS THE SYSTEM MOVES TO THE
WEST , AVAILABLE OCEAN HEAT CONTENT WILL DECREASE AND NOT BE ABLE TO
SUPPORT A SLOW MOVING TYPHOON , AND INTENSITY WILL START TO SLOWLY
DECREASE IN THE LATE PERIOD .
MODEL GUIDANCE IS IN POOR AGREEMENT
AFTER TAU 72 AS TO THE ACTUAL TRACK OF THE SYSTEM .
ECMWF , TCLPS AND
JGSM TAKE THE SYSTEM ON A MORE SOUTHWESTERLY TRACK AND EGRR AND
GFDN TAKE THE STORM ON A WESTERLY TRACK .
NOGAPS KEEPS THE SYSTEM
QUASI -STATIONARY THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD .//

Decorations
There are so many choices when it comes to the decorations for a Disney themed party .
If you are going to have both genders , make sure you go with something neutral .
You do n’t want to go with princess decorations if you will have boys there !
The good thing about such a concept is there are plenty that work well for both boys and girls to enjoy .
Consider a variety of items too for them to use .
For example , you can get Princess plates and cups as well as Cars ones .
Then the guests can pick what they would like to use .
It can help you appease everyone in attendance !
Events
Think about fun activities and events you can offer for the guests at your Disney themed party .
Try to center them around the various Disney books and movies too .
You can be creative with what you offer or you can look online for some great ideas .
You can get some help too if you hire people to come dressed in costumes and to help with various activities .
In fact , they may have a variety of them you can pick from that they will set up at the event .
It is going to save you time and money to allow them to do this part of the entertaining at your Disney themed party .
They are used to hosting such events so they are able to pick up on what is going well and what they need to modify for the guests .
Hiring such professionals to help you with the outcome of the event is a very good idea .
It can help you to reduce stress and to really be part of what is taking place .
Rather than rushing around doing this and that , you can engage with your guests and be part of those activities too .
This can be a great way to encourage you to host future parties , once you see the fun side of it !
Food
Make sure you offer plenty of food and drinks for all the guests at your Disney themed party .
You want them to have fun , to fill up on great food items , and to rave about what a great event it was .
In fact , you may decide to host this annually and make it a tradition due to it being such a hit .
Consider foods that are easy for guests to eat as they move around and have a great time .
You can offer a full meal or just snack food items .
You can offer delicious and tempting dessert items too .
You have complete control over the food and drinks so have some fun being creative with it .
You can use Disney cookie cutters to help you shape common items into something that is directly related to your party idea .
Costume Contest
If you ask your guests to come in costume to the Disney themed party , hold a contest by age group for them .
Offer some great prizes as a way to say thank you for taking part in the fun .
All of your guests are going to leave this party with a smile on their face .
They are going to be talking about it for a long time .
You will feel great too , knowing you hosted such as success !
( CNN ) -- Militants who control parts of Somalia 's capital city are beating women in broad daylight for violating their radical brand of Islamic law , according to local officials and witnesses in Mogadishu .
" Just today , Al - Shabaab dispatched men with whips to the streets around Bakara market and they are flogging any woman who is found not wearing socks , " according to a female maize trader at the Mogadishu market , who spoke Thursday .
She did not want to be named for security reasons .
In the past two days , more than 130 people , including women who were not wearing headscarves and men chewing dried khat leaves , have been detained for violating Al - Shabaab 's interpretation of sharia , or Islamic law , according to witnesses and officials .
Hooded Al - Shabaab gunmen rounded up 50 women on Wednesday from Mogadishu's Bakara market for not wearing the veil that is required for women under some interpretations of Islamic law , according to the maize trader .
" Most of these women were vegetable traders , so they are poor and can't afford to buy veils for 600,000 shillings [ about $ 23 U.S. ] , " she said .
She said she saw more women being detained Thursday .
Another 80 Somali civilians were detained in the southwestern town of Luuq , near the Kenyan and Ethiopian border , " because they turned deaf ear to orders we imposed on the town , " said the local Al - Shabaab commander Sheikh Hussien al - Iraqi .
Al - Shabaab is considered a terrorist organization by the United States because of its ties to Osama bin Laden 's al Qaeda network .
It has been imposing stricter rules on Somali civilians living in the areas it controls .
Earlier this month , Al - Shabaab militants whipped women for wearing bras in an area of northern Mogadishu that they control , shocking residents who have been besieged by the ongoing insurgency .
The militants believe the female undergarments are a deception to men .
Sigmund Freud may have spoken for all men when he famously told his disciple Marie Bonaparte : " The great question that has never been answered and which I have not yet been able to answer , despite my 30 years of research into the feminine soul , is , What does a woman want ? "
Sadly , the princess 's reply went unrecorded .
Then again , Princess Bonaparte was renowned for her frigidity , so perhaps she was the wrong person to ask .
If a genius like Freud remained stumped by the elusiveness of women 's desires , what makes the rest of us think we can figure it out ?
Vanity , perhaps .
Then again , we have access to something Freud did n't have : Match.com .
After months of intensive analysis of the profiles of the women on Match.com , I am naïve enough to think I have a pretty good idea what women want .
And , if I am right , it may turn out that Freud was over - thinking , that he was unnecessarily complicating something that is rather basic , and that the secret of what women want is not so profound and obscure as we think .
Women , like men , want different things at different stages of their lives .
Because I am in my mid-40s , I was interested in looking at single women between the ages of 34 - 44 .
This is generally the age when single women begin to get serious about a relationship , if not downright panicky .
That does n't mean she is ready to settle for just anybody , however .
I was immediately struck by the similarity of the profiles on Match .
Most women seemed to want the same things , employed the same language , read the same Oprah Book Club books , and were seeking the same mythological ubermensch .
They were all " honest , " " easy going , " " independent , " and " enjoying life to the fullest . "
They enjoyed " fulfilling " careers in marketing or pharmaceutical sales , and they were all at a good place in their lives , though they would n't mind a male companion with whom to go ice climbing up the north face of an Alaskan glacier .
They all loved sushi , baseball games , and any event where you stand in line for a half - hour for a thimbleful of wine .
Basically , they are a composite of one woman whom we 'll call Miss Match .
Miss Match is a deeply spiritual person .
She is either a passionate Christian or is " spiritual , but not religious , " having rejected traditional gods in favor of some vague sort of life force .
Miss Match has at least one dog , usually a mix of something and a poodle , and she loves horses , though , thank God , she can't afford one .
It is no coincidence that nearly all of the women on Match describe themselves as outdoorsy .
And by outdoorsy they do n't just mean they enjoy a day at the beach .
From reading their profiles you would think the Bataan Death March would be their ideal holiday : day after day of tramping through a tropical jungle .
Besides countless photographs of dogs , Miss Match 's profile is littered with photos of her scuba diving and skydiving .
Admittedly , I found this confusing .
Are these women trying to say they are vacuous thrill - seekers like the idiots on Jackass ?
Or was this a subtle warning to couch potatoes : " Be prepared to get your lazy butt off the sofa and into a parachute ? "
Actually , the fortysomething female fixation on outdoor adventures is quite understandable .
Most of the women you find on Match.com sit in a cubicle 40 - plus hours a week staring at a spreadsheet .
It is only natural they would desire to be outside on the weekend , if for no other reason than their bodies are starved for vitamin D .
As it happens , a lot more men spend their work week outdoors .
Hence a weekend al fresco does not hold the same fascination for men .
What 's more , maintaining that she " loves the outdoors " is Miss Match 's subtle way of saying she is not a domestic .
Few women will come right out and say they do not like to cook and that they loathe the role of homemaker .
After all , rule number one on Match is : " Do n't Be Negative . "
What 's more , Miss Match knows she is competing against women 20 years her junior , people who do not have to jump out of airplanes to demonstrate their fertility .
Miss
Match is simply trying to say that while she may be 44 , she is not yet ready for her wheelchair .
But before all those potential Mr. Matches get the notion that she is just some reckless tomboy who never grew up , Miss Match slams on the brakes and reveals that she is a well - rounded , classy dame : " The real gems are the beauty and peace found in nature , but I also enjoy the lights and sounds of city - life , " she waxes poetically .
" I honestly love both and can easily go from getting my hands dirty on a multi-day backpack trip to dressing up for a night on the town . "
So who is Miss Match 's ideal match ?
Easy , she wants the male model on the cover of Men 's Health magazine , assuming he is straight and without flaws and as compassionate as the Dalai Lama .
He must be funny , but his humor cannot be overly dry or sarcastic .
His glass is always half full , his outlook always sunny , and he is optimistic .
He is in great shape , with six - pack abs , though he is not in the least obsessed with his body .
If he is not a Christian , he is " spiritual , but not religious . "
He is financially secure , a leader of men , but he knows family comes first .
He has season tickets for the hometown sports teams , but you will never find Mr. Match sitting in front of the TV in his boxer shorts Sunday afternoon watching football and swilling canned beer .
And did I say he must love dogs ?
He is " that guy who can stargaze in the middle of the Ozark Mountain Trail or from the rooftop of Vin de Set . "
Nothing ever flusters Mr. Match .
There is no obstacle too high he cannot overcome .
He never complains , never whines .
When life throws him a curve , he knocks it out of the park .
When life hands him lemons , well , you know .
He is , of course , a bachelor , but not because he fears commitment or prefers to play the field , but rather because he has been focusing on his career and has yet to meet Miss Match .
Or he is divorced , tragically , but he never says an unkind word about his ex-wife .
Despite his rough , chiseled masculine good lucks he knows how to be tender and soft .
He knows how a woman wants to be treated and touched .
Amazingly , he never says a stupid word .
And he is curiously attracted to fortysomething girls who jump out of airplanes .
Needless to say , my immersion into the world of Match.com left me feeling somewhat depressed .
I still do n't believe most women like going to baseball games ( except maybe to people - watch or to be seen ) , nor do I believe that given the choice between strolling around the mall or scaling an ice cliff that they would choose the latter .
If Freud were to ask me what women want , I think I would have to reply that they want a man that does not exist .
In their feverish obsession not to settle , women have excluded perhaps 90 percent of men who , in one way or another , do not make the cut .
Rwanda Joins Commonwealth of Nations
Rwanda became the 54th member of the Commonwealth of Nations ending a six - year bid .
It is the second nation to join the organization that was not a former member of the British Empire after Mozambique joined November 1995 .
The admission was announced at the end of a biannual summit of the body in Trinidad and Tobago .
It came just a few days after Saint Vincent and the Grenadines attempted to leave the Commonwealth Realms .
The Commonwealth is not a political union , but an intergovernmental organization through which countries with diverse social , political and economic backgrounds are regarded as equal in status .
The head of the commonwealth is ceremonially held by the British monarch , currently Queen Elizabeth II .
Rwanda was a former colony of France , which incidentally restored ties with Rwanda on the very same day it was admitted to the organization .
France severed ties with the former colony in 2006 after France included Rwandan President Paul Kagame in the investigation of the African nation ’s 1994 genocide .

Uganda considers death sentence for gay sex in bill before parliament
www.guardian.co.uk
( Beware the leftist spin ) ^ | Sunday 29 November 2009 | Xan Rice
Posted on by USALiberty
As a gay Ugandan , Frank Mugisha has endured insults from strangers , hate messages on his phone , police harassment and being outed in a tabloid as one of the country 's " top homos " .
That may soon seem like the good old days .
Life imprisonment is the minimum punishment for anyone convicted of having gay sex , under an anti-homosexuality bill currently before Uganda 's parliament .
If the accused person is HIV positive or a serial offender , or a " person of authority " over the other partner , or if the " victim " is under 18 , a conviction will result in the death penalty .
Members of the public are obliged to report any homosexual activity to police with 24 hours or risk up to three years in jail  a scenario that human rights campaigners say will result in a witchhunt .
Ugandans breaking the new law abroad will be subject to extradition requests .

I agree .
I rate homosexuality as a perversion , an unnatural act , and a practice that is detrimental to any society , but I dont believe people should be executed for it .
And this proviso that people who refuse to inform on them be subject to imprisonment is frankly very frightening .

“ As a gay Ugandan , Frank Mugisha has endured insults from strangers ... ” I could n’t get past this lead .
How did “ strangers ” know he was a gay man ?
And if he did n’t like the insults , why did n’t he do something so that “ strangers ” would have no idea what his “ preference ” is ?
I do n’t know the answers to these questions , because I ’m not going to read beyond such an absurd lead , because it is a continuation of the PC brainwashing .
We are supposed to assume that the homosexuals ’ sexuality is a state / condition known to all , even strangers , but never noticed or acknowledged , and that it should receive no undue attention , other than being celebrated .
That is how schizophrenic the anti-establishment radicals are making society .

As Wikipedia admits , Uganda “ is one of the rare AIDS success stories . ”
The largest religious group in the country is Roman Catholics , followed by Anglicans and other Protestants .
About 12 % are Muslim .
Success in reducing AIDS basically depends on sexual abstinence .
Condom distribution is a sure - fire method for spreading AIDS .
There was a similar statistical history in the Phillipines , also mostly a Catholic country .

Gay rights had the potential to destroy civilisation , as the west could soon find out , he said .

Truth is , I do n't have a problem with the penalties associated with perversion in their country .
Diversity , dude , that 's what is important these days .
I got the memo .
I 'm just waiting for the inevitable bashing these guys will get from all of the liberal " human rights " groups who would similarly be righteously outraged if a real American as much as voiced approval of such a policy .
You know , the way they always attack the Saudis and the Iranians and pretty much everybody associated with Islam for such savage and uncivilized behavior .

BBC journalist John Sweeney also lost his composure , while making a documentary for Panorama on Scientology .
The presenter became increasingly irate at the behaviour of the Scientologist he was interviewing , and shouted furiously on screen .
Mr Sweeney later said : " If you are interested in becoming a TV journalist , it is a fine example of how not to do it .
I look like an exploding tomato and shout like a jet engine and every time I see it makes me cringe . "
For the bar - headed goose , migration is a high - altitude adventure .
Spring and fall it flies between Central Asia and India , a route that takes it over the highest mountains in the world , the Himalayas .
The bird has been known to reach altitudes of 30,000 feet .
At such heights , the air is so thin that there ’s only about a quarter of the oxygen available at sea level .
Yet the goose is able to sustain the level of O2 consumption  10 to 20 times normal  needed for flapping flight .

Hyde Park originally belonged to the Canons of Westminster Abbey until the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s .
King Henry VIII appropriated it for himself in order to be a hunting ground , and deer and wild boar were kept in the Park for his hunting pleasure .
It stayed a hunting ground from 1536 until James I , came to the throne and decided to allow some public access .
James I appointed a park ranger to be in charge of Hyde Park and to run it .
Charles I later opened the Park to the general public most of the time in 1637 .
He also built The Ring , near where the Serpentine Boat Houses are at the moment .
In the year of the Great Plague of London , 1665 , Hyde Park became a kind of refugee camp .
People from the City of London and from Westminster left their homes , afraid of the plague , and camped in Hyde Park .
William III , who ruled in conjunction with his wife Queen Mary II , elder daughter of James II , decided to live in Kensington Palace .
He decided that the walk from Kensington to the Government Centre at St James was unsafe , and made an artificially lit road between the two places .
This is the road now known as Rotton Row , which is thought to be a corruption of the French “ route de Roi ” , or the " road of the King " .
George II , and his wife , Queen Caroline , created the Serpentine .
This is the lake in the middle of Hyde Park which stretches over to Kensington Gardens , and results from the damming of the River Westbourne .
The Lido , an open air swimming pool , was built by the Commissioner of Royal Parks Works in 1930 , and the current Boat Houses were completed at about the same time .
After years of continuing miniaturization , it appears that Nintendo has seen the benefits of ‘ going large ’ .
The DSi XL launched in Japan at the weekend , offering significantly larger screens along with a larger , pen-like stylus .
The system was announced less than a month before going on sale , and seems to be targeted at older gamers who might have trouble using the regular DSi ’s 3.25 inch screens .
The XL ( known as the DSi LL in Japan , where LL is shorthand for ‘ extra large ’ ) boasts 4.2 inch screens and is significantly larger and heavier than the DSi , weighing in at a hefty 314 grams ( compared with the DSi ’s svelte 214 grams ) .
The three available colour schemes – Wine Red , Dark Brown and Natural White – certainly seem to indicate that Nintendo is aiming the XL at a more mature audience , although there were few silver - haired early adopters in the Akihabara queues .
Results of last month 's election have been released piecemeal Latest results from Afghanistan 's presidential election show President Hamid Karzai with 54.1 % of the vote after 92 % of polling stations declared .
The results push President Karzai past the 50 % threshold needed to avoid a run-off with rival Abdullah Abdullah .
But the figures were thrown into doubt by the UN - backed election complaints commission ordering a number of recounts and audits of votes .
It warned that it had found " clear and convincing evidence of fraud " .
The 20 August election has been overshadowed by claims against all the main candidates of fraud and ballot - box stuffing .
ANALYSIS James Robbins , BBC diplomatic correspondent
When the polls closed in Afghanistan almost three weeks ago , political and military leaders in London and Washington breathed a sigh of relief .
Violence had failed to prevent healthy turnouts in most areas .
One hurdle cleared .
But the real test set by the international community was the credibility of the results , as well as the process - and that is now in real doubt .
If fraud could actually have swung the result , and that 's still unclear , questions over the entire mission in Afghanistan will intensify , particularly because Britain and the US have both suffered record numbers of soldiers killed in recent weeks .
A credible election result was seen as a key objective for the West , as it continues its campaign against the Taliban .
The latest results came in from the south , where President Karzai enjoys strong support .
The Independent Election Commission ( IEC ) said that Abdullah Abdullah remained second , with 28.3 % of the vote .
However , it said it had " quarantined " results from 600 polling stations where it suspects irregularities .
The list of those stations has been sent to the complaints commission ( ECC ) .
Mr Abdullah claimed the move vindicated his decision to raise fears of fraud shortly after the election and said announcement of the results should have been delayed in light of these suspicions .
" I think [ the ] real outcome , after seeing the complaints , will be quite different from what you have seen today , " he said .
Announcing the results before the allegations had been investigated broke the rules of the electoral process , he claimed .
Earlier , the ECC said a recount and inspection should be done for any polling station where 600 or more votes were cast , or where any single candidate got more than 95 % of votes .
It was the first time the ECC had gone public with accusations of fraud .
AFGHAN POLL FRAUD 8 Sep : Poll complaints body orders some recounts nationwide 8 Sep : IEC says votes from 600 polling stations " quarantined " 3 Sep : Claims 30,000 fraudulent votes cast for Karzai in Kandahar 30 Aug : 2,000 fraud allegations are probed ; 600 deemed serious 20 Aug : Election day and claims 80,000 ballots were filled out fraudulently for Karzai in Ghazni 18 Aug : Ballot cards sold openly and voter bribes offered
Election : Main fraud allegations Afghanistan 's future in peril Discontent simmers in north Merkel regrets Afghan raid deaths Commission chairman Grant Kippen said it was not known how many polling stations this would involve .
He said investigations conducted in Ghazni , Paktika and Kandahar found " clear evidence of irregularity " within polling stations and ballot boxes .
" We decided based on those investigations ... that we would order the IEC to conduct an audit and recount of polling stations around the country . "
Results from a number of polling stations showed President Karzai winning 100 % of the vote .
The BBC's Chris Morris in Kabul says recounts could strip President Karzai of many votes .
Although the likelihood is that President Karzai will emerge the victor , how much legitimacy and credibility that victory has will be another question , our correspondent says .
An IEC official told the BBC that although final provisional results will be announced on Saturday , the recounts could take a long time .
The ECC may also have to investigate and rule on further complaints of irregularities , which could lead to more delays , the official said .
Mark Urban :
No closure yet IEC chief electoral officer Daoud Ali Najafi said it could take two to three months to comply with the ECC 's audit and recount order .
Analysts say that a second round of voting , if needed , would be difficult to hold beyond the end of October because of Afghanistan 's extreme weather .
The election results have been released piecemeal by the IEC .
The previous figures , released on Sunday , gave Mr Karzai 48.6 % of the vote against 31.7 % for Mr Abdullah .
Last month 's election day was marred by more than 400 Taliban attacks , including against voters whom the insurgents had warned not to turn out .
The US is considering whether to send thousands more troops to the country , where violence has hit a record high eight years after the US - led invasion .

Several days ago , Ender and I were discussing the merits of the 2007 - 08 Edmonton Oilers .
The conversation started around whether or not the offer sheet to Dustin Penner in the summer of 2007 was a good idea but we ended up touching on a wide variety of things throughout the conversation .
One of those things was my idea that the Oilers employed too many rookies that season .
They had seven different players who played 60 games that season who had n't played 60 career NHL games when the year began .
That struck me as being a very large number and it was one of the reasons that I thought the Oilers were a bad team that year .
In this post I 'm going to look at how many of these kinds of players have been employed by NHL teams since the lockout .
Is seven a large number , or are there actually lots of teams who play that many rookies all year long ?
What 's normal ?
This is an attempt to begin to answer that question using some pretty specific criteria , namely , how many players did teams have in the lineup for 60 regular season games over one season who had n't yet had 60 regular season games of NHL experience .
To make the post easier to write , I 'll be referring to those players as rookies from here on in .
The results are in and I was correct that the Oilers of 2007 - 08 were anomalous .
No other team in the four years since the lockout employed seven or more rookies .
As you 'd expect , there were a lot more rookies in the year immediately after the lockout and yet none of those teams employed as many rookies as the Oilers did in 2007 - 08 .
In fact , only four teams ( two in 2005 - 06 , two in the three subsequent years ) employed more than four .
The following chart gives us a pretty good idea of what 's normal :
Excluding the year after the lockout , it looks lik most teams wil employ one or two rookies , though 0 , 3 or 4 are not uncommon .
The Edmonton Oilers total of seven is massive .
The team in 2006 - 07 is the Pittsburgh Penguins with 6 .
In 2005 - 06 the New York Rangers employed six rookies and the L.A. Kings employed five .
Now , two of those teams were pretty good and the other two , not so much .
And that 's where the results surprised me .
With the criteria I 've chosen there does n't seem to much correlation between how many rookies a team has in the lineup and their regular season point totals :
You could maybe make a case that the teams with no rookies do substantially better .
In some ways this is probably a selection bias since teams that end the year with no rookies playing 60 games have probably been very healthy and I would imagine that good health is probably the bigger factor .
You might even be able to argue that teams who employ only one rookie over the course of the season tend to do better but the difference really is n't very big and there are really good teams across the board .
It looks to me like " they 're starting the year with a lot of rookies " is not a good way of showing a team is of poor quality .
Although the number of rookies may have a small impact on overall performance , it looks to me like , so long as the rest of the team is quality , you can break in rookies who are ready for the NHL and still win .
Indeed , breaking in rookies does n't seem to cost much at all compared to other bottom - of - the - roster options .
And the Republicans are taking up for what ?
And why ?
Insurance executives during a September meeting assured investors that , no matter what happens in health system reform , their companies would continue to exist .
A few days later , before members of Congress , a panel of executives for some of the same companies laid out reasons why the companies should continue to exist .
The timing was coincidental .
But as the debate over health system reform began to narrow in focus , health plans appeared confident that their business model would stay essentially the same , and could even get a boost from reform .
With the potential for a public plan that would compete with private plans in flux , and a requirement for people to have health insurance gaining traction , executives told investors that reform could represent a large pool of new customers , rather than a threat to profits
.
" We think the ability to reform the insurance markets has the potential to bring a substantial number of new customers to the market , " Aetna Chief Executive Officer and Chair Ronald Williams told investors and analysts at the New York conference , hosted by Morgan Stanley
The boost from reform is the mandatory purchase of health insurance .
This is a stickler , one that President Obama has not REMOVED from the many remarks , speeches he has made .
So , if the American Public MUST purchase this insurance , like car insurance , then there should be no problem with a government run public option .
Right ?
Right now , the Republicans and the Republican - Lite Democrats are hell bent on preserving the status quo , with very little change .
These people are trying to sell incremental or baby steps in any possible way to the public .
At this point , the feeling of the Democratic Party and many Independents is good luck in trying that one .

In what is sure to be welcome news to many people in British Columbia , Canada 's Prime Minister , Stephen Harper , announced Thursday that the government of Canada will hold a judicial inquiry to examine the collapse of B.C. 's Sockeye salmon fishery .
Biologist " If you are serious reversing climate change you need our salmon to grow the forests that stabilize climate and suck carbon out of the atmosphere .
Someone in Ottawa has got to take the loss of this essential living powerhouse seriously .
Wild salmon are food security , a powercord between the open ocean and the Province of BC ; they are an economic generator ; they belong to the people . "
Morton has maintained there have been " untruths " surrounding BC 's wild salmon and the impact of salmon farms , and she has insisted on an inquiry that has legal teeth .
The federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans had Morton expressed some hope Thursday after Harper 's announcement in a press release .
The release " After months of silence from Fisheries and Oceans Canada ( DFO ) , Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced today a Judicial Inquiry into how DFO is managing the Fraser River sockeye .
" Prime Minister Harper 's action is a significant step that could ensure wild salmon have a future , " says biologist Alexandra Morton , " there is clearly something very wrong with DFO and it would appear Mr. Harper understands the gravity of the situation .
This action makes me cautiously optimistic and hopeful that we are poised at the beginning of a new era of fisheries management , benefiting all Canadians . "
BC 's fishermen who rely on the wild salmon have been angry with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans for its silence on the disappearance of the Sockeye .
NDP Peter Julien , based in British Columbia , told " For weeks , the NDP and B.C. communities , fishers and grassroots activists have been calling on this government to establish a judicial inquiry .
My office has been literally flooded with petitions calling on this government to stop its shallow public relations exercise and act .
The hard work and activism finally paid off . "
Some people are pointing out Harper 's surprise announcement on an inquiry coincides with a by - election in a British Columbia riding that is bounded on one side by the Fraser River .
The Fraser was the river with the largest Sockeye losses , although it was not the only river .
The Conservative party said it was following through on an election promise made in Many in British Columbia , including biologists , In Stockwell Day will be announcing the terms of reference for the judicial inquiry Friday .
The Fishermen , activists , conservationists and members of the general public have been calling for a federal inquiry into the collapse of Canada 's Sockeye salmon fishery since the millions of salmon predicted to return this year to spawn did not materialize .
Stockwell Day , who is Canada 's Trade Minister , will be in Vancouver Friday to announce the judge who will adjudicate the inquiry .
The inquiry is to start in early 2010 and wrap up at the latest by May 2011 and will look specifically at the collapse affecting the Fraser River .
Harper made the announcement Thursday in Ottawa .
Biologist Alexandra Morton has been working for years to save the salmon .
She said that she first got involved in the fight to protect BC 's salmon when she realized there was a link between the whales and the salmon disappearing .
In an open letter to Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff , published in the Pacific Free Press , Morton saidMorton has maintained there have been " untruths " surrounding BC 's wild salmon and the impact of salmon farms , and she has insisted on an inquiry that has legal teeth .
The federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans had predicted that there would be 10.5 million Sockeye returning to spawn this year , but there were only around one million fish that made it back .
BC's Environment Minister , Barry Penner had recently called for a public review of the " adequacy " of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans ' forecasting capabilities .
Morton expressed some hope Thursday after Harper 's announcement in a press release .
The release states BC 's fishermen who rely on the wild salmon have been angry with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans for its silence on the disappearance of the Sockeye .
NDP Peter Julien , based in British Columbia , told press that his office had been swamped with requests from people for an inquiry into the collapse of the salmon fishery .
Julien saidSome people are pointing out Harper 's surprise announcement on an inquiry coincides with a by - election in a British Columbia riding that is bounded on one side by the Fraser River .
The Fraser was the river with the largest Sockeye losses , although it was not the only river .
The Conservative party said it was following through on an election promise made in 2005 Many in British Columbia , including biologists , maintain that sea lice spread from BC 's fish farms have created problems for wild salmon .
In October , Marine Harvest lost at least 40,000 Atlantic salmon , which it raises on its fish farms in British Columbia .
Conservationists say the escape of the fish will have a negative impact on the environment and pacific salmon species .
Stockwell Day will be announcing the terms of reference for the judicial inquiry Friday .
The byelection in New Westminster , British Columbia will wrap up on Monday when voters go to the polls .

Belgian independent developer Tale of Tales , which brought us The Path , has released a new update for their MMO - Screensaver The Endless Forest .
In this application , users take the form of a deer in a forest inhabited by other user - controlled animals .
For more information , please hit the jump .
With no clear objective or way to communicate directly with other ‘ players ’ , the application comes closer to a piece of art than an actual game .
Nevertheless ,
Tale of Tales has released an update that allows players to visit ‘ de drinkplaats ’ , which is Dutch for ‘ the watering hole ’ .
Inspired by a painting by the Dutch / Flemish painter Roelant Savery from the 17th century , ‘ de drinkplaats ’ allows users of The Endless Forest to transform their deer into other animals that inhabit the forest , such as a bunny or raven .
The Endless Forest is available free of charge on the website of Tale of Tales .

Hotel , bed and breakfast ( B and B ) and home owners looking to provide accommodation to the estimated 500 000 visitors during the FIFA 2010 World Cup are opening themselves up to huge potential risks by failing to take out appropriate insurance cover .
South African ’s should not necessarily assume that they are covered for incidents and events that occur while renting out their homes to visiting soccer fans .
People face the real possibility of being sued by foreign visitors and not having any covers to meet the ensuing expenses .
There was a recent case in which someone was sued by an American family for well in excess of R20 million due to a liability claim against a South African citizen .
It is possible for people renting out their primary residences and holiday homes during the tournament to obtain liability cover that is not normally available on traditional personal lines policies .
B and B and private individuals could benefit by specifying their cover for the duration of the tournament .
It is important to be aware of how costly disruptions to services due to unforeseen circumstances could be during the four weeks of the tournament .
Owners of hotels and B and B ’s should assess whether they are covered for loss of revenue due to instances such as cancellations , staff stay - aways and failure of essential equipment such
as air conditioners or heaters .
Arranging cover for this will be particularly important for B and B’s and hotels in congested areas of Cape Town and Johannesburg ; especially areas close to the soccer stadiums and fan parks , where parking is likely to cause congestion and possibly blocked entrances of premises .
Noise pollution throughout the tournament is also likely to become a problem for establishments in areas close to major events .
Some insurance policies already include cover for noise pollution from the premises within 500 meters of the establishment .
However , it is dangerous to assume that these eventualities are automatically accounted for .
Anyone offering accommodation during the tournament should consult with their insurance brokers to clarify whether their policy will cover them for all eventualities .
A good insurance broker should understand the risks involved and will be able to ensure that their clients are appropriately covered so that there are no nasty surprises if things go wrong .
Mount Everest is the highest point on earth
Nepal is to hold a cabinet meeting on Mount Everest to highlight the threat global warming poses to glaciers .
On 4 December prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal and those politicians physically fit enough will ascend 17,192ft ( 5,250 m ) to base camp .
In October the Maldives held a cabinet meeting underwater to warn of the effect of rising sea levels .
This meeting , to be held before the Copenhagen climate conference , aims to highlight Himalayan glacier melt .
With ice in the region melting at a rapid rate , lakes have been formed which could flood nearby villages .
Melted ice and snow also makes mountaineering routes more hazardous .
At such a high altitude health is a major concern , so a team of doctors will accompany the politicians .
They will fly to Everest 's only airstrip , Lukla .
Doctors will make a final health assessment before a helicopter takes the cabinet to base camp , at the foot of Everest .
Once there they will hold a brief outdoor meeting .
Mount Everest is the highest point on earth , with a summit 29,035 ft ( 8,850 m ) above sea level .
A UN - backed election watchdog has declared invalid hundreds of thousands of votes for Afghanistan 's president in the disputed August election , apparently stripping Hamid Karzai of outright victory and setting the stage for a second round .
After nearly two months of investigations , the Electoral Complaints Commission ( ECC ) – controlled by a majority of non-Afghans – found Karzai 's total had fallen to 48.3 % , according to an independent analysis .
He needed 50 % to clinch another term in office .
A separate election commission that backs the president will have to endorse the findings and call for a second - round vote to be held in the next few weeks .
" Now that we have the ECC orders , we expect the IEC [ Independent Election Commission ] to implement those orders with haste and move swiftly to issue the final certified results or the need for a runoff as required by Afghan electoral law , " said Aleem Siddique , a UN spokesman in Kabul .
According to the independent analysis by the US - based Democracy International , Karzai 's share of the vote fell from 55 % to 48.3 % after fraudulent votes identified by the EEC were stripped away .
The figures confirmed views expressed anonymously by several foreign diplomats and election workers that Karzai 's share of the vote had dropped to around 48 % .
The president 's closest rival , Abdullah Abdullah , gained from his preliminary tally of 28 % to 31.6 % .
A spokesman for the Karzai campaign , Moen Marastial , said they would accept only the results published by the Independent Election Commission , an Afghan - led organisation thought to be heavily partisan in favour of Karzai .
" Nothing has been officially announced so far .
Only the ECC has said some votes should be disqualified , " Marastial said .
He warned that the IEC could disagree the ECC 's findings .
" I do n't know whether they will accept it or not .
They have the right to work on the procedures and formulas of the investigations and after that they will decide whether they will accept or not , if it is according to international rules of investigation , " he said .
In its published findings , the ECC stressed that the IEC was constitutionally bound to accept its orders .
Marastial said Karzai may also refuse to accept the results if there was evidence of " interference in the fraud investigation " .
Karzai's supporters have several times suggested that the ECC is controlled by foreign interests .
Any refusal by the IEC to accept the results would spark yet another crisis for a country that has been paralysed by the two - month delay in settling the election result .
Ahead of the announcement , pressure had been mounting on Karzai to accept a possible second - round vote or work out a deal to break the deadlock .
The tainted election has undermined Karzai 's credibility and complicated Barack Obama 's decision on whether to send more US troops to fight a resurgent Taliban .
The White House has linked the Afghan political crisis to a decision on sending extra US troops to the country .
Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , said the US administration could not make a decision about a request for 40,000 extra troops without a credible government in place in Kabul .
The administration has been delaying a decision on extra troops because of a divide between members of the cabinet , aides , generals and the intelligence services .
Emanuel is among those advising the president not to send more troops , partly because of the impact on domestic politics .
The war is increasingly unpopular with Afghans .
The US wants Karzai to accept the runoff to establish a semblance of legitimacy .
The Obama administration has long privately expressed its lack of faith in Karzai because of the widespread corruption in his government .
Karzai has a fortnight 's window to hold a runoff before winter snow makes it impossible .
Daddies be damned !
Who are the British women who think fathers are irrelevant ?
Having reached the age of 38 without meeting Mr Right , Karen Shefras decided to become a mother by using donated sperm .
As a result , Karen , who runs her own company , has never met her ten - month - old daughter 's father .
The closest she came to him was at the clinic where five of her eggs were injected with sperm donated by the dark - haired and intelligent businessman .
' Ideally , it would have been nice to have met a man and had a baby the conventional way , ' says Karen , now 41 .
' I always pictured myself getting married - but it just did n't happen .
Controversial : A new law allows women to have sperm donor babies without a man in their lives
' I grew up as part of a generation of women being told we had lots of choices .
It never occurred to me that one day I 'd be 30 and single , and before I knew it I would be 40 and single .
For women who find themselves in this position , having a baby via a sperm donor suddenly becomes an option . '
The story of how Karen brought her daughter Addie into the world - at a cost of £ 12,000 - is remarkable enough , but statistics suggest it is becoming more commonplace .
Latest figures from the Human Fertilisation & Embryology Authority ( HFEA ) show that nearly one - fifth of all women using sperm donors are single .
More often than not , these women are educated , middle - class , financially independent females who have succeeded in every area of their lives but have failed to find a husband to father their children .
On October 1 , the law changed to reflect this growing trend by removing the requirement for single women to demonstrate that their sperm donor baby will have a father figure .
The Human Fertility & Embryology
Act 2008 means that doctors no longer need to take into account the ' need for a father ' .
Instead , a woman requesting sperm must only demonstrate that any child will receive ' supportive parenting ' .
As leading fertility law specialist Natalie Gamble of Gamble and Ghevaert says : ' The recent changing of the wording is designed to be welcoming to different family forms .
Single women are now in no worse a position in establishing that they will be able to offer parenting just as supportive as heterosexual couples . '
Critics of the Act claim the change in law is another nail in the coffin of traditional family life .
Others insist that it merely reflects the complex social make - up of Britain today .
Karen herself , who runs an exhibition management agency from her home in Twickenham , Surrey , admits that her position is not ideal , but argues that she made the best choice she could given her circumstances .
Like so many women of her generation , Karen pursued a career believing that it would bring her fulfilment .
' I got so buried in work between the ages of 20 and 30 , ' she says .
' I was having fun , I suppose , but it was a false life .
I got to 38 and everything was great , but I just felt so empty .
' I 'm not anti-man and I still hope to meet one .
But due to my age , I did not have time to wait any longer . '
' My brother had two children , which made me feel even more sorry for myself .
Everything felt pointless and directionless in my life . '
Karen was 38 when , in her own words , ' the truth really started to kick in ' and she decided to take control of her situation .
' I realised it was now or never , ' she says .
' I wanted children while my parents were still young enough to enjoy them .
I had this fear of life passing me by , and them dying while I was waiting for something tohappen . '
In August 2007 , she registered with the London Bridge Clinic and was put on their waiting list for a sperm donor .
Her parents supported her decision .
' My mum was completely overjoyed , and my dad said : " It 's a changing world .
Why not ? "
' There were only a few people who said : " That 's not the correct way to do it . "
And my answer to them was : " What is ? "
' I 'm not anti-man and I still hope to meet one .
But due to my age , I did not have time to wait any longer . '
By the time she had undergone all the medical tests required before treatment begins , Karen was at the top of the clinic 's list and given a choice of five donors .
The clinic provided details of the donors ' hair and eye colour , height and build , as well as occupation , education , hobbies and marital status .
Some clinics even offer baby photos of the donor and audio recordings of interviews with them .
' I wanted someone with similar colouring to my own , ' Karen says .
' I did n't want a blond - haired , blue - eyed baby , because I 'm not .
And intelligence was important to me .
I opted for my donor because he sounded grounded and intelligent . '
In November 2007 , Karen underwent intrauterine insemination , where donor sperm is injected directly into the uterus , but failed to conceive .
A second attempt in December was also unsuccessful .
In desperation , she turned to in vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) .
Karen 's eggs were harvested from her ovaries and fertilised outside the womb .
' They removed 14 eggs , and in the end they had five possible embryos .
They put two back , so I could have had twins - but when I went for my eight - week scan , only one had thrived . '
Addie was born on December 17 last year by Caesarean section .
' I was absolutely overwhelmed with love , ' says Karen .
' Of course it would have been nice to have shared that moment with a man , but we do n't live in an ideal world .
' People have accused me of being selfish - but there are lots of incredibly unhappy mothers and fathers out there .
I am very contented and so is Addie .
There is constant harmony in my flat . '
Karen says her job means she is able to support both herself and Addie , and she insists her daughter will have male role models in her life .
' I have my brother , my dad and male friends .
I have a wide social circle .
She gets attention from them .
' ' For a number of women , the reality is that if they want to become mothers they will have to do it alone .
The stigma of being a parent on your own is reducing .'
' Perhaps if I had once been married and experienced that partnership , I 'd feel that I was missing something more .
But I do n't feel a big gap - I feel so complete with her . '
According to one gynaecologist the Mail spoke to this week , as many as 50 per cent of patients being given sperm at his clinic are single women or are in same - sex relationships .
Tim Child , consultant gynaecologist at Oxford Fertility Unit , says this high percentage can be explained partly by the fact that medical advances mean that traditional couples are less likely to need the assistance of a sperm donor .
But he admits : ' We 've certainly noticed an increase in requests from single women .
Until October 1 , we were required by law to ask about a male role model for the child .
There was usually a brother , or a friend , or their father .
' Sometimes single women would question why they needed to answer that , and we'd have to explain that it was a legal requirement .
The change in the law means that we do n't have to go into as much detail .
I actually think it 's a realistic change in light of society today . '
According to a spokeswoman for the Donor Conception Network , a quarter of the support group 's membership is now single women .
' For a number of women , the reality is that if they want to become mothers they will have to do it alone , ' she says .
' The stigma of being a parent on your own is reducing .
' And women are generally more educated , more economically independent , more stable and confident , and therefore more able to make a decision that if they want to be mothers and can't find a man to do it with them , they can go ahead by themselves . '
TV executive Ruth Rackham , 44 , who became a single mother by choice four years ago , admits that her son's need for a father - figure was ever present in her mind .
She made the decision to become a mother at 39 , having failed , like so many of her friends , to find a partner .
' In every other area of my life , I had made conscious decisions about what I wanted .
But when it came to what , potentially , was the most important thing of all , I was leaving it to chance .
' I had tied in all hopes for children with the desire for a lasting relationship .
It suddenly dawned on me that these two things might never coincide . '
Instead of using sperm from a registered clinic , she turned to a gay friend , who lives in Italy , for help .
She needed IVF to conceive , but was pregnant by her 40th birthday .
Her son Luca , who has contact with his biological father when he visits from Italy , celebrated his fourth birthday this week .
' Because I had a boy , I felt it was very important to offer my son a positive male role model '
' Because I had a boy , I felt it was very important to offer my son a positive male role model , ' she says .
' I felt uncomfortable about the idea of a boy brought up on his own with his mother . '
Then , two years ago , she met her husband Tim - and Luca now has two father figures .
' My son has become incredibly attached to his stepfather , whom he calls Daddy , which is hard for his biological father , whom he calls Papa - but we all get on well together , ' says Ruth .
She admits that at the moment , though , the situation is somewhat confusing for her son .
' Luca does n't understand the difference between biological and stepfather .
I have tried to explain to him that Mummy and Daddy met after he was born .
' We have to be very careful to let him understand in his own way , in his own time and keep it as simple as possible .
I try to take my cue from what he wants to hear . '
Ruth , who lives near Aylesbury in Bucks , says she did not want to use an anonymous donor at that stage .
' I was happy to have a known donor who wanted to help me in my attempt to conceive .
I 'd have felt uncomfortable using unknown donor sperm - but maybe if that had been my only option , it would have been different . '
Of the HFEA 's decision to remove from their latest regulations the requirement for a potential mother to demonstrate her baby will have a father figure , she says : ' There 's a certain sadness in this .
' The most important thing is supportive parents , whatever sex they are .
But it 's undeniable that it must be a good thing for a child to have a hands - on relationship with both their biological parents . '
But for many women , the ideal remains out of reach .
Ruth adds : ' I think that in the future there will be more sperm donor babies and more options for women over the age of 35 .
Many women are now starting to freeze their eggs . '
According to lawyer Natalie Gamble , the new Act is , in effect , simply rubber - stamping changes which have already taken place in society .
' Family structures are becoming more diverse , women are taking more control over their procreation and doing it at the right time for them .
The increase in single women deciding to have families on their own is just one aspect of that .
' In the past , before clinics treated anyone , they had to consider the child 's need for a father .
Historically , this was seen as a discouragement to single women , and for many years it was very difficult for single women to access treatment through licensed clinics .
' Over the years , that policy has evolved .
Over the past five years , women have already been able to access more treatment . '
BUT , of course , not everyone welcomes the changes .
Sociologist Patricia Morgan , of the Institute for Economic Affairs , describes the new Act as ' dreadful ' .
' It 's the feminist dream come true , ' she says .
' I do n't think we 've ever had this in history - the removal of the need for a father .
' What are men meant to do now ?
If they 're not needed as responsible fathers , as providers , what is their role in life now ?
What is their status ?
' And even if these women can financially support themselves , what kind of family is it when the mother is out at work all day ?
' The implications of this law change are momentous .
Nobody seems to have thought of the child here and what kind of future he or she will have . '
Women such as Karen and Ruth would no doubt be irritated by the suggestion that they are no better than impetuous and irresponsible teenagers who become pregnant .
Karen , who is hoping to have another baby next year using the same sperm donor , points out : ' I do have small regrets .
It would be nice not to have to worry about bringing in money .
' It is hard being alone , but I do n't dwell too much on it .
My life has taken the direction it 's taken .
I feel very blessed to be a mother .'
But she admits to feeling anxious about the future .
' There are moments when I think : " God , I hope she does n't react badly when she finds out . "
I 'm hoping it wo n't be detrimental to her personality , but I come from quite a grounded family and I 'm hoping that her surroundings and her upbringing will help her .
' By the time she goes to school , I do n't think being a sperm donor baby will be such a strange thing .
In the U.S. , there are already thousands of donor children . '
But the most telling thing of all is that Karen still hopes to meet ' Mr Right ' - a positive sign at least that having a baby without a man does not remove a woman 's emotional need for a life partner .
' I really do hope a man comes along , ' she says .
' I can't see myself without a man for ever . '
In the end , perhaps the truth is that , for complete fulfilment , women need both a partner and children .
The most worrying question of all is why the most natural thing in the world has become so seemingly difficult to achieve , and why a generation of women have fallen foul of their dreams .

France 's EU presidency under Nicolas Sarkozy was one of the most costly
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has come under fire over a shower built at taxpayers ' expense but never used .
The shower , in the Grand Palace , Paris , was intended for his use at a Union of the Mediterranean summit held during France 's six - month EU presidency .
French opposition MP Rene Dosiere accused Mr Sarkozy of spending 245,000 euros ( £ 221,000 ) on the shower .
But a spokesman for Mr Sarkozy 's UMP party said the figure was for the renovation of a suite of rooms .
The French European Union presidency , which ran from July to December 2008 , was one of the most expensive in history .
The French Court of Accounts put the total cost at 171m euros ( £ 154 m ) .
Surround sound
The three - day summit during which the shower was intended to be used cost 16.6 m euros to stage in total , according to the French Court of Accounts .
An earlier BBC News website story reported that the installation of the shower alone cost 245,000 euros .
But UMP spokesman Frederic Lefebvre said that figure covered the refurbishment of a suite of eight rooms and bathrooms for the use of heads of state .
Mr Dosiere , a socialist MP , on Tuesday commented on the cost of the shower as he criticised what he described as the " incredible , insupportable and unacceptable expenses " of the French EU presidency .
Other expenses included £ 90,000 for a carpet and nearly £ 300,000 for a conference podium , according to a copy of the French Court of Accounts report published on the Mediapart website .
Usually the rotating presidency of the EU costs 70 - 80 m euros .
Only Germany has previously spent as much on it as France , the AFP news agency reported .
Its report said France had organised 489 EU events during its presidency , including nine summits , 25 ministerial meetings and 328 seminars and symposiums .
A spokesman for the European Commission said the vast majority of the budget for the costs of the rotating EU presidency comes from the member state concerned .
NASA'S plans to land astronauts on the moon again by 2020 are about to disappear into a giant black hole , according to a panel of space experts appointed by the US President , Barack Obama .
Less than a month after the 40th anniversary of the first lunar landing by Apollo 11 , the group has told White House advisers that the space agency simply does not have enough money to do it again .
Old Glory ... too costly to plant another flag on the moon .
Without a significant boost in funding - unlikely with the federal deficit approaching $ US1.3 trillion ( $ 1.56 trillion ) NASA will almost certainly have to scrap the next - generation Ares I rocket that has already cost more than $ US9 billion to develop .
The longer - term part of the agency 's $ US81 billion Constellation project - to land humans on Mars by the middle of the century , touted by the former president , George Bush , in his 2004 vision for space exploration - will remain in the realms of science fiction , at least for now .
Birth policies and family attitudes are having an effect upon population demographics ( Image : Tim Graham / Getty )
EUROPE , where the so - called population explosion got under way in the 18th century , is once again playing a pioneering role in demographic development .
The continent has the lowest fertility rate and the most elderly population in the world , and this population will soon start to shrink .
All this makes it a front runner in a demographic trend that sooner or later will reach most of the world .
Pioneers have to advance through difficult terrain .
Economists are already fretting over the problem of how social security systems will cope when the post - war baby boomers start collecting their pensions in 2015 .
In hyper - ageing countries like Italy and Germany , where 1 in 7 people will be over 80 in 2050 , it is unclear how a shrinking group of young people can generate the wealth needed to support the growing cohort of elderly citizens .
Europe ’s competitiveness could fall behind younger and growing populations in other world regions .
On the face of it , fewer people seems like good news for the environment .
The population of Germany , Europe ’s most populous country , will shrink by at least 8 million by 2050 and this trend is set to be replicated in many of its neighbours .
Remote rural areas , mainly in central and eastern Europe , might become depopulated over time .
This should benefit biodiversity as displaced plant and animal species recolonise their old terrain .
Given that the world population is still growing by about 200,000 people a day , and the ecological footprint of the human race already lies beyond the limits of sustainability , fewer …
When Wendy Scarbrough lost her job after 10 years as a television news producer for NBC , she decided it would be smart to pursue a new career and to improve her skills .
At a job fair , she learned about a course that she was sure would make her more marketable to employers .
Within weeks , she was enrolled in that course , in project management , at Northern Virginia Community College , alongside 15 other laid - off workers .
It felt a little odd enrolling at a community college , Ms. Scarbrough said , because she already had a bachelor ’s degree from Michigan State University .
Still , she said , not only were the instructors knowledgeable , but also the course involved visits from prospective employers , and she was able to polish her skills in budgeting , personnel management and other areas .
“ I learned a lot , ” she said .
“ It also helped me psychologically after looking for a job for a year and feeling discouraged .
It gave me a new direction and has certainly been helpful for networking . ”
THE Christian Brothers are handing over € 161 m in cash and property in the wake of devastating Ryan report on child abuse .
The congregation said in a statement that € 34 m in cash will be used directly to help victims of child abuse .
The transfer of € 127 m in property assets will be be used to " begin to repair trust with so many people in Ireland who felt betrayed by the brothers " .
" Our response reflects the moral obligation we collectively and individually feel , " they declared .
The move by the Christian Brothers comes as the Catholic Church is set to be rocked by another damning report on sex abuse -- this time by priests in the Dublin archdiocese .
The interim report of the Commission of Investigation into clerical sexual abuse in the archdiocese of Dublin was discussed by the Cabinet and is expected to be published tomorrow .
That damning report finds the Catholic hierarchy and state authorities failed to respond to allegations of clerical child abuse made against a sample of 46 priests .
Last night , in a statement posted on their website , the Christian Brothers said they were shamed and sorrowed at the extent of abuse of children in their care .
Other congregations are expected to release details of their assets today .
The 18 congregations involved had agreed to reveal details of their assets following publication of the Ryan report in May .
Politicians and the public demanded that they pay more compensation than the € 128 m figure agreed with former Education Minister Michael Woods as the cost to the State was estimated at a massive € 1.3bn .
The Christian Brothers , previously the country 's largest male teaching order , came in for scathing criticism in the report .
For instance , the Ryan Commission said that in St Joseph 's industrial school , Artane , in Dublin , corporal punishment was pervasive .
Brothers used a variety of weapons and devised methods of increasing suffering when inflicting punishment and , in some cases , they were cruel and even sadistic .
Punishment
In Letterfrack , Co Galway , it was impossible to avoid punishment because it was frequently capricious , unfair and inconsistent .
In cases of sexual abuse in Letterfrack , the interests of the congregation and an abusing brother were put ahead of the welfare of the boys .
After the report was published , the Christian Brothers were the first to accept that they needed to pay more than the € 30 m they had already paid since 1996 .
In their statement last night , they said they proposed to :
Make a donation of € 30 m to an independent trust established by the Government to respond to the direct educational , welfare and medical needs of former residents .
Contribute € 4 m over the next five years to support counsellor and therapeutic services such as Faoiseamh .
Transfer € 127 m worth of playing fields and lands to a separate independent trust .
" Our fervent hope is that the initiatives proposed will assist in the provision of support services to former residents of the institutions as well as the facilities , resources and scope to protect , cherish and educate present and future generations of children , " they said on their website www.christianbrothers.eu, which also gives details of their assets and liabilities .
It shows assets at the end of June of € 240.9 m -- this includes € 51.7 m in investment assets and € 10 m in bank accounts .
It is proposed to transfer 67 pc of this total into independent trusts .
The remain 23 pc of their assets are accounted for by liabilities ( € 8.1 m ) ; continuation of services such as teacher education in Marino College , Dublin , ( €29.7 m ) and the living , welfare and care of members ( €22.9 m ) .
There are 250 brothers in the country with an average of 74 years -- only 62 are under 65 years of age .
Many of them need healthcare .
The latest proposed transfer follows last year 's handing over of schools and associated properties by the brothers to the Edmund Rice Schools Trust ( ERST ) , an independent body .
The transfer value , inclusive of funding and establishment costs , was € 435 m .
The Christian Brothers added : " We understand and regret that nothing we say or do can turn back the clock for those affected by abuse " .

50 Cent is certainly not the most obvious choice for an author of a business and life self - help book .
The more you are aware of your fate , the higher the probability you have a chance to live
50 Cent The US hip hop artist shot to fame in 2003 with the release of debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin ' , and you might think that is the extent of his business philosophy .
What lessons , after all , are learned from a youth spent dodging bullets and dealing drugs on the streets of New York , that are of interest to legal businesses ?
" The boss of the neighbourhood does n't rue killing someone out as an option to expand business , " he explains to Today presenter Evan Davis .
" In corporate America I 've interacted with people who absolutely have intentions of killing the competition in a different way . "
Dog-eat - dog In The 50th Law , a book co-authored with Robert Greene , 50 Cent explains the rules if you want to get ahead in the gang and drug - centred life he grew up in .
I fear I can't change and that I 'm misunderstood .
50 Cent Born Curtis James Jackson III in Southside Jamaica , Queens , New York City , the rapper 's hustler mother died when he was just eight years old .
He was raised by his grandmother but quickly fell into the life of gang culture and drug dealing , only giving up life of an " entrepreneur " hustler after numerous arrests .
" You are in an environment where you meet aggression with aggression or you are deemed weak and the weak becomes the prey , " he says .
These are the rules that led him to slash the face of a rival drug dealer and which in 2000 , as a rising star in hip hop , saw him shot nine times in an attack that nearly took his life .
Far from persuading him to soften up , these experiences , he says , are the basis of his success .
" When you 're in life threatening situations it makes you a little more conscious of death .
" The more you are aware of your fate the higher the probability you have a chance to live .
So you 're a little more free . "

The rapper says he has no regrets over the way he dealt with his harsh upbringing But , given the opportunity , he says he would definitely have taken a different direction in life - perhaps an education in business school .
In 2003 , at the age of 28 , 50 Cent got his big break .
He was signed by rapper Eminem 's record label and released the world wide hit single In da Club .
The following album , Get Rich or Die Tryin ' , became a global rap cross-over hit , selling millions of copies both in the US and around the world .
Now an international superstar and the businessman behind the multi-million dollar G Unit brand , the rapper still believes the fact he has stared death in the face gives him the edge in the boardroom .
" The core of my power in business situations is being the person with the least fear at the table , " he says .
In da office
But many people have never experienced the death defying , dog - eat - dog world of New York streets .
Does 50 Cent 's " fear nothing " approach retain its power in more prosaic situations ?
Rapper Eminem signed 50 Cent to his own record label Surprisingly , the hip hop star uses the example of a mundane staff meeting as the crucible of his attitude to life .
The person who knows the answer to a question , but sits in the staff room and watches as another person answers it , is just as in need of his advice as the street hustler or rising rap star .
The person who speaks up " deserves to be ahead of you in life because your fear of being wrong is not allowing you to create your value in the work place , " he says .
The underlying message of 50 Cent 's philosophy could not be clearer , and is not so much business advice as general advice in life - for a person to succeed you must face your fears head on , and never let the other person know you 're afraid .
And even 50 Cent admits to having to face fears of his own .
" I fear I can't change and that I 'm misunderstood .
My confidence is mistaken for arrogance constantly .
" There are artists that can beat me at doing different things , but not at being me .
Once the public embraces me and says Fiddy 's cool , or I like 50 Cent , ca n't anybody beat me at doing that . "

Click to see the ad from S4MM called Give Me a Break .
In the ad , a small portion of the NPR story from 2004 is played , describing how a teacher in Massachusetts - which the ad fails to note teaches sex education - speaks about sexuality to her 8th grade students .
It comes from Massachusetts schools weigh gay topics , which examined how public schools in the Bay State were reacting to that state 's court ruling allowing same - sex couples to marry .
Despite a recent claim by the head of S4MM , Marc Mutty , that [ " We [ S4 MM ] have never said that schools will be mandated -- or actually perhaps we did in one ad , or certainly led people to believe that inadvertently , " http://www.dirigoblue.com/... this latest ad clearly intends to convince viewers that allowing same - sex couples will impact the curricula of schools in Maine .
Mutty 's claims that they inadvertently misled viewers is bullshit , of course , since from the same NPR story one finds :
In Massachusetts , local districts have broad discretion when it comes to sex ed , and schools range from this one in Brookline to many others that teach abstinence only to no sex ed at all .
This is exactly what many have said in rebutting the claim from S4 MM that " gay marriage " will be taught in Maine 's public schools ( whatever that means ) .
It further tars the credibility of S4MM in that they ignored this important information from the same story in which they took the quote that forced NPR to file its order .
It is now incumbent on the Maine 's news media to fully examine all the claims made by S4MM and Marc Mutty , and to explain to their readers how far they have stretched the truth - and in some cases lied - to promote their cause .
MSNBC ’s Keith Olbermann named Rush Limbaugh “ Worst Person in the World ” on Monday for standing by claims the radio host made about President Barack Obama , even though the talk - radio personality knew the claims were based on a satirical Web site .
For promoting claims that had been proven false , Olbermann compared Limbaugh to Orly Taitz , the “ birther ” lawyer leading the charge to prove that Obama is not a US citizen .
ADVERTISEMENT
As various news sources have reported , Limbaugh recently cited Obama ’s “ college thesis ” to allege the president has an agenda to redistribute Americans ’ wealth .
But the college thesis was a spoof hosted on the satire blog Jumping in Pools .
Limbaugh cited an excerpt from Obama ’s purported thesis that stated , “ The Constitution allows for many things , but what it does not allow is the most revealing .
The so - called Founders did not allow for economic freedom .
While political freedom is supposedly a cornerstone of the document , the distribution of wealth is not even mentioned . ”
“ Ladies and gentlemen , Barack Obama is seriously dangerous .
To say that distribution of wealth is economic freedom is insane , ” Limbaugh told his audience .
“ Nothing — not even the age - old maxim that if it ’s too good to be true , it probably is n’t — caused Limbaugh to think even for a second , ” Olbermann said on MSNBC ’s Countdown Monday night .
“ Jumping in Pools is a spoof blog , a satire Web site .
It posted its spoof in August .
It ’s now October and nobody has reported the shattering the details . ”
Added Olbermann : “ Thus Limbaugh proved he has neither honesty nor common sense . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
But what prompted Olbermann ’s criticism was that Limbaugh continued to defend the fake college thesis even after he was informed it was fake .
It may have been fake but “ we know he thinks it , ” Limbaugh said on his radio program .
“ Good comedy , if it ’s comedy , must contain an element of truth . …
So we stand by the fabricated quote , because we know Obama thinks it anyway . ”
“ Back - pedaling like a bear on a unicycle , ” Olbermann retorted .
“ The others who bit on this whopper — like the National Review , even Lou Dobbs — rushed quickly away from their embarrassment .
But not Rush Limbaugh , or as he might now best be renamed , Orly Taitz . ”

“ Orly Taitz Limbaugh — today ’s worst person in the world , ” Obermann quipped .

Somewhere near the top of the list of bad ideas for attorneys is posting a Craigslist ad seeking a dual legal secretary / sexual partner .
Doing just that , plus allegedly mishandling two immigration matters , has earned an Illinois attorney an appearance before the state 's disciplinary board .
The Legal Profession Blog gets the credit for pointing out the complaint , included below .
Samir Chowhan posted an ad in the " Adult Gigs " section of Craigslist in May seeking a legal secretary .
It said the job would require secretarial and paralegal work and " additional duties for two lawyers in the firm . "
In addition to a resume , applicants were to send in a few pictures and their measurements .
A woman responded , and Chowhan sent her an email with a little more information about the job :
... You would be required to have sexual interaction with me and my partner , sometimes together , sometimes separate ... You have to be comfortable doing this with us .
Chowhan repeatedly stressed the need for the applicant to be " comfortable " with the job requirements , as , perhaps not surprisingly , he'd had people in the past who could not " handle the sexual aspect of the job . "
He therefore came up with a plan to make sure the applicant would be untroubled with her tasks .
...[ W ] e've decided that as a part of the interview process you 'll be required to perform sexually ... I think it 's necessary to see if you can do that , because it 'll predict future behavior of you being able to handle it when you have the job .
The recipient of the email did not respond , but instead sent it to the disciplinary commission .
According to the complaint , Chowhan at first denied posting the ad and sending the follow - up email , but has since admitted he did it .
The disciplinary commission has requested a hearing on the matter .
The WSJ Law Blog tracked down Chohan :
WSJ Law Blog : “ I did do that , ” he said .
Chowhan explained that he was winding up his immigration practice , and “ curiosity ” got the better of him .
“ I was n’t intending to hire anyone , ” he added .
“ I was just screwing around , just curious to know if anyone would respond .
Unfortunately , someone did . ”
Chowhan says he ’s now living in Indiana , is unemployed , and has no intention of practicing law ever again .
“ I came to that decision months before this happened , though . ”
At this point , he told us , he ’s looking forward to putting it behind him .
“ I ’ll take the punishment . ”
Let 's see ... what 's the lesson from this one ?
Gentlemen : Do n't let curiosity get the best of you .
It 's a law office , not fantasy land .
Attorney Complaint
Akeela Ali Azcuy ’s Tribute
" And now the purple dusk of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky the little stars climb
Always reminding me that we 're apart
You wander down the lane and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the years gone by . "
Rashied Ali walked the earth with a powerful and passionate presence .
All his endeavors , his family , his music , and his friends , received his passionate dedication .
As his drumming was multidirectional and rhythmical , so was his life .
He walked many paths as a father , son , husband , mentor , and innovator .
Ali was unique with the agility and grace to fill all of these roles with love .
Ali developed the style known as " free jazz " drumming , which liberates the percussionist from the role of human metronome .
As Ali said , " I never really thought of ... being an innovator , I was always just trying to move the music , you know , play something different from what I hear all the time . "
His effort in this direction is what came to define him as a musician .
In his music and life he always strove to higher levels of freedom , forever questioning rigid traditions and with that vision , defining his life for himself and his loved ones .
Philadelphia born , Ali began his musical career as a child , raised in a family of musicians .
He discovered his passion for drumming in the U.S. Army and started gigging in Germany where he was stationed .
He defined himself as a percussionist , able to play any kind of music .
His love for free jazz above all , did not stop him from playing bebop , rock ' roll , funk , blues , straight ahead , and all styles that the musical scene offered .
Ali made New York City his home in the early 1960's .
As a drummer he fiercely played his way through the avant - garde scene , leaving his mark on musical free spirits such as Don Cherry , Pharoah Sanders , Paul Bley , Archie Shepp , Bill Dixon and Albert Ayler .
Ali had grown up listening to one of his musical gurus , John Coltrane .
Ali said , " I learned from Coltrane that I do n't care how much you think you know , there 's always some more stuff you can learn , so you just have to be humble with this stuff man and just try to learn as much as you can , cause the minute you think you got it all , that 's when it all closes down , you ain't got nothing else to learn any more , you 're dead , you can just shovel some dirt in your face . "
Ali and Trane generated many musical gems that continue to move the listener through all phases of human emotion .
Ali died in the prime of his career , always learning more , challenging himself , moving the music until the end .
His independent and innovative thinking led Ali to open the loft - jazz club , Ali's Alley , in 1973 , and to establish his own label , Survival Records .
Ali's Alley began as a musical outlet for the New York Avant - Garde , but soon became a melting pot of music , people , food , and good times .
Rashied mentored many young musicians , whom he welcomed into his family .
He cultivated independent free thinking in his young musicians and fostered that same spirit in his family .
Throughout his life Ali was a devoted and loving father and husband to his wife , Patricia , and his children .
He was always present and supportive of his family .
He taught everyone around him to follow their hearts and minds despite obstacles from the outside world .
His contagious spirit and passion inspired all those around him and through these relationships he will always be remembered , loved and cherished .
And you thought that giving your fiancée a sapphire engagement ring after watching Blood Diamond would be enough to make you a socially responsible consumer .
Sorry , but no .
Our globally conscious Representative Jim McDermott has introduced the Conflict Minerals Trade Act , which tracks the origins of the minerals that make up the components of our mobile phones , laptops , and iPods .
That ’s because , according to a nonprofit called Raise Hope for Congo , more than 5 million people have died in fighting to control the mines that produce those minerals .
Not everyone has a big rock on their left hand , but almost all of us chat on a cell phone , check e-mail on a laptop , and keep an iPod on hand to block out people on the bus .
For those devices to work , they need tin for the circuit boards , a mineral called coltan to hold an electrical charge , and tungsten for the component that makes the phone ’s vibrating feature work .
“ There ’s so much that we use every day that has some derivation of these [ minerals ] , ” says McDermott spokesperson Mike DeCesare .
All three of those minerals — along with gold , used in both electronics and jewelry ( there are those ethically compromised rings again ) — are found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
According to Raise Hope , trading in those minerals is worth $ 180 million per year to whomever controls the mines .
And with the money has come armed conflict .
To that end , McDermott ’s legislation , co-sponsored by Rep. Frank Wolf , R - Virginia , would create a map of the mines that are likely funding the fighting in the Congo .
Companies making products like computers and cell phones would then be able to certify that the minerals in their products do n’t come from those mines .
The Secretary of Commerce , our own Gary Locke , would be responsible for compiling a “ Potential Conflict Goods List . ”
The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association released a statement praising McDermott ’s legislation .
It ’s not really the kind of thing that ’s politically feasible to oppose .
But the CTIA notes that in addition to encouraging their businesses to take greater responsibility for supporting human rights worldwide , the bill ’s map and list would “ give CTIA ’s members additional tools as they seek to ensure that they are sourcing from ‘ conflict free ’ sources . ”
But until some system of certification is in place , consumers can only wonder : “ Is the buzzing in my pocket a call from a dear friend or a cry for help from people suffering so I can make last - minute happy - hour plans ? ”
I love when guys from the mid-90s Steelers teams pop up on some random stuff .
Former LB Kevin Greene , who also had a 19 - year Army Reserve career to go with his 15 years of NFL service , taped a vehicle safety spot for the Naval Safety Center .
In it , he urges Marines and Sailor to be smart about automobile safety , and calls out the idiots who drive drunk .
I always loved Greene , even though he was only a Steeler for 3 seasons .
He was one of the guys I wanted to see win a championship in that Super Bowl XXX year , his last in Pittsburgh .
In the safety video , he comes off completely down to Earth , with a refreshing on - screen personality .
He did n’t just sign up to mumble some scripted lines and get his facetime , he actually seems to care about keeping the Naval officers safe .
Some of my favorite lines :
“ Hello , my name is Kevin Greene of the Pittsburgh Steelers and a couple other teams . ”
“ I played in 5 Pro Bowls and I actually have a kinda cool stat …I ’m like the all - time NFL sack leader for linebackers … and … I do n’t know , for whatever that ’s worth . ”
“ Drunk driving ?
You gotta be kidding me !
No excuse . ”
Gotta love that despite playing only 3 seasons in the ‘ Burgh , Greene still associates himself with the Steelers .
Plus , I ’ve had a few close friends pass away in car accidents , so the safety video and Greene ’s participation is that much cooler .
What ’s next , Greg Lloyd for karate safety ?
Yesterday , four US Senators led by Senator Chris Dodd announced plans to introduce " The Retroactive Immunity Repeal Act " .
That bill , endorsed by EFF , would repeal the law that Congress passed last summer granting immunity to phone companies that illegally assist in domestic spying by US intelligence agencies , and would revive EFF ’s recently dismissed lawsuit against AT&T for its collaboration in the NSA ’s warrantless wiretapping program .
As yesterday ’s announcement explains ,
Over the last two years , Senators Dodd , Leahy , and Feingold have led the fight against granting retroactive immunity to the telecommunications companies .
However , last July , Congress passed FISA legislation that granted retroactive immunity over the objections of the Senators and others .
This bill seeks to reverse the mistake of the last Congress and repeal the retroactive immunity provisions .
The Senators strongly believe that the courts , and neither Congress nor the Administration , should be the ones to determine whether these corporations violated the law and rights of Americans and whether or not they should be held accountable .
EFF thanks these Senators , along with fourth bill sponsor Senator Merkley , for their continuing work to maintain the rule of law and demand accountability from lawbreaking telcos .
Importantly , the bill announced today is n’t the only front in the battle to repeal telco immunity : the JUSTICE Act , Senator Feingold ’s bill to reform the USA PATRIOT Act , also contains a provision that would repeal the immunity law .
The Senate Judiciary Committee will be considering the reforms in that bill this Thursday , so visit our action center now to tell your Senator to reform the PATRIOT Act and repeal telco immunity !
There has been a lot of interest in my new climate video .
Already we have nearly 450 1400 views at Google video and over 200 800 downloads of the video .
I am now releasing the video on DVD and through YouTube .
I have had several requests for a DVD version rather than an online version or file .
For a limited time , through December 31 , 2007 , I will send a DVD of my video
What is Normal ?
A Critique of Catastrophic Man-Made Global Warming
Theory to anyone who sends me a stamped self - addressed envelope .
The DVD plus a standard CD mailer weigh about 3.3 OZ , so you will need $ 1.31 postage in the US .
Send your request to " Climate Video , c / o Warren Meyer , 11811 N. Tatum Blvd # 4095 , Phoenix , AZ , 85253 "
Also , in response to popular demand , I have release the video on YouTube .
YouTube requires that all videos be under 10 minutes , so I have broken the film into six parts .
If you want to just preview a portion , the second half of the fourth film and the first half of the fifth are probably the most critical .
A Youtube Playlist for the film is here .
This is a cool feature I have not used before , but will effectively let you run the parts end to end , making the 50 - minute video more or less seamless .
The individual parts are :
Climate Video Part 1 : Introduction ; how greenhouse gases work ; historical climate reconstructions
Climate Video Part 2 : Historical reconstructions ; problems with proxies
Climate Video part 3 : How much warming is due to man ; measurement biases ; natural cycles in climate
Climate Video Part 4 : Role of the sun ; aerosols and cooling ; climate sensitivity ; checking forecasts against history
Climate Video Part 5 : Positive and negative feedback ; hurricanes .
Climate Video Part 6 : Melting ice and rising oceans ; costs of CO2 abatement ; conclusions .
You may still stream the entire climate film from Google Video here .
( the video will stutter between the 12 and 17 second marks , and then should run fine )

Nancy Pelosi clapped her hands as she left the House floor late Saturday night , and said with a smile , ' That was easy . '
Pelosi wins the day
Nancy Pelosi clapped her hands as she left the House floor late Saturday night .
“ That was easy , ” the speaker said with a smile .
Advertisement
It was n’t .
She had just delivered a promise decades of her predecessors failed to bring home , harnessing her uncommon focus , vote - counting acumen and consensus - building skills to bring tens of millions of Americans a giant leap closer to having health insurance coverage with a 220 - 215 roll call .
“ Somebody asked me if this was a victory for [ President ] Barack Obama .
It ’s not .
This victory belongs to her , ” said House Rules Committee Chairwoman Louise Slaughter ( D - N.Y . ) .
“ As far as I know she never sleeps nor eats . ”
The bill ’s fate , for now , rests across the Capitol in the hands of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev . ) .
But with Saturday ’s vote , Pelosi proved yet again she is the able master of a Democratic Caucus that is enjoying its greatest political and legislative success since at least the beginning of the Clinton administration and arguably since its legislative heyday in the mid-1960s .
Democrats , including Pelosi , view the push for expanding the government ’s role in the health care system as a new plank in the social justice platform constructed with Civil Rights , Voting Rights , open housing and Medicare laws enacted during Lyndon Johnson ’s presidency , when Democrats held similar – and at times even larger — majorities in the House .
“ You , Madam speaker — and the leadership — we thank you for the extraordinary leadership which you have given us in bringing us to the point where we are today , ” Rep. John Dingell , the Michigan Democrat who 's dean of the House , said on the floor Saturday night .
He was praising a woman who helped strip him of his chairmanship of the House Energy and Commerce Committee less than a year ago and once backed a primary challenger against him in Michigan ’s 15th District .
For all the work that went into pulling together the votes for the bill – the president , Cabinet secretaries , legions of White House aides , House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ’s deft touch with conservative Blue Dogs and senior lawmakers , Majority Whip Jim Clyburn and his team of vote - counting lieutenants , progressive grassroots organizations and any number of others who could rightly take credit for a piece of the victory – no one could doubt that it took Pelosi ’s leadership to deliver a congressional vote in favor of a national health care system that eluded President Bill Clinton , Sen .
Ted Kennedy and Dingell ’s father , who first introduced such a bill in 1943 .
“ The p resident appreciates the speaker 's strong committed leadership without which this historic vote would not have occurred , ” White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told POLITICO in an e-mail as soon as the vote was secured .
“ Every American who is barred from insurance because of a pre-existing condition , every American who can't afford coverage or is hurt today by out - of - pocket costs that are more than they can bear , owes Nancy Pelosi a debt of gratitude tonight for the leadership she has provided to move us close to a new and better day . ”
Her colleagues say Pelosi ’s drive separates her from her peers .
“ Her focus , her vision , her tenacity , her energy , ” gushed Hoyer , the Maryland Democrat who was a onetime rival of Pelosi ’s , at a post - vote press conference .
It can be seen in her assiduous attention to the details of policy , her willingness to use every tool in a leader ’s arsenal – persuasion , threat , reward , retribution – to put together coalitions , and her ability to prioritize Democratic principles , her colleagues say .
A Democratic insider familiar with Pelosi 's methods says she sets a plan and pursues it , understanding she 'll have to hold a few hands -- and perhaps smack a few others -- along the way .
" The Speaker always has a map in her head and she knows when to invoke history to the caucus versus bring in one person for a three - hour chat , " the insider says .
" And basically where the negotiations will be three weeks from now -- but ( she ) knows the members have to go through the process . "
So driven to win passage of the bill was the liberal , pro-choice progressive that she cut a deal with anti-abortion Democrats to prohibit federal funds from subsidizing the procedure – creating a convention - rattling coalition of the House ’s Pro-Choice Caucus and the National Right to Life Committee , which threatened to punish Republicans if they played games with the outcome of the amendment to sink the bill .
The speaker ’s troops savored the Saturday night victory – and feted a legislative leader known for distributing praise to her deputies .
But tonight ’s victory might prove short - lived if it ’s not followed by a similar win in the Senate – and Pelosi ’s team wrenched tough votes from reluctant members who know they are likely to face trouble – if not defeat – back home in 2010 .
But regardless of the obstacles in the path to enactment , Rep. John Murtha ( D - Pa. ) said Saturday 's vote would be the most important moment of Pelosi 's career as speaker .
" I think this is probably the biggest win she 'll have in all the years she serves , " Murtha said of his California colleague .
" This affects every person in the country .
Nothing else , not the [ Iraq ] war , nothing else touches everyone else in the country .
This is the biggest thing she 'll do . "

Para 2010 la Comisi�n Federal de Electricidad ( CFE ) requiere un aumento de 10 % en sus tarifas industriales , comerciales y residencial de alto consumo .
De acuerdo con un documento entregado a la Secretar�a de Hacienda , la paraestatal prev� que los combustibles que emplea para generar electricidad aumentar�n 10.6 % en promedio el pr�ximo a�o .
Actualmente 76 % de las cuotas que cobra la CFE se ajustan de manera autom�tica cada mes para que la volatilidad de los precios de combustibles no impacte en su operaci�n .
Las tarifas restantes ( principalmente dom�sticas ) se modifican de acuerdo con la inflaci�n considerada en los Criterios Econ�micos del Presupuesto federal .
Si los costos de la CFE superan al de la inflaci�n , el gobierno federal aplica un subsidio a los usuarios .
Analistas afirmaron que el alza prevista en la electricidad repercutir�a en un aumento de medio punto en la inflaci�n de 2010 .
El efecto de posibles incrementos en el precio de servicios p�blicos ocasionar� una inflaci�n de 6 % , a�adieron .

Saudi Arabian warplanes attacked Shiite rebel strongholds in northern Yemen on Thursday in a surge of fighting along the border that followed the death of a Saudi security official at the hands of insurgents , according to news reports .
Saudi fighter jets targeted as many as six rebel positions in Yemen and along the mountainous border .
Saudi troops reportedly were heading toward the region to secure villages and prevent further cross - border incursions by Houthi rebel forces , which have been sporadically battling the Yemeni government since 2004 .
Saudi airstrikes “ began on their [ rebel ] positions in northern Yemen ” late Wednesday afternoon , an advisor to the Saudi government told Reuters .
The advisor asked not to be named because operations were still underway .
“ There have been successive airstrikes , very heavy bombardment of their positions , not just on the border but on ” rebel camps around the northern city of Saada .
The Yemeni government has not released a statement on the Saudi offensive , but Al Jazeera news channel quoted a Yemeni Defense Ministry official as saying , “ Saudi Arabia did not hit targets in Yemen . ”

The prospect of violence spilling over from its southern neighbor has troubled the Saudi kingdom for years .
Yemen , the poorest country in the Arab world , is attracting militants from Al Qaeda who seek to overthrow the government and launch attacks across the Middle East , U.S. officials say .
The Saudis fear that Al Qaeda elements will exploit Yemen ’s instability to infiltrate the kingdom and attack government targets and oil installations .
In August , a Saudi militant living in Yemen entered the kingdom and , armed with hidden explosives , blew himself up at a palace reception .
The attack lightly wounded Muhammad bin Nayef , a member of the Saudi royal family and the country ’s top counter - terrorism official .
On Tuesday , militants believed to be linked to Al Qaeda ambushed and killed two Yemeni police chiefs and three guards .
At least 40 rebels are reported to have been killed in the Saudi airstrikes , which were launched after insurgents crossed into the kingdom Tuesday and killed a Saudi security officer and wounded 11 others in a raid near Jebel Dukhan .
Yemen ’s rugged northern region along the Saudi border is home to tribes and clans that largely live beyond the reach of the government .
The Houthi insurgents belong to the Shiite Muslim Zaidi sect , which ruled Yemen for centuries until the 1962 national revolution .

The Yemeni government began the Operation Scorched Earth offensive against the rebels in August .
Fighting has been steady for months , and tens of thousands have fled their homes for displacement camps .
The government has blocked most news agencies from reaching the areas of heaviest bloodshed .
The insurgency has broader regional implications .
The Yemeni government asserts that Shiite Iran is aiding the Houthis as a means of broadening its influence .
Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh is an ally of Sunni Muslim - controlled Saudi Arabia , which has criticized Iran ’s support for the Islamic militant groups Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Gaza Strip .

A botnet that was once responsible for an estimated third of the world 's spam has been knocked out of commission thanks to researchers from security firm FireEye .
After carefully analyzing the machinations of the massive botnet , alternately known as Mega - D and Ozdok , the FireEye employees last week launched a coordinated blitz on dozens of its command and control channels .
The channels were used to send new spamming instructions to the legions of zombie machines that make up the network .
Almost immediately , the spam stopped , according to M86 Security blog .
Last year , the email security firm estimated the botnet was the leading source of spam until some of its servers were disabled .
The body blow is good news to ISPs that are forced to choke on the torrent of spam sent out by the pesky botnet .
But because many email servers already deployed blacklists that filtered emails sent from IP addresses known to be used by Ozdok , end users may not notice much of a change , said Jamie Tomasello , an abuse operations manager at antispam firm Cloudmark .
The takedown effort is significant because it shows that a relatively small company can defeat a for - profit network that took extraordinary measures to ensure it remained operational .
Not only did Ozdok reserve a long list of domain names as command and control channels , it also used hard - coded DNS servers .
When all else failed , its software was able to dynamically generate new domain names on the fly .
With head chopped off of Ozdok , more than 264,000 IP addresses were found reporting to sinkholes under FireEye 's control , an indication of the massive number of zombies believed to have belonged to the botnet .
FireEye researchers plan to work with the ISPs to identify the owners of the orphaned bots so their owners can clean up the mess .
FireEye researchers said the key to dismantling the giant ring was a coordinated effort that worked in multiple directions all at once so that bot herders did n't have a chance to counteract .
" As it turns out , no matter how many fallback mechanisms are in place , if they are n't all implemented properly , the botnet is vulnerable , " they wrote . ®
Im Zentrum der Affäre steht die Supermarktkette Edeka - Simmel , die Peter Simmel , Aufsichtsrats - Chef von Edeka , betreibt .
Wie FOCUS aus internen Geschäftspapieren erfuhr , spionierten Privatdetektive Supermarkt - Angestellten der bundesweit 32 Edeka - Simmel - Filialen systematisch hinterher .
So führten Detektive nicht nur heimlich Hausvisiten bei krank gemeldeten Mitarbeitern durch , sondern filzten nach Schichtende die Privatautos der Angestellten .
Warengutscheine statt Urlaubsgeld
Aus Verträgen und einer Arbeitsanweisung vom 12 .
Januar 2009 geht hervor , dass die beauftragen Detektive pro Woche 20 Wagen kontrollierten .
„ Wenn Mitarbeiter sich weigern , den Wagen zu öffnen , drohen wir damit , die Polizei zu rufen und verweisen darauf , dass dieses sicherlich arbeitsrechtliche Konsequenzen haben werde “ , berichtete ein Detektiv FOCUS .
Die Münchner Arbeitsrechtlerin Dorthee Wilcke sagte , der Wink mit der Kündigung könne auf eine „ strafbare Nötigung hinauslaufen “ .
Firmenchef Peter Simmel weist solche Vorwürfe zurück .
Nur in einem einzigen Fall habe es eine Wagenkontrolle gegeben .
Die Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft Ver.di kritisierte Passagen der Arbeitsverträge für Simmel - Beschäftigte als „ rechtswidrig “ .
Zudem begleiche der Unternehmer Urlaubs - und Weihnachtsgeld sowie Überstunden mit Warengutscheinen .
Diese könnten dann nur in Simmels Edeka - Märkten eingelöst werden .
„ Warengutscheine können als Lohnersatz nicht beitragsfrei erbracht werden “ , so Dirk Bühl von der deutschen Rentenversicherung Bund zu FOCUS .
Ver.di-Fachabteilungsleiter
Hubert Thiermeyer kündigte an : „ Wir werden Anzeige erstatten und den Vorgang an die Prüfbehörden weiterleiten . “
Man Misdiagnosed of Coma for 23 Years ; Was Conscious All Those Times
No one wants to last a whole night having nightmares , so imagine being in a single nightmare for 23 years .
A Belgian engineering student was put into a deep coma and vegetative state after a car accident .
He was in that condition for 23 years .
However , he was conscious and has been able to hear all conversations around him during all those time .
It was Dr. Steven Laureys , a neurological researcher at the Liege University Hospital , who discovered that Rom Houben is conscious using brain scanning techniques despite the fact that he lost control of his body .
His discovery now brings fears that there may be many similar cases around the world .
Houben , who now communicate using a specialized computer , said that he always dreamed of a better life , that frustration is too small of a word to describe what he had felt all those years and that he will never forget the day it was discovered what really is wrong with him and that it felt like it was second birth .
The opposition accuse Mr Lugo of seeking to hold on to power
Paraguay 's president has sacked the head of the armed forces , after warning some officers were plotting a coup against him .
The commander has been replaced by a general seen as more loyal to President Fernando Lugo .
Two days ago he also replaced the heads of the army , navy and air force , after warning of what he called " pockets of coup - plotters " in the military .
The opposition has accused him of trying to strengthen his hold on power .
Rear Adm Ciber Benitez was the fourth military commander to be fired in just a few days by the president , who took office in August 2008 .
He will be replaced by Gen Juan Oscar Velazquez , seen as very loyal to Mr Lugo .
Local media reported that the sacking follow rumours of meetings between senior military figures and the political opposition over the weekend .
Support for Mr Lugo , a former Catholic bishop , has been damaged by recent allegations that he fathered the children of three women during his time as a priest .
In May he admitted responsibility for one of the children but denies the other allegations .
Paraguay returned to democracy in 1989 after 35 years of military rule under Gen Alfredo Stroessner .
Not only the networks of all political persuasions that come to mind , but the mindset they represent …
When I was growing up , Eyewitness News always found a house on fire in South Buffalo .
" Tonight 's top story , " Irv Weinstein would intone , " … a fire in South Buffalo . "
Every single night .
If you watched the news from out of town , you were sure that the city must have completely burned to the ground .
Cable news thinking has nothing to do with fires or with politics .
Instead , it amplifies the worst elements of emotional reaction :
Focus on the urgent instead of the important .
Vivid emotions and the visuals that go with them as a selector for what 's important .
Emphasis on noise over thoughtful analysis .
Unwillingness to reverse course and change one 's mind .
Xenophobic and jingoistic reactions ( fear of outsiders ) .
Defense of the status quo encouraged by an audience self - selected to be uniform .
Things become important merely because others have decided they are important .
Top down messaging encourages an echo chamber ( agree with this edict or change the channel ) .
Ill - informed about history and this particular issue .
Confusing opinion with the truth .
Revising facts to fit a point of view .
Unwillingness to review past mistakes in light of history and use those to do better next time .
If I wanted to hobble an organization or even a country , I 'd wish these twelve traits on them .
I wonder if this sounds like the last board meeting you went to …

A recent article in the New York Times reported that the military has become frustrated with President Barack Obama because he has n’t quickly decided to risk more of their lives in an Afghan war that is likely to be unwinnable .
In a post - World War II world that has featured a non-traditional militarized foreign policy of profligate interventions into the affairs of other nations , the U.S. military and its opinion have acquired great prestige and are accorded hushed reverence in American society .
The military and flag are worshiped as never before .
But is this really patriotism ?
The nation ’s founders would roll over in their graves at what patriotism has become .
After their bad experience with British colonial military abuses and seeing European citizens paying with blood and treasure for the frequent wars of their monarchs , the founders feared standing armies for undermining liberty .
The U.S. Constitution rejected European militarism in favor of tight congressional controls over the employment , organization , and funding of the U.S. armed forces .
Since World War II , those controls – such as congressional declarations of war – have been severely eroded .
And the American public , still feeling guilty over the admittedly terrible treatment of returning draftees from the Vietnam War , has retained its awe of the now voluntary military as an institution , even as it has soured on the Iraq and Afghan Wars .
Even while fighting two unpopular wars , the public has supported huge defense budgets all out of proportion to what is needed to defend the country .
Is this healthy for a republic ?
The politically incorrect answer to this question is a resounding " no ! "
Being genuinely patriotic means supporting the country ’s society and culture .
Excessive reverence for the U.S. government , military , and flag is merely nationalism and is similar to episodes in Russia , Germany , and Japan in the last century .
And slathering the military with too many resources tempts politicos , such as George W. Bush and Madeleine Albright , to dream up unneeded military adventures overseas , which many times end in disaster .
True American patriotism , following in the tradition of the founding , rejects militarism without rejecting an appropriate role for the military .
According to the Constitution , the active military should " provide for the common defense " and nothing more .
This limited role should rule out the military being used to invade other nations for ostensibly lofty purposes .
To be even more politically incorrect , on 9/11 , the U.S. military failed in this primary mission .
No one was fired over this tragic fiasco .
Since then , the military has been used to make things worse and actually undermine U.S. security .
Armchair quasi-patriots – unfortunately , most of the country – do n’t like to acknowledge what triggers al - Qaeda ’s heinous attacks in the first place : U.S. interventions in Islamic countries .
In both the counterproductive Afghan and Iraq invasions and occupations , the military made huge mistakes before having to relearn counterinsurgency warfare tactics purposefully forgotten in the wake of its debacle in Vietnam .
Does repeated incompetence deserve veneration ?
One might then say so much for the military organization and its leaders , but should n’t we still have reverence for the frontline soldier who risks his or her life for our freedom ?
Unfortunately , military personnel – like the general public from which they come – are under the same aforementioned delusion about what " patriotism " should be .
One could argue that war is sometimes necessary for defense – although the current U.S. offensive - defensive strategy is unneeded , unconstitutional , and counterproductive – but war rarely leads to increased freedom , as the founders knew .
The civil liberties erosion under the " war on terror " is illustrative .
Also , military personnel should know , or take the time to learn if they do n’t , that the U.S. has been the most aggressive country on the planet during the Cold War and since in terms of the number of foreign military interventions .
Therefore , a new patriotism is needed .
As a start , let ’s stop worshiping the military and flag and bring back the founders ’ old - fashioned respect for liberty and the Constitution .
