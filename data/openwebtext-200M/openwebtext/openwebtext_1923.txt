Bush Outlaws All War Protest In United States
By : Sorcha Faal , and as reported to her Western Subscribers
In one of his most chilling moves to date against his own citizens , the American War Leader has issued a sweeping order this week outlawing all forms of protest against the Iraq war .
President Bush enacted into US law an ‘ Executive Order ’ on July 17th titled " Blocking Property of Certain Persons Who Threaten Stabilization Efforts in Iraq " , and which says :
" By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America , including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act , as amended ( 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq . ) ( IEEPA ) , the National Emergencies Act ( 50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq . ) ( NEA ) , and section 301 of title 3 , United States Code ,
I , GEORGE W. BUSH , President of the United States of America , find that , due to the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by acts of violence threatening the peace and stability of Iraq and undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq and to provide humanitarian assistance to the Iraqi people , it is in the interests of the United States to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13303 of May 22 , 2003 , and expanded in Executive Order 13315 of August 28 , 2003 , and relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive Order 13350 of July 29 , 2004 , and Executive Order 13364 of November 29 , 2004 . "
According to Russian legal experts , the greatest concern to the American people are the underlying provisions of this new law , and which , they state , are written ‘ so broadly ’ as to outlaw all forms of protest against the war .
These provisions state :
" ( ii ) to have materially assisted , sponsored , or provided financial , material , logistical , or technical support for , or goods or services in support of , such an act or acts of violence or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order ; or
( b) The prohibitions in subsection ( a ) of this section include , but are not limited to , ( i ) the making of any contribution or provision of funds , goods , or services by , to , or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order , and ( ii ) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds , goods , or services from any such person .
( c ) the term " United States person " means any United States citizen , permanent resident alien , entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States ( including foreign branches ) , or any person in the United States .
All agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order and , where appropriate , to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken . "
To the subsection of this new US law , according to these legal experts , that says " ... the making of any contribution or provision of funds , goods , or services by , to , or for the benefit ... " , the insertion of the word ‘ services ’ has broad , and catastrophic , consequences for the American people in that any act deemed by their government to be against the Iraqi war is , in fact , supporting the ‘ enemy ’ and therefore threatens the ‘ stabilization of Iraq ’ .
In an even greater affront to the American people are the provisions of a law called The Patriot Act , and that should they run afoul of this new law they are forbidden to allow anyone to know about it , and as we can read as reported by the Seattle Times News Service :
" The [ Patriot ] act also expands the use of National Security Letters , which are a kind of warrant that the Justice Department writes for itself , authorizing its agents to seize such things as records of money movements , telephone calls and Internet visits .
Recipients of a National Security Letter are not allowed to tell anyone about them , and so cannot contest them . "
It is interesting to note , too , that this is not the first time that the United States has unleashed the brutal power of their government against its citizens to further their war aims and stifle domestic dissent , as during the European conflict of World War I they enacted a law called The Sedition Act of 1918 and which " ... forbade Americans to use " disloyal , profane , scurrilous , or abusive language " about the United States government , flag , or armed forces during war . "
It is curious to note that after the enactment of this new law there has been no protest by any of the other political leaders in the United States , with the exception of the only Muslim member of the United States Congress , Minnesota Democrat Keith Ellison , and who compared President Bush to the Nazi War Leader Adolph Hitler by stating the attacks upon the World Trade Center could be likened to the burning of the Reichstag .
Today , as the United States faces an imminent economic collapse , while at the same time its war bill has reached the staggering amount of $ 648 billion , one of the last freedoms the American people have had to protest their leaders actions against them , and other peoples in the World , has now been taken away from them , the freedom to speak and write in opposition to what is being done to them .
" If liberty means anything at all , it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear . " , said the great British writer George Orwell , but , and sadly , liberty has been lost to the once free people of the United States who are no longer allowed to tell their leaders , or each other , what they do n’t want to hear .
With this being so , the American people should , likewise , contemplate their ‘ new ’ future , and as , also , stated best by George Orwell , " If you want a vision of the future , imagine a boot stamping on a human face - forever . "

The area covered by sea ice in the Arctic has shrunk to its lowest level since satellite measurements began nearly 30 years ago , opening up the Northwest Passage â€ “ a long - sought short cut between Europe and Asia that has been historically impassable .
In the mosaic image above , created from nearly 200 images acquired in early September 2007 by the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar ( ASAR ) instrument aboard ESAâ€™s Envisat satellite , the dark gray color represents the ice - free areas while green represents areas with sea ice .
Leif Toudal Pedersen from the Danish National Space Centre said : “ We have seen the ice - covered area drop to just around 3 million sq km which is about 1 million sq km less than the previous minima of 2005 and 2006 .
There has been a reduction of the ice cover over the last 10 years of about 100 000 sq km per year on average , so a drop of 1 million sq km in just one year is extreme .
To give you an idea of how big 1 million sq km is that is about 386,000 sq miles , or 1.5 times the size of Texas .
With melting this year 10 times the average are we experiencing the tipping point ?
The tipping point would be when there is enough dark ocean water not covered with white reflective ice that the amount of heat absorbed would make it impossible for ice to reform .
It is extremely hard to calculate just when this point will happen , but we can imagine what the results of such a scenario would be .
The first thing we would notice is a rapid , and out of control melting ( see above ) , this would be because as more ice melts , more heat is absorbed , which melts more ice , which allows more heat to be absorbed , which melts more … you get the idea .
The second thing we would notice is that the ice that did form this winter would not extend as far as previous years ( we will have to wait to see this data as the ice usually continues to melt until mid/late September ) .
If the ice does fail to recover this winter it means that all winter long the water exposed to the sun will be kept at a higher temperature than it normally would and next summer the ice will melt that much faster .
“ The strong reduction in just one year certainly raises flags that the ice ( in summer ) may disappear much sooner than expected and that we urgently need to understand better the processes involved . ”
Arctic sea ice naturally extends its surface coverage each northern winter and recedes each northern summer , but the rate of overall loss since 1978 when satellite records began has accelerated .
The most direct route of the Northwest Passage ( highlighted in the top mosaic by an orange line ) across northern Canada is shown fully navigable , while the Northeast Passage ( blue line ) along the Siberian coast remains only partially blocked .
To date , the Northwest Passage has been predicted to remain closed even during reduced ice cover by multi- year ice pack â€ “ sea ice that survives one or more summers .
However , according to Pedersen , this yearâ€™s extreme event has shown the passage may well open sooner than expected .
The previous record low was in 2005 when the Arctic area covered by sea ice was just 4 million sq km .
Even then , the most direct Northwest Passage did not fully open .
The Polar Regions are very sensitive indicators of climate change .
The UNâ€™s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change showed these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted the Arctic would be virtually ice free by the summer of 2070 .
Still other scientists predict it could become ice free as early as 2040 due to rising temperatures and sea ice decline .
click for larger animation above .
The prospect of a warm arctic , is in short not a good one .
Not good for polar bears , not good for the people who live in the arctic , and even though they think it would be a gold rush , not good for industrialized countries either .
If this is the tipping point , it might be a little late to do much .
But if this is just a small taste of things to come , well we still have some time .
Quick direct action to lower CO2 emissions will make progress towards healing this problem .
Things are starting to get pretty serious .
I wonder will we start to act ?
The longdesc lottery
Let 's talk about the longdesc attribute .
In HTML 4 , it 's defined as a pointer to a long description for a complex image .
Anyone can learn how to write a good long description .
There 's only one problem : virtually no one bothers , and virtually everyone who does bother gets it wrong .
Let 's quantify that .
In August 2007 , Ian Hickson analyzed a sample of 1 billion < img > elements in Google 's index .
Approximately 1.3 million ( 0.13 % ) had a longdesc attribute .
That 's OK , you say , not every image needs a longdesc attribute .
And you would be right .
But regardless of whether it 's needed or not , it 's not being used that often : just over one in a thousand images .
Now let 's look at how often the longdesc attribute is actually used correctly .
Of course this is a more subjective question , but we can spot some obvious errors .
Out of those 1.3 million images with a longdesc attribute , let 's subtract the ones where the longdesc attribute ...
is blank
is not a valid URL
points to the image itself ( i.e. the same URL as the src attribute )
attribute ) points to the page you 're already on
points to the root level of another domain
is the same as a parent link 's href attribute ( i.e. the longdesc is redundant because you could just follow the image link instead )
That knocks out a whopping 1.25 million ( about 96 % ) right off the bat .
That 's not 96 % of all the images on the web ; that 's 96 % of the 0.13 % of images that included a longdesc attribute in the first place .
And when you take a closer look at the remaining 50,000 ( 4 % of 1.3 million ) , the results get even worse : links to other images , links gone 404 , links to one - line text descriptions identical to the alt attribute , and links to pages that describe the image size but not its contents ( Wikipedia , I 'm looking at you ) .
Extrapolating back to 1.3 million , that 50,000 shrinks to about 10,000 .
That means that less than 1 % of images that provide a longdesc attribute are actually useful .
No more than one in a hundred get it right , of one in a thousand that even try .
Meanwhile , the very people advocating for keeping the longdesc attribute have recently conducted some user testing .
That is , testing how well an actual blind person with an actual screen reader can read actual web pages .
It turned out that the test subject did n't know that longdesc even existed before the tester told him about it .
Can you blame him ?
99.87 % of the images he 'd ever encountered had no longdesc attribute at all .
Even if he had known about it , and he had actually stumbled across one , he would still be up against 99 to 1 odds that following it would be worth his time .
He has a better chance of winning the lottery .

According to NBC ’s David Gregory we ’re all missing the very important points that Ann Coulter makes because we get caught up in her hate speech .
He just said to Elizabeth Edwards “ if you strip away some of the inflammatory rhetoric against your husband and other Democrats , the point she ’s trying to make about your husband , Senator Edwards , running for the White House is in effect that he ’s disingenuous … ”
Okay , so much wrong with the way Gregory defends Coulter .
Her hateful , inflammatory rhetoric ca n’t be stripped away — and let ’s be honest , that ’s why NBC and ABC put her on their t.v. shows .
In typical fashion , he also tries to paint everyone with the same kind of hate speech .
So , instead of putting Coulter on , NBC now has one of their top reporters defending her approach .
Because , you know , if you strip away the fact that Coulter advocated the assassination of a leading presidential candidate , and mocked his dead son , there ’s really such an important message buried inside .
Huh ?
Says so much .
Elizabeth Edwards handled it well , pretty much laughing at him — and made the key point — this is not about stripping away hateful rhetoric .
The hate speech is the issue :
The traditional media has created Ann Coulter .
They feed the beast .
They enable her and her hate speech .
And , we ’re just all really stupid because we think the hate rhetoric matters .

newswire article reporting oregon & cascadia actions & protests 1,000 people get in Bushs Face Calling for Impeachment author : Mollie Despite the warnings from the media to avoid the demonstration in Bellevue on August 27th all the streets were going to be closed , it would be dangerous , they said about 1,000 people showed up to register their views .
It was an upbeat crowed perhaps because it was a rare opportunity to get in front of Bush to let him know what we think .
Maybe because Gonzo resigned and it now feels that the Bush administration is unraveling .
A handful of Republicans many have greeted Bush inside the hotel yesterday but the people in the streets did not .
They carried a range of signs to tell Bush what they thought of him and his policies .
Impeachment predominated but there were many other issues that concerned people , including ending the war .
Some were also critical of the U.S. Representative who was the beneficiary of this $ 1,000 a plate , $ 10,000 per photo op with Bush fundraiser .
People came from across the state to join together .
They started gathering early and lined the streets with signs .
In Microsoft - wealthy Bellevue , they found a lot of kindred spirits .
As one person in an expensive car said as she drove by , " Even rich white people are fed up with Bush . "
Others stayed at the Bradford Center to hear speakers and songs .
Then the march began .
Without a permit , we stayed on the sidewalks .
The line of marchers stretched for blocks .
Many drivers in cars and trucks -- honked and waved in support .
Surprisingly , only two streets were cordoned off and even then , we were able to get close to the hotel .
It was a rare summer day and we made a joyful noise as we marched and then lined up around the intersection of Bellevue and 108th st .
The Bellevue police were in everyday uniforms and on bikes .
They were laid back and they were n't out in force .
Toward the end of the demonstration , some people pushed the envelope by going across the fence .
Then the storm troopers came out but they did not appear to do anything other than stand there to maintain the boundary .
Clearly , the police have learned how not to overact or restrict people from expressing their first amendment rights the recent court cases that forced cities to pay money for police violations had an effect .
Whether the Republicans have figured out that supporting Bush plus the war will result in defeat 2008 is unclear .

Two recent scientific discoveries mark the latest steps toward the ultimate medical - diagnosis technology : the tricorder .
Bones McCoy made Star Trek 's portable black box famous by using it to diagnose ailments without ever touching a patient .
Now , studies show that the tricorder is closer to becoming reality , because of new medical - imaging technology and a new state of matter .
" When we were conceptualizing ( our experiment ) , we saw the ultimate device should be noninvasive , giving you the molecular details of the disease going on inside the body , " said Howard Chang of Stanford University 's Comprehensive Cancer Center .
" I think a tricorder is a useful idea ....
It shows the gap between what we have now and what we hope technology will achieve in the end . "
Scientists have been trying to construct a tricorder - like device for years , but no one has managed to pack all the functions of a true tricorder – point , pull a trigger and diagnose – into one handheld unit .
Last year , Purdue University researchers unveiled a shoebox - size molecular scale that can chemically weigh everything from tumor markers in urine samples to potential explosives residue on luggage .
Attempts at replicating the tricorder 's geographic omniscience have recently been chronicled .
And in 1996 , a Canadian company surfaced long enough to stamp the name Tricorder on a handheld electromagnetic sensor and weather station .
Combining the technologies into one compact box may take decades .
But the two latest discoveries offer incremental advances in diagnostic medicine – pointing toward more portable and less invasive medical technologies .
Several lab - on - a- chip technologies have brought diagnosis to handhelds , but they still require a tissue sample .
Chang 's group has developed a way to observe gene activity without so much as a cheek swab .
Another advance could lead to portable imaging technology as powerful as machines that today occupy entire rooms .
Chang and his co-authors have linked visible patterns in computed tomography , or CT , scans of liver - cancer patients with cancer - gene activity .
" ( We 're ) trying to put a patient in a CAT scan and image the human genome in their tumor , " said Michael Kuo , an assistant professor of interventional radiology at the University of California at San Diego .
For example , the scientists could determine whether the gene that spurs the growth of blood vessels , called VEGF , was turned on or off , by statistically analyzing a CT image .
Experimental treatments such as vaccines and gene therapies attack tumors by shutting down this gene 's ability to feed cancer tumors with new blood vessels .
Instead of taking an invasive biopsy that could put sick patients at risk , a noninvasive CT scan could determine the activity of VEGF and many other genes .
The findings , in the May 21 online edition of the journal Nature Biotechnology , show scientists have associated more than 5,000 genes with CT imaging traits .
In the other research , scientists have developed a compact , precision - magnetic microscope based on a new state of matter .
The technology , the researchers said , is as effective as current imaging devices such as MEGs for the brain and MCGs for the heart , which require a hospital visit because the devices are large and expensive .
It 's made possible by a state of matter discovered just 12 years ago called the Bose - Einstein condensate .
Physicists at UC Berkeley have developed the device by harnessing a special property of Bose - Einstein condensates : Because they are cooled close to absolute zero , they are as free of vibrations and thermal noise as a quantum system can be , and are thus like a quiet , acoustically pristine concert hall .
Tiny magnetic fields that might be unobservable in other systems are easily picked up .
Dan Stamper - Kurn , assistant professor of physics at Berkeley , and his colleagues published the work in the May 18 issue of Physical Review Letters .
Unlike the superconductors that power current magnetic imaging , Stamper - Kurn 's device is cooled not by gigantic refrigerators but by lasers – making the prospect for miniaturization bright .
" I do n't know when will come the day that you can strap a Bose - Einstein condensation experiment to your head , " Stamper - Kurn said .
But , he added , both the lasers and the vacuum chambers needed to make a condensate are shrinking fast .
Dmitry Budker , a physicist at Berkeley ( not a co-author of the paper ) , believes the work could lead to a high - powered magnetic microscope , studying computer chips or individual cells and neurons .
" As with all new technologies , " Budker said in an e-mail , " unexpected vistas might open . "

Why are poor people in America so fat ?
Would you believe that farm subsidies have something to do with it ?
Walmart is where lower income consumers come to shop .
Why ?
Because you get the most bang for your buck .
Walmart is also notorious for having the fattest customers .
Why ?
It comes back to value - it turns out that unhealthiest food also gives you the most caloric bang for your buck .
Do n't pretend you do n't know what I 'm talking about
I shop at a grocery store that borders on one of Seattle 's ghettos .
In case you are wondering , Seattle 's ghettos are nothing compared to other urban ghettos .
Meaning , you can safely walk through a Seattle ghetto .
But that 's where the majority of Seattle 's urban poor live , and if you want to see food stamps in action , you should shop at my Safeway .
Food stamps are no longer in stamp form in Washington State - people are given debit cards that are referred to as " benefit cards " .
Benefits cards are usually easy to spot , if you are looking .
But you do n't have to look at a person 's form of payment to know what social class they belong to - you need only look at their shopping cart , and their waistline .
This is anecdotal , of course , but no doubt you 've noticed this , too : poor people eat more crappy junk food than rich people .
There 's a tendency in America to equate poor nutrition and subsequent obesity with a lack of education .
It 's familar logic : the poor are n't educated enough to work , so they stay poor .
Being uneducated means that they do n't know that Doritos are bad for you .
Or , if you look to what a lot of us secretly think , the poor are simply too dumb to eat salad , too simple to know that Twinkies do not make a healthy meal .*
Why would someone who has so little money to spend go and spend it on packaged food ?
we wonder to ourselves .
Do n't they know what a waste of money it is to buy junk food ?
We tsk tsk them in our heads .
We load up our carts with loose leaf lettuce and portabella mushrooms , thinking ourselves superior for knowing better .
Once we get to the checkout counter and see the total cost of our veggies , though , we probably do end up thinking : wow , it 's really expensive to be healthy .
From the NY Times ( via Consumerist ) :
As a rule , processed foods are more “ energy dense ” than fresh foods : they contain less water and fiber but more added fat and sugar , which makes them both less filling and more fattening .
These particular calories also happen to be the least healthful ones in the marketplace , which is why we call the foods that contain them “ junk . ”
Drewnowski concluded that the rules of the food game in America are organized in such a way that if you are eating on a budget , the most rational economic strategy is to eat badly — and get fat .
Bang for your buck
It is expensive to eat well , even if you are only buying raw veggies .
The truth is that lower income shoppers , and other populations that live on junk food , are getting more calories per dollar than the rest of us .
It 's economically efficient , if tragically perverse .
The reason , as the New York Times article explains , has to do with the Farm Bill , which heavily subsidizes soybeans , corn , and wheat - three major ingredients , or sources , of many of the ingredients in junk food .
The result ?
[ T ]he real price of fruits and vegetables between 1985 and 2000 increased by nearly 40 percent while the real price of soft drinks ( aka liquid corn ) declined by 23 percent .
The reason the least healthful calories in the supermarket are the cheapest is that those are the ones the farm bill encourages farmers to grow .
So even foods that are more processed , that require more labor to produce , cost less .
The article goes on to explain the origins of the Farm Bill and the detrimental , albeit unintended , effect it is having on our population .
The farm bill helps determine what sort of food your children will have for lunch in school tomorrow .
The school - lunch program began at a time when the public - health problem of America ’s children was undernourishment , so feeding surplus agricultural commodities to kids seemed like a win - win strategy .
Today the problem is overnutrition , but a school lunch lady trying to prepare healthful fresh food is apt to get dinged by U.S.D.A. inspectors for failing to serve enough calories ; if she dishes up a lunch that includes chicken nuggets and Tater Tots , however , the inspector smiles and the reimbursements flow .
The farm bill essentially treats our children as a human Disposall for all the unhealthful calories that the farm bill has encouraged American farmers to overproduce .
Do click over and read the rest of the article .
The author gives a good breakdown of calorie - per - dollar - spent between carrots and junk food .
It ends on a hopeful note , claiming that the resurgence in organic farming and local produce , combined with consumer demands and the American ideal of a free market economy , may give us a chance to reclaim our farming heritage and our health .
I 'm not sure that I 'm so optimistic about our chances for revamping what seems like extremely complicated and pork - filled legislation .

* Because so many people keep reading this sentence and thinking that I actually believe that the poor are dumb , I 'd like to point out that the sentence is meant to generalize about the way that many wealthy Americans think about the poor , NOT THE WAY THAT I FEEL ABOUT THE POOR .
My god , people , do you really think a web site dedicated to helping readers learn how to save money would feature a writer who loathes the poor ?
GET A GRIP .
And for the record , I 'm pretty fat myself , so it 's not like I 'm making fun of anyone for eating badly .
The Ministry of Defence plans to open its " X - Files " on UFO sightings to the public for the first time .
Officials have not yet decided on a date for the release of the reports , which date back to 1967 , but it is hoped to be within weeks .
The move follows the decision by the French national space agency to release its UFO files in March , the first official body in the world to do so .
UFO buffs will be keen to find out what officials knew about some of the UK 's most famous sightings and whether any action was taken .
One celebrated event - at Rendlesham Forest , Suffolk , in 1980 - has been dubbed " Britain 's Roswell " after the UFO incident in the US in 1947 .
At Rendlesham there were several witness reports of a UFO apparently landing .
The released files should support or discount claims that radiation was detected at the site after the event .
David Clarke , a lecturer in journalism at Sheffield Hallam University and author of Flying Saucerers : A Social History of UFOlogy , said opening the MoD 's files would make it harder to sustain the idea that evidence for the existence of aliens has been suppressed .
" The more of this stuff that they put on their website or put in the national archives , the less it will cost the taxpayer , because at the moment people are writing in about individual incidents and they are having respond , " said Dr Clarke , referring to requests under the Freedom of Information Act .
The documents due for release are witness reports of apparent UFO sightings , many by civil pilots and military personnel .
Most were simply collected and filed by a small , secret unit within defence intelligence called DI55 .
A few are thought to have been investigated further by the military , but the details have never been made public .
There are 24 files due for release , each containing 200-300 reports of sightings , plus internal MoD briefings and correspondence .
Again , the appropriate follow - up would be , " There you are again , Karl , a story that perfectly mirrors Libby 's felonious perjury . "
And this -- not later , after Karl has safely hidden in his dark little world - - would be the appropriate time to raise the fact that Rove leaked this information to Cooper with no caveats .
MR. ROVE : Well , but I — my recollection is , “ I ’ve heard that , too . ”
So — but the point is , if , if , if a journalist had said to me , “ I ’d like you to confirm this , ” my answer would have been , “ I ca n ’t .
I do n’t know .
I ’ve heard that , too . ”
Notes ?
Novak has notes ?
In spite of the fact he has in the past Novak said he did n't have notes ?
MR. GREGORY : But he , he took those notes down just as you said them .
MR. GREGORY : But that ’s an important distinction , because the — you — “ I heard that , too , ” suggests that you heard it from somebody else rather than knowing it yourself .
But the more important question would be , " Karl , that line , ' I 've heard that too , ' exactly parallels the line that Scooter Libby claims to have used with journalists , that he had simply ' heard this news from journalists . '
Is it just a freakish coincidence that your story about your involvement in this leak so perfectly resembles Libby 's story - - a story that a jury has already determined to be a deliberate lie ? "
Ah , the ongoing legal proceedings dodge .
You 'd think , at a minimum , Gregory would have pushed Rove for a commitment to come clean after the dismissal is held up on appeal .
MR. ROVE : No .
And I , I remember it slightly differently .
I remember saying , “ I ’ve heard that , too . ”
Let , let me say this .
There is a civil lawsuit filed by Mr. Wilson and Ms. Plame .
It has been tossed out at the district court level .
They ’ve announced their intention to appeal .
I think it is better that I not add anything beyond what is already in the public record until that suit is resolved .
But , as I ’m — my recollection is that I said , “ I heard that , too . ”
We — I would point you to ...
Note , Gregory did n't focus on the Administration 's earlier claims that Karl was not involved in the leak .
Rather , he sets the bar higher , with Bush 's quote that he would " take care of " ( and how - - can you say commutation ? ) anyone who " violated laws . "
MR. RUSSERT : Then you go on to say , in the book , “ Senior White House adviser Karl Rove returned my call late that afternoon [ July 8 th , 2003 ] , ” the same day .
“ I mentioned I had heard that Wilson ’s wife worked at the CIA in the counterproliferation section and that she had suggested Wilson be sent to Niger .
I distinctly remember Rove ’s reply , ‘ Oh , you know that , too . ’
Rove and I also discussed other aspects of Wilson ’s mission , but since he never has disclosed them publicly , neither have I . ”
So you considered Rove ’s comments , “ Oh , you know that , too , ” as a confirmation ?
MR. GREGORY : Robert Novak , who divulged Valerie Plame ’s name in his column , appeared on this program with Tim Russert back in July , and Tim asked about his book .
Watch .
PRES .
GEORGE W. BUSH : If there ’s a leak out of my administration , I want to know who it is .
And if the person has violated laws , that person will be taken care of .
MR. GREGORY : Let me talk about the CIA leak case , of which you were obviously a , a central part .
This is what the president said in 2003 after the identity of Valerie Plame was divulged in a Robert Novak column .
Watch .
So it falls to me to do what Gregory ought to have done while he had Karl in front of him .
Here 's the transcript , with my annotations :
Not surprisingly , when David Gregory had Karl Rove on Meet the Press this morning , he never called Rove on any of Rove 's misrepresentations .
That 's par for the course , on NBC .
When Russert had Bob Novak on , he did n't call him on any of the misrepresentations , either .
( Though to NBC 's credit , they had Matt Cooper on to smack Karl around after Karl was gone . )
Of course , both Russert ( as Libby 's fictional source for Plame 's identity ) and Gregory ( as one of the people whom Ari Fleischer leaked Plame 's identity to ) are key players in this story .
They 're not exactly reporting from a position of comfort or clarity .
MR. GREGORY : It , it , it ’s important to point out that the special prosecutor , Patrick Fitzgerald , declined to bring any criminal charges against you .
But given the president ’s emphatic statement about getting to the bottom of this , were you ever held to account by the president for what you did ?
MR .
ROVE : You know , I acted in an appropriate manner , made all the appropriate individuals aware of , of , of my contact .
I met with the FBI right at the beginning of this , told them everything .
You ’re right , the special prosecutor declined to take any action at all .
I was never a target .
In fact , it ’s — what ’s interesting to me is that the person who did give the name , Richard Armitage , we found out at the end of the process , did , did have the conversation with Novak , took no action against him either .
Two appropriate follow - ups .
First , " Are you saying that you told Bush that you leaked to Matt Cooper and confirmed the story for Bob Novak ? "
And after Rove does n't answer that , you ask " Did the story you told the FBI in October 2003 resemble the story you told in your fifth ( FIFTH !?!?!?!) grand jury appearance in April 2006 ? "
And finally , you point out that , in fact , even Bob Novak does n't claim Richard Armitage gave him " the name " -- that that remains one of the items in Novak 's column that had a virgin birth .
[ To be more specific : As Jeff points out , Novak and Armitage dispute whether Armitage gave Novak Valerie 's first name , but neither claims Armitage gave Novak the name " Plame , " which is the true virgin birth in Novak 's column . ]
MR. GREGORY : Was it an inappropriate investigation ?
MR .
ROVE : It ’s entirely appropriate to look into these kind of things , sure .
MR .
GREGORY : Should Armitage have come forward sooner , do you think , to the administration ?
Ug , David ?
Coming forward on October 1 in an investigation that was publicly announced on September 29 ... that 's pretty early in the process , do n't you think ?
Or are you asking whether Armitage should have ' fessed up publicly to his involvement earlier ?
Because that would be a downright breathtaking question from the one journalist known to have received a leak of Plame 's identity , who has not yet come forward with his story of that leak .
MR. ROVE : That ’s — that was his decision , and those are the people who were advising him .
That ’s fine .
MR .
GREGORY : The president seemed frustrated that he did n’t .
You mean the President -- the guy whom then White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales worked and still works for ?
Because Armitage offered to tell him all the details , but Gonzales refused .
MR. ROVE : I , I ’m , I ’m going to leave it there .
Ah , I see .
Bush really did know , and like Libby , you 're just covering up for his involvement in these leaks ...
MR. GREGORY : Do you think you owe Valerie Plame an apology ?
MR .
ROVE : No. MR .
GREGORY : You do not ?
MR. ROVE : No .
Shorter Rove :
If I apologized , that lawsuit would get put back into play faster than you can say " Valerie Plame is a CIA spy . "
MR. GREGORY : You considered her fair game in this debate ?
MR .
ROVE : No .
And you know what ?
Fair game , that was n’t my phrase .
That ’s a phrase of a journalist .
In fact , a colleague of yours .
This is a really fascinating dodge .
We know from Fitzgerald 's fall 2004 affidavits that Rove claimed Tweety wrongly characterized this comment -- that was one of the many reasons why Fitzgerald suspected Rove was lying his ass off , he was even trying to deny these post - Novak leaks .
But he does n't deny that he said something to this effect , here .
Just that Tweety made up the phrase .
MR. GREGORY : Was she an appropriate target in this debate ?
MR .
ROVE : No. MR .
GREGORY : She was not .
Watch this closely , ladies and gentlemen , because this is as close as Karl Rove will ever come to admitting he was wrong for leaking Plame 's identity .
Okay , this next bit will require a multi-step debunk :
MR. ROVE : No .
Look , her husband wrote a op - ed that we now know by — in a statement issued on July 11th by the director of the CIA , backed by a report by the Senate Select Intelligence Committee , was misleading and inaccurate .
The vice president , the White House and the director of the CIA did not send Mr. Wilson to Africa to look into — to the question of uranium cake from Niger to Iraq .
Okay , check for yourself .
Does Joe Wilson say -- anywhere in the op - ed -- that the vice president , the White House or the director of the CIA sent Joe Wilson ?
Here 's the exact quote :
In February 2002 , I was informed by officials at the Central Intelligence Agency that Vice President Dick Cheney 's office had questions about a particular intelligence report .
While I never saw the report , I was told that it referred to a memorandum of agreement that documented the sale of uranium yellowcake — a form of lightly processed ore — by Niger to Iraq in the late 1990's .
The agency officials asked if I would travel to Niger to check out the story so they could provide a response to the vice president 's office . [ my emphasis ]
Wilson said that " agency officials " asked him to go to Niger , not Cheney , Tenet , or the White House .
And in fact , Tenet 's statement does n't refute this scenario , either -- it completely supports it .
Rove 's statement is just a shameless lie-- and Gregory likely knows that , too , since he was critical of all the White House prevaricating the week of the leak .
We also know that he did — he came — the information he came back with was not dispositive , was not conclusive , did not disprove the British intelligence finding that the Iraqis had attempted to acquire uranium cake .
In fact , we now know that he brought back information not disclosed in his article that added to the belief , that confirmed the British intelligence report that the Iraqis had attempted to acquire uranium cake .
This is actually some pretty admirable Rovian jujitsu .
It 's jujitsu because Wilson 's trip could not have been an attempt to confirm the British report -- which was published on September 24 , 2002 , since he went on the trip in February 2002 .
More importantly , Rove is pretending that Wilson was sent to confirm or deny the story that Iraq was trying to acquire uranium from Iraq , which is a blatant lie .
In fact , Wilson was sent to confirm whether Niger had signed a contract with Iraq to deliver uranium , a claim the administration gave up about the time of the British report .
Moreover , the SSCI report that Rove has just cited claims that Wilson 's report was never used to confirm or deny the case for uranium ( though that , too , is deceiving , since it was used after the IAEA had debunked the forgeries to sustain the case ) .
He brought back information about a previously unknown contact where the Iraqis , working through a third party , attempted to bring and did bring to Niger a trade delegation .
This , I believe , is a case of Rove believing his own ( or Libby and Cheney 's ) propaganda ) .
Baghdad Bob -- the " trade delegation " in question -- never went to Niger .
Rather , the meeting in question happened in Algeria , on the margins of another meeting .
But BushCo likes to claim that the meeting happened in Niger because it confuses the issue and plays into their propaganda .
And since the only thing Niger had to sell was uranium cake that was on a U.N. sanctions list , they declined to do any business .
He brought back information that affirmed the , the British intelligence report .
After this all came out , the British did a study , did a review , appointed a commission to review their intelligence finding and came back and confirmed that they stood by their original assessment that , that Iraq had attempted to acquire uranium yellow cake from Niger in — and exactly as was in the president ’s speech .
Uh huh .
And yet subsequent reports have proved that the British were still relying on the same crappy forgeries the Bush Administration was .
I 'd say that 's cause to start a war .
So Rove has exonerated himself precisely how ?
So Rove , after admitting Valerie Wilson was not an appropriate target ( forgive me , he 's probably thinking , I got carried away !!! ) , basically can't even lay out a factual case against Joe Wilson either ?
No wonder they ended up going after Valerie .
Gen Kiley testified in Congress over the case last week
Gen Kiley becomes the third top - ranking official to lose his job over Walter Reed conditions , which were highlighted last month by the Washington Post .
President Bush has said he is " deeply troubled " after reports of cockroaches and rats in some hospital buildings .
Gen Kiley had filed a " request to retire " on Sunday , the army said .
However , a senior Pentagon official speaking on condition of anonymity said the acting US Army Secretary , Peter Geren , had asked Gen Kiley for his retirement .
The secretary of the army and the head of the medical centre have quit over the reports .
At war
" I submitted my retirement because I think it is in the best interest of the Army , " Gen Kiley , who had overseen the army 's medical services , said in a statement .
" We are an Army Medical Department at war , supporting an Army at war - it should n't be and it is n't about one doctor , " the statement said .
The 56 - year - old was commander of Washington 's Walter Reed Army Medical Center from 2002 to 2004 .
Major General Gale Pollock , the Deputy Surgeon General , will replace Gen Kiley until a permanent replacement is found .
" I have confidence she will carry out her responsibilities and lead with skill and distinction , " said Peter Geren .
' Huge embarrassment '
Gen Kiley has been accused of playing down the reports by the Washington Post and ignoring earlier warnings about sub -standard care at the hospital .
The scandal over Walter Reed erupted in February
The suspicion will be though that the man who initially played down the reports of cockroaches , mice and mould in the rooms of wounded war veterans , has been pushed , says the BBC's James Coomarasamy in Washington .
This was a scandal which would have been a huge embarrassment at any time , but is particularly bad just as the Bush administration is sending more troops into Iraq , our correspondent says .
The chairman of the House armed services committee said the removal of top Army brass was only a first step towards solving the problems at Walter Reed .
" But this step alone will not fix the problems that our wounded and injured service members experience when they are in recovery , " Representative Ike Skelton said in a statement .
" With the installation of new leaders , the real test will be making sure that the work fixing problems actually gets done , " he added .
The artwork is typical of Banksy 's anti-war stance

Bombing Middle England , which is made from acrylic and spray - paint on canvas , reached double its highest estimated price of £ 50,000 at Sotheby's .
The artist 's Balloon Girl also sold for £ 37,200 , while another piece called Bomb Hugger fetched £ 31,200 .
But a rare signed artwork , Precision Bomber , failed to sell .
' Sensational result '
The previous highest price paid for one of the artist 's distinctive spray paintings was £ 62,400 in October 2006 , when the image of a couple embracing clad in deep sea diving gear - which was used for the cover of Blur 's Think Tank album - went for 10 times its estimated value at Bonhams .
" It 's a sensational result , " said Elli Varnavides , head of the impressionist , modern and contemporary art department at Sotheby 's Olympia branch .
" It 's a record for any Banksy sold at international auction . "
Another sale at Sotheby 's New Bond Street auction house raised £ 45.7 m on Wednesday evening .
Sotheby 's said the total was a record for a contemporary art sale in Europe .
The highest priced lot was White Canoe by British artist Peter Doig , which was bought by an anonymous bidder for £ 5.7 m , a record for the artist .
Other sales included Gerard Richter 's Abstraktes Bild which went for £ 2.8 m and Roy Lichtenstein 's Still Life with Oysters , Fish in a Bowl and Book , which fetched £ 2.7 m .
Mystery man
Banksy , whose true identity has never officially been revealed , became famous for creating politicised stencils on the walls of public buildings .
His high - profile stunts have included painting " I want out " inside the elephant enclosure of London Zoo and a painting of a ladder on the partition wall in Israel 's West Bank .
Last year , he doctored copies of Paris Hilton 's album to show the singer topless with a dog's head , and placed a life - sized replica of a Guantanamo Bay detainee inside the Disneyland theme park in California .
A gang of thieves tried to capitalise on his success last month by attempting to steal the door of a derelict building in Liverpool which featured one of his paintings .
One art expert said the price showed Banksy was becoming more of a household name .
" Our figures show that prices for contemporary art have risen by 12 % in the last year alone , " said Charles Dupplin of insurance firm Hiscox .
" It 's no surprise that pieces of art like this are fetching bigger sums . "
Three more Banksy paintings go on sale in Sotheby 's on Thursday in one of the biggest weeks for art auctions the UK has ever seen .
On Monday , sales at Sotheby 's Impressionist & Modern Art sale in central London made almost £ 95 m , a new European record .
Forty - three years ago , when I reached what my grandfather imagined to be the eve of puberty , I was summoned to spend the weekend with him at his house in rural Connecticut .
I knew what to expect because my four older brothers had undergone the same rite of passage .
The climax of the weekend would be the ceremonial presentation of a double - barreled shotgun , followed by sober instruction on firearm safety and general manliness .
Next , my grandfather would take me on an excursion into the woods and we'd fire off a few rounds .
But when my turn came the ritual had changed .
Instead of a gun , I was given a double - barreled pair of binoculars , and then my grandfather took me on my first bird walk .
I was bewildered .
But within an hour my disappointment was forgotten , shoved aside by sheer awe at the sight of a redstart hovering in midair , the sound of a wood thrush 's flute music , the swoosh of chimney swifts rushing in formation overhead .
Out of the cacophony of the dawn chorus , my grandfather taught me to pick out the rhythm of a dropped ping - pong ball in the field sparrow 's song and the towhee 's exuberant " drink your tea ! "
By their silhouettes alone I learned to distinguish a phoebe and a kestrel .
That weekend my grandfather lifted the veil to a world that had not existed for me before .
I did n't want our time together to end because I would have to go back to my family 's farm where , to the best of my knowledge , there were no birds .
Of course , back home in the Berkshires of western Massachusetts , I found all the birds I 'd been introduced to in Connecticut and many more , ambassadors of every color : electric - blue indigo buntings , blood - red scarlet tanagers , earth - toned veeries .
I still remember the first blackburnian warbler I ever saw , his throat and cheeks so vividly orange , his face looked like it might burst into flames .
Spring and summer mornings thereafter , I 'd wake up and listen to the birds singing in my backyard .
If there was a sound I could n't recognize , I 'd throw on a shirt and pair of pants , grab my binoculars , and track it down , something I still do today .
In his later years , my grandfather used to grumble that birds were becoming scarcer and scarcer .
It was tempting to write off his gloom as the natural tendency of the elderly to romanticize the past , or maybe just an old man 's deteriorating hearing and eyesight .
But it was true that the whippoorwill that had kept me awake nights when I visited him as a boy had gone quiet , and the woods and fields of the Northeast felt emptier to me .
Earlier this summer , the National Audubon Society released a definitive study of population trends of North American birds , a monumental effort based on decades of Christmas bird counts and breeding bird surveys .
The study confirms what my grandfather feared and what most of us now know .
Birds that I used to see routinely growing up in New England – evening grosbeaks , eastern meadowlarks , northern bobwhites – are in free fall .
The losses are mind - boggling .
Since my grandfather introduced me to birds just half a lifetime ago , once - common species have declined by as much as 80 percent due to the usual suspects : habitat loss , pesticides , introduced species , and climate change .
The songs of tens of millions of birds have been silenced .
It feels as if the lights are dimming .
In one sense , extinction is hugely overrated .
The vast majority of animals and plants that disappear hardly leave a ripple in the pool of life .
Species become rare , they disappear , yet ecosystems persist .
In some cases biological communities are fundamentally altered because of the missing pieces , but most of the time the ecological effects of extinction of species like Bachman 's warbler or even ivory - billed woodpeckers are hardly measurable .
The true loss is spiritual and aesthetic , not functional or economic .
Life would go on if every Shakespeare play and Beethoven sonata were destroyed , but to use the words of the Audubon report , our skies would be " a little quieter and the landscape a little drabber . "
Of course , we 'll always have CDs of bird song and DVDs of bird behavior to fall back on – a digital memory , as it were – but will that be enough ?
I can see now that my grandfather 's rite of passage was really about connecting us with the land .
It was about learning how to become intimate with our world 's signs , smells , sounds , textures and rhythms .
It was about knowing where we are and who we are .
How wonderful it would be to be able to pass that gift on to my own grandchildren .

Alexander the Great

In the wake of Oliver Stone 's epic movie about the Macedonian conqueror 's life we at LiveScience believe a reassessment of his triumphs is needed to right the wrongs inflicted by Colin Farrell 's hair , Angelina Jolie 's lips and Val Kilmer 's performance .
Trained in philosophy by Aristotle
Bust of Aristotle from Palazzo Altemps , Roma .
How many of history 's great leaders can claim to have had one of the greatest philosophers of all time as their personal tutor ?
Out of all the intellectuals at the prestigious Academy in Athens , Alexander 's father , Philip , chose Aristotle ( 384-322 B.C. ) to instruct his 13 - year - old son .
Aristotle , who had been the student of Plato , was offered a handsome salary to move to the town of Mieza , deep in the Macedonian countryside .
In the nearby Temple of the Nymphs , Aristotle taught the young prince geography , zoology , politics and medicine .
Alexander was greatly influenced by the philosopher 's teachings .
On later military campaigns , Alexander brought scientists with him and sent plant and animal specimens back to his former mentor .
Tamed the horse Bucephalus
Detail of Alexander and Bucephalus , ( 1859 -61 ) by Edgar Degas , in National Gallery of Art , Washington .
Philip , Alexander 's father , bought a horse called Bucephalus for the exorbitant price of 13 talents ( 1 talent = 27 kg of gold ) , but the rambunctious animal bucked all comers .
Watching the futile attempts , Alexander noticed that the animal was frightened by its own shadow .
He bet his father that he could mount the horse .
By turning Bucephalus toward the sun so its shadow was behind it , Alexander was able to climb into the saddle and gallop around triumphantly .
To which his father said : " My boy , you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions .
Macedonia is too small for you . "
Bucephalus remained Alexander 's faithful steed until it died in what is now present - day Pakistan , fighting elephant - mounted brigades .
Assumed Father 's Throne in Timely , but Ruthless , Manner
Macedonian coin showing Philip II as the god Zeus ( c 336-329 B.C. ) .
Alexander 's father , Philip , was stabbed by one of his bodyguards in 336 B.C. at a wedding banquet .
Although few scholars think that Alexander was directly involved in the assassination , he wasted no time dispatching any possible rivals - even instructing his mother , Olympias , to execute the infant son of Philip 's last wife .
Alexander spent the next two years quelling rebellions in the lands conquered by his father .
Thebes revolted on a false rumor that Alexander was dead .
Showing no mercy , Alexander slaughtered or sold into slavery 30,000 inhabitants before leveling the city to the ground .
After such an example , there were no significant uprisings in Greece during Alexander 's 12 - year Asia campaign .
Perfected Macedonian Military Style , the Phalanx
The Macedonian phalanx .
The most distinctive element of the Macedonian war machine was the phalanx .
Developed by Alexander 's father , the phalanx was a tight formation of soldiers - usually 16 by 16 - carrying shields and sarisses , which were 20 - foot - long spears made of cornel - wood .
The back rows of the phalanx held their sarisses upright , hiding the movement of forces behind the lines , while the front rows kept the enemy at bay with an impenetrable wall of sharp pikes .
On flat terrain , the phalanx proved unbeatable .
Alexander also had at his disposal light auxiliaries , archers , a siege train , and a cavalry .
Thanks to his father , Alexander 's army was largely a professional one .
In earlier times , Macedonians would stop fighting during the harvest , but Philip and Alexander paid the men enough that they could afford to be soldiers full - time .
This meant they were often better trained than their adversaries .
Crossed the Hellespont
Alexander with his spear at the Hellespont gazes at a personification of Asia , from a fresco from Boscoreale , Museo Archeologico Nationale .
After solidifying his rule of Macedonia and Greece , Alexander looked east to Asia and the Persian Empire , which was led by Darius III .
Alexander assembled an allied Greek army of 5,000 cavalry and 32,000 infantry to avenge the Persian invasion of Greece in 490 B.C. With 60 naval vessels , Alexander crossed the Hellespont ( a narrow strait separating Europe and Asia - now called the Dardanelles ) in 334 B.C. From his ship , Alexander threw his spear onto the shore .
As he took his first steps in Asia , he pulled his weapon from the sand and declared that these lands would be won by the spear .
But the first order of business was a little tourism !
Being quite fond of the Trojan War story -- to the point of keeping a copy of Homer 's Iliad tucked under his pillow -- Alexander made a special trip to Troy to perform several sacrifices and to trade some of his armor for a sacred shield in the Temple of Athena .
Untied Gordian Knot , Loosed Metaphor for the Ages
Alexander cuts the Gordian Knot , by Jean - Simon Berthelemy , in Ecole des Beaux - Arts , Paris .
According to legend , the Phrygians , who lived in what is now central Turkey , were told by an oracle to make king the first man to ride into town in an oxcart .
As luck would have it , this man was Gordius , a poor peasant .
After his coronation , Gordius dedicated his cart to the god Zeus and tied it to a pole outside the temple .
The knot was made of cornel bark , which hardened over time .
It was said that whoever untied this intricate knot would conquer all of Asia .
Alexander could not pass up such an opportunity , but there were no ends to the knot for him to even get started .
In frustration , he sliced it in half with his sword , proclaiming , " I have loosed it ! "
The Gordian Knot has since become synonymous with an intractable problem that requires an unconventional solution .
Simply Divine : Declared Son of a God
The Siwa oasis where the shrine of Zeus Ammon was located .
After defeating the Persians at the Battle of Issus , Alexander decided to enter Egypt , which had been under Persian rule for almost 200 years .
The Egyptians despised the Persians for their heavy taxes and religious intolerance .
They gladly anointed Alexander as pharaoh , initiating a cultural exchange between Greece and Egypt that lasted for the next three hundred years .
While in Egypt , Alexander also made the dangerous journey across the desert to the shrine of Zeus Ammon .
It is said that he was guided by ravens and blessed with rain .
Upon his arrival , the priest apparently told him he was the son of Zeus .
Whether or not Alexander believed in his own divinity , he played the stories to his own advantage .
Founded Alexandria ; Became Poster Child for Librarians
The building of Alexandria ( seen here in a medieval European fresco ) .
Besides razing cities , Alexander also founded about 20 new ones , naming most of them after himself .
The most enduring of these is Alexandria on the coast of the Nile delta .
In a superb natural harbor where the Persians had once erected a fortress , Alexander had his architects build a grand city along Greek lines .
Alexandria later developed into a cosmopolitan port , with schools , theater , and one of the greatest libraries of antiquity .
Greeks ran the city 's administration , but Egyptians were allowed to keep their customs and religion -- though they could only become citizens if they learned Greek and accepted Greek traditions .
Defeated the Persians
Alexander in battle defeating Darius III - detail from a Roman mosaic , excavated in Pompeii ( c. 79 B.C. ) .
After less than a year in Egypt , Alexander resumed to chasing after the Persian emperor , Darius III .
At the plains of Gaugamela , Darius assembled an army of 200,000 , which included cavalry wearing chain mail and chariots with blades spinning out of the wheels .
Alexander 's 47,000 men attacked Darius ' flanks , splitting the Persian forces , while Alexander charged into the center .
The Persians broke ranks and were routed .
Darius escaped by horseback , only to be later killed by one of his own men .
Having conquered the Persians , Alexander was named King of Asia .
He took Babylon and Persepolis , the Persian capital .
In an attempt to solidify his rule , he began to dress like a Persian , and married a Persian dancer named Roxanne .
His men found it unbecoming of their king that he thought it necessary to please a defeated enemy .
Extended Empire Into India ; Partied -- and Died -- Like a Rock Star
Detail from The Battle Between Alexander and Porus by Nicholas Berchem .
Alexander believed Asia ended just on the other side of India .
Wanting to conquer the continent , he persuaded his men to march east .
The Indian king Porus and his elephants fell to Alexander , but the weather and the mountains wore out his men .
It soon became clear that Asia was larger than believed .
With his campaign suffering from " mission drift , " Alexander succumbed to his men's pleas and turned back .
But he decided on a circuitous route : down India 's rivers to the ocean , then along the coast back to Persia .
It was probably Alexander 's greatest mistake , as 15,000 of his men died of starvation or heat in the Gedrosan Desert -- more than all those he lost in battle .
The journey may have taken its toll on Alexander as well .
At a banquet back in Babylon , he drank excessively -- as usual -- then fell ill of a fever , possibly due to malaria .
( Though a number of causes , including poisoning , have been suggested . )
He died a few days later , just shy of his 33rd birthday .
Was Erwin Schrödinger really a dog lover ?
June 21 , 2007 at 3:00 am thinkingshift
I ask this question because of what Schrödinger did to that poor feline in his famous thought experiment of 1935 .
Let ’s recall what he did to kitty before we find out how said kitty cat may thankfully be rescued from the brink of death .
Schrödinger was an Austrian scientist who ( along with Einstein ) refused to accept quantum mechanic ’s notion that nothing is real and that we cannot predict or say anything about what is happening when we are not observing .
In other words , the act of observation creates reality .
To demonstrate the absurdity of the quantum world , Schrödinger ’s thought experiment placed a live cat in a box that contained radioactive material .
Quantum mechanics tells us that the cat exists in an indeterminate state : neither dead nor alive .
This is the phenomenon of superposition – both alive and dead .
There is no reality until the box is opened and the cat is observed – then , Hello Kitty !
The act of observation forces the object to take the position of either dead or alive .
This thought experiment caused Einstein to utter : “ God does not play dice “ .
In our everyday world , we think of an object as being in either position A or B .
In the quantum world , however , objects can exist at both A and B simultaneously .
In 1982 , a scientific team tested Schrödinger ’s mythical cat concept when they sent two photons or particles of light flying off into opposite directions at the speed of light .
The photons were observed and , measurements made on one photon , had an instantaneous effect on the behaviour of the other photon – suggesting that they are inextricably linked and that their interaction and information exchange disobeys Einstein ’s theory that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light .
This experiment showed that superpositions really do occur .
But it ’s not easy to spot a cat both alive and dead in real life , so we can never really see the phenomenon of superposition for ourselves !
Okay so much for the theory , now for an interesting question : what if kitty could be brought back from the brink of death ?
This question revolves around something scientists have been pondering – exactly how does measurement achieve which position an object takes and is there any way to undo the effects of measurement ?
In 2006 , scientists took a quick peek inside the box to check out kitty ’s state ( reported in Science Vol 312 , p 1498 ) and they found that rather than collapsing in an instant , the superposition proceeds towards collapse one step at a time .
It is this gradual collapse that might save Schrödinger ’s cat : scientists believe they could monitor kitty ’s state and undo any damage the monitoring has done .
The May 12 issue of New Scientist ( sorry , subscription needed ) reports on a landmark thought experiment that may save kitty , which is to be conducted by physicist , John Martini , at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
Here ’s how it will happen :
a loop of superconducting wire ( known as a phase qubit ) will be manipulated by firing a finely tuned microwave pulse at the loop ;
this will put the qubit in a ‘ cat state ’ ( dead or alive ) ;
to find out whether kitty is dead or alive , the researchers will look to see whether the qubit performs a quantum trick called tunnelling ;
when a quantum particle is faced with an insurmountable barrier it can take advantage of the uncertainty principle , which says you can never precisely define all the particle ’s properties .
So this means there is a small probability we will find the particle on the other side of the barrier having tunnelled its way to a higher energy state .
Of course , if the particle has tunneled , it means the measurement was completed and kitty is dead or alive .
The trick is to catch the qubit before it tunnels .
To sneak a peak at the qubit ’s state midway through its collapse , the researchers induce a steadily increasing voltage across the wire .
This teases the qubit into thinking about tunnelling .
The voltage is then lowered , which is like opening the box and quickly closing it again .
Lowering and raising the energy barrier acts as a “ weak form of measurement ” .
If the qubit has n’t tunnelled , it is in the lower energy state and its delicate superposition has not been destroyed .
To undo any harm that has been inflicted , another microwave pulse , known as a pi-pulse , is fired at the qubit .
This reverses the quantum state of the qubit ie back to a high energy state – and so it ’s as if the qubit had never been disturbed at all because the second measurement cancels out the first one .
Weak measurements give the opportunity to peek into the box and partially determine kitty ’s fate ( eg the cat may be close to expiring ) , undo the weak measurement and restore kitty to the original unknown quantum state .
What ’s the point of all this ?
well , scientists have up to now thought of quantum measurements as creating reality – until things are measured , they have no independent existence .
But if some forms of measurement , such as weak measurement , are reversible , then the theories of quantum mechanics go far , far deeper than scientists have thought .
If you create reality with weak measurements , does undoing the measurement erase the reality you created by doing the measurement ?
So maybe we do n’t actually live in a real or permanent cosmos because , just maybe , it could one day unravel before our very eyes .
Phew ! poor kitty !!
I pinched the image accompanying this post from Boing Boing – part of the LOLCats fun they ’ve been having over there .
UPDATE : March 2010
First quantum effects seen in visible object but kitty not alive yet !

At the end of last night 's morbidly titled " THIS WEEK AT WAR , " CNN host Tom Foreman dramatized the importance of the 2008 Presidential election by deeming it a war - time election .
He beseeched viewers to watch CNN 's upcoming Presidential debates .
The Democrats will air this evening , June 3rd and the Republicans follow Tuesday , June 5th .
Mr. Foreman stressed with theatrical flair , the precarious state of our world , then challenged viewers of the debates to ask TOUGH questions of the candidates .
I respond to Mr. Foreman with similar flair , and offer the same challenge to CNN , and to all media venues as I have been doing for a very long time :
Once and for all , ask TOUGH questions of the candidates .
Not trivialities about haircuts and personal residences which undermine the seriousness of the debate .
Be adult .
Be professional .
Ask the candidates who want to control this nation what PERSONAL sacrifice they 're willing to make on its behalf .
Do n't accept ad nauseam responses like " hard work " as you have in the past , making the questioner as buffoonish as the ' responder . '
Do n't characterize simple walks across the stage as bullying , or sighs as inability to lead .
Do n't place summations in the hands of facile observers like William Bennett , Donna Brazile , and J.C. Watts .
Believe me , drama queens Wolf Blitzer , Paula Zahn , Bill Schneider and Tom Foreman are inflammatory and irresponsible enough .
Back to my customary challenge :
To every candidate on stage and off , regardless of political affiliation , if they support the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , you must ask the critical questions I 've requested so many times before : ( http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0817-33.htm).
- Who in your immediate family is now serving in this war ?
- Who in your immediate family will soon serve in this war ?
- Will your children or grandchildren EVER serve in this war ?
- If yes , when and in what capacity ?
- If no , WHY THE HELL NOT ???
I mean , come on !
America 's history is filled with wealthy , politically powerful families who served valiantly in the military .
Even George Herbert Walker Bush served heroically in World War II ( or so it is said ) .
Just the opposite is true today .
Take the Romney family for example .
Have you seen Mitt Romney 's campaign commercial ?
The 'oh so butch ' montage of successive Mitts in impressive knits ?
The G.Q. Mitt pimping American machismo ?
The ESQUIRE Mitt pumping American strength ?
The GLAMBO Mitt , posed and poised to replenish our military with as many enlistees as he can ?
Relying , of course , on O.P.'s.
Other People 's daughters and Other People 's sons .
Did you know that Mitt , the incredibly wealthy warhawk candidate , has FIVE ADULT SONS ?
And not one of them , including their Glambo Dad , has ever served in the military ?
Not even the Massachusetts National Guard which is now serving in Iraq ?
This may seem contradictory for a family whose patriarch vows to increase the military , and vehemently supports the war .
But the Romneys are n't the least bit concerned with hypocrisy .
They 're different from the Bushes who hide their service age young 'uns from we - the - people so we do n't notice they 're not in The War .
On the Bush front , however , I am pleased to report the contrived re-appearance and Naval Reserve enlistment of Jeb 's eldest son , George P. Naturally , George P. wo n't see any action .
Nonetheless , I do take pride in believing I helped provoke ' P's re-emergence , having written critically of his disappearance in December of last year ( http://www.commondreams.org/views06/1216-21.htm).
But Mitt 's sons have always been non-militarily " out " to the public .
As if to say , ' Come on !
We 're Romneys .
We 're wealthy .
Yes , our Daddy supports this war , but WE'RE not expected to fight it .'
Instead the brothers are on danger - free duty on the homefront , blogging ( http://fivebrothers.mittromney.com) for their candidate Dad , who is proud of their ' hard work ' :
" My sons tell me it 's time to contribute to their blog with a dispatch from the campaign trail .
Boy , are they working hard â€ “ and having fun at the same time !
Iâ€™m told the Five Brothers blog is one of the most popular features on our web site . "
There 's that ' hard work ' stuff again .
Pardon my Olberman moment , but ...
Mr. Romney , HAVE YOU NO SHAME ???
It would be one thing if Romney were n't such a rah - rah supporter of this illegal , immoral war .
A war that has killed nearly 3,500 of our young men and women in Iraq , nearly four hundred more in Afghanistan , and gravely wounded tens of thousands .
But it 's beyond reason how Romney and warmongers like him can cavalierly pimp a war for others , yet never send their own .
In this nation and this world , a person 's value is measured more by wealth than by character ( Donald Trump , Sumner Redstone and Rupert Murdoch as examples ) .
It 's ludicrous to presume the sons of the super - rich would be permitted to serve in war .
Take for example , Britain 's Prince Harry .
Mitt Romney is reportedly worth in excess of two hundred million dollars .
Beyond that , his sons and grandchildren have a purported trust fund of another seventy million .
The Romney 's are n't regular guys like Casey Sheehan , Jesus Suarez del Solar , Patrick McCaffrey , Sherwood Baker , Jeffrey Lucey , Jonathan Castro , Evan Ashcraft , and the thousands more who perished unnecessarily in George Bush 's War .
The Romneys are special ... too precious to be sacrificed .
In truth , I personally do n't believe in war .
Especially NOT the War On Iraq .
I do n't want to see ANYONE serving in it .
Not a Romney , a Giuliani , or even a Bush .
But I do believe in parity .
In equality .
In carrying equal weight .
Which is why I continue to challenge the media to take warmongers to task regarding their personal and familial sacrifice for the war they all support .
Of course I know there are stock , pre-rehearsed answers to questions like these in the rarefied chance they are asked :
' I do n't force my children to do what I want , or believe as I believe .
They have the freedom to pursue their own actions and will . '
I also understand that the children of a powerful politician or wealthy individual would likely receive preferential treatment in the military .
Yet the questions should still be asked .
If the candidates are honest , they will admit they DON'T WANT their children or grandchildren to serve .
Which is why they are chickenhawks .
Which is why using the power of the Presidency to sacrifice Other People 's children , be they American , Iraqi , Iranian , Palestinian or Darfurian is wrong !
This morning in a pre-debate interview , CNN's Wolf Blitzer interviewed Mitt Romney 's eldest son , Tag .
He asked Tag 's thoughts on Mitt as a Dad and a role model .
Blitzer never once asked Tag why he or his brothers were n't serving their nation in the War their father supports .
Why not , Blitzer ?
It 's an honorable question .
Why do n't you and your cronies do your damn job ???
The fact is , absent a pre-existing medical condition , Tag could n't have a legitimate prohibitive response .
Being a father , a spouse , a son , a grandson , a brother , a business owner , a student , or an employee do n't exclude one from war .
Each of these categories is pemissible for military service and thousands in these categories are serving .
Challenge the chickenhawks .
Other People 's children must n't be sacrificed for war !
( Author 's Note : The Romneys have been spotlighted in this article .
However the issue is the same for ALL candidates .
If war - supporting candidates expect OTHER PEOPLE'S children to serve , they should expect the same service of their own ! )

BERLIN , Sept. 21 ( UPI ) -- German TV journalists have identified three CIA agents involved in the kidnapping of Khaled el - Masri , a German - Lebanese extraordinary rendition victim .
The undercover names of three men currently living in North Carolina were provided by Spanish police , the public TV station NDR said in a statement .
UPI held off publishing the names as we could not independently confirm them .

Spanish officials also told the Germans that el - Masri was kidnapped by a team of 13 agents , who flew him in a Boeing 737 , flight N313P , from Macedonia to Afghanistan .
Earlier they had touched down on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca .
A TV crew from NDR went to the United States to face the agents , who were identified after they had paid with their credit cards for an overnight stay in Mallorca .
All three alleged agents declined to comment , but at least one of them works for a company allegedly linked to the CIA and its extraordinary rendition program , which aimed to move terrorist suspects to third countries where they were interrogated and allegedly tortured .
A German Green Party politician has since called on German prosecutors to issue a warrant for the arrest of the men .
El - Masri was hauled off a bus on Dec. 31 , 2003 .
Roughly three weeks later , the CIA flew him to Afghanistan , where he was held for five months in a secret prison and repeatedly abused .
In a testimony to German parliament earlier this year , el - Masri mentioned foot chains , hooded guards and repeated beatings aimed at forcing him to admit that he was a terrorist .
The CIA released him when they found out they had the wrong man -- el - Masri was not the terrorist suspect they were looking for .
Scientists at the University of Bonn , together with colleagues from Romania , have discovered a gene variant that significantly increases the risk of developing gallstones .
It is estimated that one in ten Europeans has this variant in their hereditary disposition .
For those affected , the likelihood of developing a gallstone in the course of their life is two to three times higher .
The relevant gene contains the instructions for building a molecular pump which transports cholesterol from the liver into the bile ducts – cholesterol being the substance from which most gallstones are formed .
The genetic modification appears to cause this pump to work permanently at high speed .
Gallstones are a common disorder : in Germany alone more than 170,000 gallbladder operations a year are performed .
Gallstones occur very frequently , affecting 15 to 20 per cent of all Germans , usually without noticeable symptoms .
But in around a quarter of cases the stones will announce their presence at some time in the form of a painful colic .
In the end they often have to be operated .
" Gallstones are among the gastrointestinal problems that incur the highest treatment costs , " says Professor Dr. Frank Lammert , the Bonn - based specialist for internal medicine .
Gallstones tend to be found at high levels within certain families .
In particular , studies of twins provide evidence of a genetic component that boosts risk levels .
" We reckon that environmental influences , like the wrong diet , are 70 to 80 per cent responsible for the disorder , " explains Lammert who works in the university hospital 's Department I headed by Professor Dr. Tilman Sauerbruch .
" The rest is caused by genes . "
Professor Lammert – working together with his colleagues Dr. Frank Grünhage , Maja Walier and Professor Dr. Thomas Wienker as well as scientists at the University Clinic of Cluj - Napoca in Romania – has been searching for the specific genes involved .
And he has succeeded , thanks to a study covering 178 women and men from 84 families .
They all suffer from gallstones .
In 21.4 per cent of cases the subjects were found to be carrying a particular gene variant .
In healthy individuals studied as a control group , this variant also occurred , but only at a frequency of 8.6 per cent .
Cholesterol pump at full speed
" The mutation concerns what is known as the ABCG8 - gene , " Dr. Grünhage explains .
" It contains the instructions for building a pump responsible for transporting the blood lipid cholesterol from the liver into the bile ducts . "
Most of the gallstones consist to a high degree of crystallised cholesterol .
The medical researcher concludes that , " The genetic alteration probably makes the pump run permanently at high speed . "
The researchers now hope that their finding will have positive consequences for prevention and therapy .
Professor Lammert thinks that , " It may be possible for certain patients to be helped with drug treatments in future , thus avoiding the need for an operation . "
However , the genetic contribution to the common problem of gallstones has not been fully explained by this study : " We believe there are at least three or four other gene variants that increase gallstone risk , " says the medical scientist .

Updates at bottom : Senate ethics committee may probe , Romney campaign removes YouTube video US Republican Senator Larry Craig on Monday denied " inappropriate conduct " after he was arrested by police investigating alleged lewd incidents in an airport bathroom .
Craig was arrested in the midwestern city of Minneapolis - St Paul in June by a plain clothes police officer , reported Roll Call newspaper , which covers Congress .
Citing court documents , Roll Call said Craig , 62 , pleaded guilty this month to misdemeanor disorderly conduct and paid more than 500 dollars in fines and fees , and had a 10 - day jail sentence stayed .
Shortly after news of the incident broke on the paper 's website , Craig , who represents the western state of Idaho , issued a statement saying he had erred by admitting wrongdoing .
" At the time of this incident , I complained to the police that they were misconstruing my actions .
I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct , " said Craig , who is married , and up for reelection in 2008 .
" I should have had the advice of counsel in resolving this matter .
In hindsight , I should not have pled guilty .
" I was trying to handle this matter myself quickly and expeditiously . "
The report quoted a plain clothes police officer as saying Craig was seated in a stall in the bathroom , and had made gestures consistent with someone " wishing to engage in lewd contact . "
The complete article can be read in Roll Call .
Talking Points Memo has a copy of the arrest report here .
Romney campaign removes Craig video
At least one Republican presidential campaign was affected by Monday 's report that a senator had been arrested for allegedly " lewd " conduct in a men 's bathroom .
" Sen. Larry Craig ( R - Idaho )  who has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in connection with an incident where he allegedly solicited a plainclothes police officer in a men's restroom  is one of Mitt Romney 's top backers in the Senate , " Jonathan Martin writes at Politico .
" A clip of Craig praising Romney was until just moments ago available on Romney 's YouTube channel , but is now listed as ' a private video . " '
The video was later removed from the Internet by the Romney campaign .
Excerpts from article :
#
Explaining why he 's backing Romney , Craig says in the video that it's in part because " he has very strong family values . "
" That 's something I grew up with and believe in , " Craig explains .
In February , the Romney campaign announced that Craig and Sen. Bob Bennett ( R - Utah ) would serve as co-Senate liaisons for the effort .
....
Craig resigned his post today , said Romney communications director Matt Rhoades .
" Senator Craig has stepped down from his role with the campaign , " Rhoades said .
" He did not want to be a distraction and we accept his decision . "

Senate ethics committee may probe A front page article in Tuesday 's edition of the Washington Post notes that Craig 's plea might have consequences at his place of employment .
" Because Craig pleaded guilty to a crime , the incident may be reviewed by the Senate ethics committee , " Paul Kane and Shailagh Murray report .
" Its chairman , Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif. ) , declined to comment last night . "
Analysts , speaking to the Associated Press , believe that Craig wo n't be running for reelection .
" Adding ( the guilty plea ) to the mix complicates his decision at best , and might cause him to rethink his future in the U.S. Senate , " said Jim Weatherby , professor emeritus at Boise State University .
According to the AP , Idaho Democratic Party spokesman Chuck Oxley remarked , " The people of Idaho would have been better served if they 'd heard this ... when it happened . " ( with wire reports )
Mike Rogers first reported last year on Craig 's encounters with men in bathrooms , including one at Union Station in Washington .
On his site , blogActive , Rogers says " there are more where Larry Craig came from . "
He also includes video reports of Craig 's denying involvement in Congressional - page sex scandals in the 1980s .
John McArdle broke the Craig story for Roll Call .

This is the last in our series of posts on working with lines in photography which we highly recommend you check out .
When framing a landscape shot one of the types of environmental features that many photographers look for and like to incorporate in their shots is converging lines .
We ’ve talked previously about how lines have the potential to add interest to an image – but multiple lines that converge together ( or come close to one another ) can be a great technique to lead your viewers eye into a shot .
Perhaps the classic example ( and one that ’s probably been overdone ) of converging lines are railway tracks .
Position yourself in the middle of two tracks ( after taking a look at what might be coming from behind of course ) and you ’ll see the two tracks on either side of you appear to get closer and closer together as they go into the distance .
Note : we do n’t really recommend taking shots on tracks in this way .
Safety first !
Take this shot and the natural reaction for those looking at the scene will be for them to follow the lines off into the distance .
In a sense the two lines act like a funnel which directs the gaze of those entering them in a certain direction .
The same effect can be achieved with roads or pathways , converging fence lines , a set of stairs , power lines or virtually any other lines that run parallel into the distance or that actually converge at some point .
4 Tips Regarding Converging Lines
1. Experiment with Positioning – the classic railway line / road shot described above has many possibilities .
One is to position the tracks dead center and symmetrically in the shot .
Another positioning would be to step to one side of the tracks and let them run diagonally through your frame from a lower corner to the opposite upper corner .
The beauty of this is that you ’ll end up with a more dynamic shot .
Symmetrical and vertical placement of the lines can be powerful but diagonal lines tend to convey movement .
Alternatively stepping away from the start of the lines can give another perspective – as can holding your camera on an angle to give another diagonal framing of the lines .
2. Wide Angle Lenses – different lenses can totally change the impact of a shot with converging lines .
I find that a wide angle lens can be particularly useful – especially when positioning yourself between the two lines .
This will help to give the perception that the distance between the lines at the starting point of the image is wider than it is .
This exaggeration of the width of your lines can have a powerful impact upon your shot .
As you ’re framing your shot ask yourself – ‘ where is the most effective position to frame this ? ”
3 . Positioning the ‘ convergence ’ – one thing to consider when you have converging lines in an image is that they draw the eye into a shot – towards the point that they converge – this becomes one of the most important parts of this image – a focal point .
Keep in mind rules like the Rule of Thirds that says that the intersecting points of imaginary lines a third of the way into an image are key points for positioning points of interest .
This can be a good place to let your converging lines lead ( although breaking this rule can be powerful too )
Also know that if the point of convergence is outside the frame of the shot that you are leading the eye out of your shot .
This could leave a shot unbalanced and with tension – alternatively it could enhance the shot and leave your viewers wondering about the place that they converge .
4. Adding Interest at the Point of Convergence – Sometimes it is worth enhancing the point of convergence with something of interest ( for example waiting until a train appears in the distance on the tracks – or positioning a person at the top of stairs ) – on other occasions the composition of the shot is strong enough without adding an extra subject .
If you ’ve got some examples of converging lines in images that you ’ve taken I ’d love to see them over at the DPS forums – either in the Critique My Shot sections .
Here are a few more Converging Lines shots to illustrate the point and hopefully give a little inspiration .

I made the mistake of reading comp.lang.lisp again , but I shall not rant .
Instead I will just point out that all available data ( that I can see ) is consistent with Common Lisp gaining , not losing , users .
Take for example these three graphs , showing the download activity of three CL implementations hosted on Sourceforge ( Clisp , ECL , and SBCL ) :
Clisp
ECL
SBCL
All three are on the rise : SBCL is positively skyrocketing , ECL has clear upwards trend , and even Clisp is increasing its mindshare .
Of course , it may be that all the new users are coming from implementations for which statistics are n't so easily available , or that the increase is purely illusionary and due to bots — but I doubt it .
Common Lisp is becoming more popular .
If an implementor reading this feels like saying " Yes , our numbers are looking good too . " — or anything else remotely on the topic — just send me an email and I 'll put your success statement right here , next to these glorious lies statistics .
To keep this in perspective , though , the numbers are still pretty small .
... but they keep getting bigger .
Romney 's home state was Michigan , making his 4 - D exemption as a missionary all but automatic because of the relatively small number of Mormon missionaries from that state .
It might have been more difficult in Utah , where the huge Mormon population meant that there were sometimes more missionaries than available exemptions .
Most missions lasted two and a half years , as Romney 's did .
The deferments for Mormon missionaries became increasingly controversial in the late 1960s , especially in Utah , leading the Mormon Church and the government to limit the number of church missionaries who could put off their military service .
That agreement called for each church ward , or church district , to designate one male every six months to be exempted from potential duty for the duration of his missionary work .
Before and after his missionary deferment , Romney also received nearly three years of deferments for his academic studies .
When his deferments ended and he became eligible for military service in 1970 , he drew a high number in the annual lottery that determined which young men were drafted .
His high number ensured he was not drafted into the military .
As the Vietnam War raged in the 1960s , Mitt Romney received a deferment from the draft as a Mormon " minister of religion " for the duration of his missionary work in France , which lasted two and a half years .
Mayo said no records are available from the period that would show how Romney 's deferment was handled .
But he said he recalled " the conclusion was `we really do n't have to worry about [ exceeding the quota ] because we were never in that situation . ' "
By serving as a missionary and being given the deferment , Romney ensured that he would not be drafted from July 1966 until February 1969 .
Romney 's draft record from the time describes him as " minister of religion or divinity student . "
Mayo said the church would have considered Romney a minister .
Romney , who has said he would have served if he had been drafted , shed some light on his view of the matter in a recent interview with the Globe .
" I really dont recall thinking about political positions when I was knocking at the door in France " as a missionary , Romney said .
" I was supportive of my country .
I longed in many respects to actually be in Vietnam and be representing our country there and in some ways it was frustrating not to feel like I was there as part of the troops that were fighting in Vietnam . "
At the same time , Romney said , he was influenced by the statement of his father , then - Michigan Governor George W. Romney , who said in 1967 that he had been " brainwashed " by US officials about Vietnam .
" When my dad said that he had been wrong about Vietnam and that it was a mistake and they had been brainwashed and so forth , I certainly trusted him and believed him , " Romney said .
The exemption for Mormon missionaries created controversy at the time .
Non-Mormons in Utah filed a lawsuit against the federal government in 1968 .
The suit was still in court two years later , at a time when " the church and the Selective Service System work hand - in - hand in deferring the missionaries , " according to an article from the period published by The New York Times .
Richard Leedy , the lawyer who brought the suit , said in a telephone interview that he did so because " the substantial number of deferments to missionaries made the likelihood of us non-Mormons going to Vietnam a lot more likely . "
Separately , Romney 's draft service was deferred due to his status as a full - time student for about three years .
Romney registered with the Selective Service in April 1965 but was not considered readily available for military service until December 1970 .
His name was then put into the lottery based on an individual 's birthday , and he drew the number 300 at a time when no one drawing higher than 195 was drafted .
" When Governor Romney 's deferment for college and missionary service ended , he made himself available for military service , and his name went into the lottery , but he was not selected , " Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom said via e-mail .

審査が甘いキャッシングローンってあるのかしらねえ～
パートで働いている45歳の主婦です。週3～4日くらい近所のスーパーで働いています。ですからいくらかの定収入はあります。が、最近子供たちにお金がかかるようになったことで、家計が赤字になってしまう月もたびたびあるんですよお～困ります！でも、先々のことを考えると、どうしても貯金は崩したくないんです。
だから家計が厳しい月だけ一時的にでもお金を借りられたらいいなあ～と思いますよ～。それゆえ、審査が甘いキャッシングローンの金融会社を教えていただきたいのですけど…ダメかしら？
審査が甘いキャッシングローンはありますよ！
家計を預かる主婦のたっての頼みですからもちろんお教えしますよ！！審査が甘いキャッシングローンは確かにありますので安心して下さいね。まず一般論を言えば、銀行のキャッシングローンの審査が一番厳しめで、次に大手消費者金融となり、中小の専業消費者金融だと大手消費者金融に比べて審査は甘くなります。そして、一番審査が甘いとされているのは街金融です。
ただし、これはあくまでも一般論であって、「消費者金融のキャッシングローンの審査に落ちたが銀行のキャッシングローンの審査には通った」といった体験談はありますし、またその逆の体験談もあるのです。他方で、審査が厳しいか甘いかに関係なく、キャッシングローンの審査に通る基準をあえて挙げるとすれば、継続した一定の安定収入があり、他社からの借り入れもなく、また金融ブラックでもなければ、まずどの金融機関のキャッシングローンの審査でも落ちるとはないと言えます。
だから自分がこの条件に当て嵌まるのであれば、審査が甘い金融会社に絞って選ぶのではなく、金利面や融資面も考慮して幅広い観点から自分の借入れニーズにぴったり合致した金融会社を選んだ方がよいと思いますよ。
一方、そのような条件を十分に満たした上で、あえて審査が甘いキャッシングローンを希望するのであれば、以下の条件を満たす金融会社はキャッシングローンの審査が甘いと言ってよいでしょう。一つ目は、パートやアルバイト、あるいは契約社員や派遣労働であっても働き方それ自体を審査で問われないことです。
二つ目は、年齢・性別・職業・勤め先・勤続年数・持家か借家か等の個人属性のスコアリング評価がキャッシングローンの審査にあまり影響しない点です。たとえば、正社員と非正社員、大企業と中小企業、持家と借家といった条件が審査にかなり影響するようなキャッシングローンの審査は甘いとは言えません。
三つ目は、複数社から借り入れがあっても、また他社から多額の借金があっても返済状況が良好ならキャッシングローンの審査に通してくれるような金融会社は、かなり審査が甘いと言ってよいでしょうね。加えて、金融ブラックでも過去不問で融資してくれる会社は、さらに審査が甘いと言えます。
最後の点としては、無職でも審査に申し込めて、場合によっては融資してくれる金融会社はすごく審査が甘いと考えてよいでしょう。ただし、無職でまったくの無収入の場合は審査に通りませんよ！
キャッシングローンの人気ワード、「審査が甘い」の理想と現実
キャッシングの条件に、審査が甘いことを挙げている方は想像以上に多いのをご存知ですか？確かに、審査は厳しいより甘いほうが安心して申し込めますし、利用者としては層あって欲しいものでもありますよね。しかし、その理想は各人の置かれている状況で多きな差があり、さらに現実となると、理想とは大きく違っているのも認識しなければいけません。
審査が甘いとはどういうことなのか。理想としてあげられるのは、勤務年数が短くてもOKとか、多少の借り入れがあってもOKとか、1回くらいの延滞は見逃してくれるとか、本当にいろいろな理想とも要望とも言える内容が多いです。理想の持ち方もピンキリなので、「本当にそうだよな～」と思えるものもあれば、「それは審査じゃなくて考えが甘い」と言わざるを得ないようなものもあります。1回の延滞を見逃してくれる、と書きましたが、信用情報で登録される延滞は、期限から3ヶ月経過したものが一般的ですから、「3ヶ月も延滞しておいて、審査で見逃して欲しいというのは虫が良すぎやしないかい？」と言いたくなったりもします。
このように、いろいろな視点からの「審査が甘い」。では肝心の現実はどうなのかというと、やはり「世の中そんなに甘くはない」というのが答えです。ただし、中にはよくその状況で借り入れできたね！？という体験談もありますから、望みは捨てないことも大事です。では、審査の甘い実例を見ていきましょう。
データでは判断できない「人柄」をみる消費者金融もあります。そうなると電話や対面での審査で、いかにしっかりした人物であるかを印象付けられるか、きちんと返済をしてもらえる人物であるかをアピールできるかがポイントになります。他社借入などが3～4社ある方でも、法定上限（年収の3分の1）を超えていなければ、消費者金融で少額融資を申し込むのもアリでしょう。そのためには他社との取引で延滞や事故を起こしていないことが何よりも大切です。「借り入れは多いけど、計画的に返済ができる人」と判定されるためには絶対に必要な条件ですよね？
勤務年数などの情報も、 「病気で退職して、体調が戻ったので」とか、「前の会社はセクハラで辞めざるを得なかった」とか、なぜ勤務年数が短いのかを正当に理由付けできることが必要です。これもアピールできる機会が必要になるので、ネット申込みをした後に、詳しくご相談したいんですが、とそのポイントだけを集中的にアピールできる申込み方法を選択するようにしましょう。アピールポイントは少なければ少ないほど、相手にインパクトを与えることができます。数字では不利でも、アピールでプラスにひっくり返すチャンスは残されています。
審査が甘い。それを導くには、申込者本人の努力も必要だというのが結論です。ネットで申込みができるからこそ、不安な点だけを口頭でアピールできる。これらの申込み方法の使い方で、審査は甘くも辛くもなっていきます。
結婚資金のサポートにも抜群の安心感！
結婚資金は貯めていたとしても、いざ実際に結婚するとなると何かと足が出がちです。式場をちょっとグレードアップしたり、指輪をちょっと良いものにしたり、お金を使える場所は数限りなくあります。
結婚式にかかったお金は後からある程度回収できるとはいえ、当面の資金としてお金が必要です。この当面の資金をカバーするのに最適なのが先輩から教えてもらったカードローンでのキャッシングでした。最初は借りることに抵抗が無かったわけではありません。
しかし、実際にカードローンを準備していれば使うことはなくても心の支えになるということを知りました。もしもの時にはカードローンを使えば良い。そんな使い方があるなんて思いもしませんでした！
すぐに借りられ助かりました！
会社に行こうとしたら財布がないんです！…どうやら昨日の飲み会の後、二次会に行って…そこから先の記憶が曖昧で…恐らくどこかに落としてしまったのかも…でもお金はすぐに必要です！次の給料日までは持ちません！(泣)なんとかしなければ…。
困っていたらネットで簡単に借り入れが出来る金融会社広告を見たんです。ネットだけで？と半信半疑だったんですが、申し込んでみるとこれがびっくり！本当に即審査、そしてすぐにキャッシングが出来たんですよ！こんなに簡単に借り入れ出来て本当に良かったです！
自宅への電話や郵便無くて安心
今年はボーナスも少なかったから、小遣いもダウン（涙）。毎月何とか過ごせてはいるものの、趣味の釣り道具が買えなくて・・。ついに我慢出来ずに消費者金融で借りることにしました。自宅への電話や郵便物が一切無いって書いてあったので、奥さんに内緒で借りられるかなって思って。
本当に家には何も来なかったので、ばれることはなかったです。助かりました。釣りの道具に関しては無関心だから問題ないですし。お金を借りてまで釣り道具買ったなんて、ばれたら大変ですからね。
内緒で簡単に借りられるから、また利用しちゃうかもしれないな。
Jeff's Electromagnetic Coil - Gun : Assembly Instructions
( Draft 03/10/2001 , corrections 9/1/02 : was 22 gauge wire , not 24 , and 3/4 " coil , not 1 " .
06/17/03 added diagram .
8/9/04 added coil dimensions )
Enough people have asked for instructions on how to build the coil - gun that I reluctantly decided to post the details .
Please do n't make me regret it .
Warning : This is a High - Voltage device .
Please be extreemely careful and realize that there may be dangers that I have n't properly described .
Attempt this at your own risk .
The coil - gun is simply an electromagnet coil powered by a short high - voltage pulse generated by the flash unit of a disposable camera .
Parts :
Kodak disposable flash camera
40 feet ( 12.2 m ) of 22 Guage Enamel - Coated Magnet wire ( part of a 3 spool set from Radio Shack part number : 278-1345 )
SPST lever Micro switch ( rated to 250v is ok , even though we are using 300v but only for a short time ) Radio Shack : 275-016
soda straw
2 steel washers 1/4 " center hole ( or whatever fits nicely around the straw ) , by 1 " outer diameter
1 " piece of small tubing to plug end of straw
6 " piece of wood dowel to fit down center of straw ( ok if it is a bit loose , just use masking tape to make it larger diameter to fit snugly )
12 " x 6 " piece of corrogated cardboard for the gun chasis
Masking tape
Tools :
Small flat blade screwdriver to help pry camera case apart
Soldering Iron & solder
Electric screwdriver or variable speed drill to wind coil ( optional )
Scissors to cut cardboard chasis
Step 1 : Dismantle a disposable flash camera .
This can be done after the film is used up .
There is a small door on the bottom that allows you to remove the film cannister and send it in for processing , or you can have the photo lab do it and give the camera back to you ( normally they keep the camera and send it back to the company for reloading ) .
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> >>>
WARNING <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
While dismantling the camera it is difficult to extract the PC card without shocking yourself !!!
The large capacitor is charged to 300v and stays charged for a long time so always treat it as though it is fully charged .
Always discharge the capacitor ( see below ) before handling the card .
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
To discharge the capacitor :
Remove the battery , then repeatedly press the shutter release and film advance to discharge the capacitor .
Then when the case is half open ,
reach in with a plastic handled screwdriver and physically short out the leads of the large cylindrical capacitor .
( Note : there is a small risk of the capacitor exploding at this point if you have n't sufficiently discharged it .
But this is the only way to be sure it is completely discharged .
The correct way to do this would be to discharge through a resistor , but it is difficult to do with out increasing the shock risk ) .
Attach a shorting wire or resistor across the leads to make sure it stays discharged while you are working on it .
( do n't forget to remove the wire later for operation )
Step 2 : Assemble the barrel and coil .
The barrel of the gun is a plastic soda straw .
Two steel washers are fitted over the straw 7/8ths of an inch ( 2 centimeters ) apart to make a spool to wind the wire .
The steel helps concentrate the magnetic field within the barrel .
Disks of paper or tape should be placed on the insides of the washers so the metal does not scrape the insulation .
At least 1 " of straw should protrude from the short end , and maybe 3 or 4 " from the long end .
I put a wooden dowel down the center of the straw to keep it stiff while winding the wire , then chucked it in a portable drill so it would spin easily .
Then an assistant held the spool of wire , and I spun the spindle to wind the wire onto the straw .
Try to keep the windings tight and smooth by tilting the spindle a little so that the wire winds from side to side evenly .
The final coil is approximately 1 inch ( 25 mm ) in diameter .
Do n't forget to leave a long enough lead from the first end of the wire ( I brought it out under the washer and taped it to the straw so it would n't be in the way .
After it is all wound , wrap it tightly with electrical tape .
It will help the performance if you can surround the coil with a wrap of sheet steel ( maybe cut from a soup can ) to confine the magnetic field , but mine is n't .
The next step is to make an end - plug .
I used a small piece of rubber hose that fit tightly into the end of the straw , then a plastic pen tube through the center of it and extending down the straw to just before the first washer .
When loading the projectile in the barrel , it is critical that the front of the projectile is even with the end washer .
Any further in , and it might get shot backwards or not move at all .
Not far enough , and it wo n't get pulled in .
Step 3 : Mount in an enclosure and design trigger switch
I mounted the circuit card inside of a cardboard box ( because I was in a hurry , plastic or wood would be nicer ) .
I made two holes in the box , one to push a wooden stick in to start the charging of the flash assembly ( only need to push it if the gun has n't been used for a few hours , after that it auto recharges ) .
The second hole is to view the neon bulb that shows when it is recharged .
Step 4 : Wiring
One lead of the coil is soldered to the negative terminal of the large capacitor .
The other end of the coil is soldered to a micro switch which acts as a trigger .
The other end of the switch is attached to the positive lead of the capacitor .
Put a piece of tape between the normal flash switch contacts since they are n't needed .
The rest of the flash card is unaltered .
Operation :
Loading of ammo is critical .
The front of the projectile ( BB or small nail ) must be exactly positioned at the entrance of the coil 's aft end plate .
I used a small rubber hose as an adjustable breach plug so I could vary how far it pushes the ammo into the barrel .
Mine does n't have any means of holding the ammo from falling out the front , so you just have to hold the barrel slightly elevated when it is loaded .
Make sure to remove any shorting wire that may have been installed across the capacitor leads during construction .
To start the unit charging , there is a " click " switch on the circuit card that you push with a plastic stick .
After that the unit will recharge automatically after each shot .
Takes about 20 seconds to recharge .
I cut a hole in the box so I can see the neon bulb that signals a full charge .
Always wear glasses when firing this gun since the projectile can ricochet unpredictably .
Performance varies so even though one shot was a dud , the next one could be a real zinger .
Be especially careful when reloading since the unit is usually charged and could fire at any time .
Then just point at a safe target ( soft styrofoam works well ) and shoot .
Performance :
BBs go about 20 feet , and small nails will push about 1 / 4 " into a piece of styrofoam .
Not bad for just a single AA battery .
It recharges in about 20 seconds .
Try firing 2 BBs at the same time - surprise , they hit harder .
3 BBs even harder .
Aparently the additional metal makes it more efficient .
So then I went to using finishing nails and cut up pieces of 8 penny nails .
There 's a lot of complicated physics that goes into the design of these .
I just eyeballed it and got lucky .
The critical factors are charge voltage , capacitor discharge rate , and coil dimensions .
The capacitor needs to completely discharge before the projectile has left the coil or the coil will end up holding it back , or even just oscillating it in place .
My first test firing blew the breach plug and projectile backwards into my chest .
To see if addtional capcitance would help , I tried putting a variety of large capacitors in parallel with the existing one .
They caused it to recharge much , much more slowly but did n't seem to help projectile velocity much if any .
Fancy Options :
A piece of clear tubing is attached to the back of the straw ( breech ) to hold BB's .
A system of two small nails pushed through the tubing allows me to select one BB at a time to feed into the barrel .
The laser pointer helps to aim above the target to counter the drop due to slow velocity .
Be SAFE , LEARN , and have FUN .
Larry King does n't buy Cheney 's faulty memory on Ashcroft hospital visit

In an interview set to air Tuesday night on CNN , Vice President Dick Cheney tells Larry King that the administration would stick by embattled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , but King told viewers he thought Cheney 's answer was not completely supportive .
" I did not think ... that it was a firm , 100 percent ' we love you General Gonzales , ' " King said Tuesday afternoon on CNN .
Cheney described the ongoing investigation into the firing of nine US Attorneys as " a bit of a witch hunt on Capitol Hill as they keep turning over rocks hoping they find something . "
He said he would stand by Gonzales in a brief excerpt of the interview .
" Al 's a good man , good friend , and in a difficult assignment , " Cheney said .
King told viewers that he asked Cheney whether he instructed Gonzales and then White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card to visit then - Attorney General John Ashcroft at his hospital bedside to push Ashcroft , who was recovering from surgery , to approve a secret surveillance program .
Cheney told King he had no recollection of delivering those instructions , but the veteran CNN interviewer said he did n't quite buy that explanation .
" How could you not recall ?
You know , ' Hey you two guys , you go over to that guy in the hospital bed , and you tell him to sign this , ' " King said .
The following video is from CNN's Newsroom , broadcast on July 31 .
The battle over domestic electronic surveillance returned to prominence last week with fresh hearings in Congress and the usual Cheney administration demagoguery .
In a clear attempt to shape the debate , on Wednesday the President took to the bully pulpit at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade to demand that Congress stop pussy - footing around and make the six month FISA statute passed in August permanent .
Chop , chop .
New revelations about NSA snooping , however , would seem to make quick passage of such legislation impossible .
After all , the whole point of the six month sunset provision was to provide for six months of debate , not to just delay the vote until Congress had the chance to enjoy a month - long break , and then rubber stamp it like the good old days .
Congress sings surveillance blues
" The threat from al - Qaeda is not going to expire in 135 days , " W said , " so I call on Congress to make the Protect America Act permanent . "
Dubbed by critics the Police America Act , the law allows warrantless wiretapping of electronic communications as long as the target of the surveillance is overseas , or if domestic , the target of a terrorist investigation .
He had more than that on his mind , however .
He also sought to bail out the telecommunications companies , which sold out their customers by granting retroactive immunity to the companies aided the administrations efforts .
" For years , the FBI was not only asking telecom companies to do its investigative work , but also asking them to sidestep the Fourth Amendment , " said Michael German , ACLU National Security Policy Counsel .
" The fact that telecoms complied with the FBI ’s intrusive demands is shocking .
It sets an extremely risky precedent to hand out such broad and vague authority to telecom companies .
Ceding investigative powers to private companies will have disastrous effects not only for Americans ’ privacy , but for their safety . "
Whether or not Congress folds and bails out the telcos – and we think they will – some kind of formal expansion of the law also appears to be on the table .
A sticking point between the administration and the secretive FISA court has been the court ’s refusal to allow blanket wiretapping of foreign calls routed through American communications switches , and the President ’s call for a permanent expansion of the law clearly envisions warrantless surveillance sweeps of these calls as well .
FBI , DCSNet and security
One interesting byproduct of expanded warrantless surveillance is how systems designed for ease of use - based on the assumption that the necessity of obtaining a warrant would minimize abuse , and which provide for nearly seamless monitoring of domestic communications - now provide for real - time warrantless snooping from anywhere in the country with the click of a mouse .
Since 1994 , telcos operating in the US have been required to install switches that meet very specific wiretapping requirements , as mandated by the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act , or CALEA .
The CALEA - compliant switches allow the FBI to log directly onto the telco networks , whether land - based or cellular .
As Wired explained , after an examination of redacted FBI documents obtained originally by the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) :
Together , the surveillance systems let FBI agents play back recordings even as they are being captured ( like TiVo ) , create master wiretap files , send digital recordings to translators , track the rough location of targets in real time using cell - tower information , and even stream intercepts outward to mobile surveillance vans .
FBI wiretapping rooms in field offices and undercover locations around the country are connected through a private , encrypted backbone that is separated from the internet .
Sprint runs it on the government 's behalf .
The network allows an FBI agent in New York , for example , to remotely set up a wiretap on a cell phone based in Sacramento , California , and immediately learn the phone 's location , then begin receiving conversations , text messages and voicemail pass codes in New York .
With a few keystrokes , the agent can route the recordings to language specialists for translation .
The numbers dialed are automatically sent to FBI analysts trained to interpret phone - call patterns , and are transferred nightly , by external storage devices , to the bureau 's Telephone Application Database , where they 're subjected to a type of data mining called link analysis .
Normally , the telcos flip the switch once served with a court order , but court orders are not necessarily mandatory these days , and anyway , the big telcos for the last few years have not seemed overly concerned about anything other than toadying up to the FBI and the NSA .
The prevalence of surveillance backdoors in the nation ’s telecommunications infrastructure has also raised serious concerns over the security of that infrastructure .
Hewlett - Packard Co. , the world 's largest PC vendor , filed suit against its fastest growing rival on Tuesday , alleging the infringement of five patents .
HP is seeking compensation from Acer Inc. and a U.S. subsidiary of the company for allegedly selling PC products in the U.S. that infringe on its patents , according to court documents .
The complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas .
" Acer 's legal division is looking into this issue and we have no comment at this stage , " said Henry Wang , senior public relations director for Acer , in Taipei .
HP alleges that the Taiwanese company knowingly violated the patents , which are related to optical drives , clock frequency switching and power consumption .
HP is seeking a jury trial and compensation for the use of its technology in Acer PC products , as well as treble damages for intentional violation of the patents and the payment of all its legal fees .
HP became the world 's largest PC vendor in the fourth quarter of last year , according to market researcher IDC .
Acer took fourth place , although it clocked the strongest growth by any company in the top ten ranking .
Dell Inc. was second , and Lenovo Group Ltd. took third .
The lawsuit may be an attempt to slow Acer 's breakneck growth and its expansion in the U.S. , according to Henry King , an analyst for Goldman Sachs ( Asia ) LLC in Taipei .
He said that Acer is probably protected in the patent dispute by cross-licenses held by the companies that contract manufacture PC products on its behalf .
Most major PC companies , including HP , Acer and Dell , farm out production to the same contract manufacturers in Taiwan and China , and the contract manufacturers try to sort out patent issues through cross-licenses .
Acer has been continuously growing its PC shipments and gaining market share in various markets , particularly in notebooks , making it " a threat that leading PC vendors cannot afford to neglect , " King wrote in a report on Wednesday .
" We understand why competitors would desire a halt to Acer 's expansion in the US market , " he wrote .
US Army 1943 Guide To Iraq Posted by Pile ( 11531 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
In 1943 , The US Army published a guide to Iraq to help soldiers during World War II .
You have been ordered to Iraq ( i - RAHK ) as part of the world - wide offensive to beat Hitler .
You will enter Iraq both as a soldier and as an individual , because on our side a man can be both a soldier and an individual .
That is our strength — if we are smart enough to use it .
It can be our weakness if we are n't .
As a soldier your duties are laid out for you .
As an individual , it is what you do on your own that counts — and it may count for a lot more than you think .
American success or failure in Iraq may well depend on whether the Iraqis ( as the people are called ) like American soldiers or not .
It may not be quite that simple .
But then again it could ...
How To Beat Hitler .
Herr Hitler knows he 's licked if the peoples united against him stand their ground .
So it is pretty obvious what he and his propaganda machine are trying to do .
They 're trying to spread disunity and discontent among their opponents whenever and wherever they can .
So what 's the answer ?
That ought to be pretty obvious , too .
One of your big jobs is to prevent Hitler 's agents from getting in their dirty work .
The best way you can do this is by getting along with the Iraqis and making them your friends .
And the best way to get along with any people is to understand them .
That is what this guide is for .
To help you understand the people and the country so that you can do the best and quickest job of sending Hitler back where he came from .
And secondly , so that you as a human being will get the most out of an experience few Americans have been lucky enough to have .
Years from now you 'll be telling your children and maybe your grandchildren stories beginning , " Now when I was in Baghdad — . "
WHAT IS THIS IRAQ ?
WHAT is Iraq , anyhow ?
Well , it 's a lot of things , old and new .
It is one of the oldest countries in the world — and one of the youngest under its present government .
In Baghdad , the capital city , you will see street merchants selling exactly the same kind of pottery that their ancestors sold at the time of the Arabian Nights .
Not far away you will see great dams and modern refineries equal to the best you have seen in America .
If you happen to be sent to the oil fields , you will discover miracles of modern engineering construction side by side with primitive refineries built 2,000 years ago and still in operation .
Iraq Is Hot !
As a matter of fact , you may be so busy when you reach Iraq that you wo n't see much of anything for awhile .
Probably you will feel Iraq first — and that means heat .
Blazing heat .
And dust .
In the daytime Iraq can be one of the hottest spots in the world .
If you happen to travel by train in the daytime , the leather seats may get so hot that you 'll have to stand up .
Most work is done between 6 a.m. and noon and perhaps an hour or two in the early evening .
And yet the nights of these hot days are often uncomfortably cool .
Or maybe the first thing you notice will be the smells .
You have heard and read a lot about the " mysterious East . "
You have seen moving pictures about the colorful life of the desert and the bazaars .
When you actually get there you will look in vain for some of the things you have been led to expect .
You will smell and feel a lot of things the movies did n't warn you about .
MEET THE PEOPLE
But do n't get discouraged .
Most Americans and Europeans who have gone to Iraq did n't like it at first .
Might as well be frank about it .
They thought it a harsh , hot , parched , dusty , and inhospitable land .
But nearly all of these same people changed their minds after a few days or weeks , and largely on account of the Iraqi people they began to meet .
So will you .
That tall man in the flowing robe you are going to see soon , with the whiskers and the long hair , is a first - class fighting man , highly skilled in guerilla warfare .
Few fighters in any country , in fact , excel him in that kind of situation .
If he is your friend , he can be a staunch and valuable ally .
If he should happen to be your enemy — look out !
Remember Lawrence of Arabia ?
Well , it was with men like these that he wrote history in the First World War .
But you will also find out quickly that the Iraqi is one of the most cheerful and friendly people in the world .
Few people you have seen get so much fun out of work and everyday living .
If you are willing to go just a little out of your way to understand him , everything will be o.k .
Differences ?
Of Course !
Differences ?
Sure , there are differences .
Differences of costume .
Differences of food .
Differences of manner and custom and religious beliefs .
Different attitudes toward women .
Differences galore .
But what of it ?
You are n't going to Iraq to change the Iraqis .
Just the opposite .
We are fighting this war to preserve the principle of " live and let live . "
Maybe that sounded like a lot of words to you at home .
Now you have a chance to prove it to yourself and others .
If you can , it 's going to be a better world to live in for all of us .
Although relatively few Iraqis receive a formal education similar to yours , they are shrewd and intelligent and tend to believe what they hear and sec with their own ears and eyes .
By what you do and how you act you can do a lot to win this war and the peace after it .
Right now Iraq is threatened with invasion — as America is now .
The Iraqis have some religious and tribal differences among themselves .
Hitler has been trying to use these differences to his own ends .
If you can win the trust and friendship of all the Iraqis you meet , you will do more than you may think possible to help bring them together in our common cause .
Needless to say , Hitler will also try to use the differences between ourselves and Iraqis to make trouble .
But we have a weapon to beat that kind of thing .
Plain common horse sense .
Let 's use it .
Hitler 's game is to divide and conquer .
Ours is to unite and win !
THE COUNTRY
First , let 's have a look at the country .
We can't very well talk about places and people until we know where we are .
In the center of this guide you will find a map of what is called the " Middle East . "
You will see by the map , Iraq lies south of Turkey ; east of Syria and Palestine ; north of Arabia ; west of Iran ( EE - RAHN ) ( Persia ) ; and just touches the Persian Gulf at one corner .
It is about the size of the State of Montana .
A Strategic Hot Spot .
Iraq is thus a strategic part of the great " land bridge " between Europe and India — the road Hitler HOPES to use to join hands with his back - stabbing allies , the laps .
Also , the Persian Gulf is an important back door for us to get supplies to our Russian allies .
And even more , Iraq has great military importance for its oil fields , with their pipelines to the Mediterranean Sea .
Yes , Iraq is a hot spot in more ways than one .
Iraq was formerly called Mesopotamia .
Its history goes back a tidy 5,000 years .
By tradition the Garden of Eden was located in this region .
Hence it is often called " the birthplace of mankind . "
It is certainly one of the oldest settled regions in the world .
Here it was that the ancient cities of Babylon and Nineveh ( NI - ne - ve ) flourished in Bible times .
You will very likely see their ruins , some of the great ruins of the world .
Before the First World War , Mesopotamia ( as it was called then ) was a part of Turkey .
After the war the state of Iraq was set up as a British mandate , with an Arab chieftain , Feisal ( FAY - sal ) , as king .
In 1932 Iraq became an independent state — a " limited monarchy " of the English type , with an elected legislature .
The present king is Feisal II , the grandson of the first king .
Close relations have been maintained with the British , and the country is now guarded by British troops to prevent the Germans from gaining control .
The Cities .
Iraq has only a few cities .
Baghdad , the largest , has a population of around 500,000 , about like that of Minneapolis or Kansas City .
Mosul ( MO - sul ) in the oil region has a population of over 100,000 , Suq al - Shu yukh ( SOOQ ash - shu - YOOKH ) about the same , and Basrah ( BAS - ra ) on the Persian Gulf , the most important port , has about 70,000 .
Most of Iraq is desert country .
Not great sandy wastes like the Sahara in Africa , but flinty , harsh , monotonous desert , treeless but covered with a thin scrub vegetation very much like our Southwest region .
The only water in this region comes from waterholes , and these are jealously guarded .
Water is more valuable than anything else in the desert , and for the Iraqi , to waste water would be like throwing money away .
In contrast to the dry deserts are the great green valleys of the Tigris ( TAI - gris ) and Euphrates ( yoo - FRAY - teez ) Rivers .
These two important rivers rise in the Kurdistan ( KUR - di - stan ) mountains of Turkey , north and west of Iraq .
After flowing across the country in parallel channels , they join together and empty into the Persian Gulf through one mouth .
In the valleys of these two rivers nine - tenths of the 3½ million people ( about the population of Chicago ) live .
At the northern end of these valleys is the important oil field of Kirkuk ( kir - KOOK ) .
The field was discovered in 1927 but it was not until 1935 that production began in earnest .
Twin pipe - lines have been constructed to the ports of Tripoli in Syria and Haifa ( HAI - fa ) in Palestine , on the Mediterranean Sea .
These fields and pipe - lines are among the richest prizes Hitler would like to grab , and they are heavily guarded .
Guarding or defending them may be among your most important military duties , for this oil is the source of supply for the armies of the Middle East and India , and also feeds the Mediterranean fleet .
How the People Live .
Nearly all farming in Iraq is dependent on irrigation , with water taken from the two great rivers .
The most important crop is dates , which not only are the chief food of the people but also shipped to other countries .
Grain , especially wheat , barley , rice , and millet is grown in large quantity .
Also grown are cotton , sugar cane and legumes , with small quantities of citrus fruits .
Practically the only building material is dried mud , like the adobe used in the Southwestern U.S.A .
It is admirably suited to the hot climate and you will find the inside of the flat - roofed Iraqi houses cool even in the noonday heat .
The Iraqi people are divided by occupation into the tradesmen in the cities , the farmers in the irrigated areas , and the nomads , who herd their sheep and camels on the desert , moving from place to place for fresh pastures .
The nomads and farmers cling to the native dress more than the city dwellers , who are often quite " westernized . "
The nomads are divided into tribes headed by sheikhs ( SHAYKH ) .
These leaders are very powerful and should be shown great consideration .
Townsmen , farmers , and nomads consider themselves as equals and should be treated as such .
THE MOSLEMS
THERE are a few Christians and Jews and other sects among the Iraqis , but by far the most people you will meet and see are Moslems .
This means that they are followers of the religion founded by Mohammed .
But you should not call it the Mohammedan religion , for the Moslems do not worship Mohammed as Christians worship Christ .
They believe in one god , Allah , and that Mohammed was His prophet .
The religion is called Islam and the people who believe in it are called Moslems .
The Moslem bible is known as the Koran and the Moslems worship in mosques ( mosks ) .
They are very devout in their religion and do not like to have " unbelievers " ( to them you are an " unbeliever " ) come anywhere near their mosques .
You can usually tell a mosque by its high tower .
Keep away from mosques .
Even though you may have visited mosques in Syria or Egypt , the mosques in Iraq must not be entered .
If you try to enter one , you will be thrown out , probably with a severe beating .
The Iraqi Moslems even resent unbelievers coming close to mosques .
If you have blundered too near a mosque , get away in a hurry before trouble starts .
The Moslem religion requires a man to pray five times a day .
This is done by facing the holy city of Mecca and going through a series of prostrations .
Do n't stare at anyone who is praying , and above all do not make fun of him .
Respect his religion as he will respect yours .
No Preaching .
This is n't preaching .
You probably belong to a church at home , and you know how you would feel towards anyone who insulted or desecrated your church .
The Moslems feel just the same way , perhaps even more strongly .
In fact , their feeling about their religion is pretty much the same as ours toward our religion , although more intense .
If anything , we should respect the Moslems the more for the intensity of their devotion .
There are four towns in Iraq which are particularly sacred to the Iraqi Moslems .
These are Kerbela ( ker - be - LAA ) , Nejef ( NE - jef ) , Kadhiman ( KAA - di - MAYN ) ( near Baghdad ) , and Samarra .
Unless you are ordered to these towns , it is advisable to stay away from them .
It is a good idea in any foreign country to avoid any religious or political discussions .
This is even truer in Iraq than most countries , because it happens that here the Moslems themselves are divided into two factions something like our division into Catholic and Protestant denominations — so do n't put in your two cents worth when Iraqis argue about religion .
There are also political differences in Iraq that have puzzled diplomats and statesmen .
You wo n't help matters any by getting mixed up in them .
Moreover , if you discuss foreign politics with them , you might be maneuvered into making statements that could be interpreted as criticisms of our Allies .
Your move is to stay out of political and religious arguments altogether .
By getting into them you 'll only help the Nazi propagandists who are trying to stir up trouble among the Iraqis .
IRAQI CUSTOMS AND MANNERS
MOST of the Iraqi customs and manners are religious in their origin .
For example , there is the month of fasting each year called " Ramadan " ( ra - ma - DAHN ) .
This period is similar to the Lenten period in many of the Christian Churches .
In 1942 Ramadan begins September 12th .
In 1943 it will be about two weeks earlier .
During this period the Moslems do not eat , drink , or smoke between sunrise and sunset .
Avoid offering , or asking them for food , drink , or smokes at this time , except after sunset .
All hesitations and refusals at this period should be accepted without any attempts at persuasion .
Any drawing of blood , during this period , even if accidental , such as a scratch or a nosebleed , may have serious consequences .
Remember that Moslem tempers are very short during this month as yours would be under similar circumstances .
The Moslem day of rest is Friday , and their stores are closed on that day .
In Baghdad and the other large cities many shops are closed on Saturday , the Jewish day of rest , while Christian shops are closed on Sunday .
Moslems , Christians , and Jews all have a number of religious holidays .
Some of these are solemn fasts like Ramadan , others are colorful festivals .
You will be wise to respect the observance of these holidays .
The " Evil Eye " .
Many of the Iraqis believe in the " evil eye " .
This is a good deal in their minds like putting a " hex " on a person is to people in parts of our country .
If you stare at people , especially children , someone may think you are the possessor of an " evil eye " , and are trying to put a curse on the person you are staring at .
Some of the Iraqis think that the lens of a camera is an " evil eye " , and you will make enemies by taking close - up snapshots and possibly wind up with a knife in your back .
General views or street scenes will cause no trouble — except mosques .
Do n't try to photograph mosques .
Beggars are not numerous in Iraq .
Those you will see live mainly in the cities and are mostly professionals , and it is not a good idea to give them money .
If you do , the word will spread to all the beggars in the city that you are an easy mark .
Of course , some of them may be deserving , and if you feel moved by their plight , give them a little something — but better be prepared to repeat .
Bargaining in the shops and bazaars is a great national pastime .
You will have to bargain for almost everything you buy .
The price first quoted is usually one - third to two - thirds higher than what you should pay .
In bargaining the important thing is not to hurry .
A little American horse trading will carry you a long way in this game .
Manners Are Important .
Moslems pay much attention to good manners .
Handshaking in Iraq is considered an important part of good manners .
You will be greeted with a handshake on every occasion that you meet an Iraqi .
His handshake is cordial and sincere .
Return it in the same spirit .
But do not touch or handle an Iraqi in any other way .
Do not wrestle with him in fun , and do n't slap him on the back .
Any such contact is offensive to his idea of good manners .
Above all never strike an Iraqi .
Do your swearing in English .
Avoid the native oaths — you will not know their exact meaning and they may get you into trouble .
Do n't under any circumstances call an Iraqi a " dog " , a " devil " , a " native " , or a " heathen " .
These terms are all deadly insults to him .
They do not drink liquor or eat pork .
So respect their feelings and do not drink in their presence .
They do not like to see others drink and it offends them to see others drunk .
Never give them pork to eat or offer it to them even in fun .
Pigs are " unclean " to Moslems .
So are dogs .
If you happen to have a mascot dog , be particularly careful to keep him away from mosques .
Moslems do not let other people see them naked .
Do not urinate in their presence .
They do it squatting and dislike to see other people do it standing up .
These things may seem trivial , but they are important if you want to get along well with the Iraqis .
Moslem Women .
Moslem women do not mingle freely with men .
The greater part of their time they spend at home and in the company of their families .
Never make advances to Moslem women or try to attract their attention in the streets or other public places .
Do not loiter near them when they are shopping .
If a woman has occasion to lift her veil while shopping , do not stare or smile at her .
Look the other way .
These rules are extremely important .
The Moslems will immediately dislike you and there will be trouble if you do not treat women according to their standards and customs .
These rules apply both to the cities and towns and to the villages and the desert .
The village and desert women go unveiled more often than the women in the cities and seem to have more freedom .
But the rules are still strict .
Any advance on your part will mean trouble and plenty of it .
Even when speaking to Iraqi men , no mention should be made of their female relatives .
The Iraqi themselves follow this custom and would resent anyone , especially a foreigner , not doing the same .
To repeat — do n't make a pass at any Moslem woman or there will be trouble .
Anyway , it wo n't get you anywhere .
Prostitutes do not walk the streets but live in special quarters of the cities .
Iraqi Hospitality .
If you are entertained in an Iraqi city home , you will probably find dishes and silverware and customs somewhat like our own .
But do not eat too much of the first course of a meal .
There is probably more coming .
In the country there will probably be no table , plates , or silverware .
You will be expected to sit on the ground as your host does .
Follow his example .
Roll up your right sleeve and eat with the tips of your right fingers — even if you are a southpaw .
It is considered rude to eat with your left hand .
If your host tears off tid-bits and hands them to you , eat them .
In the country there will probably be only one course .
After the meal , water will be brought to wash your hands and a towel to wipe them .
In the desert the customs are much the same as in the country , except that there is less variety in the food .
You may be offered only some bread and milk or soured milk , like buttermilk .
These people are poor and are offering you the best they have .
You must not refuse it — but do not take too much .
Coffee drinking is equally popular in the city , country , or desert .
Even a shopkeeper may offer you a small glass of coffee .
Do not refuse it or throw it away half - drunk , even it it does not taste like our American coffee .
If you are offered a second cup , take it , and also a third .
But it is customary to refuse a fourth .
These are some general hints about manners .
But the main thing is the SPIRIT of politeness and courtesy .
If you show this , the Iraqis will understand and forgive any lapses you may make through not knowing their customs .
If you show that you really want to be friendly , you 'll get along .
THE LANGUAGE
THE native language of Iraq is Arabic .
You will not need to know many words to get along .
A few simple words will go a long way .
Learn a few words and phrases — you will find a helpful list at the end of this guide — and talk to the Iraqis in their own language .
They will like it even if your pronunciation is not the same as theirs .
They will be especially pleased when you use their polite salutations even if you do not know any other words .
When you hear one of them speak English — no matter how badly — you will understand the pleasure they feel when you speak to them in their language .
Many Iraqis speak a few words or at least understand English , especially those in the larger stores in the cities and others in the oil regions which were developed by the British , Occasionally among the wealthier classes French , Turkish , and sometimes German are spoken .
In most of the Baghdad bazaars , Persian is understood .
From Mosul north both Turkish and Kurdish are heard commonly .
CLIMATE AND HEALTH — SANITARY CONDITIONS
IRAQ is a hot country .
This means : keep your headgear [ Iraq Summer Sun ] on when you are in the summer sun .
In this kind of a climate it is very easy to let yourself be burned and think nothing of it .
But next day you are likely to wake up with black blisters and possible fever .
The headgear issued to you will be sufficient to protect you .
But whatever you wear , be sure that it shades the back of your neck as well as the top of your head .
If you expose the back of your neck you are inviting sunstroke .
Do n't , under any circumstances , take a sun bath .
In the desert , be prepared for extremes of temperature .
The days are usually very hot .
The nights can be uncomfortably cool .
Boil your drinking water or see that it is properly chlorinated .
You will find that conditions of life in Iraq do not allow the degree of sanitation or cleanliness that we know .
Avoid eating unwashed vegetables and fruits .
They may be contaminated by human excrement .
Wash raw fruits and vegetables in water or alcohol or peel them before eating them , because the skins may have become contaminated by flies or by human contact .
Avoid leafy vegetables altogether .
Keep all food away from flies .
[ Do n't Take a Sun Bath ]
Diseases : Malaria and typhoid are two very serious fevers .
You should guard against them in every possible way .
Malaria is carried by a particular kind of mosquito which breeds in marshy areas , uncovered wells and cisterns and in shallow water pools .
If at all possible , stay away from areas in which malaria is common .
When you can't do this , sleep under nets and keep your arms and legs covered , especially at dusk .
Typhoid is contracted from unboiled water and from raw foods which have not been properly cleaned or peeled .
Once again , avoid them .
[ Bugs and Lice ] Sandflies , which are smaller than mosquitos and which can get through an ordinary mosquito net , carry a slight three - day fever which is not serious but is very weakening .
It is known as sandfly fever .
Sandflies are most prevalent in midsummer .
Coating yourself with a light oil will give you some protection from them .
You should be very careful about bugs and lice , which are common .
Give yourself a frequent once - over for them .
Scabies is a skin infection , produced by a parasite which feeds on the skin .
It is extremely annoying and difficult to get rid of .
However , it can be cured by sulphur ointment .
Intestinal diseases , such as dysentery and tapeworm , are very common in Iraq .
These can be avoided , or at least made less severe , by extreme care in the water you drink and the food you eat .
Trachoma , a very common disease of the eye , can be picked up almost everywhere , even from shaking hands with someone and then touching your eyes .
Do n't rub or touch your eyes .
Toilets such as those in America are very scarce .
You will have to get used to relieving yourself outdoors at any convenient spot .
Be sure to get well off the main streets and well away from mosques , and out of sight as much as possible .
You will have to carry your own supply of toilet paper .
There is a good deal of venereal disease around , so do n't take chances .
CURRENCY , WEIGHTS , MEASURES , ETC .
Iraqi Currency .
The rate of exchange of Iraqi money to United States currency may vary a little from time to time , so that the table below can give only approximate ratios .
The basis of Iraqi money is the " dinar " ( DEE - NAHR ) which is roughly worth $ 4.00 in United States money .
Each dinar is further divided into 1,000 " fils " ( fils or FI - lis ) .
The dinar is a paper note or bill ; the fils pieces are coin .
The approximate value of the various denominations of Iraqi money are given below .

An easy way to remember the values of the various fils pieces is to think of each fils as being worth just a little less than ½ cent in U.S. money .
The Moslem Calendar .
The Moslem calendar is used in Iraq .
The main thing to know about the Moslem calendar is that it is lunar , or based on the moon .
Each of the 12 months has only 28 days .
This means that the Moslem year is a little shorter than our year , so that a special date , such as the fast of Ramadan , will occur a little earlier each year .
Time .
There are two ways of telling time in Iraq .
The official system is the " European system . "
That is , a 24 - hour clock , beginning at midnight , instead of a 12 - hour clock .
So in railway timetables you may see that a train is scheduled to arrive at 14 o'clock .
That means at 2 p.m. as we reckon time .
Or at 23 o'clock .
which is 11 p.m. to Us. 24 o'clock is midnight .
However , most of the country , goes on the same 12 - hour system used in America .
Weights and Measures .
The metric system is used for all official measurements of distance and area in Iraq .
The unit of length in the metric system is the " meter , " which is 39.37 inches , or a little more than our yard .
The unit of road distance is the " kilometer , " which is 1,000 meters or 5/8 ( a little over one - half ) of one of our miles .
The metric unit of square measure is the " hectare " ( HECK - tayr ) , which consists of 10,000 square meters , or about 2 ½ of our acres .
An Iraqi unit of square measure is the dunam ( DU - nam ) or " misharah " ( mi - SHAH - ra ) , which equals 2,500 square meters or a little less than 3,000 square yards .
The unit of weight in the metric system is the " kilogram , " which equals 2.2 pounds in our system .
Liquids in the metric system are measured by the " liter . "
A liter is a little more than one of our quarts .
SOME IMPORTANT DO'S AND DON'TS
Keep away from mosques .
Smoke or spit somewhere else — never in front of a mosque .
If you come near a mosque , keep moving ( away ) and do n't loiter .
Keep silent when the Moslems are praying ( which they do five times a day ) and do n't stare .
Discuss something else — NEVER religion or politics or women — with Moslems .
Remember the fear of the " evil eye . "
Do n't stare at anyone .
Do n't point your camera in anyone 's face .
Avoid offering opinions on internal politics .
Shake hands with the Iraqi ; otherwise do n't touch them or slap them on the back .
Remember that the Iraqi are a very modest people and avoid any exposure of the body in their presence .
Keep out of the sun whenever you can .
When you can't , keep your head and neck covered .
[ Meal Time Tips for Southpaws ]
Start eating only after your host has begun .
Eat with your right hand — never with your left , even if you are a southpaw .
Always tear bread with your fingers — never cut it .
Bread to the Moslems is holy .
Do n't throw scraps of it about or let it fall on the ground .
In the city eat only part of the first course .
There may be more coming .
In the country leave some food in the bowl — what you leave goes to the women and children .
Do n't offer Moslems food containing pork , bacon , or lard , or cooked in pork products .
All such food is religiously " unclean " to them .

If a woman answers , wait until she has had time to retire .
Always respect the Moslem women .
Do n't stare at them .
Do n't smile at them .
Do n't talk to them or follow them .
If you do any of these things , it means trouble for you and your unit .
In a house or tent , follow the rule of your host .
If he takes off his shoes on entering , do the same .
If you are required to sit on the floor in an Iraqi house or tent , cross your legs while doing so .
When visiting , do n't overstay your welcome .
The third glass of tea or coffee is the signal to leave unless you are quartered there .
If you should see grown men walking hand in hand , ignore it .
They are not " queer . "
Be kind and considerate to servants .
The Iraqis consider all people equals .
Avoid any expression of race prejudice .
The people draw very little color line .
Talk Arabic if you can to the people .
No matter how badly you do it , they will like it .
Shake hands on meeting and leaving .
On meeting an Iraqi , be sure to inquire after his health .
If you wish to give someone a present , make it sweets or cigarettes .
If you are stationed in the country , it is a good idea to take sweets and cigarettes with you when you visit an Iraqi 's home .
Show respect toward all older persons .
If serving food , the eldest person should be served first .
Be polite .
Good manners are important to the Iraqis .
Be hospitable .
Bargain on prices .
Do n't let shopkeepers or merchants overcharge you ; but be polite .

HINTS ON PRONOUNCING ARABIC
THESE are pronunciation hints to help you in listening to the Arabic language records which have been supplied to your troop unit .
They will also help you with the pronunciation of additional words and phrases given in the vocabulary below , which are not included in the records .
Arabic is spoken over a great area in North Africa and the Near East .
There are some differences between regions , both in pronunciation and the use of words .
The dialect you are going to hear on this set of records is the Baghdad variety and you will be understood all over Iraq , except in the extreme north , and in most of Trans - Jordania .
If you should go on to other regions , you will be given further information at that time .
Do n't worry about that now .
There is nothing very difficult about Arabic — except that you wo n't be able to read Arabic signs and newspapers you will see .
That is because they use a different alphabet from ours .
Therefore , the instructions and vocabulary below are not based on the written Arabic language , but are a simplified system of representing the language as it sounds .
This system contains letters for all the sounds you must make to be understood .
It does not contain letters for some of the sounds you will hear , but it will give you enough to get by on , both listening and speaking .
Here are a few simple rules to help you :
1. Accents .
You know what the accented syllable of a word is , of course .
It is the syllable which is spoken louder than the other syllables in the same word .
We will show accented ( loud ) syllables in capital letters and unaccented syllables in small letters .
2. Vowels .
These are the kinds of sounds we represent in English by a , e , i , o , u , ah , ay , ei , ai , au , ow , etc .
Just follow the key below and you will have no trouble .
a or A equals

seriously , if in the 40's when political correctness was a long way off we could instruct our armed forces to be this respectful of the culture int he country they 're stationed in , why the hell not now !?
Name : ( change name for anonymous posting ) Title : Comments : 1 Article displayed .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
How do people think the Democratic Congress is doing after six months ?
Lousy .
But better than the alternative .
In a new CNN / Opinion Research poll , only 25 percent of those polled approved of the job Congress is doing .
It 's midyear , and the Democratic Congress is taking a break .
Well - deserved ?
No , say Republicans .
" We are now halfway through the first year of the 110th Congress , " Rep. Eric Cantor , R - Virginia , said .
" And there is no question that the failure on the part of the Democrats in terms of their midterm exam is really a letdown to the expectations of the American people . ''
Democratic leaders are inclined to agree .
" I 'm not happy with Congress , either , " Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said .
And the American people ?
Look at the grades .
President Bush is doing terribly -- an average of 30 percent job approval in six recent polls .
Congress is doing worse -- 25 percent on the average in five polls .
Why the low marks ?
Democrats point to one issue where not much seems to be getting done .
" The war in Iraq is dragging down people 's confidence in what 's going on in this country , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said .
Republicans point to another issue .
" One of the reasons that confidence is at an all - time low is because of the immigration bill , " Sen .
Jim DeMint , R - South Carolina , said .
So , are voters ready to change horses again and go back to a Republican Congress ?
Nope .
A solid majority says it 's good for the country that the Democratic Party is in control of Congress .
Even though they 're doing a lousy job ?
Yes .
People think , OK , the Democrats are n't so great .
But the Republicans are worse .
Just a bare majority of Americans now holds a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party ( 51 percent ) .
But only 36 percent like the Republicans .
That 's the Republican Party 's second - lowest rating in 15 years .
Only in December 1998 , when the Republican Congress voted to impeach President Clinton , were Republicans held in lower regard .
So Democrats blame Republicans .
" The fact is that the Republicans are n't allowing us to proceed , '' Reid said .
And Republicans blame Democrats .
A Web video just released by the National Republican Congressional Committee highlights what it calls " the Democrat majority 's broken promises , abysmal record and rock - bottom approval rating . "
But Americans are not convinced that changing parties will make much difference .
The new dynamic in American politics right now is n't Democrat versus Republican .
" It is a sad commentary in America today that many Americans have lost faith in their government , " Sen .
Jon Kyl , R - Arizona , said .
He added , " Americans do n't believe that their government is representing them , is acting on their behalf .
The polls show it . "
The new dynamic is the people versus the government .
The immigration bill is a perfect illustration .
It was a bipartisan bill , supported by President Bush and by most Democrats in Congress .
Why did n't it pass ?
Because the people did n't like it .

“ I 'd put my money on solar energy … I hope we do n't have to wait til oil and coal run out before we tackle that . ”

The discover of tumis in situ is particularly exciting to scientists
The complex contains at least 20 tombs , and dates from the pre-Inca Sican era .
Among the discoveries are 12 " tumis " , ceremonial knives which scientists have not been able to study in a burial site before , as well as ceramics and masks .
The Sican culture flourished from approximately AD 800 - 1300 , one of several metalworking societies which succumbed to drought and conquest .
Archaeologists working on the project say the find will help them understand details of the culture .
Sican was a very organised society
Izumi Shimada
" That tells us that Sican was a very organised society . "
Professor Shimada , based at the University of Southern Illinois in the US , has been excavating Sican sites for a quarter of a century .
The latest dig was performed in conjunction with the Sican National Museum .
Trading goods
The burial site sits on Peru 's northern coast , near the town of Ferrenafe .
Discoveries in the tomb complex include tumis formed from an alloy of silver , copper and gold ; masks , breastplates and ceramics .
The site contains at least 20 tombs , making it a " religious city "
Another set of bones , clearly from a person of some stature , were found in a seated position accompanied by a metallic crown , part of a thorny oyster , and various ceramic objects including a vase .
The tumis are a prize find , because until now the knives have come to scientists from tomb raiders .
Finding them in situ would allow a closer understanding of their role in Sican culture , researchers said .
One of the tumis features a representation of Naylamp , the mythical founder of Sican society who according to legend emerged from the sea and became a god .
The Sican were noted for producing gold , silver and copper in quantities which were substantial for the period .
They traded shells and stones with societies in what are now Ecuador , Chile and Colombia .
Their civilisation had already declined by the time that the mightiest of Peruvian cultures , the Inca , rose to prominence about AD 1200 .

Upon the recommendation of a friend , I recently picked up a copy of the audiobook ( via Audible.com ) for Malcolm Gladwell 's book entitled " Blink . " [ Amazon.com Link ]
Blink is about ( in my own words ) gut impressions ... reading people , reading situations ... going with your intuition .
It is a very fascinating read ( listen ) .
Via Amazon you can even read an excerpt that gives you a good sense of what the book is about .
Anyway ...
Section five of the book is entitled " Listening to Doctors . "
[ Replace the word doctor with the word lawyer in the rest of this post ( yes ... it is painful to do that , but trust me ) . ]
In that section , Gladwell talks about various studies on the incidences of malpractice among doctors .
Do you know what studies show ?
They show ( paraphrasing Gladwell ) that the risk of being sued for malpractice has little to do with the number of mistakes you make ... no , in fact there is another element .
That element is ... how the patients were treated on a personal level by their doctor .
Did they have a relationship with their doctor ?
Was he snotty with them ?
Negative ?
Condescending ?
One study Gladwell mentions provides some interesting pointers to all of us lawyers ... doctors who spent even a few minutes longer in consultations with patients , who gave orienting comments explaining the process , who were active listeners and who had a sense of humor / tried to be funny were much much much less likely to be sued for malpractice even though they made just as many mistakes as other doctors ( who WERE sued ) .
Gladwell points out that it is all about your tone of voice with your clients , are you dominant or concerned ?
That one aspect ( tone of voice ) makes all the difference in the world .
So ... how are you treating your clients these days ?
How long does it take to you return a client 's phone call ?
When was the last time you sat down with a client to actually explain your opinion letter to them ?
Update : I noticed that Ernie Svenson mentioned Blink a few months ago in a post entitled " Strange book recommendation for lawyers . "
Cheney has documents indicating Sadaam is buying yellow cake uranium from Niger forged and produced through the Italian Intelligence Service SISMI .
Again speculation that Cheney has the document forged , but it does not seem like much of a stretch considering that is is EXACTLY what Cheney needs .
Joe Wilson goes to Niger and finds out it is not true .
Bush , in spite of CIA warnings , uses the Cheney " 16 words " talking point in the State of the Union speech .
Joe Wilson writes an editorial in the NYT calling BS .
Cheney , enraged and seeking revenge , outs undercover CIA operative Valerie Plame through Scooter Libby and others .
This compromises Brewster Jenninngs , a vital CIA nuclear anti-proliferation covert operation , putting American intelligence operatives and all of their allies and contacts in mortal danger .
Washington Post
The inadvertent disclosure of the name of a business affiliated with the CIA underscores the potential damage to the agency and its operatives caused by the leak of Plame 's identity .
Intelligence officials have said that once Plame 's job as an undercover operative was revealed , other agency secrets could be unraveled and her sources might be compromised or endangered .
Larry Johnson - a former CIA and State Department official who was a 1985 classmate of Plame 's in the CIA 's case officer - training program at Camp Peary , Va. , known as " the Farm " - predicted that when the CIA 's internal damage assessment is finished , " at the end of the day , ( the harm ) will be huge and some people potentially may have lost their lives . "
Patrick Fitzgerald investigates the leak .
Cheney and Libby et al lie and obfuscate and stonewall and throw sand in his eyes , effectively obstructing a federal investigation ..... and Justice .
At his trial , Scooter initially is going to call Cheney in his defense , his lawyer says he does not intend to be the fall guy .
And then suddenly he decides NOT to call Cheney or Rove .
Obviously a deal has been cut .
Scooter is found guilty of perjury and obstructing justice .
Patently and effectively shielding Cheney from any consequences .
Cheney 's puppet Bush at Cheney 's insistence , commutes Scooter 's sentence .
Thus guaranteeing all the bodies stay safely buried .
By commuting rather than pardoning , he ensures that Scooter can still plead the Fifth , further ensuring justice is thwarted .
It would do no good to call Scooter Libby .
His silence has been bought and paid for , " Leahy said , referring to Bush ’s commutation , " and he would just take the fifth . "
Dick Cheney successfully obstructs justice .
And gets away with outing an entire American Intelligence network in a time of war .
This is clearly treason .

Blogger posts internal White House numbers after 2008 hopeful called for ' flood ' Michael Roston

After President George W. Bush commuted the sentence of I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , his former adviser and one - time Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney , a contender for the Democratic nomination for president in 2008 encouraged citizens to flood the White House with phone calls .
A blogger raised the ante , and linked to an internal White House telephone directory so callers could reach beyond the White House 's switchboard .
" Last week Vice President Cheney asserted that he was beyond the reach of the law .
Today , President Bush demonstrated the lengths he would go to , ensuring that even aides to Dick Cheney are beyond the judgment of the law , " Senator Joseph Biden ( D - DE ) , a 2008 long shot , said in a statement he issued after Bush made his move .
" It is time for the American people to be heard .
I call for all Americans to flood the White House with phone calls tomorrow expressing their outrage over this blatant disregard for the rule of law . "
One blogger followed up on Biden 's suggestion and took it a step further .
Lambert Strether at the blog CorrenteWire posted a link to the White House 's full internal telephone directory in a Monday night entry .
" I figure the regular switchboard might be busy tomorrow , but if you ï¿½ve got the White House phone directory , you can just work your way down until somebody picks up , " he wrote .
From all over the country , phone calls have flooded Washington in recent weeks .
According to various news reports , part of the US Senate 's phone system crashed in the wake of the contentious debate over immigration reform legislation .
" So many Senators ' offices were inundated with calls , mostly in opposition , that the Senate telephone switchboard was shut down , " Silia Brush reported in a June 29 US News and World Report article .
While Strether hoped that individuals in the White House would hear from citizens , he encouraged them to be polite .
" Naturally , if you call the White House to express your disapprobation in the matter of I . Lewis Libby , you will be courteous , and remember that our public servants have important work to do , " he wrote .
At press time , RAW STORY was awaiting feedback from Strether on whether readers were in fact calling individual White House staff .

As the moon moved through the stages of the eclipse , George Lovely took this series of images from which he created a montage .
This picture by Francis Williamson in the Algarve , Portugal , shows the umbra stage of the eclipse .
During the lunar eclipse , captured here by Alan Wadsworth , the earth blocks the sunlight which normally bounces off the moon .
William Cooper captured the eclipse over Canary Wharf , London .
The phenomenon was also visible from India , as this photo by Soham Shoney in Pondicherry shows .

How Did You Lose Your Innocence ?
post # 211 — October 10 , 2006 — a Careers , Client Relations , Managing , Strategy post
I have been doing a lot of client work in the last few weeks in many countries , meeting people young and old in professional businesses .
My message is one of the economic benefits of optimism , professionalism and high standards , but it is met most often with a dejected , beaten - down cynicism .
Many times during my latest trip I was told things like : â€ œDavid .
It would be very nice to have your ideals : to believe that the managers with the highest integrity get the best work and the highest profits out of the group they manage .
But donâ€™t task - masters and slave - drivers also get results ?â€ 
â€ œIt would be nice to believe that the way you get the best out of employees and clients is to try – at least try — and understand them as human beings , and get better , if necessary at meeting their human needs .
But donâ€™t such idealistic people get rejected in companies — can you really get promoted as a manager if you care about your people — or your customers — too much ? ”
I keep meeting people who have given up their ability to believe in the power of standards and ideals ( or to believe that anyone else in business has them ) .
Some Examples
A consultant ( age 50 or so ) , who worked for one of the most famous â€˜brand namesâ€™ in consulting :
â€ œI was as simple boy who grew up in the country .
When I came to the city , they taught me that to get on in business you have to lie .
You exaggerate and misrepresent in proposals in order to win the work , you claim to have done things you have not done .
Thatâ€™s the way the game is played , you are taught.â€ 
A 30 - year - old middle - level supervisor at a European - wide training program :
â€ œThe firm pretends that it wants to inspire us , but the truth is that we do boring work , and so do those more senior than us .
We cannot imagine that there are people who do work they are still excited about .
Thatâ€™s a luxury we cannot dream about .
They just want us to work harder and get the people who report to us to work harder.â€ 
A partner in a tax firm :
â€ œWe know many ways to save our clients money , but that just would mean we would bill them less and take home less pay , so we donâ€™t work at getting efficient .
That would be the ‘ right ’ thing to do , and may even get us a good repuation in the long run , but no - one would seriously suggest changing to that way . ”
A senior national - level director of a professional business , in charge of 6,000 people :
â€ œItâ€™s OK talking about all this quality and employee motivation stuff , David , but we just want to make money — lotâ€™s of it .
Whatâ€™s wrong with that ?â€ 
So hereâ€™s my question to you :
How did we / you end up here ?
Clearly , something was missing from my education and upbringing – the world forgot to “ beat out of me ” my ideals , but seems to have done a good job of beating them out of most other people .
I ’m really interested : What ( specifically ) happened to you that made you lose your innocence about how business ( or academia ) was run ?
( Stories please . )
The following cautionary tale must surely rate in the top five of " most embarrassing things that can happen to you in public - ever " .
According to UK tabloid the Sun , a 33 - year - old Welsh housewife ended up in hospital after wearing Ann Summers vibrating Passion Pants to her local Asda supermarket in Swansea .
Unfortunately , she became " so aroused by the 2 ½ - inch vibrating bullet inside that she fainted " then " fell against shelves and banged her head " .
This prompted the attendance of the paramedics who " found the black leatherette panties still buzzing " .
Having disabled the orgasmatronic underwear , they then whisked the senseless shopper to hospital where she made a complete recovery .
Staff handed her back the Passion Pants upon discharge , discreetly concealed in a plastic bag .
To its credit , the Sun does not name the woman .
We assume , however , that she will be shopping at her local Tesco for the next ten years or so , or until everyone in the Asda who witnessed her ordeal is dead or has succumbed to total amnesia - whichever comes soonest .
For the record , Ann Summers notes that Passion Pants are " Not for internal use " .
Now we know why . ®
Bootnote
Thanks to all those members of the neoLuddite Resistance Army who have written in to suggest that this is in fact another manifestation of the Rise of the Machines™ .
The elimination of the female of the species through vibrating panties ?
It 's a chilling thought , but what a way to go ...

A girl of seven who had never seen sunshine has been rescued from a remote farmhouse .
The child , who was kept in a darkened room , had skin like parchment and is believed to be extremely disturbed .
She had never met anyone but her mother , who is believed to have kept her hidden away in shame because she was illegitimate .
German police said the woman also kept eight head of cattle at the farmhouse , and they were better looked after than her daughter .
One officer described the girl as " virtually feral " .
Scroll down for more ...
Police and welfare officials swooped after a tip - off that the 45 - year - old woman was hiding a child in the farmhouse near Augsburg in Bavaria .
At least one youngster living nearby had glimpsed the child through a window and told her parents : " There is a little girl in the strange house . "
The farmhouse was said to be like a rubbish tip inside , full of rotting food , paper and tins .
In a highly bureaucratic country such as Germany it is baffling how the woman managed to keep the child without her being registered somewhere .
Prosecutors are to press cruelty charges against her .
The girl 's uncle lives nearby but he has not been arrested .
Local people tipped off the police after spotting the woman buying children 's clothes .
Johannes Kreuzpointer , the senior public prosecutor in charge of the case , said police were trying to establish who the father of the girl is and how she was missed by the German welfare state .
" The investigation is continuing and many people are being interviewed , " he said .
The mother has been taken to a different town as feelings of anger grow about the treatment of her daughter among local people .
The mother was seen around the town but described variously by locals as " withdrawn , joyless , shy and strange . "
Police are to have her psychologically assessed in the coming days before deciding whether she should face charges of neglect .
The theory is that the woman gave birth to the girl at home in July 1999 and never told a soul about it .
She lived on inherited property some way from people and was able to carve out a solitary existence for herself and her child .
Better information reaps dividends
When investors review the Dow Jones Industrial Average and other stock markets , they usually do not consider the changing value of a point .
People focus on the changing numbers in points , such as " the Dow is up 10 points , " rather than looking at the changing value of a point , says Arthur Lupia , the Hal R. Varian Collegiate Professor of Political Science .
If news reports about a stock market included other meaningful information , such as its value in comparison to things that people buy ( e.g. , oil ) or other ways that they can store their earnings ( e.g. , the currencies of other countries ) , people could make better investment decisions , he says .
" Small changes in the emphasis and content of stock market reports can lead people to pay more attention to the changing meaning of the Dow Jones Industrial Average points which can , in turn , improve their decisions , " he says .
Lupia and his colleagues studied the diluted value of stock market reports .
He presented the findings Aug. 31 at the American Political Science Association annual meeting in Chicago .
Lupia , who also is a research professor at the Institute for Social Research , says the value of a Dow Jones point has declined significantly in recent years , thus news reports of " record highs do not mean what they used to . "
As a result , some people might be surprised to learn how little their IRAs and 401 ( k ) s are worth when they retire .
The researchers tested their theories in an experiment that allowed a person to purchase stock or to convert the money into Canadian currency then place it under his or her bed for a year .
In one demonstration that included dividends and other benefits of holding stocks , Lupia and colleagues showed that an investor who bought all of the stocks included in the Dow Jones on Jan. 2 , 2001 , and sold them on the record - high closing date of 2006 ( Dec. 27 ) , gained $ 3,377.34  or $ 2,870.74 after taxes .
If , however , the same investor simply converted the money to Canadian dollars on Jan. 2 , 2001 , and changed them back for U.S. dollars on Dec. 27 , 2006 , his or her post - tax gain would have been substantially greater ( $ 3,074.64 ) than it would have been from participating in a " record - breaking " stock market .
When the researchers repeated this comparison for nearly 800,000 combinations of " cash in " and " cash out " dates between 2001 - 06 , they found that after accounting for taxes , investors would have been better off exchanging their money for Canadian dollars than buying the components of the Dow Jones 97 percent of the time .
The reason for this surprising result is that the value of a point on the Dow Jones Industrial Index is tied to the value of a U.S. dollar , Lupia says .
In recent years , due to a series of economic factors and political decisions , the value of the U.S. dollar has fallen substantially against other benchmarks , such as an ounce of gold , a barrel of oil , the Euro , and the Canadian dollar .
The meaning of a Dow Jones point increase and record highs in the stock market are severely diluted , he says .
The changing role of the U.S. economy in the world should lead people to rethink generations - old assumptions about the U.S. dollar , as well as Dow Jones points , as a steady measure of value , Lupia says .
He argues that small changes in how stock market information is reported can help people understand how the falling U.S. dollar affects the financial futures of people who invest in IRAs and 401 ( k ) s .
If news reports help people to understand this relationship , investors get a more accurate picture of their financial futures , he says .
Lupia 's co-authors of the study are political science graduate students Cassandra Grafstrom , Yanna Krupnikov , Adam Seth Levine , William MacMillan and Erin McGovern .
A security researcher intercepted thousands of private e-mail messages sent by foreign embassies and human rights groups around the world by turning portions of the Tor internet anonymity service into his own private listening post .
A little over a week ago , Swedish computer security consultant Dan Egerstad posted the user names and passwords for 100 e-mail accounts used by the victims , but did n't say how he obtained them .
He revealed Friday that he intercepted the information by hosting five
Tor exit nodes placed in different locations on the internet as a research project .
Tor is a sophisticated privacy tool designed to prevent tracking of where a web user surfs on the internet and with whom a user communicates .
It 's endorsed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other civil liberties groups as a method for whistleblowers and human - rights workers to communicate with journalists , among other uses .
It 's also used by law enforcement and other government agencies to visit websites anonymously to read content and gather intelligence without exposing their identity to a website owner .
But Egerstad says that many who use
Tor mistakenly believe it is an end - to - end encryption tool .
As a result , they are n't taking the precautions they need to take to protect their web activity .
He believes others are likely exploiting this oversight as well .
" I am absolutely positive that I am not the only one to figure this out , " Egerstad says .
" I 'm pretty sure there are governments doing the exact same thing .
There 's probably a reason why people are volunteering to set up a node . "
Victims of Egerstad 's research project included embassies belonging to Australia , Japan , Iran , India and Russia .
Egerstad also found accounts belonging to the foreign ministry of Iran , the United Kingdom 's visa office in Nepal and the Defence Research and Development Organization in India 's Ministry of Defence .
In addition , Egerstad was able to read correspondence belonging to the Indian ambassador to China , various politicians in Hong Kong , workers in the Dalai Lama 's liaison office and several human - rights groups in Hong Kong .
Egerstad says it was n't just e-mail that was exposed but instant messages passed internally between workers and any other web traffic that crossed the network .
Among the data he initially collected was e-mail from an Australian embassy worker with the subject line referring to an " Australian military plan . "
" It kind of shocked me , " he says .
Tor has hundreds of thousands of users around the world , according to its developers .
The largest numbers of users are in the United States , the European Union and China .
Tor works by using servers donated by volunteers around the world to bounce traffic around en route to its destination .
Traffic is encrypted through most of that route , and routed over a random path each time a person uses it .
Under Tor 's architecture , administrators at the entry point can identify the user 's IP address , but can't read the content of the user 's correspondence or know its final destination .
Each node in the network thereafter only knows the node from which it received the traffic , and it peels off a layer of encryption to reveal the next node to which it must forward the connection .
( Tor stands for " The Onion Router . " )
But Tor has a known weakness :
The last node through which traffic passes in the network has to decrypt the communication before delivering it to its final destination .
Someone operating that node can see the communication passing through this server .
The Tor website includes a diagram showing that the last leg of traffic is not encrypted , and also warns users that " the guy running the exit node can read the bytes that come in and out of there . "
But Egerstad says that most users appear to have missed or ignored this information .
Unless they 're surfing to a website protected with SSL encryption , or use encryption software like PGP , all of their e-mail content , instant messages , surfing and other web activity is potentially exposed to any eavesdropper who owns a Tor server .
This amounts to a lot of eavesdroppers – the software currently lists about 1,600 nodes in the Tor network .
Egerstad discovered the problem about two months ago when he signed up five servers he owns in Sweden , the United States and Asia to be Tor nodes , and started peeking at the traffic .
He was surprised to discover that 95 percent of the traffic that passed through his Tor nodes was not encrypted .
Even more surprising was the number of embassies and other government agencies that were using Tor , and using it incorrectly .
That prompted Egerstad to narrow his search to e-mail correspondence with a focus on government agencies .
He wrote a script to search for .gov domains and keywords such as " embassy , " " war " and " military , " and focused on sniffing port - 25 traffic , the port through which e-mail passes .
He collected between 200 and 250 accounts belonging to embassies and government agencies that were sending passwords and the content of correspondence in the clear .
None of them belonged to U.S. embassies or government agencies .
Among the data he found in the correspondence was a spreadsheet listing passport numbers and personal information about the passport holders , as well as sensitive details about meetings and activities among government officials .
Egerstad contacted one account holder about his vulnerability but was ignored , he says .
So on Aug. 30 he posted 100 of the accounts and passwords online to get the word out , but kept largely mum about how he'd obtained the information .
Since posting the data , he says only one victim has contacted him to find out what they were doing wrong and learn how to fix it : Iran .
In addition to Iran 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the country 's embassies in Ghana , Kenya , Oman and Tunisia were swept up by Egerstad 's experimental surveillance .
Shava Nerad , the development director for the nonprofit group that supports
Tor , admits the group needs to produce better documentation for users to make the risks of the system clearer .
But she adds that people in high - risk environments , such as embassies , should understand those risks already and should be encrypting their communication on their own .
" If you 're in a position like that handling sensitive data and you 're working for the government , " she says , " it is irresponsible to send that data unencrypted .
They should institute practices that educate their users and ensure the privacy of the data by going through encrypted VPNs . "
Egerstad says he has shut down his Tor nodes .

Let ’s look at another bitter Red Pill lesson on the opportunity cost of the war in Iraq .
While this solar hydrogen system does n’t seem like a good idea for mainstream deployment , Mike Strizki , the man behind the project accurately notes , “ No one has said what I ’m doing does n’t work . ”
So , why is n’t this a good idea ?
Well , the cost !
It ’s too expensive .
Right ?
Yeah .
All beancounters are great at explaining to newspaper reporters how expensive clean energy technologies are , but I do n’t see anyone comparing the cost of these technologies to the stupid and illegal war in Iraq .
Except me .
So , how many $ 500,000 solar hydrogen systems ( like the one described below ) could be built with the funds currently being allocated to the sinkhole war in Iraq ?
Remember , the Iraq war is costing $ 208,333 per minute .
So , for every 2.4 minutes that the U.S. spends in Iraq , one of these emission free solar hydrogen systems could be built .
That ’s 25 per hour .
That ’s 600 per day .
That ’s 4200 per week .
That ’s 16,800 per month .
Of course , this is retail pricing .
What would the cost be if the the buildouts were done on a massive scale ?
An order of magnitude less probably is n’t out of the question .
I ’m not advocating the system described in this article .
( Watch , someone will accuse me of falling for the hydrogen scam in comments . )
The point is that we do n’t have a clean - energy - technology - is - expensive problem .
We have a diabolical - misappropriation - of - public - funds problem .
Some combination of large scale wave , solar and wind ( in that order ) power generation , plus simple conservation technologies , plus individuals feeding the grid with their excess wind and solar power would be the way to go .
How close to that goal could we get if $ 208,333 per minute was spent trying to reach it ?
We ’ll never know because , “ They hate us for our freedom . ”
Via : Christian Science Monitor :
Mike Strizki lives in the nation ’s first solar - hydrogen house .
The technology this civil engineer has been able to string together â€ “ solar panels , a hydrogen fuel cell , storage tanks , and a piece of equipment called an electrolyzer â€ “ provides electricity to his home year - round , even on the cloudiest of winter days .
Mr. Strizki ’s monthly utility bill is zero â€ “ he ’s off the power grid â€ “ and his system creates no carbon - dioxide emissions .
Neither does the fuel - cell car parked in his garage , which runs off the hydrogen his system creates .
It sounds promising , even utopian : homemade , storable energy that does n’t contribute to global warming .
But does Strizki ’s method â€ “ converting electricity generated from renewable sources into hydrogen â€ “ make sense for widespread adoption ?
According to some renewable - energy experts , the answer is “ no , ” at least not anytime soon .
The system is too expensive , they say , and the process of creating hydrogen from clean sources is itself laced with inefficiency â€ “ the numbers just do n’t add up .
Strizki ’s response : “ Nothing is as wildly expensive as destroying the whole planet . ”
Dunkin '
Donuts has announced that it will be offering a zero - trans - fat menu starting Oct. 15 in all its stores .
( They 've already been including zero - trans - fat items in 400 Dunkin ' Donutses around the country as part of a blind taste test . )
Subsidiary Baskin Robbins will follow suit in January 2008 .
So where does that leave the donut world 's trans - fat tote board ?
Krispy Kreme : The North Carolina company that has been aggressively challenging Massachusetts - based Dunkin ' Donuts ' pastry supremacy in the U.S. does n't have a zero - trans - fat option on its menu , but is working on it .
" We continue to work aggressively with outside supply partners , and our goal is to get to zero trans - fatty acids while maintaining great Krispy Kreme taste , " a spokesman told the Associated Press .
Winchell 's Donut House : California - based donut chain did n't return AP 's calls .
Sounds like a " no comment . "
Starbucks : Seattle - based mega - chain that you may be acquainted with .
Announced in May that it was going to cut artificial trans fats out of its products in the continental U.S. , Alaska and Canada by the end of the year .
Tim Horton's : Canada 's pride and joy ( popular Canadiana writer Will Ferguson once told me I 'd never understand the Canadian soul until I 'd had a maple donut at Tim Horton's ) , and one donut empire the AP story strangely missed .
It 's a big omission , too .
When I called , the Tim Horton 's people told me that the company 's been trans - fat - free since early 2006 .
And in case you protest that only American donut chains count , remember that they have over 300 restaurants in the U.S. ( and one outside Kandahar , Afghanistan , weirdly enough ) .
Mark up one win for Canada .
So , to sum up : Dunkin ' Donuts is ahead of Starbucks by a length , Krispy Kreme 's stuck way in the back of the pack , and Winchell 's seems to have lost its jockey altogether .
And Tim Horton's ?
It 's already won the race and is enjoying a post - run rubdown .
Wait .
" Dunkin ' Donutses " ?
Can that possibly be right ?

Want to know how much your salary is per hour ?
Use this trick to quickly find out how much you make ( & how much you SHOULD charge )
I think everyone can agree : Getting paid for your hard work is AWESOME .
But it does n’t matter if you ’re an entrepreneur or if you ’re working for someone else , you ’re probably going to be asking yourself a LOT of questions :
How much am I being paid per hour ?
How do I calculate my pay from hourly to salary ?
How long will it take me to make X % more ?
How much should I expect for payment ?
That ’s why I wanted to share with you two cool back - of - the - napkin tricks that I use to help me answer some of these questions quickly so I ’m not wasting a bunch of time .
You can even do these tricks at parties and impress everyone with your awesome personal finance tricks !*

Cool financial trick # 1 : Find out your yearly salary using your hourly rate
The formula to convert hourly to salary
This one ’s simple : just take your hourly rate , double it , and add a thousand to the end .
If you make $ 20 / hour , you make $ 40,000 / year .
( $ 20 x 2 = 40 .
Add 000 to the end for $ 40,000 . )
If you make $ 25 / hour , you make approximately $ 50,000 / year .
Working backwards , $ 60,000 a year is $ 30 an hour ( $ 60,000 / 1,000 = $ 60 .
60/2 = $ 30 ! )
This can also work in the reverse if you want to find out your hourly rate .
Simply divide by two and drop the thousand .
So $ 50,000 / year becomes approximately $ 25 / hour .
Of course , this is based on the typical 40 - hour workweek and does n’t include taxes .
Why this trick is great
For two reasons :
One , sometimes you have an hourly job and need to compare it to a salaried one ( or vice versa ) while applying to possible jobs .
Two :
When you ’re a beginner freelancer and you really do n’t know how much to charge , this can help .
Use Google or Glassdoor to find out the salary a full - time person would earn – then convert it to hourly to figure out what you should charge .
Once you ’re established , you should charge way more because you ’re worth it .
I often get questions like :
“ How much should I charge ? ”
“ Is $ XX / hour too much or too little ? ”
“ Should I be charging by the hour or by the project ? ”
By looking at your ideal ( read : realistic ) salary , you ’ll be able to figure out how much you should be charging per hour quickly and easily .
If you ’re still wondering how much you should be charging , here are two other great methods I ’ve used to find a rate that ’s good for me .
That ’s right .
You get three tricks for the price of one .
Consider yourself LUCKY .
Double your “ resentment number ” .
I love this one because it ’s both really interesting and effective .
Ask yourself :
What ’s the lowest rate you ’ll work for that ’ll leave you resentful of your work ?
Say you ’ll work for $ 15 / hour at the VERY LEAST but hate the job .
Just double that number so now you ’ll earn $ 30 / hour .
Do what the next guy does .
This method is incredibly simple :
Go to Google and search for the average hourly rate for whatever service you ’re providing .
You ’ll get a good sense of where to start when you ’re charging your clients .
And after you earn your first $ 1,000 , it ’s incredibly easy to start dialing your prices up and “ tuning ” your rate .
Were you making $ 30 / hour ?
Start charging $ 40 or even $ 50 .
There ’s no hard and set rule for how much you should be charging .
Cool financial trick # 2 : Use the rule of 72 to see how long it ’ll take to double your money
The formula
Simply take 72 and divide it by your return rate percentage .
The result is the number of years it takes to double your money .
When you put it together , it looks like this :
72 / [ return rate you ’re getting ] = # of years to double your money .
Imagine you ’re getting a 10 % interest rate from an index fund .
Divide 72 by 10 , and you have approximately 7 years to double your money .
So if you invested $ 5000 today , and earned a 10 % return , you ’d have $ 10,000 in 7 years .
Of course , it doubles from there too .
In other words , as long as the return rate is constant , the money will double every 7 years .

Why this trick is great
With the rule of 72 , you can see how easy it is to DOUBLE your investment by investing just a little bit of money .
To give you an example of how much money you can earn this way , I ’ll tell you about when I put away $ 1000 in an index fund as a gift to my friend ’s new baby .
Yes , I know .
I ’m such a sentimentalist .
Assuming the index fund earns 10 % annualized during the kid ’s life , guess how much it would be worth ?
Age 1 : $ 1,000
Age 7 : $ 2,000
Age 14 : $ 4,000
Age 21 : $ 8,000 ( This is where I come in and tell her not to spend it all on her spring break trip to Cabo . )
Age 28 : $ 16,000
Age 35 : $ 32,000
Age 42 : $ 64,000
Age 49 : $ 128,000
Age 56 : $ 256,000
Age 63 : $ 512,000
Basically , you can see that Uncle Ramit ’s $ 1,000 gift would leave the kid rolling in money 60 years later .
As singer - songwriter and greatest - poet - of - this - generation - and - the - next Celine Dion once said , “ My heart will go on . ”
And it grows from there .
Note how much the money grows towards the end .
Yes , this is a simplistic model that assumes a 10 % return rate .
And yes , it leaves out inflation / taxes .
BUT it shows that even a small investment of $ 1,000 can grow with time — even though you do n’t add a penny to it .
The critical factors are time , minimizing fees / taxes , and picking sensible , long - term investments .
So the question is now :
What are you going to do about this ?
Are you going to keep your money sitting in a bank account where it ’s NOT making appreciable returns , or are you going to start investing that money ?
The sooner you start , the easier it is to get rich .
This is n’t BS either .
There are over 100 years of evidence in the stock market that suggests this .
Still do n’t believe me ?
Let ’s look at another real - world example .
Say you ’re 25 years old and you decide to invest $ 500 / month in a low - cost , diversified index fund .
If you do that until you ’re 60 , how much money do you think you ’d have ?
Take a look :
$ 1,116,612.89 .
That ’s right .
You ’d be a millionaire after only investing a few thousand dollars per year .
Notice , I ’m not talking about the Hollywood type of investing where hot - shot stockbrokers make huge multi-million dollar trades while yelling “ SELL ” into a phone for some reason .
I said you should invest in low - cost , diversified index funds over time .
That ’s because smart investments are about consistency more than anything else — not chasing hot stocks .
Or other weird investments :
By using these two tricks , you ’ll be able to really get started on your journey to live a Rich Life .
Use the hourly to salary trick to figure out how much to charge so you can invest in an index fund .
Then use the rule of 72 to figure out when that index fund sets you up for retirement .

Sure .
I 'm Dan Pritchett at EBay .
I 'm a technical fellow ; I have been at EBay for 5 years .
I 'm currently working in the corporate architecture organization ; we are actaully a new organization that was formed at the beginning of 2006 to start addressing the integration issues across the EBay platforms .
People think of EBay as EBay .com maybe think of PayPal.com , probably Skype given the publicity around that but the reality is that we have 19 different properties and platforms , that are all unique technology stacks , unique operational concerns and so on .
The Corporate Architecture team is responsible to trying to figure out how to bring technologies to bare that allow those organizations to continue to operate independently and respond to their markets while trying to drive down the cost of doing business at EBay .
2. EBay does n't use transactions ?
What 's up with that ?
So EBay .com does n't use transactions .
I was asked this question previously [ concerning ]
PayPal , because it 's moving money in and out people bank accounts .
PayPal.com uses transactions .
But EBay .com does n't use transactions and a lot of it is driven by availability concerns for the majority of our use cases , there 's critical data and there 's non critical data , and out of necessity we have to split our databases .
There 's just no way to think that we would run on a single database , so it is going to be horizontally spread both within a given functional area and across functional area .
So that by necessity when you start talking about transactions drives you to the 2 phase commit .
And from the availability point of view , it is not pragmatic to think that we can get the number of databases that are involved in any particular use case enlisted in a 2 phase commit and both be responsive and also maintain site availability .
Beyond that , there 's just data that we are willing to lose .
Now that does n't mean we do n't care about your data , it just means that we care about different types of your data in different ways , as I 'm sure you do , right ?
We 're pretty sure that when somebody is selling an item on EBay that they are going to be very unhappy if we told them that the item was listed and the item was n't listed .
Our accounting department would be very unhappy if the item was listed but we failed to capture the fees for the items , so we do n't get paid for it .
But there are other things that happen there .
There 's preference data , there 's marketing data , these are the kind of things that we feel pretty comfortable when saying " we are going to make a best effort to make sure that we capture that data , if we miss it occasionally , which is less than at least … we are at least three 9's in all these things , we missed it and that 's unfortunate .
It 's potentially frustrating for the community and we understand and appreciate that , but we are willing to sacrifice that for making sure we got the other data at a much more reliable rate " .
3 . How did you find that when you first came into contact with the organization , what was your reaction to that ?
Not having transactions , not letting the database do things like foreign key constraints and things that you would expect a database to do was definitely uncomfortable , put me off balance a little bit .
But once you begin to understand what it is you are trying to achieve , it does make a lot of sense and the concept of the cap theorem that you have consistency , availability or partitioning , and you get 2 out of 3 , is really spot on .
The reality is that as you scale , as you move to high transactional volumes , you are forced in that direction , it 's not like there 's a set of alternatives .
What I find curios and interesting is that while I can't say that I have talked to all the very high volume sites , I can say that for the ones that we have interacted with , we found the same thing .
They have arrived there independently , so there comes a point where you outgrow the scaling capabilities of normal expected patterns and you have to do things differently and the way you do things differently seams to be pretty consistent , and transaction is one of the first thing to go .
4 . Also an area that I was interested in your talk was the fact that you minimized what the database does .
The current state of that on EBay may be that we have got a little too far in the other direction and we started to back away from that a little bit .
It was a reaction to the fact that there was a critical junction from 1999 and 2000 where we actually had a single database and we were using transactions and we were using foreign key constraints and all kinds of cool capabilities that Oracle offered , and then the database crashed and it crashed a couple of times , and so the reaction was " ok what do we start off loading out , how do we pull stuff out of the code " , and that drove us in this direction of minimizing what the database does .
So there are certain things like referential integrity that you can't do if you are functionally decomposing data across multiple databases , because you can't have referential integrity span database instances .
Some of the other things that we have stayed away from like sorting , joining , we 're coming back to now , primary key joins are actually far more efficient to do in the database then they are in the application space space , some of the sorting stuff that we would like to do is reasonable to do .
We do have other challenges with things like ordering , like Oracle does n't provide good pagination , semantics for sort , so when you are sorting data and it is coming back to you and you need to show things 50 at a time and you 've got 5000 items in the result set , it 's difficult to rely on Oracle to do that .
A lot of that stuff we have also moved into our voyager technology , because we have actually built voyager , one of the optimizations we made in that was to become very efficient at how you return the forth page set of 50 out of the 50000 in the result set .
We have also played some tricks there that are not using some of the technologies we have just off loaded on the other platforms .
But for the most part we want the database to be an essentially reliable data store and keep as much stuff as possible in logics so that we have more control over it , we can control when that logic rules , how it is implemented and all that kind of stuff as well .
That 's the same reason why we do n't use stored procedures : anything that happens in the database is invisible to developers for all practical purposes .
5 . Did this experience alter some of your views about the role that the database should play in this kind of application ?
Absolutely .
Even to the extent that I question at times , and we have been looking at this at EBay , whether you even need a database .
If at the end of the day you are just storing bits of data and you are not asking for ordering , you are just doing look ups along primary key paths , you are not doing arbitrary search criteria .
If I look at some of the journal file technology , why is that not appropriate at times because it gives you transactional guarantees in terms of being committed to a persistent state , and I can certainly rely on intelligent use of direct structures and file naming patterns to get very efficient look ups our primary key path .
It definitely brings in the question " do I need an Oracle database in every instance ?
Do I need a database in every instance ? "
And these are things we are starting to look at , we certainly looked at on EBay , there are places where if we have this non critical data that we 're willing to take some compromise on does that data need to be in Oracle at all .
Are those places where we can put that in different database or not in a database at all ?
It definitely brings those kinds of things into question .
6 . What other things have surprised you over the course of your last few years at EBay ?
Most of the surprises come along the lines of the things like : you have a process , you have a system , it seams to be running along in a nice state and suddenly these discontinuity events are occurring and you say : " ok , now what do we do ? " .
Few of them blindsided us a little bit .
One of them was dealing with our parallel development efforts .
We suddenly reached a point where we discovered merging was very hard and trying to get code to the point where we can roll out to the site was a problem , so we had to go through some hick ups coming up with this current merge process we have that does require people to work around the clock but at least it works .
Another one has taken us by surprise lately was power .
This one has come out of nowhere seemingly , but in reality it was always looking under the covers , but what 's most interesting about it is that it became a software problem .
And I am not sure everybody is convinced of that , but I am convinced of that now , that we would reach a point where we could n't deliver power to our datacenters because municipalities can't even deliver the power infrastructure or build the power infrastructure to do that , which then drives you into problems of " how do I drive up utilization on boxes to the point that I 'm not wasting , I do n't have idle processors that are consuming power but not doing work for me ? " .
An interesting architectural deployment and software engineering problem , if you asked me 2 years ago " are going to be thinking about this problem in terms of how to maximize transactions per watt ? "
I would not have predicted that it was going to be part of my life now .
In terms of experiences at EBay , and it 's harder for me to think of it in terms of what were the shocks from a career , its always easier for me to think in terms of what were the problems snuck up on me .
It brought me to this idea that I 've been trying to articulate and get my head around of " what are all the vectors of scalability ? "
I like to think of architecture in terms of a spider graph where all the axis on the spider graphs that you really need to be thinking about .
And history teaches us that the vector that you 've left off the spider graph is the one that in 2 years from now is going to be the one that has collapsed imploded and you are going to be working very hard to figure out how to incorporate it and then make the trade offs against all the other vectors to get things back into an acceptable balance .
And that one is hard , guessing which vector is not on your graph is probably the hardest problem that any architect faces .
7. Connected with that , what are the kinds of things that surprise new people when they join EBay ?
I think one of the biggest surprises for new people is how much we bend the rules of architecture and in some ways this was new for me to think about as well , because we have patterns and principles and it's not that we ignore all patterns , we ignore all principles , but you have to apply them intelligently .
I forgot who was giving the talk earlier and said " patterns do n't mean you have to turn off your brain " .
But what 's probably the most difficult thing for architects and developers to get their head around is how far we will deviate from a pattern , how far we will bend and break the rules , because at the end of the day the only thing that matters ultimately is that we are able to meet the availability numbers at the transaction volumes we are facing .
You do n't want to be careless about that , you do n't want to throw all principles to the wind but you have to achieve that .
EBay is an interesting place ; I enjoy being there so much because very straight forward problems become extremely hard at massive scales , and our scales are so massive .
One of the challenges that I often face with the product organization is that they will see a cool feature on a site that is parallel to our industry but they really want it .
And it 's like " they are doing this " and that 's ok , but they are doing 500.000 page views a day and you want to put it on a page that 's doing 300 million page views a day , and that involves 5 database round trips , in order for us to implement that feature so you are talking about adding 1.5 billion SQL executions a day to a database .
A host that can do 600 million host a day , I now need 3 mid tier boxes just so that we can have this widget on this page .
These are the kind of problems that you face as an architect at EBay .
There is this need to be responsive to the business and to do things , but so many things are so hard .
Another cool thing is that what a lot of organizations consider a scaling problem , we do n't assign architects to because it 's such a trivial volume of data that we expect the developers to be able to handle it .
The 3 or 4 million per day per page site is just something that we will apply our pattern to .
You do n't need approvals , just go build it the way it is supposed to be built , we know it will run .
There are people spending hours of their day trying to figure out how to get the 4 million page views a day .
To us it 's a cast aside problem , you are a developer at EBay you 'd better know how to do a 4 million page views a day page .
8 . You mentioned a lot of common rules that you had to bend .
What are some examples of those rules ?
Obviously transactions are a huge one that makes people crazy .
Bringing things into the referential integrity and a lot of the database constraints and pulling those into the application tier .
We 've also done some interesting things in the way that we collapsed the application tier .
There are places in our site where logics occur that you would n't necessarily want logic to occur but it occurs there because it 's the most pragmatic place for it to exist , there 's times when there 's business logics in XSLT but that 's because it has to occur there for the user experience to be correct .
There 's a variety of examples like that , it 's hard for me to come to specific ones .
It does n't have to be … is that most of my time at EBay has really been spent on the component level architectural considerations , some design patterns in the v3 stack but the reality is that I 've done very little actual coding in that stack , I 've done coding on other stacks on EBay , but my primary role has been trying to address how we do integration , how we do deployment , what do our data centers look like , and a lot of these kinds of things , and a lot less about what 's the Java patterns that we are using .
I did some of that early on but we have mini architects working on that problem and I got assigned of to other challenges .
9 . Do you want to talk about what is the architecture on different layers ?
From what level ?
Because the interesting thing is that there 's always the onion .
You can look at our application stack and this is a very classic core J2EE set of design patterns , without using J2EE so presentation tier : that 's done via command , there 's the application objects which are the equivalent of session beans , the business object which are the equivalent of entity beans , a data abstraction layer which is our O/R mapping layer , the V3 application stack is very familiar to anybody who understands the patterns .
We have slightly different names for the things we have taken some interesting design decisions like the way we communicate back the page description is we built a business oriented XML structure that goes back to the presentation tear which then does a transform on it using XSLT to generate HTML .
That 's unique , I do n't think patterns necessarily call for that , is not necessarily a deviation from the patterns , but it 's a model ; it 's an interesting way to implement the models .
But the rest of it is interesting in terms of how we break things down in the application , the functional decomposition , in the code along specific problems domains .
We have some standard ones of user / registration management , buying , selling , finding , billing , I do n't even remember what they all are , so that allows us to focus , in terms of code management and dependency management the ; way we organize the code .
The standard J2EE stuff is about " what does this stack look like ? " .
As you start building that scale you have to go to the next level of functional decomposition saying " ok , how do I manage my dependencies between the various layers of the code , so that I do n't end up with all these wads of un-maintainable logic , and then you go to the next layer , the deployment decomposition where you start working on " ok , now that I have a search domain but how do I actually deploy that into a set of operational pools , so that I can manage availability , see the dependencies across those things , how do I determine what they are dependent upon , how do I protect them from having cross dependencies that get in the deadly embrace styles of coupling and then the architectures extends out to even within that how do I actually run a search pool out of 3 data centers and make sure our search is supposed to be nearly always available , supposed to be the most available thing on the site , how do you accomplish that ?
What do those pools look like ?
What are the hardware configurations ? "
And one of the great enlightenments that we got to is that hardware fail over is n't completely reliable , so if you are actually looking at the way that we have configured our pools of equipment , and we have load balancers in front of them and those load balancers are paired so that we can rely on hardware fail overs but that does n't always work so we have 2 different IP addresses into 2 different pair pools of those that we load , we let DNS load balance across so that we protect our so when you say the EBay architecture is each of these layers , and some of these I 'm more intimately involved in than others , my sweet spot is between the " what is the interaction between components , what are the deployment models that we are going to use in order to achieve availability , and so on " .
10 .
What kind of architecture enforcement does EBay apply across the development team and how is that managed …?
There 's 1500 in house developers which is considerably more when you facture in the outsource contracting that we do , and you 've got 30 architects .
You can imagine that the architects are not involved in every single project .
There 's actually a process that goes on at EBay where at a time features are request there 's always a pager written for the feature and there 's a review process established that the feature sound logical ; if it's in line with architectural patterns from its description and it appears that it's not going to be a large scale feature , then those are given a pass , the ones that have got potential architecture impacts or are going to be large get an architect assigned .
And then enforcement is a too strong of a word for what happens at EBay .
For the architects that do n't get architectural assignments we have the standard patterns .
The developers are supposed to pick the domains that their code impacts properly , they are supposed to follow the standard design patterns , and they do .
It 's more efficient if they do , so they do .
The larger ones that involve architects , we do have a lot of standardized patterns and we actually have taken that beyond just the normal coding patterns you might expect .
We have a whole collection of standard database patterns , based on the type of data you are trying to model , which of the read / write model versus the horizontal split model , what will your key management be , all those kind of things .
I have got some standard patterns , we do it also for asyncronization standards , and we 've got 3 or 4 groupings of these that we do .
We use a rules base system ; we have one for rules and one for services .
That gives the architects some standard frameworks that they can apply which is as in all patterns , it 's helpful for them because it reduce their workload , but it gives a lever to use when working with development and operations and that kind of stuff .
If I have already got a standard pattern and we pick pattern C for database use , this has already been approved by the architectural review board , there 's an architectural review board called ARB , so it 's already been approved by them , we do n't have to go ask for their approval .
Now if you want to do something different , that 's going to get through a whole different set of review processes .
Standardizing these patterns and having approvals help them considerably with that .
11 . A spin on the previous question ; you said you focused more on the deployment side of things .
How do you interact with developers ?
My previous role at EBay was , when I was part of the EBay.com architecture team , I was senior architect , I tended to interact with developers less because I was working on the meta- architectural issues for the architects .
So I drove a lot of the patterns getting them pre-approved and so on , I had less day by day interaction with the developers .
The new role that I 'm in where we have actually brought the development team together , in that case I talk to the developers daily .
I actually am a big proponent and I try very hard even with my responsibilities to write code , I think architects have to write code for 2 reasons : one - they need to stay in touch with what the real problems are that you are trying to solve , if you do n't understand a problem it 's simple , if you actually spend time understanding the problem , then you gain in appreciation for the complexity of it .
So that 's one reason , the other reason is that I think that in order to be highly effective with the development team you have to have a certain amount of credibility with them , and if I go in and I actually make contributions to the effort that has being done , I deliver code , they see that I know how to do this , this means I am going to be more likely to propose reasonable solutions , and they are going to be more likely to believe me , because they have seen me do the work and I have credibility as a developer as well as an architect .
That 's the way I interact with the current team and I actually like that interaction the best , because I believe design is a spectrum and where architecture ends and where design begins is very fuzzy .
And there 's also a loop back that 's involved because there are going to have problems that run headlong into design that are going to have architecture impacts , there are limitations of what you can accomplish with code .
You 've always got constraints of what can you do with current programming languages , what have you got in terms of the current hardware that will be able to help you and so on .
Architecturally you can make some decisions , but when you run to the walls you can try to fix that up by design changes or you can go back and revise if you are on the right architectural path and whether it is feasible this time , then continue to pursue that .
I prefer that more continuous feedback loops all the way up and down the process chain .
There 's a lot of talk about Agile , and Agile work but it tends to be towards designing code , architecture needs to be somewhat Agile as well , and much more so than it has been .
You have to bend a little bit , if your architecture is waffling all over the place it will make everybody crazy but you have to be open minded to the fact that you 're going to make adjustments in the architecture .
12 . Are you conscious of deployment issues being more important earlier on for the application developers ?
Absolutely .
I think that one of the things that we have done in our team that has been highly successful was that we own all the way from requirements definitions to deployment , everybody is involved in that as part of the same team , we sit on the same floor , we have joined meetings , when we are working on architecture issues around the things that we want to do , there 's a requirements person in the room , there 's an architect in the room , there 's a developer in the room , there 's an operation person in the room .
So we get all the concerns out on the table and get all the constraints and be able to focus on them to make it happen .
You have to think about building this stuff from the very beginning that it has to be run , so you have to involve the entire stack .
And that goes back to my earlier point of envisioning scalability and I cheat .
Scalability to me includes things like manageability , because that 's how well you can scale your operational team , I got called on this , but we can do it however .
But it you think about it as a spider graph , if you leave somebody out of the room that owns a vector on the spider graph , you are going to get wrong .
It really is a fixed sized string if you pull on one of them something else is going to give in order to make it happen .
You do n't have infinite elasticity of where that thing can go .
You have to make the right set of compromise .
13 .
What are the interactions styles you defined ?
What is your services strategy ?
There 's an outward facing services strategy and there 's the inside of EBay services strategy , as I said earlier with 19 distinct platforms , we have a reasonably large integration challenge even if we do n't look at what our external community needs in terms of interfaces .
It 's about trying to define services , trying to find the best way to expose services , make them known through whatever method , if it 's WSDL or something more pragmatic like a Wiki but just to make sure that platforms know what other platforms have to offer and how we let them interact .
The other area that it 's proving to be interesting is that services are interesting but they are asynchronous couplings .
It 's actually a scary proposition at EBay not only because of the availability considerations , but there 's also a matter of scale .
If one of our platforms , like Rent , has something that they have to offer on the EBay site , EBay gets a little nervous about the coupling between their availability , but Rent is actually is scared to death about the EBay transaction volume getting pointed at one of their service integrations .
We are spending a lot more time trying to figure out what 's the appropriate way to do asynchronous integration , what 's the right technology stack for doing that , what are the right interaction styles , because we definitely want to be able to decouple volumes and availability and all these kinds of things , between the platforms , let them continue to grow and Agility is important .
One of the things that has been very important is not just the things you would expect , in terms of coupling , but also not couple those businesses ability to respond to their markets , because each one of them has got very different market pressures that they are trying to respond to .
This became very apparent to me when I was looking at the auction site itself .
We have EBay.com which services 33 countries but we have also got Korea which it 's own auction platform .
We have been very careful with how we help Korea , the architectural " help " idea , but they have a competitor there .
EBay is in our space of online auctions , our competitive pressures are different , we are getting a lot of non auction competition , that we have try to figure how to respond to , but that 's a different problem .
In Korea where they actually have a neck to neck auction competitor , and they are in the lead right now but the slightest stumble , a poor community experience , any of these things , it is close enough that it could flip it and knock them out from being a leader and then they have to try to play catch up , which is not a position you want to be in .
It 's hard enough to stay in front of your competitor it 's even worse to try and catch them .
At an architectural level we 're talking about interaction styles .
But we have to be very cognizant of anything that we do to try and integrate with them and help them does not detract from their ability to be responsive to their business and maintain that position that is a very big challenge for them to hold on to right now .
And then back to my earlier point that architecting at EBay is a challenge , yet another piece of this problem that you bring in when you 're trying to architect solutions and so on , you have to understand what you are facing you are trying to find your way to the proper set of compromises .

Tracking the development of intelligence in both natural and artificial systems , including humans , monkeys , dolphins , chatbots , and neural network simulations alike .
This blog is maintained by Chris Chatham , and usually updated every weekday .
Here 's the feed .
In the previous posts I covered the basics of the lens assembly , how a CMOS Image Sensor works , and briefly on the Bayer Filter .
In this post I plan to cover the basic Image Processing done by the camera phone to produce the image you see on the screen .
In order to understand what happens , we need to first understand how the image is captured by the CMOS Sensor .
In the image on the left is the original scene that we will use as our example .
As it was covered in the previous posts , this scene is imaged on the CMOS Imager and broken apart by the individual pixels that are laid out in the Bayer Grid .
If you remember I had stated that 50 % of the pixels are green in the Bayer Filter and there is a reason for this ; the human eye is most senstive to green than from all other colors , because of that more information is recorded in the green channel .
With that information in mind you can see in the figure to the right how the CMOS Imager records the original scene .
As you can see the recorded image is mostly green .
You are probably wondering how a mostly green picture ends up looking normal on my screen ?
Well that is a good question and the answer is a process called Demosaicing .
So what is demosaicing ?
The short answer , it is an algorithm that interpolates the complete picture from the partial raw data recorded by the CMOS Image Sensor .
Now , for many this may not make sense , so lets go back to the original Bayer Grid that is show on the left here .
Looking at the grid , lets break this grid up into 2x2 grids composed of 1 Red , 1 Blue and 2 Green pixels , similar to the figure to the right .
We now need to assume that each of individual grids describes one full color cavity and the camera phone now has half the image in the vertical and horizontal direction .
So how do we get th e remainder of the full image , simple we now need to realize that if we create grids that overlap as shown in the figure on the left we can now be able to generate the information for the full image .
Now an issue I am sure many of you are wondering how do we deal with the pixels at the edge of the image , since we do n't have enough info at those points for the full color cavity ?
Well basically they are cropped out of the image since most of our camera phones have lots of pixels already and we can afford to do that .
I have gone over a very basic demosaicing technique , to give you a better idea of what is going on .
In reality there are numerous techniques and many are proprietary to each camera phone vendor .
Demosaicing Artifacts
Now there are issues related to Demosaicing , one of them is in relation to fine details in the image .
If you look at the image above you can notice many fine details when this image is captured by a camera phone and then demosaiced we notice something has changed and you can see that in the image below .
If you notice each of the sections of the original image has developed a unique artifacts , this artifacts are referred to as moire patterns .
Some typical charateristics of moire are repeating patterns , color artifacts or pixels arranges in an unrealistic maze - like patterns , which can be seen in the image above .
This typically happens when we have reached the resolution limit of the sensor and as a result the demosaicing algorithm creates these moire patterns .
So now that wraps the basic image processing that happens on your camera phone in order to take a picture .
I hope most of you guys enjoyed these past 3 posts on how a camera phone works , now I am sure you are wondering what is coming next .
In the next few days I will begin posting up the techniques I use to analyze the performance of various camera phones .
How about the compilation of the rare Russian cars that even common Russian people that live in Russia had probably never seen before ?
Hand picked examples of Russian automobile industry are presented in this article for your viewing pleasure .
AZLK factory ( now is closed ) was indeed the factory of “ might - have - been ” Soviet auto - dreams .
Judge by yourself :
Moskvich 408 Tourist ( 1964 ) with the top speed of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) could be a real cabriolet for the middle class , but at that time the country leaders decided that such an automobile would be too luxurious for a Soviet proletariat .
The idea of this Moskvich - cabriolet was carried out by AZLK only in producing pedal vehicles for kids .
Click to read the full article about Soviet pedal vehicles for kids on Englishrussia .
AZLK 2139 Arbat ( prototype of the 1987 ) had to be a revolutionary looking car of the Soviet ( Russian ) automobile industry of the 90s .
But the Soviet country leaders with their dislike for the idea of the accessible luxurious cars for the middle class and the collapse of the Soviet Union by itself made this automobile just a part of the exhibition in AZLK museum in Moscow .
The model of Moskvich 2141 KR ( prototype of the 1988 for rally races ) with the engine of 175 hp and the top speed of about 125 mph ( 200 km / h ) could be a beginning of a short - run production of AZLK sports - cars , but the idea also was n’t realized .
The prototype now stands in Autoreview museum ( Moscow ) .
While AZLK was making attempts to introduce some luxury into the Soviet automobile industry , two other car factories , Gorkovsky ( GAZ ) and Volzhsky ( VAZ ) , were trying to start their own amphibian cars production :
VAZ 2122 Reka ( River ) Amphibian was developed in the late 70s / early 80s , by the request of the military department .
This unique Soviet jeep was able to move on water at the speed of 5 mph ( 9 km / h ) .
But after successfully passed the tests the project was closed for some unknown reason .
UAZ 3907 Jaguar of Gorkovksy car factory ( GAZ ) had shared the fate oh his VAZ amphibian brother .
This car , developed in the late 70s , was able to move on water by means of two propeller screws , and could carry up to seven persons in full equipment .
The vehicle showed wonderful rolling characteristics during various tests at extreme temperatures ( from - 116 F ( - 47C ) up to 113 F ( +45C ) ) .
The project was closed because of inflation caused by the collapse of the USSR .
UAZ 3907 Jaguar was not the only attempt of GAZ factory to produce non-typical off - road vehicle .
In the middle 70-s was developed the experimental modification of Volga – GAZ - 24 -95 .
Click to read the full article about Volga Randrover on Englishrussia .
Volzhsky car factory ( VAZ ) also made attempts to produce it ’s own sports car but with a help of it ’s foreign partners .
Here are some examples :
In 1978 in Vilnius ( Lithuania ) a firm called VFTS constructed modification of Lada called “ Lada Samara Eva ( Eve ) ” , based on the Lada 2108 model .
This was a rear wheel drive sports car with the engine of 300 hp .
Another modification of Lada , Lada Samara T3 , was actually none - Soviet sports car with the components of Porsche , subsidized by the French Lada exporter called Poch and constructed by Oreka company .
It successfully participated in various European rally championships in 1990 - 1991 , such as “ Paris - Dakar ” and “ Tunisia ” .
And the story of the Soviet sports cars has started in the early 30s and it is closely related with ZIL ( Lihachiov car factory ) , former ZIS ( Stalin car factory ) .
But the point is that during that time the Soviet leaders considered that the motoring should only serve to the country and the developments of ZIL were nothing more than prototypes used for testing various components designed for governmental automobiles .
Most of them only looked as sports cars …
For example , ZIS 101A Sport ( 1939 ) was too heavy for its engine and could hardly gain speed of 100 mph ( 160 km /h ) , but its tires were not suitable for such high speeds .
The beginning of the World War 2 has put an end to this project .
The most ( and probably the only ) successful sports car of Lihachiov factory was the legendary ZIL 112 - S ( 1961 ) with the engine of 240 hp , an original transmission , a top speed of 170 mph ( 270 km /h ) and an exterior that resembled in some way Italian Ferrari Testarossa of that time .
During the construction of ZIL 112 - S there were used elements of GAZ - 21 Volga of Gorkovsky car factory .
USSR was the communist state , so there were n’t any private enterprises .
All the factories were owned by the Government and collaboration between them was a customary practice , not only in case of ZIL 112 -S .
As it has appeared , the first model of KAMAZ ( Kamsky car factory ) was also developed on ZIL factory in the late 70s ( ZIL - 175 ) .
One can see it on the picture below .
It is necessary to notice , that the later KAMAZ models have become the winners of Paris - Dakar European race .

And this ( on the left ) is the prototype model of M3MA 444 Moskvich of AZLK ( 1957 ) that later has become ZAZ - 965 or Zaporozhets ( on the right ) of Zaporozhsky car factory ( 1960 ) .
If to say more about the prototypes and the experimental models , many of them looked quite different in comparison with the final models .
For example here is the prototype of the Soivet and Russian off - road car Lada Niva E2121 Crocodile and the original later serial model Lada Niva 2121 ( 1979 ) .
And this is the prototype of ZAZ 966 ( Zaporozhets ) with the forward wheel drive and the hood that resembles Lada 2101 ( VAZ ) .
This model has not been put on production .
The final ZAZ 966 had the rear wheel drive and different design .

I wrote last week of an Army contracting officer in Kuwait , who , with the collusion of his wife and sister , allegedly took almost $ 10 million in bribes from corrupt contractors .
It was said to be the largest case of fraud yet uncovered during the Iraq reconstruction .
Well , as reported in this morning ’s New York Times , it may wind up being a drop in the bucket .
Investigators from the Army Criminal Investigation Command , the Justice Department , and the FBI have uncovered a network of criminality much larger than anything previously conceived .
It involves “ the purchase and delivery of weapons , supplies , and other material to Iraqi and American forces ” and amounts to “ the largest ring of fraud and kickbacks uncovered in the conflict there . ”
Among those under investigation is Lt. Col. Levonda Joey Selph , a contracting officer who reported directly to General David Petraeus , the current commander of U.S. forces in Iraq .
Now , it comes as no surprise that reconstruction operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have suffered from incompetence , waste , and fraud .
What does surprise , though , is the scale of wrongdoing slowly emerging from news reports .
From the Times :
The investigation into contracts for matériel to Iraqi soldiers and police officers is part of an even larger series of criminal cases .
As of Aug. 23 , there were a total of 73 criminal investigations related to contract fraud in Iraq , Kuwait and Afghanistan , Col. Dan Baggio , an Army spokesman said Monday .
Twenty civilians and military personnel have been charged in federal court as a result of the inquiries , he said .
The inquiries involve contracts valued at more than $ 5 billion , and Colonel Baggio said the charges so far involve more than $ 15 million in bribes …
Investigations span the gamut from low - level officials submitting false claims for amounts less than $ 2,500 to more serious cases involving , conspiracy , bribery , product substitution and bid-rigging or double - billing involving large dollar amounts or more senior contracting officials , Army criminal investigators said .
The investigations involve contractors , government employees , local nationals and American military personnel .
If keeping track of all this corruption is confusing , have no fear .
Here ’s an incomplete timeline of events , cobbled together from the Times article :
May 2006 : Senator John W. Warner , Republican of Virginia and then chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , requests a federal oversight committee to look into reports of missing weapons and equipment purchased for use by Iraqi security forces .
October 2006 : The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction issues a report , citing discrepancies in American military records with regard to the location of weapons issued to Iraqi security forces .
July 2007 : The GAO finds even larger problems , noting that the American military “ cannot fully account for about 110,000 AK - 47 rifles , 90,000 pistols , 80 items of body armor , and 115,000 helmets reported as issued to Iraqi security forces as of Sept. 22 , 2005 . ” August 2007 : Reports emerge that federal investigators believe the loss of these weapons may be the result of widespread corruption within the military contracting system .
In the department of better late than never , the Pentagon is taking action .
Its Inspector General , Claude M. Kicklighter , will lead a team of 18 investigators to Iraq early next month to examine contracting practices .
Army Secretary Pete Geren is also expected to announce later this week the creation of a special panel to identify problems in the military contracting process .

[ This article was originally published in the Review of Austrian Economics . ]
Public choice can be defined as the application of economic theory and methodology to the study of politics and political institutions , broadly defined .
Neoclassical price theory has been one of the principal tools of the public - choice theorist , having been applied to address such questions as why people vote , why bureaucrats bungle , the effects of deficit finance on government spending , and myriad other questions regarding the operations and activities of governments .
There has indeed been a public - choice " revolution " in economics .
But neoclassical price theory has its limitations , many of which have been investigated by Austrian economists .
These limitations have implications for the study of public choice .
Namely , if neoclassical price theory is itself flawed , then perhaps its applications to the study of political decision - making have produced uncertain results .
In this article , I shall explore two strands of Austrian economics — theories of competition and of entrepreneurship — and their implications for public - choice theory .
I do not claim to provide an exhaustive examination of public - choice theory from an Austrian perspective , but only to offer a few insights .
The first section notes some limitations of applying the neoclassical competitive model to the study of political decision - making .
The next discusses the implications of placing more emphasis on the role of political entrepreneurship in the study of public choice .
The final section contains a summary and conclusions .
One area in which the neoclassical competitive model has been applied by public - choice theorists is the economics of local public finance .
There exists a large volume of mostly empirical research purporting that when metropolitan areas are composed of larger numbers of governments , competition among governments for population and , consequently , tax base induces them to be more cost - conscious , thereby putting downward pressures on government spending ( DiLorenzo , 1981a , 1981b , 1982 , 1983 ) .
Thus , on efficiency grounds , public - choice economists often take the position that more governments within a metropolitan area are preferred to fewer .
This is a direct application of the neoclassical competitive model , which holds that more firms in an industry leads to stronger competitive forces .
It is also derived from the related structure - conduct - performance ( SCP ) paradigm of industrial organization theory .
Industrial Organization and Public Choice
The SCP paradigm asserts that a more concentrated market structure is likely to be more monopolist because , in such a setting , the cost of collusion is lower .
But this assumption has been called into question by research that constitutes yet another revolution in economic theory — a revolution in the field of industrial organization ( Goldschmidt , Mann , and Weston , 1974 ; Brozen , 1982 ) .
One of the significant features of the " revolution " in the field of industrial organization is that many researchers have taken a more dy - namic view of the market as a process .
Thus , they have moved closer to the Austrian view of the nature of competition .
By taking a more dynamic view of how industries evolve over time , economists have learned ( or relearned , according to DiLorenzo and High , forthcoming ) that an important reason why industries become concentrated is the superior efficiency of one or a few firms .
" Dominant " firms can only remain that way by continuing to offer competitive products at favorable prices , in the absence of government - imposed entry barriers .
Substitutes and potential entry have placed effective limits on monopoly pricing by firms in concentrated industries ( Brozen , 1982 ) .
Thus , the traditional antitrust prescription of divestiture to avoid monopolization is now widely believed to be sometimes harmful .
Focusing attention on the reasons why industries become concentrated has advanced our knowledge over the days when it was simply assumed that market concentration meant monopolization and " market power . "
This shift in research emphasis is welcomed by many Austrians , who for decades have criticized the neoclassical competitive model as almost devoid of behavioral content , given its emphasis on static equilibrium conditions rather than the process of competition .
Competition is by its nature a dynamic process whose essential characteristics are assumed away by the assumptions underlying the static analysis… .
Advertising , [ price ] undercutting , and improving … the goods or services produced are all excluded by definition — " perfect " competition means indeed the absence of all competitive activities .
( Hayek , 1948 , p. 96 )
By viewing competition as a static equilibrium condition rather than as a dynamic , rivalrous process , economists are prone to condemn competitive activities as monopolistic .
These developments in the economics of industrial organization are relevant to the study of public choice .
If the neoclassical competitive model — and its derivative , the structure - conduct - performance ( SCP ) paradigm — are themselves flawed , perhaps the model 's applications to the study of the local government " industry " are also subject to question .
I contend that by relying on static , market structure models of the local government " industry , " public - choice economists have often drawn false conclusions .
However , by relying on static models , they have not erred in the same direction as the structuralist industrial organization economists .
Rather than condemning as monopolist many practices that are inherently competitive , they have done the opposite .
By focusing on government structure at a point in time rather than on the dynamic , historical process by which the institutional structure of government evolves , they have sometimes praised as " competitive " government actions that are inherently monopolistic .
Consider , for example , how public - choice economists often interpret US Census Bureau data on local government structure .
Among public - choice economists who have studied local government , it is generally agreed that the greater the number of government units in a metropolitan area ( the more " fragmented " the governmental structure ) , the better .
Fragmentation creates interjurisdictional competition , which supposedly provides incentives for lowering the costs of service provision .
This purportedly lowers expenditures and taxes and also results in higher - quality government services .
These conclusions are usually drawn from cross-section data on government expenditure , regressed against several " determinants " of public expenditures , with some sort of proxy for interjurisdictional competition , i.e. , number of government units in a metropolitan area .
More often than not , the independent variable for government structure reveals that more fragmented metropolitan areas have lower levels of government expenditure , ceteris paribus .
These empirical studies are similar to the early empirical work in industrial organization that found a positive correlation between market concentration and profitability .
More concentrated metropolitan governments are thought to lead to higher levels of political " profits " in the form of higher spending than would otherwise occur .
But just as taking a more dynamic or historical view of industrial market structure can yield different interpretations of the causes of market concentration , it can also change one 's view of the meaning of a more or less concentrated structure of local government .
Consider the example of off - budget government spending at the state and local levels ( Bennett and DiLorenzo , 1983 ) .
Off - Budget Spending and the Government Process
Historically , tax revolts and fiscal constraints in the form of statutory or constitutional restrictions on taxing , spending , or borrowing at the state and local levels of government have been met by politicians not by catering to " the will of the people , " but , rather , by subverting that will by creating off - budget enterprises ( OBEs ) that permit them to preach fiscal conservatism by continuing to practice fiscal profligacy .
The " solution " politicians have for more than a century applied to the " problem " of taxpayer demands for tax or expenditure restraint is disarmingly simple : Separate corporate entities are created by state and local governments , which could issue bonds that are not subject to the legal restrictions on public debt or even to voter approval .
These entities are called a variety of names , including districts , boards , authorities , agencies , commissions , corporations , and trusts .
Regardless of their title , an essential feature of all such organizations is that their financial activities do not appear in the budget of the government unit that created them .
One distinguishing feature of OBEs is that their operations , at least in theory , are not financed from taxes , but from revenues generated by their activities .
Because the taxpayer is not deemed to be liable for the financial obligations of OBEs , voter approval is not required for the debt issued by such organizations and , more importantly , debt restrictions do not apply .
However , the idea that off - budget finance should not require voter approval because the projects financed are self - supporting is a myth , for billions of taxpayer dollars are used to subsidize OBE activity ( Bennett and DiLorenzo , 1983 ) .
The array of activities undertaken by OBEs is quite large and includes the financing of school buildings , airports , parking lots , recreation centers , courthouses , subways , bridges , tunnels , highways , parks , lakes , sewer systems , sports arenas , electric utilities , racetracks , outer - space programs ( in California ) , and housing , to name a few examples .
In short , any activities that are undertaken on budget by state and local governments ( or by private enterprises , for that matter ) are also undertaken by OBEs in every state .
Even if debt restrictions did not exist , politicians would benefit from off - budget activities .
The public sector is constrained by numerous regulations designed to protect the public interest .
Virtually none of these applies to any OBE .
For example , civil service regulations do not apply , so it is easier for politicians to create patronage jobs off - budget ; there are no requirements for competitive bidding procedures on contracts , so campaign contributions can be obtained and loyal supporters can be rewarded ; the members of the boards of directors of every OBE are political appointees who are not elected or responsible to voters , so that the will of politicians cannot easily be frustrated by a recalcitrant bureaucracy .
OBEs are given wide powers by law .
They are granted monopoly franchises , may have powers of eminent domain , can override zoning ordinances , are exempt from regulations and paperwork that impose heavy costs on private enterprises , have no legal restrictions on collective bargaining agreements , and are often specifically exempted from antitrust laws regarding price fixing .
Unfortunately , it is impossible to obtain accurate data on the number of OBEs that exist or on their activities .
Most states do not keep statistics on their numbers .
One thing is known with certainty , however :
There are thousands of OBEs throughout the nation , including more than 2,500 in Pennsylvania alone as of 1977 ( Schlosser , 1977 ) .
One implication of this research for public - choice theory is that the structure of the local government industry at any one point in time does not necessarily reveal how " competitive " government is .
Bureau of the Census data on the number of government units in metropolitan areas includes many OBEs , designating them as special districts , public corporations , statutory authorities , and so on .
But an increase in the number of such entities often results in a government that is increasingly detached from the consent of the governed , is not subject to direct voter approval at the ballot box , and grants itself extraordinary powers — even by government standards — of eminent domain , zoning authority , and immunity from civil service , collective bargaining , antitrust , and other laws that others in society must comply with .
A strong argument can be made that avoiding taxpayer demands for fiscal restraint is the whole purpose of off - budget spending , which renders government more monopolist .
To designate these developments as " competitive " or " efficient " is misleading , at best .
But this is precisely the problem public - choice economists experience when applying the neoclassical competitive model to the study of local government ( see , for example , Blewitt , 1984 ) .
Efficiency and the Structure of Local Government
Competitive markets are praised by neoclassical economists because , among other reasons , they promote allocative efficiency .
Austrian economists , however , have little use for such notions because of their belief that all costs and benefits are subjective .
To state that a certain allocation of resources is allocatively efficient and maximizes " social welfare " is to assume that benefits and costs are objective and measurable by some outside observer / social engineer .
Moreover , to claim that one allocation of resources is superior to another on neoclassical efficiency grounds requires one to make interpersonal utility comparisons , a sheer impossibility .
For instance , if an industry is judged to be producing less than the competitive level , a common policy prescription to promote efficiency is to somehow induce the firm (s ) to increase their production ( through divestiture , for instance ) .
This may harm the producers since it forces them to do something they did not voluntarily choose to do , but it is said to be efficient because the utility gain to some other group in society — usually called consumers — is said to outweigh the utility loss to the producers .
Policy recommendations based on such efficiency norms often attenuate the rights of political minorities such as " monopolist " producers on the grounds that their utility loss is outweighed by the utility gains of others .
This arbitrarily assumes that the property rights of the former group are unimportant .
In short , what passes for science is loaded with normative judgments .
There is an alternative ( and equally normative ) definition of " efficient " institutions that has its roots in Adam Smith 's Wealth of Nations and embraces the notion of individualist property rights norms :
Those institutions are efficient that facilitate mutually advantageous , voluntary exchange ( Buchanan , 1964 ) .
From this perspective , a " better " allocation of resources can only be determined by people themselves , not by professional maximizers of social welfare functions .
The standard of evaluation is ultimately consent among individuals .
Also , according to this perspective , the proliferation of the number of local governments cannot be said to be " efficient , " since the growth of government embodies a further reallocation of resources from the private to the public sector .
The private sector is the exclusive domain of mutually advantageous exchange .
Outside of its role of enforcing and protecting private property rights , all government resource allocation is necessarily coercive in the absence of direct democracy and voting rules mandating unanimous consent .
The proliferation of local government units , on - or off - budget , represents an expansion of the domain of rent - seeking behavior , which is necessarily coercive , at the expense of a contracted private sector and of the domain of voluntary exchange .
Public - choice economists typically criticize a consolidated local government structure as monopolist compared to the alternative of a larger number of jurisdictions within a metropolitan area .
In many instances , this criticism is probably well grounded .
One centralized school district , for instance , is likely to be even more monopolist than if there were several to choose from by " voting with your feet . "
As George Orwell might have said , all governments are monopolist , only some are more monopolist than others .
However , it is not clear that the relevant alternative to a fragmented government structure within a metropolitan area is a more centralized , monopolist government .
Another alternative is a return to private - sector provision of the private goods now supplied by local governments : education , libraries , hospitals , airport operation , fire protection , parking lot operation , water supply , police protection , sewerage treatment , parks and recreation , operation of liquor stores , mass transportation , and myriad other activities .
One thing all these activities have in common is that no strong case can be made that any of them is a public good .
They are all divisible in consumption and exclusion is not costly .
Moreover , they are all things that are supplied throughout the country by private businesses as well as by governments , leading one to question the existence of any economic rationale for government provision .
Governments usually grant themselves distinct advantages whenever direct competition with the private sector is permitted ( which it often is not ) by not having to pay taxes or comply with costly regulations imposed on private enterprises .
Thus , these are often money - making operations for local governments that have taken over services that would have alternatively been provided by private businesses .
Government imperialism is a more likely explanation than market failure for why these activities are carried out by hundreds of local government jurisdictions .
Governments are redirecting resources from the private to the public sector as private firms are either banned by law from competing with government monopolies or are driven out of business because of the special advantages that government service providers have .
Viewed in this way , it appears that the public - choice characterization of the " efficient " organization of local government is grossly misleading .
Public Choice and Political Entrepreneurs
Austrian economists often claim that neoclassical economics ignores many important economic phenomena by not sufficiently emphasizing the role of entrepreneurship in the economic organization .
Ludwig von Mises broadly defined entrepreneurship to encompass capitalists , workers , consumers , and others : " Economics , in speaking of entrepreneurs , has in view not men , but a definite function " ( 1966 , p. 246 ) .
The function of the entrepreneur is to react to ( and create ) change in the market .
The efficiency of markets does not depend upon the equality of price to marginal costs , the familiar equilibrium condition of neoclassical price theory , but , rather , " it depends on the degree of success with which market forces can be relied upon to generate spontaneous corrections … at times of disequilibrium " ( Kirzner , 1974 , p. 6 ) .
Entrepreneurship is the engine of economic growth and wealth creation in capitalist economies , for according to Robert Tollison :
When competition is viewed as a dynamic , value - creating , evolutionary process , the role of economic rents in stimulating entrepreneurial decisions and in prompting an efficient allocation of resources is crucial … .
[ P ] rofit seeking in a competitive market order is a normal feature of economic life .
The returns of resource owners will be driven to normal levels … by competitive profit seeking as some resource owners earn positive rents which promote entry and others earn negative rents which cause exit .
Profit seeking and economic rents are inherently related to the efficiency of the competitive market process .
Such activities drive the competitive price system and create value ( e.g. , new products ) in the economy .
( 1982 , p. 577 )
But neoclassical economics does not view competition as a " dynamic , value - creating , evolutionary process . "
Rather , it is a static equilibrium condition .
And in equilibrium , there is no place for the function of entrepreneurship , since in equilibrium , there are no changes in the given data of endowments , technologies , or preferences .
By downplaying or ignoring the role of entrepreneurship and of competition as a dynamic , rivalrous process , neo-classical economics has probably underestimated the wealth - creating and welfare - enhancing capabilities of capitalism .
Similarly , by applying the static , neoclassical model to the study of political " markets , " public - choice theorists have probably downplayed or ignored the role of political entrepreneurship .
But this has not led them to ignore the role of entrepreneurship in creating wealth and facilitating exchange , as with the study of private markets .
The essence of political entrepreneurship is to destroy wealth through negative - sum rent - seeking behavior .
Thus , adherence to the static , neoclassical model is likely to lead one to understate the beneficial economic effects of private markets while , when applied to the study of public choice , understating the destructive effects of politics .
In much of public - choice theory , interest groups are viewed as entities that coalesce to express a demand for wealth transfers .
In seeking political profit , politicians respond by supplying the transfers through legislation and regulation .
Politicians are accordingly labeled " brokers " of legislation ( Tollison and McCormick , 1981 ) .
Thus , just as a perfectly competitive , profit - maximizing firm would cater to consumer demands , politicians passively respond to the wishes of interest groups .
But the price theory analogy is not entirely accurate , for in a world of uncertainty , producers are constantly searching for and creating profit opportunities by advertising , offering new or different products , and other activities aimed at stimulating the demand for their goods or services .
They do not merely respond to changing consumer demands .
Similarly , political entrepreneurs do not just passively respond to interest - group pressures ; they also try to stimulate the demand for their " services , " i.e. , the provision of wealth transfers ( Mitchell , 1984 ) .
Although it has been relatively neglected in the public - choice literature , Richard Wagner ( 1966 ) described the importance of political entrepreneurship in a hypothetical example where interest groups are outlawed .
Consider farm interests after pressure groups are outlawed .
It clearly seems contrary to intuition and common sense to claim that farmers would no longer have [ political ] activities undertaken to increase their real incomes .
For a reconciliation we must turn to the political entrepreneur and observe the impact of the outlawing of lobbying upon his profit opportunities .
If a political profit existed before the institutional change [ i.e. , outlawing lobbying ] , what reason exists for the belief that such profit will not exist after the change ?
Clearly , for a reduction in the political profit from farm votes , either voting or organizational rules must be changed .
Since the outlawing of pressure groups is unrelated to either of these two features , the profit must still exist after pressure groups are outlawed .
Therefore , some political entrepreneur would carry their cause to congress .
( p. 165 )
Wagner further stated that various institutional arrangements often emerge to promote individual interests when free - rider problems prevent the formation of effective interest groups .
For instance , one role of government bureaucracies is to serve the wishes of political entrepreneurs with whom they share a common objective : an expansion of the agency 's activity ( and budget ) .
Bureaucracies have strong incentives to promote and stimulate a perceived need for their activities — every bureaucracy is a vigorous lobbyist .
Peter Woll ( 1977 ) noted the importance of bureaucratic lobbying in his book , American Bureaucracy :
The ability of administrative agencies to marshal support in favor of particular programs is often severely tested , and as a result the agencies have frequently created public relations departments on a permanent basis to engineer consent for their legislative proposals .
It has been estimated that the executive branch spends close to half a billion dollars [ in 1971 ] a year on public relations and public information programs … .
[ A ] gencies are expending huge amounts of funds , time , and effort on indirect and direct lobbying activities .
( p. 194 )
As recent examples of bureaucratic lobbying expenditures , the US Department of Agriculture in 1984 officially employed 144 full - time public affairs persons with a budget of $ 6.5 million .
The entire department , including sub-agencies , employs 704 people involved in public affairs ( Palmer , 1985 ) .
The Department of Education had 21 public affairs professionals and a $ 1.5 million budget ; and the Pentagon listed 1,066 full - time public relations employees .
Similar programs are sure to be found in other agencies as well .
The effect of political advertising is likely to be public acquiescence in the continued growth of the government wealth - transfer process .
Unlike private advertising , political advertising does not foster competition and lower prices by facilitating comparison shopping , for no comparisons are permitted .
Governments usually grant themselves statutory monopolies in the goods and services they provide .
Nor are there strong constraints on false advertising by government because of the absence of competitive pressures .
Few private businesses , for instance , would risk criticizing false advertising by government enterprises for fear of regulatory retribution by the government authorities .
Nor can one expect government regulatory agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission to crack down on fraudulent claims made by government itself .
Thus :
Politicians cannot be held liable for their promises .
If a hot dog manufacturer 's all - meat product turns out to be 30 percent chicken and bread crumbs , he will most likely encounter difficulty with the government , even if consumers buy the product .
But when the government 's comparable product turns out to be 60 percent baloney , no regulatory agency will take action .
( Wagner , 1976 , p. 81 )
Moreover , the principal function of political advertising " would seem to be to promote acquiescence about the prevailing public policies .
The purpose of public advertising would be to reassure citizens that the fact that their public goods are composed of 60 percent baloney indicates good performance " ( Wagner , 1976 , p. 97 ) .
In this way , political entrepreneurship in the form of public advertising facilitates the process of rent seeking .
Another example of political entrepreneurship is tax - funded politics ( Bennett and DiLorenzo , 1985 ) .
Hundreds of millions of dollars per year are doled out by the federal government to special interest groups including Ralph Nader - type consumer groups , environmentalists , welfare rights lobbyists , civil rights organizations , labor unions , senior citizens organizations , and various conservative political activists , to name a few examples .
The funds are obtained through grants and contracts ostensibly for helping consumers , the unemployed , the elderly , minorities , the environment , and so on , but then are diverted ( illegally ) for partisan politics .
In these instances , Congress is directly stimulating the perceived demand for its " services " by giving taxpayers ' money to special interests to lobby , campaign , register voters , publish books ( as well as op - eds and political training manuals ) , hold media events , and conduct other forms of partisan politics .
Politicians use tax - funded politics to fabricate demands for legislation and government activity to stimulate the demand for their services .
Interest groups that receive government funding can be more blatant in their political activities than government bureaucracies can since it is illegal for government employees to engage in on - the - job political activity .
And , as Gordon Tullock ( 1983 ) pointed out , " interest groups normally have an interest in diminishing the information of the average voter .
If they can sell him some false tale which supports their particular effort … it pays .
They … produce misinformation " ( p. 71 ) .
In sum , focusing on the role of political entrepreneurship is likely to improve one 's understanding of the government process .
Demand - side models of the political process ( such as the median voter model ) can be misleading if they fail to incorporate the fact that political entrepreneurs are experts at fabricating false crises to convince the public to acquiesce in their policy proposals .
Voters are rationally ignorant , and much of the information about politics they do receive is propaganda issued by self - serving politicians , interest groups , and bureaucracies .
It does not pay to be as well informed about politics as about one 's own personal affairs , which permits political entrepreneurs to manufacture a false " will of the people . "
Joseph Schumpeter ( 1942 ) recognized this more than four decades ago :
Human nature in politics being what it is , [ politicians ] are able to fashion and , within very wide limits , even to create the will of the people .
What we are confronted with in the analysis of political processes is largely not a genuine but a manufactured will .
…
[ T ]he will of the people is the product and not the motive power of the political process .
( p. 263 )
Even though private and political entrepreneurship both serve to transmit information , they produce fundamentally different results .
The nature of market activity is to enhance people 's propensity to truck , barter , and exchange — generally a positive - sum game — and entrepreneurship facilitates this process .
By contrast , the nature of most government activity , including political entrepreneurship , is to promote wealth transfers , which is at best a zero - sum game .
Mancur Olson ( 1982 ) provides evidence that such rent seeking is , in fact , a negative - sum game and a major cause of economic stagnation .
Conclusions
Austrian economics and public choice are two of the most exciting areas of economic research .
With its emphasis on competition as a dynamic , rivalrous process and the role of entrepreneurship , Austrian economics clarifies how markets work .
Public - choice theory has been absolutely revolutionary in focusing attention on how the tools of economics can be employed to better understand how governments work .
This article is , if anything , a plea to consider the two research programs as complementary .
Economic reasoning can and will be applied to advance our understanding of the political process , but one need not adopt the entire neoclassical economic framework to do so .
The two strands of Austrian economics discussed here — theories of competition and of entrepreneurship — offer some insights into the government process that neoclassical economics ignores , at best , and possibly even misinterprets .
One implication of this is that the type of public - choice research conducted might take on a different focus .
Specifically , it would be a wise investment of intellectual resources to conduct more historical studies of the evolution of political institutions from a public - choice perspective .
Public choice is often a study of comparative institutions , but economic history is one research approach which has , unfortunately , been relatively neglected by public - choice theorists .
There is much to learn from economic and political history from a public - choice perspective that just cannot be captured by regression equations of the " determinants " of government spending , taxing , and borrowing .
Not only can a careful consideration of the usefulness of Austrian economics to the study of public choice expand our knowledge of government institutions ; it can also prevent us from making mistakes .
I have claimed elsewhere ( DiLorenzo , 1984 ) that the economics of rent seeking has become confused .
One reason for this is the failure to properly distinguish between rent seeking and profit seeking by not viewing real - world competition as a dynamic , rivalrous process .
Consequently , some authors have condemned as " wasteful rent seeking " many activities ( e.g. , competitive advertising , product innovation , research and development , the market for corporate control ) that are an essential part of a dynamic , competitive market .
This is a step backward in the public - choice revolution , something that might have been avoided by being aware of some of the limitations of the neoclassical competitive model and its applications to public choice .

Were there such a category , Somalia would hold a place in Guinness World Records as the country with the longest absence of a functioning central government .
When the Somalis dismantled their government in 1991 and returned to their precolonial political status , the expectation was that chaos would result — and that , of course , would be the politically correct thing to expect .
Imagine if it were otherwise .
Imagine any part of the globe not being dominated by a central government and the people there surviving , even prospering .
If such were to happen and the idea spread to other parts of Africa or other parts of the world , the mystique of the necessity of the state might be irreparably damaged , and many politicians and bureaucrats might find themselves walking about looking for work .
If the expectation was that Somalia would plunge into an abyss of chaos , what is the reality ?
A number of recent studies address this question , including one by economist Peter Leeson drawing on statistical data from the United Nations Development Project , World Bank , CIA , and World Health Organization .
Comparing the last five years under the central government ( 1985 –1990 ) with the most recent five years of anarchy ( 2000 –2005 ) , Leeson finds these welfare changes :
Life expectancy increased from 46 to 48.5 years .
This is a poor expectancy as compared with developed countries .
But in any measurement of welfare , what is important to observe is not where a population stands at a given time , but what is the trend .
Is the trend positive , or is it the reverse ?
Number of one - year - olds fully immunized against measles rose from 30 to 40 percent .
Number of physicians per 100,000 population rose from 3.4 to 4 .
Number of infants with low birth weight fell from 16 per thousand to 0.3 — almost none .
Infant mortality per 1,000 births fell from 152 to 114.9 .
Maternal mortality per 100,000 births fell from 1,600 to 1,100 .
Percent of population with access to sanitation rose from 18 to 26 .
Percent of population with access to at least one health facility rose from 28 to 54.8 .
Percent of population in extreme poverty ( i.e. , less than $ 1 per day ) fell from 60 to 43.2 .
Radios per thousand population rose from 4 to 98.5 .
Telephones per thousand population rose from 1.9 to 14.9 .
TVs per 1,000 population rose from 1.2 to 3.7 .
Fatalities due to measles fell from 8,000 to 5,600 .
Another even more comprehensive study published last year by Benjamin Powell of the Independent Institute , concludes : " We find that Somalia 's living standards have improved generally … not just in absolute terms , but also relative to other African countries since the collapse of the Somali central government . "
Somalia 's pastoral economy is now stronger than that of either neighboring Kenya or Ethiopia .
It is the largest exporter of livestock of any East African country .
Telecommunications have burgeoned in Somalia ; a call from a mobile phone is cheaper in Somalia than anywhere else in Africa .
A small number of international investors are finding that the level of security of property and contract in Somalia warrants doing business there .
Among these companies are Dole , BBC , the courier DHL , British Airways , General Motors , and Coca Cola , which recently opened a large bottling plant in Mogadishu .
A 5 - star Ambassador Hotel is operating in Hargeisa , and three new universities are fully functional : Amoud University ( 1997 ) in Borama , and Mogadishu University ( 1997 ) , and University of Benadir ( 2002 ) in Mogadishu .
The Call to " Establish Democracy "
All of this is terribly politically incorrect for the reason I suggested .
Consequently , the United Nations has by now spent well over two billion dollars attempting to re-establish a central government in Somalia .
But here is the irony : it is the presence of the United Nations that has caused virtually all of the turbulence we have seen in Somalia .
Let me explain why this is the case .
Like most of precolonial Africa , Somalia is traditionally a stateless society .
When the colonial powers withdrew , in order to better serve their purposes , they hastily trained local people and set up European - style governments in their place .
These were supposed to be democratic .
But they soon devolved into brutal dictatorships .
Democracy is unworkable in Africa for several reasons .
The first thing that voting does is to divide a population into two groups — a group that rules and a group that is ruled .
This is completely at variance with Somali tradition .
Second , if democracy is to work , it depends in theory , at least , upon a populace that will vote on issues .
But in a kinship society such as Somalia , voting takes place not on the merit of issues but along group lines ; one votes according to one 's clan affiliation .
Since the ethic of kinship requires loyalty to one 's fellow clansmen , the winners use the power of government to benefit their own members , which means exploitation of the members of other clans .
Consequently when there exists a governmental apparatus with its awesome powers of taxation and police and judicial monopoly , the interests of the clans conflict .
Some clan will control that apparatus .
To avoid being exploited by other clans , each must attempt to be that controlling clan .
The turmoil in Somalia consists in the clans maneuvering to position themselves to control the government whenever it might come into being , and this has been exacerbated by the governments of the world , especially the United States , keeping alive the expectation that a government will soon be established and supplying arms to whoever seems at present most likely to be able to " bring democracy " to Somalia .
The " warlord " phenomenon refers to clan and independent militias , often including leftovers of the former central government , who promise to establish a government under the control of their own clan .
They often operate outside the control of the traditional elders and sometimes in opposition to them .
Hence the most violent years in Somalia were the years following 1991 when the United Nations was physically present , attempting to impose a central government .
When the United Nations withdrew in 1995 , the expectation of a future central government began to recede , and things began to stabilize .
But the United Nations continued it efforts to re-establish a government through a series of some sixteen failed " peace conferences . "
In 2000 it set up a straw government , the Transitional National Government ( TNG ) .
However , not only did the northern Somali clans not recognize the TNG , it was unable to control its intended capital city of Mogadishu .
Today a combined " peace - keeping mission " of United States –backed troops from Ethiopia , Somalia 's traditional enemy , and Uganda under the aegis of the African Union is in Mogadishu attempting to prop up the TNG and secure its control over the rest of Somalia .
Violence soars .
The situation is curiously like an event in Greek mythology .
The gods on Mt. Olympus were enjoying a festive party , to which , understandably , they had not invited Eris , the goddess of discord .
Eris , just as understandably , took the matter personally .
She had the blacksmith Hephaestus fashion a golden apple , on which was written καλλιστι — " To the fairest . "
Then she opened the door a crack and rolled the golden apple into the festive hall .
In no time at all , the gods were fighting over who should have the apple .
The golden apple in Somalia is the expectation that there will soon be a central government .
As long as there is that expectation , the clans must fight over who will control it .
Somalia and the Rule of Law
Now , I 've gone this far without telling you much about Somalia .
It 's the Horn of Africa , that part of northeast Africa that juts out into the Indian Ocean just below the Arabian Peninsula .
The Somali culture area includes all of the Horn and is home to some 11.5 million people .
The colonial powers arbitrarily fragmented this culture area so that today parts of it fall under the jurisdiction of Kenya in the south , some in Ethiopia in the west , and some in Djibouti in the north .
The remainder along the coast is now without a working government .
What these people have in common , even more than similar language , lifestyle , and physical character is a body of customary law , the Xeer , which differs from clan to clan in nonessential ways such as founding myths but is remarkably uniform with respect to its provision for the protection of persons and property .
The Xeer provides a rule of law — customary law , that is — permitting safe travel , trade , marriage , and so forth throughout the region .
The Xeer is most intact in the north of Somalia , which was under British rule ; in the south , the Italians tried to eradicate it .
Nonetheless , it survives to a significant degree everywhere , even in the urban areas , and is virtually unaffected in rural Somalia .
The Xeer is the secret to the whole perplexing question of Somalia 's success without a central government , since it provides an authentic rule of law to support trade and economic development .
Fortunately , we know something about the Xeer because of Michael van Notten , a Dutch lawyer who in the early 1990s married into the Samaron Clan in the northwest of Somalia , the fifth largest of the Somali clans , and lived with them for the last twelve years of his life .
He took full advantage of that opportunity to research the Xeer .
The result was his pioneering study , The Law of the Somalis ( Red Sea Press , 2005 ) .
Van Notten died when his manuscript was half finished .
Fortunately , he had largely completed assembling the ethnographic material .
In his will , he asked that I edit and complete the manuscript for publication .
The task ahead is to see the work translated into Somali .
Highlights of the Xeer
There is time in this short talk to give you only some of the highlights of the Xeer .
First , law and , consequently , crime are defined in terms of property rights .
The law is compensatory rather than punitive .
Because property right requires compensation , rather than punishment , there is no imprisonment , and fines are rare .
Such fines as might be imposed seldom exceed the amount of compensation and are not payable to any court or government , but directly to the victim .
A fine might be in order when , for example , the killing of a camel was deliberate and premeditated , in which case the victim receives not one but two camels .
Fines are used in another interesting way .
It is expected that a prominent public figure such as a religious or political dignitary or a policeman or a judge should lead an exemplary life .
If he violates the law , he pays double what would be required of an ordinary person .
Also , it should be noted , since the law and crime are defined in terms of property rights , the Xeer is unequivocal in its opposition to any form of taxation .
Second , in order to assure that compensation will be forthcoming even in cases where the perpetrator is a child , or penniless , or crazy , or has fled abroad , the Xeer requires that every person be fully insured against any liability he might incur under the law .
If an individual cannot make the required payment , a designated group of his kin is responsible .
Van Notten describes in an interesting way how this happens :
A person who violates someone 's rights and is unable to pay the compensation himself notifies his family , who then pays on his behalf .
From an emotional point of view , this notification is a painful procedure , since no family member will miss the opportunity to tell the wrongdoer how vicious or stupid he was .
Also , they will ask assurances that he will be more careful in the future .
Indeed , all those who must pay for the wrongdoings of a family member will thereafter keep an eye on him and try to intervene before he incurs another liability .
They will no longer , for example , allow him to keep or bear a weapon .
While on other continents the re-education of criminals is typically a task of the government , in Somalia it is the responsibility of the family .
If the family tires of bailing out a repeat offender , they can disown him , in which case he becomes an outlaw .
Not being insured , he forfeits all protection under the law and , for his safety , must leave the country .
Customary law is similar in this and many other respects throughout the world .
An instance is told in the founding legend of my own Clan MacCallum in Scotland .
The founder of the Clan supposedly was exiled 1,500 years ago from Ireland because he was a hothead whom his family disowned for embroiling them in fights .
In the loneliness of his exile on the North Sea , he became a man of peace .
He could n't return to Ireland , as he was no longer under protection of the law and could have been killed with impunity .
So he went instead to Scotland and there founded our clan .
A third point about the Xeer is that there is no monopoly of police or judicial services .
Anyone is free to serve in those capacities as long as he is not at the same time a religious or political dignitary , since that would compromise the sharp separation of law , politics , and religion .
Also , anyone performing in such a role is subject to the same laws as anyone else — and more so : if he violates the law , he must pay heavier damages or fines than would apply to anyone else .
Public figures are expected to show exemplary conduct .
Fourth , there is no victimless crime .
Only a victim or his family can initiate a court action .
Where there is no victim to call a court into being , no court can form .
No court can investigate on its own initiative any evidence of alleged misconduct .
Last , the court procedure is interesting .
From birth , every Somali has his own judge who will sit on the court that will judge him should he transgress the law .
That judge is his oday , the head of his extended family consisting of all males descended from the same great grandfather , together with their spouses and children .
Several extended families make up a jilib , which is the group responsible for paying the blood price in the event a member kills someone of another jilib or clan .
The oday , or judge , is chosen carefully , following weeks or months of deliberation by elders of the clan .
He has no authority over the family but is chosen solely for his knowledge of human affairs and his wisdom , and he can lose his position if his decisions are not highly regarded in the community .
When an offense is committed , the offender goes first to his oday , who then forms a court with the oday of the plaintiff .
If the two odays cannot resolve the matter , they form another court made up of odays representing additional families , jilibs , or clans .
A virtue of each person knowing from birth who will be one of his judges , and vice versa , is that an oday knows each person in his extended family intimately and can observe and counsel him before what might seem to be a small problem escalates into a crime .
Once a court forms and accepts jurisdiction over a case , its first action is to appoint a recorder , who will repeat loudly during the hearing each important point made by the speakers .
The court then announces when and where it will hear the case .
When the court session opens , the court invites the plaintiff to state his case .
The plaintiff has the right to appoint a representative to make the presentation on his behalf .
During the presentation , the plaintiff has opportunity to confer with his family to make sure that he has not forgotten anything .
When the plaintiff has finished , the court asks him to summarize his case and state his demands .
Lastly , the court asks the defendant to present his defense and any counterclaims .
Then the court adjourns to deliberate on whether any witnesses should be heard .
A disputed fact is admitted as evidence only when three witnesses have testified to its truth .
The parties can also call in experts and character witnesses .
If the victim has died or has been wounded , the court will instruct a religious dignitary to assess how the victim died or was wounded .
These dignitaries assess injuries usually by applying the standards enumerated in the commentary of the twelfth - century Muslim scholar al - Nawawii's Minhaaj at - Talibiin .
When the plaintiff has elaborated his case with witnesses and evidence , the defendant is given a chance to refute the plaintiff 's charges , arguments , and evidence .
It is not customary to cross-examine witnesses .
Finally , the court adjourns again to evaluate the evidence .
If less than three witnesses support a fact , or if the witnesses contradict each other , the court will proceed to oath taking .
There are several types of oaths .
The simplest starts by the oath giver saying , " I swear by my virility . "
Alternatively , he can say , " I swear by Allah . "
A stronger oath is the so - called triple oath , in which he swears the same oath three times .
A stronger oath yet is the one that is repeated 50 times .
Also , there is the so - called divorce oath , in which the oath giver swears by his marriage (s ) .
If it is later found out that he lied , his marriage (s ) become null and void .
It should be noted that even when the plaintiff fails to convince the court of his case , the court will usually not rule in favor of the defendant until the latter has taken an oath of innocence .
In a longer talk , I could discuss the role of police and enforcement of judgments , but this much should give some flavor of the legal system practiced by the Somalis .
It provides an effective rule of law entirely without the backing of a government .
The Xeer takes its place among such great legal systems of the world as the Roman law , the English common law , the Law Merchant , and the Jewish traditional law ( Halacha ) .
It must be extremely old and is believed to have developed in the Horn of Africa .
There is no evidence that it developed elsewhere or was greatly influenced by any foreign legal system .
The fact that Somali legal terminology is practically devoid of loan words from foreign languages suggests that the Xeer is truly indigenous .
Michael van Notten 's book describing this system of law deserves to be better known and widely read .
It is the first study of any customary law to treat it not as a curiosity of the past , but as potentially instructive for a future free society .
In his book , Van Notten lays out some practical applications to the world in which we find ourselves today , applications I have n't had time to touch on here .
Whether or not the intervention of foreign governments , which has intensified with the refusal of Somalis to die or remain poor , will frustrate this potential , only time can tell .
Many of King 's novels have been successfully adapted for screen
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation said staff at the Alice Springs book store did not initially realise the writer was autographing his own novels .
Bookshop manager Bev Ellis said : " When you see someone writing in one of your books you get a bit toey [ nervous ] .
" We immediately ran to the books and lo and behold , there was the signature . "
Ms Ellis later approached the author at a nearby supermarket and said he was " very nice , charming " .
" Well , if we knew you were coming we would have baked you a cake , " she told the writer .
' Embarrassing '
The prolific author , best known for works such as Carrie , The Shining and Misery , signed six books including his most recent novel , Lisey 's Story .
Most of the books will be given to local charities , though one was purchased by a customer who was in the store with King .
Ms Ellis added that it was common for authors to visit the shop , check if their books are on the shelves and sign some copies .
" If they 're not on the shelves , they 'll ask about them .
It 's embarrassing if we have n't got their work , " she said .
King 's representative in Australia told the media he was unaware the author was in the country .
Still , Oregon continues to have a higher unemployment rate , at 5.2 percent , than that of the country as a whole , 4.4 percent .
High - tech jobs are growing again in Portland , but the timber industry continues to decline .
“ We have a very pronounced rural - urban split , ” said William Lunch , a professor of political science at Oregon State University .
Under a farm bill now before Congress , advocates for the hungry say , the rules that allow expanded eligibility for food stamps could be restricted , potentially disqualifying about 50,000 of the 434,000 Oregonians who use them .
On Friday , Mr. Kulongoski sent a letter to President Bush asking him to preserve the current benefits .
The governor , a former labor lawyer , state insurance commissioner , state attorney general and member of the Oregon Supreme Court , noted more than once during his week on the low - cost diet that he grew up an orphan in a Catholic boys home in St. Louis .
He said Friday that he had learned to clean his plate no matter what was on it .
With Mr. Kulongoski and his wife , Mary Oberst , limited to $ 42 between them , what was on the plate became distinctly familiar .
Ms. Oberst , who typically does their cooking — the governor has no kitchen staff — released a to - the - penny menu midway through the week that showed a single chicken surfacing first with zucchini on the side , and then later in salad and a “ chowder . ”
[ The couple returned to their regular diet on Sunday afternoon .
In a brief telephone interview on Monday , the governor said that eating less had clearly affected him .
“ I went to bed earlier , ” he said , “ because I was tired at the end of the day . ”
He also said he had missed his stash of Northwest microbrews . ]
How much do the Kulongoskis usually spend on food ?
Hard to say .
The governor ’s office puts it at just $ 55 a week , but that is for at - home meals only .
Not included are things they eschewed during the challenge : meals at official functions , dinners out , and lunches and snacks bought on the job .
For all the public fascination with the governor ’s menu , there did not appear to be immediate benefits for his policy agenda .
Mr. Kulongoski ’s proposal to provide health insurance to children by raising the cigarette tax failed in an initial vote during the week , though he said he believed that it would pass before the legislature adjourns in June .
His plan to expand financing for community colleges has also stalled for now .
Asked if his lean week had bolstered his political heft , he said : “ I do n’t think it makes any difference .
I ’ve been in this for 35 years , and these things all pass .
Next week they may not remember me being on the diet , but something will stay in the mind about hunger in Oregon . ”
KRAKOW ( Poland ) : Polish author Stanislaw Lem , one of the world 's leading science fiction writers , died on Monday in his home city of Krakow at the age of 84 after a battle with a heart disease .
Lem , whose books have sold more than 27 million copies and have been translated into more than 40 languages , won widespread acclaim for The Cyberiad , stories from a mechanical world ruled by robots , first published in English in 1974 .
Solaris , published in 1961 and set on an isolated space stations , was made into a film epic 10 years later by Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky and into a 2002 Hollywood remake shot by Steven Sodebergh and starring George Clooney .
'' Shortly after 6.30 pm Stanislaw Lem died in the heart clinic , where he had been treated over the past few weeks for circulatory problems , '' Andrzej Kulig , director of the Jagiellonian University hospital , said .
Lem , born on September 12 , 1921 in what is now the Ukrainian city of Lviv , studied medicine before World War Two .
After the war , Communist censorship blocked the publication of his earliest writing .
After the fall of communism in 1989 Lem ceased writing science fiction , instead devoting himself to reports on near future predictions for governments and organisations .
He wrote essays on computer crime , as well as technological and ethical problems posed by the expansion of the Internet .

PORTSMOUTH , New Hampshire ( CNN ) -- Sen. John McCain 's visit Tuesday to Concord High School proved to be more than the average guest speaker appearance , with the Republican presidential candidate giving and getting a dose of the campaign 's trademark " straight talk . "
While campaigning Tuesday with her husband , Cindy McCain uses crutches after twisting her knee .
During the question - and - answer session , one student rose and asked a pointed question about McCain 's age , 71 : " If elected , you'd be older than Ronald Reagan , making you the oldest president .
Do you ever worry that , like , you might die in office or get Alzheimer 's or some other disease that might affect your judgment ? "
The Arizona senator chuckled slightly as comments of " Oh my God " filled the room .
In a self - deprecating reference to his memory , McCain said his children have joked about their father " hiding his own Easter eggs , " but quickly added that he is a " 24 - 7 " worker and will out - campaign any of his rivals .
McCain ended the exchange in his quintessential style : " Thanks for the question , you little jerk .
... You 're drafted . "
Another student then asked McCain a question about what he would do for rights for " LGBTs " -- lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender people .
McCain was confused by the question and acknowledged to the audience that he did not know what the initials meant .
Once the meaning was clarified , McCain told sophomore William Sleaster he is opposed to any form of discrimination , but he supports the military 's " Do n't Ask , Don't Tell " policy and he opposes same - sex marriage .
" I believe that the sanctity of marriage between man and woman is unique and should be preserved , and I understand the controversy that swirls around that issue , and that debate needs to be continued to be held , but I support that position , " McCain said .
" You want to take away someone 's rights because you believe it 's wrong , " Sleaster followed up .
" I do n't put that interpretation on my position , but I understand yours , " McCain responded , seeming to enjoy the back and forth .
" I came here looking to see a good leader .
I do n't , " Sleaster said before leaving the microphone to some boos and gasps from the audience and an eventual scolding by a school administrator .
" Listen , I understand , " McCain told the buzzing crowd .
" I thank you .
That 's what America is all about , and I appreciate your views . "
Asked later at a news conference , McCain said he had never heard the initials " LGBT " before , but knew the phrase .
Iraq dominated much of McCain 's comments before the packed auditorium .
He reiterated his support for U.S. strategy there , and played up his criticism of the way the war was handled until recently .
" I was the only one of the major Republican candidates who adamantly , vociferously opposed the [ former Defense Secretary Donald ]
Rumsfeld strategy and fought hard for the strategy [ of using more troops ] that we 're employing today , " he told reporters .
" The others thought it was fine .
That 's because they do n't have the knowledge or background and experience that I do on issues of national security .
That 's a clear indication of it . "

Belgian photograper Sebastian Schutyser spent nearly four years photographing the mud mosques of Mali .
A collection of 200 such black & white photographs is now online at ArchNet The project " began in 1998 , " Schutyser explains : " For several months I traveled from village to village by bicycle and ' pirogue ' , navigating with IGN 1:200.000 maps .
The inaccessibility of the area made me realize why this had n't been done before .
" Within a few years , however , and over a period lasting roughly till the Spring of 2002 , Schutyser managed " to travel faster , and reach the most remote parts of the Inner Delta .
To increase the documentary value of the collection , I worked with 35 mm color slides , and photographed every mosque from different angles .
Whenever I encountered a particularly pretty mosque , I also photographed it on 4 - 5 inch black & white negative , to add to the ' vintage ' collection .
" Those color photos — all 2,070 of them — can be seen in these five batches of approximately 400 images each : 1-400 1251-1675 , and 1676 - 2070 " With 515 mosques photographed , " Schutyser writes , " this collection shows a representative image of the adobe mosques of the Niger Inner Delta .
Advancing modernity , and a lack of appreciation for this ' archaic ' approach to building , are serious threats to the continuity of this living architecture .
" I might also add that each building is a kind of ritually re-repaired ventilation machine capable of generating its own microclimate : " During the day , " ArchNet explains , " the walls absorb the heat of the day that is released throughout the night , helping the interior of the mosque remain cool all day long .
Some structures , for example , Djenné ’s Great Mosque , also have roof vents with ceramic caps .
These caps , made by the town 's women , can be removed at night to ventilate the interior spaces .
Masons have integrated palm wood scaffolding into the building 's construction , not as beams , but as permanent scaffolding for the workers who apply plaster annually during the spring festival to restore the mosque .
The palm beams also minimize the stress that comes from the extreme temperature and humidity changes typical of the climate .
" Finally , each tower is " often topped with a spire capped by an ostrich egg , symbolizing fertility and purity .
" Schutyser 's images have been collected in a beautiful book , co-written with Dorothee Gruner and Jean Dethier , called Banco : Adobe Mosques of the Inner Niger Delta ( All images in this post are © Sebastian Schutyser ) .
Hitachi has successfully tested a brain - machine interface that allows users to turn power switches on and off with their mind .
Relying on optical topography , a neuroimaging technique that uses near - infrared light to map blood concentration in the brain , the system can recognize the changes in brain blood flow associated with mental activity and translate those changes into voltage signals for controlling external devices .
In the experiments , test subjects were able to activate the power switch of a model train by performing mental arithmetic and reciting items from memory .
The prototype brain - machine interface allows only simple control of switches , but with a better understanding of the subtle variations in blood concentrations associated with various brain activities , the signals can be refined and used to control more complex mechanical operations .
In the long term , brain - machine interface technology may help paralyzed patients become independent by empowering them to carry out actions with their minds .
In the short term , Hitachi sees potential applications for this brain - machine interface in the field of cognitive rehabilitation , where it can be used as an entertaining tool for demonstrating a patient�s progress .
The company hopes to make this technology commercially available in five years .

And they are n’t blaming women either .
Pocket Issue and AOL have issued a press release that shows the results of 4000 people polled with almost 3 out of 4 believing that human actions are n’t causing global warming , with 65 % going further to agree with the notion that scientific findings on this issue are “ far fetched . ”
What strikes me as odd is how people all over the radio are claiming this as proof that global warming just is n’t our fault .
“ If that many people believe it is n’t true , then it must not be true , ” goes the logic in resposne to a statement by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that says global warming is ,
very likely due to the observed increase of anthropogenic [ man - made ] greenhouse gas concentrations .
Very likely , they later clarify means 90 % sure .
But this recent poll does n’t surprise me .
Least I forget ,
Even today , more than four years into the war in Iraq , as many as four in 10 Americans ( 41 percent ) still believe Saddam Hussein ’s regime was directly involved in financing , planning or carrying out the terrorist attacks on 9/11 , even though no evidence has surfaced to support a connection .
Closer to home , more Americans are able to name Jordin Sparks as the winner of the most recent season of American Idol ( 18 percent ) than can identify John Roberts as the Supreme Court ’s chief justice ( 11 percent ) .
source
But that ’s to be expected right ?
We ’re too busy watching American Idol to be bothered with the “ reason ” we ’re fighting a war , let alone who is in charge of the high court in our land .
But before I go too far in picking on poor Americans I should remind myself that this phenomenon of mass disillusion is not a recent invention of our nation in the modern era .
Plenty of people did n’t believe the first folks to point out at that the Earth is round or that cigarettes cause cancer or that our solar system revolves around the sun .
For at least three centuries after Copernicus wrote Commentariolus explaining that last little idea the catholic church would n’t allow such a “ theory ” to be printed in Rome .
Hell , the church just got around to pardoning Galileo in 1992 for defending it !
But we seem especially good , as a society , at ignoring scientific evidence these days .
As proof I offer the fact that we even have three Republican candidates for president who think they ca n’t get elected unless they publicly admit they do n’t believe in evolution .
Me personally , I do n’t believe Prezident George W. Bush is real .
The “ evidence ” is just too overwhelming .
So call it a group sickness or a mass denial or a twisted reality we just have to get used to .
Plenty of people will believe what ever they want to believe and if they do n’t want to believe that their behavior is largely responsible for global warming and the subsequent global climate change due to severely impact our children as well as increase the mass extinction among God ’s creatures here on Earth , well , there ’s probably not much you ’re personally going to be able to say that will be able to aurally compete with talk radio propaganda .
Those guys have heard the uninformed masses speak and that ’s proof enough for them that everything is A OK .
Is there a bright spot ?
Well maybe there is .
This time last year the same Joe Q. Public
I ’m picking on would n’t even admit global warming existed .
I can tell you one thing , they ’re going to have a hell of a time with peak oil .
The Stream Protection Rule was developed by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement ( OSMRE ) over the course of seven years during the Obama administration .
The rulemaking was an effort to better protect public waterways from mountaintop removal and other destructive coal mining practices .
The rule would have updated the 1983 Stream Buffer Zone Rule .
After years of drafting and refinements , the rule took effect in January 2017 before being revoked by Congress in February through the Congressional Review Act.
President Trump signed the legislation rescinding the rule , and the 1983 version is now once again in effect .

The killing of journalist Hrant Dink shocked Turkey
" People sometimes pay with their lives for saying out loud what they think . "
Those were the words of Anna Politkovskaya , the Russian journalist shot dead by an unknown assassin in the lift of her Moscow apartment block on 7 October last year .
The killer was seen on a CCTV recording , wearing a baseball cap but not hiding his face .
Anna Politkovskaya was a fierce critic of President Putin 's government , and had received many death threats .
When she died she was working on an article alleging torture by special forces under the Chechen Prime Minister Ramzan Kadyrov .
Press freedom is like the canary in the coalmine

As in the cases of a dozen other murders of prominent Russian journalists since 2000 , the investigation into her killing has so far led nowhere .
On 19 January this year Hrant Dink , a well - known Armenian Turkish writer and journalist , was shot dead in a street in Istanbul .
He had received threats from Turkish nationalists for writing about the mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in World War I , and been found guilty last year on a criminal charge of " insulting Turkishness " .
Those deaths of famous journalists provoked an international storm .
And the kidnapping of the BBC correspondent Alan Johnston in Gaza in March has again focussed attention on the grave threats to journalists in conflict zones .
But journalists are being killed , attacked or threatened in record numbers .
Most acts of violence go unreported .
List of shame
In March , a study by the International News Safety Institute ( Insi ) , a coalition of media organisations and human rights groups , said 1,000 journalists had been killed around the world in the past 10 years .
The BBC's Alan Johnston was abducted in Gaza on 12 March
The most dangerous place was Iraq , with 138 killed .
Russia came next , with 88 deaths .
Insi 's director , Rodney Pinder , said : " In many countries , murder has become the easiest , cheapest and most effective way of silencing troublesome reporting . "
On World Press Freedom
Day this year , campaigners say the most deadly threat to media freedom is violence targeting journalists just because the things they may expose are unwelcome .
" Press Freedom suffered a continued global decline in 2006 . "
That is the conclusion of this year 's global survey by Freedom House , a New York - based campaigning group .
It rated Burma , Cuba , Libya and North Korea as the world 's worst violators of media freedom .
As a region , it says the Middle East and North Africa has the harshest restrictions .
And a new report by the independent Committee to Protect Journalists has published a " roll of dishonour " of places where it says press freedom has deteriorated over the past five years .
Ethiopia is at the top of the list : 18 journalists have reportedly been jailed there , and the CPJ says private newspapers are driven to exercise self - censorship .
Next come Gambia ( where one newspaper editor was murdered ) , Russia , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Cuba , Pakistan , Egypt , Azerbaijan , Morocco and Thailand .
Intolerance and rigid laws
The Council of Europe says journalists in several of its 46 member - states fear for their lives .
The Council 's parliamentary assembly has protested about brutal attacks on journalists in Ukraine ( where the journalist Georgiy Gongadze was found beheaded in the year 2000 ) , as well as Azerbaijan and Moldova .
And Europe still suffers the effects of religious intolerance , which was seen in last year 's uncontrolled protests against a set of Danish cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed .
The Council of Europe condemns Iranian religious leaders for issuing " death decrees " against a Frenchman and two Azerbaijanis who wrote about Islam .
In the former Yugoslavia , too , journalists have been the targets of sectarian violence while investigating alleged war crimes , many years after the conflict ended .
The Paris - based World Association of Newspapers raises the alarm over anti-terrorism laws which it says are stifling media freedom .
Today it denounces many governments for failing to protect the press from their effects .
The association says state secrets laws have been used to convict journalists in Russia and China .
In Germany , the Netherlands and the UK , too , journalists have faced trial for violating security laws .
Bad for everyone
And the media themselves are not immune from criticism .
In America , the networks and big news organisations are being asked : why did they fall for the Pentagon 's false story about the heroism of Private Jessica Lynch in Iraq ?
And where was their proper scrutiny of the US government over the " war on terror " ?
Commercial pressures have also brought new ownership monopolies and forced Western news companies to cut their foreign news staff .
That has boosted an exciting alternative , the blogosphere .
The internet seems to promise unlimited access to information for people everywhere .
China and some other countries have moved quickly to curtail their people 's ability to use it freely .
There is some good news for the embattled media .
Last December the UN Security Council passed Resolution 1738 , requiring armies and governments to protect journalists like other civilians in war zones .
And the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe is pressing its 55 member - states to live up to their promises .
Miklos Haraszti , the OSCE 's Representative on Freedom of the Media , challenged the Russian authorities over Anna Politkovskaya 's murder , saying Moscow allowed a " climate of impunity " to develop which may have led her killers to believe they would go unpunished .
" Press freedom is like the canary in the coalmine , " says Jennifer Windsor of Freedom House .
" Assaults on the media are inevitably followed by assaults on other democratic institutions . "

Even Sinhalese journalists are warned not to write anything against the government or the truth .

Journalists in Manila , Philippines will be lighting candles and reading poems to honour the 51 journalists murdered in three years since our current president assumed power in 2001 .
Does n't that make the Philippines a very dangerous place for journalists ?
James , Manila , Philippines
It seems that there is a warped view of democracy in Europe and Russia in which journalists can report on what they like on condition that they have to satisfy a certain group of people who are actually intolerant of other people 's views .
This is becoming an increasing problem in Russia where you have to report only good things or be vulnerable to attack from pro-Kremlin activists or state - sponsored thugs in the guise of the paramilitary youth group - NASHI .
However , there is a key difference between exposing corruption and having a different point of view on such topics and intervening in the private lives of famous people and business leaders .

I am a young broadcast journalist with one of the leading TV stations in Ghana , and although i do not report from any of the stated regions , i feel a bit uncomfortable with the thought of a fellow journalist being killed for what they trained and studied years to do !
I have always dreamt of being in the eye of news worthy region to report to the world but now i really have jitters over the mere thought .
It 's about time they put measures in place to protect journalists .
But then again , what can they do ?

No mention of Afghanistan ?
At least two media workers were killed by the Taliban this year and several more have been threatened .
Going to the frontlines is nearly impossible because of the threat of kidnappings , and security forces , including the US military block access , shoot at journalists and confiscate media cameras .
Meanwhile the government and Parliament are trying to limit press freedoms .
The risks have grown noticeably in the last three years .

Story Highlights • Station banned by Hugo Chavez posts content on Web site
• RCTV's affiliate in Colombia beams newscast into Venezuela
• Closing of station prompted large street protests
Adjust font size :
CARACAS , Venezuela ( CNN ) -- Radio Caracas Television , the station silenced by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , has found a way to continue its daily broadcasts -- on YouTube , the popular video Web site .
Although the station is officially off the air , CNN's Harris Whitbeck said its news department continues to operate on reduced staffing , and the three daily hour - long installments of the newscast " El Observador " are uploaded onto YouTube by RCTV's Web department .
In addition , RCTV's Colombia - based affiliate , Caracol , has agreed to transmit the evening installment of " El Observador " over its international signal .
The program , which will run at midnight , could reach about 800,000 people in Venezuela .
Although this is drastically reduced from RCTV 's previous audience , its continued presence is a sign of hope for the staff .
" We 're just doing our job as journalists , " said an employee of RCTV .
" As long as somebody is seeing us , we consider what we are doing to be valid . "
Thousands of people , most of them from area universities , took to the streets of Caracas in protest this week after Chavez refused to renew RCTV 's broadcasting license , which expired last Sunday .
( I - Report : Watch marchers fill street to protest station 's closing )
Chavez accused RCTV of violating broadcast laws and supporting a botched coup against him in 2002 .
He replaced RCTV on Monday with a state - run broadcast station .
RCTV , which had been on air for 53 years , aired soap operas , programs and news broadcasts with a decidedly anti-governmental perspective .
It was one of only a handful of private broadcast stations in Venezuela that openly criticized the government .
Another , Globovision , has received similar threats from Chavez regarding its right to broadcast .
One of YouTube 's many features is the option for viewers to comment on the posted videos , and recently old and new segments of RCTV programming on the site have been accompanied by fiery debate about the limits of free expression .
" Cerrar un medio de comunicacion es una monstruosidad sin excusa alguna , " stated one commenter : " To close a means of communication is an inexcusable monstrosity . "

Health Tips From Your Own DNA Researchers ' test may show whether you 're prone to heart disease , cancer .
Aug. 21 , 2007  --
New mom Melissa Christensen runs marathons and eats her vegetables , but during a DNA mapping test she learned she is still a candidate for heart disease , diabetes and osteoporosis .
The healthy 30 - year - old said the test gave her a health warning straight from her own DNA .
Do you have a question about genetic testing ?
Click here to take part in a Q+A with the Human Genome Institute .
" It does n't mean for sure that you 'll get any of these health conditions , " said Sharon Alford , the principal researcher at Detroit 's Henry Ford Hospital .
" There are things you can do to stay healthy regardless of your genetic markers . "
" That 's good , " said Christensen , who is one of the first few hundred Americans to see a personal , practical benefit from the Human Genome Project , which identified all of the genes in human DNA .
Because they can map an individual 's DNA , researchers now use a simple blood test to check for different genetic flaws that often give rise to the eight treatable diseases that kill and cost the most , including skin , lung and colon cancer , high blood pressure and heart disease .
" We could identify people who are at risk early in their life long before they become overweight or become inactive or start smoking , " said Colleen McBride of the National Human Genome Research Institute .
Some Info May Be too Much Reality
Researchers hope the information will send a more powerful message to people who may not focus on healthy eating and exercise , if they learn they are predisposed to heart disease or other ailments .
" And where maybe before they were n't as committed , now here it is in black and white and it's reality so they feel more motivated , " said Alford .
Right now they test people only for preventable diseases .
Part of the experiment is to determine how much grim information people actually want to know about their own bodies .
If they offered a test for incurable diseases such as Alzheimer 's or leukemia , Christensen said , she probably would not opt for those results .
" I do n't think I would because it might be scary , " she said .
" I 'm a worrier . "

Before our eyes , the neoconservative position is disintegrating .
Its foreign - policy tenets have been shown to be false .
As is now openly admitted , they have brought the US to the verge of disaster in Iraq , which is why the American version of the " men in grey suits " has ridden to the rescue .
After less than six years in office , elected at a time when the US was unchallenged as the sole superpower , the Bush administration has managed to deliver the country to the edge of what can only be compared to a Vietnam moment : the political and military defeat of the central and defining plank of American foreign policy .
Of course , in one sense it is quite unlike Vietnam .
In 1975 the Americans suffered a spectacular military defeat at the hands of North Vietnam and the Vietcong , with US helicopters seeking to rescue leading US personnel from the tops of buildings as Vietnamese guerrillas closed in on the centre of Saigon .
It was to shape American foreign policy - in particular , a desire to avoid overseas military entanglements - for decades .
Indeed , the rise of the neoconservatives was partly predicated on a rejection of what they saw as American defeatism during and after the Vietnam war .
Iraq is very different .
There is no single enemy with a clear military strategy .
Baghdad will not be Saigon .
This is a case of an endless , bloody and unwinnable quagmire rather than any spectacular denouement in waiting .
But the Iraq moment is far more dangerous for the US than the Vietnam moment .
Although one of the key justifications for the Vietnam war was to prevent the spread of communism , the US defeat was to produce nothing of the kind : apart from the fact that Cambodia and Laos became embroiled , the effects were essentially confined to Vietnam .
There were no wider political repercussions in east Asia : ironically , it was China that was to invade North Vietnam in 1979 ( and deservedly got a bloody nose ) .
The regional consequences of the Iraq imbroglio are , in comparison , immediate , profound and far - reaching .
The civil war threatens to unhinge more or less the entire Middle East .
The neoconservative strategy - to remake the region single - handedly ( with the support of Israel , of course ) - has been undermined by its own hubris .
The American dilemma is patent in some of the key recommendations of the ISG report : to involve Iran and Syria in any Iraqi settlement ( including the return of the Golan Heights to Syria ) and to seek a new agreement between Israel and Palestine .
In short , it proposes a reversal of the key strands of Bush 's foreign policy
From a longer - term perspective , moreover , it is already clear that it will be impossible for the Americans to restore the status quo ante in the region .
The failure of the occupation has shown the limitations of its power - which every country , from Iran and Syria to Israel and Saudi Arabia ( not to mention Hizbullah and Hamas ) , will have noted .
The US has been the decisive arbiter in the Middle East since the end of the Suez crisis in 1956 , albeit with the Soviet Union playing a secondary role until 1989 .
The American era is now over .
In future the US will be forced to share its influence with regional powers such as Iran , with the EU - and no doubt in time , with emerging global players such as China and perhaps even Russia .
Such a scenario may well mean that the key alliance that has shaped the Middle East since 1956 - between the US and Israel - will no longer be so pivotal and could be increasingly downgraded .
From a regional standpoint , it is clear that the Iraq moment is far more serious for the US than the Vietnam moment .
What is true regionally is also the case globally .
We are reminded of how even the most powerful and , indeed , the most knowledgeable can get things profoundly wrong .
It is worthwhile recalling the longer - term global context of the American defeat in Vietnam .
It did not signal any serious upturn in the fortunes of the Soviet Union ; this was already in a state of economic stagnation and growing political paralysis that was to become terminal in the 80s , leaving the US as the sole superpower .
It was this that encouraged the neoconservatives to utterly misread the historical runes at the end of the 90s .
They believed that the world was ripe for a huge expansion of American power and influence .
A few years later we can see the full absurdity of this position .
Far from the US being in the ascendant , deeper trends have moved in the opposite direction .
The US might enjoy overwhelming military advantage , but its relative economic power , which in the long run is almost invariably decisive , is in decline .
The interregnum after the cold war , far from being the prelude to a new American age , was bearing the signs of what is now very visible : the emergence of a multipolar world .
By misreading global trends , the Bush administration 's embrace of unilateralism not only provoked the Iraq disaster but also hastened American decline .
An increasingly multipolar world requires an entirely different kind of US foreign policy : far from being unilateralist , it necessitates a complex form of power - sharing on both a global and regional basis .
This is not only the opposite to neoconservative unilateralism , it is also entirely different from the simplicities of superpower cooperation and rivalry in the bipolar world of the cold war .
The new approach is implicit in the ISG report , which recognises that any resolution of the Iraq crisis depends on the involvement of Iran and Syria .
Elements of this approach are already apparent on the Korean peninsula and in Latin America .
The ramifications of the Iraq moment will surely influence US foreign policy for decades to come .

Russian Proton - M rocket with Japanese satellite crashes on launch
RIA Novosti
06/09/2007 11:05 MOSCOW , September 6 ( RIA Novosti ) - A Russian Proton - M booster rocket carrying a Japanese communications satellite exploded shortly after lift - off early Thursday , a space agency spokesman said .
The rocket , which was launched from the Baikonur space center in Kazakhstan at 2:43 a.m. Moscow time ( 10:43 p.m. GMT Wednesday ) , experienced an engine malfunction and second - stage separation failure 139 seconds into its flight , and came down in the central Kazakh steppe , 50 kilometers ( 30 miles ) southeast of the town of Dzhezkazgan , the spokesman said .
The rocket was carrying highly toxic heptyl rocket fuel , and an investigative team will soon be sent to determine the extent of any environmental damage that may have resulted from the crash , he said .
Although Russia and Kazakhstan have an agreement on launches from Baikonur until 2050 , for which Moscow pays Astana $ 115 million a year , Kazakhstan recently said it would reconsider allowing further flights of the Proton because of the rocket fuel 's toxicity and potential for catastrophic environmental contamination in the event of a launch failure .
The satellite was owned by JSat Corp. and would have provided communications links for Japan , the Pacific Region and Hawaii .
The company currently operates eight geostationary communications satellites .
The Delaware - registered company International Launch Services ( ILS ) , which organized the launch , is a Russian - American joint venture that has orbited 41 commercial payloads since 1996 .
Last year , a Russian Dnepr rocket crashed on lift - off from Baikonur , after which a special commission was formed to assess the resulting environmental damage .
On the basis of its findings , Russia paid Kazakhstan $ 1.1 million in damages .
Ladies , are you self - conscious about your breasts ?
Do you think they need to be bigger to get you attention from guys , or at least from guys like Charlie White ?
Well , you could have expensive and gross breast implant surgery , or you could just grab some F Cup cookies from Japan .
These sure - to - be - effective cookies apparently make your breasts bigger when you eat just two a day , while most cookies will just make your ass bigger .

Some 10,000 years ago white rice evolved from wild red rice and began spreading around the globe .
But how did this happen ?
Researchers at Cornell and elsewhere have determined that 97.9 percent of all white rice is derived from a mutation ( a deletion of DNA ) in a single gene originating in the Japonica subspecies of rice .
Their report , published online in the journal PloS ( Public Library of Science ) Genetics , suggests that early farmers favored , bred and spread white rice around the world .
The researchers report that this predominant mutation is also found in the Indica subspecies of white rice .
They have found a second independent mutation ( a single DNA substitution ) in the same gene in several Aus varieties of rice in Bangladesh , accounting for the remaining 2.1 percent of white rice varieties .
Neither of these two mutations is found in any wild red rice species .
Both mutations produce shortened versions of the same protein in which the missing part is responsible for activating the molecular pathway leading to grain color in rice .
" We think that other domains of this protein are critical for other functions in the plant , because we never see the protein entirely deleted , just the part of the molecule that affects the pathway for grain color , " said Susan McCouch , Cornell professor of plant breeding and genetics and the paper 's senior author .
Megan Sweeney , Cornell Ph.D. '06 and postdoctoral associate , was the paper 's lead author .
The researchers speculate that ancient farmers actively bred and spread white rice varieties first throughout the Himalayan region and then the rest of the world because the varieties cooked faster ( requiring less fuel ) , their hulls were easier to remove compared with red rice , and disease and insects were easier to see amid the white grains .
The farmers also may have favored one mutation over the other because it may have produced favorable grains more consistently , the researchers say .
In 2006 the researchers first identified the gene that makes the rice seed 's bran layer , or pericarp , white .
This gave rice breeders and engineers a genetic marker to help develop new breeds .
The Cornell researchers regularly introduce favorable genes from wild red rices into elite white cultivars to improve yields and provide better responses to stress , but they generally select against the gene for red pericarp because it is associated with such unfavorable " weedy " linked traits as seed dormancy and " shattering " ( where seeds fall easily from the stalk ) .
" Breeders can now begin to screen for the red pericarp gene while selecting against closely linked traits like shattering and dormancy , " said McCouch .
The new tools may lead to more diverse domestic rice varieties .
Also , breeders are interested in using the marker to predict whether new generations will contain white or red grains , using DNA from young seedlings , long before the plants set seed .
McCouch noted that due to the genetics of pericarp color in rice ( white grain is recessive and maternally inherited ) , when white grains appear in the panicle ( the grain clusters on the stems ) , it is an indication that all seeds in the clusters will be white -- and offspring from these seeds will continue to produce white - grain plants .
The researchers theorize that women who shucked rice for cooking thousands of years ago would have recognized the value of the white seeds and may have set aside selected panicles for breeding and planting .
Scott Williamson and Carlos Bustamante , both researchers in Cornell 's Department of Biological Statistics and Computational Biology , were also co-authors on this paper .
The research was supported by the Plant Genome Program of the National Science Foundation , the Generation Challenge Program , Chungbuk National University and Korea 's National Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology .

A recent study in Nature1 suggested that terrestrial plants may be a global source of the potent greenhouse gas methane , making plants substantial contributors to the annual global methane budget .
This controversial finding and the resulting commotion triggered a consortium2 of Dutch scientists to re-examine this in an independent study .
Reporting in New Phytologist , Tom Dueck and colleagues present their results and conclude that methane emissions from plants are negligible and do not contribute to global climate change .
The consortium brings together a unique combination of expertise and facilities enabling the design and execution of a novel experiment .
Plants were grown in a facility containing atmospheric carbon dioxide almost exclusively with a heavy form of carbon ( 13C ) .
This makes the carbon released from the plants relatively easy to detect .
Thus , if plants are able to emit methane , it will contain the heavy carbon isotope and can be detected against the background of lighter carbon molecules in the air .
Six plant species were grown in a 13C - carbon dioxide atmosphere , saturating the plants with heavy carbon .
13C - Methane emission was measured under controlled , but natural conditions with a photo - acoustic laser technique .
This technique is so sensitive that the scientists are able to measure the carbon dioxide in the breath of small insects like ants .
Even with this state - of - the - art technique , the measured emission rates were so close to the detection limit that they did not statistically differ from zero .
To our knowledge this is the first independent test which has been published since the controversy last year .
Conscious of the fact that a small amount of plant material might only result in small amounts of methane , the researchers sampled the ‘ heavy ’ methane in the air in which a large amount of plants were growing .
Again , the measured methane emissions were neglible .
Thus these plant specialists conclude that there is no reason to reassess the mitigation potential of plants .
The researchers stress that questions still remain and that the gap in the global methane budget needs to be properly addressed .

SAN FRANCISCO , Nov. 11  From the billions of documents that form the World Wide Web and the links that weave them together , computer scientists and a growing collection of start - up companies are finding new ways to mine human intelligence .
Their goal is to add a layer of meaning on top of the existing Web that would make it less of a catalog and more of a guide  and even provide the foundation for systems that can reason in a human fashion .
That level of artificial intelligence , with machines doing the thinking instead of simply following commands , has eluded researchers for more than half a century .
Referred to as Web 3.0 , the effort is in its infancy , and the very idea has given rise to skeptics who have called it an unobtainable vision .
But the underlying technologies are rapidly gaining adherents , at big companies like I.B.M. and Google as well as small ones .
Their projects often center on simple , practical uses , from producing vacation recommendations to predicting the next hit song .
But in the future , more powerful systems could act as personal advisers in areas as diverse as financial planning , with an intelligent system mapping out a retirement plan for a couple , for instance , or educational consulting , with the Web helping a high school student identify the right college .
これまでの背景と最近の状況変化
「安全 なWebサイト利用の鉄則」にある通り、フィッシングに騙されずにWebを安全に使う基本手順は、（パスワードやカード番号などの）重要な情報を入力する直前に今見ているページのアドレスを確認することなのだが、しばしば、「そのページにアクセスする前にジャンプ先URLを確認する」という手順を掲げる人がいる。しかし、それは次の理由で失当である。
ジャンプ先URLを確認する手段がない。ステータスバーは古来よりJavaScriptで自由に書き換えられる表示欄とされてきたのであり、ジャンプ先の確認に使えない。
ジャンプ先URLを事前に確認したとしても、それが（任意サイトへの）リダイレクタになっている場合、最終的にどこへアクセスすることになるか不明。
そもそも、アクセスする前から、アドレス確認の必要性を予見できるとは限らない。普通は、アクセスして（パスワードやカード番号などの）重要な情報を入力しようとした時点で、アドレス確認の重要性に気づくはず。その時点で、そこまでに辿ってきたページのジャンプ先URLが正しかったかを思い出すことはできない。
しかし、これ はPCのWebでの話である。携帯電話世界のWebでは話が違ってくる。
携帯電話 のWebでは、アドレスバーがないため、入力の直前に確認することがほとんど行われていない一方、携帯電話では「あまり遠くへ行かない」という使われ方をしているため、ジャンプ前に確認する方法で十分に偽サイトの見分けができる状況があった。このことは、3年前の日記「太古の昔、アドレスバーが入力欄でなかったのを知ってるかい？」と「アドレスバーのない携帯電話はPhishing詐欺に耐えられるか」で次のように書いていた。
携帯電話ではほとんどの人が、公式メニューと数件程度のブックマークから直接サイトにアクセスして利用しているだろう。つまりサーフィンをしない。平均ホップ数がかなり小さいと推定できる。
だから、携帯電話にアドレスバーがなくても誰も困らなかったし、疑問を感じなかったのだろう。今見ている画面は、ついさっき意識的に選んだサイトであるに違いないと確信して使っている。
携帯電話の場合、幸いなことにHTMLメールというものがない。そのため、パソコンにおけるフィッシング詐欺のように、見た目には正規のドメインのサイトへのリンクに見えて、ジャンプ先は異なるドメインになるという罠をしかけることはできない。ジャンプ前にURLを確認できるため、ページ表示にアドレスバーがなくても、それによってドメインの錯誤が起きることはないのかもしれない。
この前提に立つと、携帯電話ではジャンプ先URLの偽装ができてはならないことになる。その前提に立って修正されたのが、「au携帯電話のバーコードリーダでジャンプ先URLが偽装される（2005年4月）」の脆弱性だった。
さて、ところが、それから2年ほどが経過し、携帯電話のWeb世界も状況が変わってきた。検索サービスが普及してきたのである。2006年、携帯キャリア各社がそろって検索サイトと提携して、公式機能としてWeb検索を提供するようになった。
この日記のリンク元を見ていても、携帯Web検索から辿り着いた記録が去年から急激に増えていてる。
つまり、公式メニューから数ホップしかジャンプしないとか、2次元コードで読み取ったURLにジャンプするだけとか、メールで指定されたURLにジャンプするだけといった、「あまり遠くへ行かない」という旧来の携帯Webの使い方は廃れつつあり、PC世界のWebと同様に、適当に検索して目的サイトを探すという使い方が普及しつつある。
となると、フィッシング対策もPC同様に必要になってくるはずだ。フィッシングはメールで誘うものだけではない。検索サイトからたまたま流れ着いて来るのを待つという攻撃も現実にあり得る。これは単なる可能性の話ではなく、2005年6月にフィッシング犯の初の逮捕事例が出た際に、次の通り報道されている。
企業のホームページ（ＨＰ）に似せたサイトをインターネット上に設け、本物と思いこんでアクセスした利用者の個人情報を盗み取る「フィッシング」をしたとして、警視庁は１３日午前、大阪市に住む４０代前半の会社員の男を著作権法違反などの疑いで逮捕した。（略）
偽サイトは、本物のマークが「 ＹＡＨＯＯ！」であるのに対して「 ＹＡＦＯＯ！」としていた。 （略） 「ヤフー」と検索した際、検索結果の一覧で表示されたため、利用者は本物と誤信したらしい。
男は盗み取ったとみられる他人のＩＤ番号を使ってヤフーのサイトに接続した不正アクセス禁止法違反の疑いも持たれている。同庁は、約１週間に２０〜３０人分のデータを入手したとみている。

インターネット上でヤフーの偽サイトを開設し、個人情報を盗み取る「フィッシング」をしたとして著作権法違反などの疑いで逮捕された大阪市の会社員の男が、携帯電話向けにも同社の偽サイトを開設していたことが、警視庁の調べで分かった。同庁は、男がパソコン用のサイトと併設し、より多くのＩＤ番号とパスワードを入手しようとした疑いがあるとみている。

図のように、auでの検索結果は、「 EZweb 」 と「 携帯一般サイト 」 と「 PCサイト」の3つに分けて表示される。これらは上から順に同じページに並べられ、それぞれ数件ずつが表示される。
この検索結果で、右端 の「 PCサイト」の検索結果（最も下のブロックに表示される）では、トップに現れたのは本物の三井住友銀行であったが、中央の「携帯一般サイト」では、スラッシュドットジャパンのページがトップにヒットしてしまっている。これは、三井住友銀行が「携帯一般サイト」（ページ形式が携帯用で、かつ、インターネットからアクセスできるサイト）を提供していないために起きていると思われる。これはSEO不足というレベルでなく危険な状態にあると言える。
では、フィッシングのターゲットになりかねない組織はすべて、auが言うところの「携帯一般サイト」を用意しないといけないことになるのだろうか？
それも酷な話だろう。auのこのような機能の提供は不用意だと言うべきではないだろうか。
さらに、左端 の 「 EZweb」サイトにいたっては、「魔法のメロランド」などというどこの馬の骨ともわからない着メロサイトが「着うた：三井住友銀行」としてヒットしている。上から順に見ていくと（広告欄を除いて）最初に表示されるのはこの部分である。
現時点でも、検索結果は次のようになる。トップは「携帯先ATM（三井住友銀行）」というタイトルのソニー銀行のページ、2番目は「「 三井住友銀行」とは 無料 Wiki」というタイトルのGREEのページ、3番目は「イー・ローンで一歩先行くローン選び：三井住友銀行のローン一覧」というSBIホールディングズのページである。
しかも、 図1をよく見ると、「 携帯一般サイト 」 と「 PCサイト」の検索結果では、緑色で
「 http://slsashdot.jp/...」というようにリンク先のURLが表示されているのがわかるが、「EZwebの検索結果」にはなぜかそれが表示されない。
図 2のように、 「みずほ銀行」で検索すると、「無料Wiki」のサイトと「みずほ銀行」というタイトルのサイトがヒットするが、このサイトが何者なのかさっぱり不明だ。「東京三菱UFJ」で検索した場合は、トップには掲示板らしきものが現れるが、信用できるサイトなのかわからない。
つまり、 「 携帯一般サイト 」 と「 PCサイト 」 については 、 「 ジャンプ前にジャンプ先を確認するという」旧来の携帯Webの利用手順で利用できるのが、「EZweb」サイトについてはそれができないようになっている。アドレスバーを搭載しないのなら、事前にジャンプ先を確認できるようになっているべきところ、なぜ「EZweb」サイトだけわざわざその表示を隠すのか？
これは 「脆弱性」とまでは言えそうにないのでIPAには届け出ていないが、昨年12月から今年5月にかけて、3回ほど、「auお客様センター」に電話して、問題の所在と修正すべき点（「EZweb」サイトについてもURLを表示すること）を意見として伝えたが、半年経っても対処されていない。
「 auお客様センター」の言い分としては、「EZweb」（と検索結果で分類されている）ページは、EZwebの所謂「公式サイト」であり、一定の審査基準をパスしたサイトであるから、アドレスを表示する必要はないのだという。
「 一定の審査基準と言うが、どんな基準なのか見せて欲しい。公開していないのか？」と尋ねると、公開はしていないとのことで見せてもらえなかった。ざっと検索してみるとわけのわからないサイトがいっぱい「EZweb」サイトとして登録されているようだが、どのくらい信用できるものなのだろう？
仮に信用できるサイトだけが登録されているにしても、おそらくそれはサイト単位であって、ページ単位ではないだろう。もし、ページ内容を自由に記述できるユーザページを提供しているサイトが「EZweb」サイトとして登録されていれば、そこに偽サイトを作り込まれる可能性のある場合もあるのではないか。
結局、サイトが本物かどうかはユーザがドメイン名で確認するほかないのだから、ブラウザにアドレスバーを設ける
なり、ジャンプ先を常に表示するなりの対策を施すべきだ。
NTTドコモとソフトバンクモバイルがどうなっているかはまだ調べていない。
While I was traveling this past week , there was a conference held here entitled L- functions and Automorphic Forms , which was a celebration of the 60th birthday of my math department colleague Dorian Goldfeld .
From all I ’ve heard the conference was a great success , well attended , with lots of interesting talks .
But by far the biggest excitement was due to one talk in particular , that of Lucien Szpiro on “ Finiteness Theorems for Dynamical Systems ” .
Szpiro , a French mathematician who often used to be a visitor at Columbia , but is now permanently at the CUNY Graduate Center , claimed in his talk to have a proof of the abc conjecture ( although I gather that , due to Szpiro ’s low - key presentation , not everyone in the audience realized this … ) .
The abc conjecture is one of the most famous open problems in number theory .
There are various slightly different versions , here ’s one :
For each $ \epsilon >0 $ there exists a constant $ C_\epsilon $ such that , given any three positive co-prime integers a , b , c satisfying a+b=c , one has
$ $ c < C_ \epsilon R( abc ) ^ { 1+\epsilon} $ $ where $ R( abc ) $ is the product of all the primes that occur in a , b , c , each counted only once .
The abc conjecture has a huge number of implications , including Fermat ’s Last Theorem , as well as many important open questions in number theory .
Before the proof by Wiles , probably quite a few people thought that when and if Fermat was proved it would be proved by first proving abc .
For a very detailed web - site with information about the conjecture ( which leads off with a quotation from Dorian “ The abc conjecture is the most important unsolved problem in diophantine analysis ” ) , see here .
There are lots of expository articles about the subject at various levels , for two by Dorian , see here ( elementary ) and here ( advanced ) .
As far as I know , Szpiro does not yet have a manuscript with the details of the proof yet ready for distribution .
Since I was n’t at the talk I can only relay some fragmentary reports from people who were there .
Szpiro has been teaching a course last semester which dealt a bit with the techniques he has been working with , here ’s the syllabus which includes :
We will then introduced the canonical height associated to a dynamical system on the Riemann Sphere .
We will study such dynamical systems from an algebraic point of view .
In particular we will look at the dynamics associated to the multiplication by 2 in an elliptic curve .
We will relate these notions and the questions they raised to the abc conjecture and the Lehmer conjecture .
For more about these techniques , one could consult some of Szpiro ’s recent papers , available on his web - site .
The idea of his proof seems to be to use a and b to construct an elliptic curve E , then show that if abc is wrong you get an E with too many torsion points over quadratic extensions of the rational numbers .
The way he gets a bound on the torsion is by studying the “ algebraic dynamics ” given by the iterated map on the sphere coming from multiplication by 2 on the elliptic curve .
I ’m not clear about this , but it also seems that what Szpiro was proving was not quite the same thing as abc ( his exponent was larger than 1+ε , something which does n’t change many of the important implications ) .
Maybe someone else who was there can explain the details of the proof .
I suspect that quite a few experts are now looking carefully at Szpiro ’s arguments , and whether or not he actually has a convincing proof will become clear soon .
Update : I ’m hearing from some fairly authoritative sources that there appears to be a problem with Szpiro ’s proof .
An entire generation of Palestinians in Gaza is growing up stunted : physically and nutritionally stunted because they are not getting enough to eat ; emotionally stunted because of the pressures of living in a virtual prison and facing the constant threat of destruction and displacement ; intellectually and academically stunted because they cannot concentrate -- or , even if they can , because they are trying to study and learn in circumstances that no child should have to endure .
Even before Israel this week declared Gaza “ hostile territory ” -- apparently in preparation for cutting off the last remaining supplies of fuel and electricity to 1.5 million men , women and children -- the situation was dire .
As a result of Israel ’s blockade on most imports and exports and other policies designed to punish the populace , about 70 % of Gaza ’s workforce is now unemployed or without pay , according to the United Nations , and about 80 % of its residents live in grinding poverty .
About 1.2 million of them are now dependent for their day - to - day survival on food handouts from U.N. or international agencies , without which , as the World Food Program ’s Kirstie Campbell put it , “ they are liable to starve . ”
An increasing number of Palestinian families in Gaza are unable to offer their children more than one meager meal a day , often little more than rice and boiled lentils .
Fresh fruit and vegetables are beyond the reach of many families .
Meat and chicken are impossibly expensive .
Gaza faces the rich waters of the Mediterranean , but fish is unavailable in its markets because the Israeli navy has curtailed the movements of Gaza ’s fishermen .

Los Angeles parents who have spent the last few weeks running from one back - to - school sale to another could do worse than to spare a few minutes to think about their counterparts in the Gaza Strip .
As a result of the siege , Gaza is not only short of raw textiles and other key goods but also paper , ink and vital school supplies .
One - third of Gaza ’s children started the school year missing necessary textbooks .
John Ging , the Gaza director of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency , whose schools take care of 200,000 children in Gaza , has warned that children come to school “ hungry and unable to concentrate . ”
Israel says that its policies in Gaza are designed to put pressure on the Palestinian population to in turn put pressure on those who fire crude home - made rockets from Gaza into the Israeli town of Sderot .
Those rocket attacks are wrong .
But it is also wrong to punish an entire population for the actions of a few -- actions that the schoolchildren of Gaza and their beleagueredparents are in any case powerless to stop .
It is a violation of international law to collectively punish more than a million people for something they did not do .
According to the Geneva Convention , to which it is a signatory , Israel actually has the obligation to ensure the well - being of the people on whom it has chosen to impose a military occupation for more than four decades .
Instead , it has shrugged off the law .
It has ignored the repeated demands of the U.N. Security Council .
It has dismissed the International Court of Justice in the Hague .
What John Dugard , the U.N. 's special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied territories , refers to as the “ carefully managed ” strangulation of Gaza -- in full view of an uncaring world -- is explicitly part of its strategy .
“ The idea , ” said Dov Weisglass , an Israeli government advisor , “ is to put the Palestinians on a diet , but not make them die of hunger . ”

CRAWFORD , Texas —
Six weeks after announcing her departure from the peace movement , Cindy Sheehan said Sunday that she plans to run against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unless she introduces articles of impeachment against President Bush in the next two weeks .
Sheehan said she will run against the San Francisco Democrat in 2008 as an independent if Pelosi does not seek by July 23 to oust Bush .
That ’s when Sheehan and her supporters are to arrive in Washington , D.C. , after a 13 - day caravan and walking tour starting from the group ’s war protest site near Bush ’s Crawford ranch .
“ Democrats and Americans feel betrayed by the Democratic leadership , ” Sheehan told The Associated Press .
“ We hired them to bring an end to the war .
I ’m not too far from San Francisco , so it would n’t be too big of a move for me .
I would give her a run for her money . ”

What You Required To Understand About Bid Bonds in Construction
Our surety bonds group is a full - service , across the country surety bonding company , licensed in every U.S. state .
The total amount of a bid bond is identified in relation to the amount of the contract .
A quote bond ’s complete quantity typically does not surpass 5 - 10 % of the total quantity of the agreement .
You ’ll not lose your bond if you withdraw your quote earlier than the developer opens it .
You will lose your Bid Bond in case you withdraw your quote after you ’ve gotten been awarded the contract .
A Guide to bid bonds in the U.S .
Nice American ’s appeal for financial power and stability and its devotion to private and continuous service is particularly vital to brokers with building accounts .
A lot of quote bonds consist of a money deposit , which is subject to complete or partial loss if the lucrative contractor stops working to both carry out the contract ( or develop a cost bond or performance bond – depending upon how the quote course of is structured ) .
The bid bond assures that , needs to the bidder accomplish success , they ’ll indicate the deal and provide the required surety bond .
To put it merely , these bonds are used as financial security for agreement quote propositions – specifically for giant projects such as business advancements .
With out submitting the needed bond , a contractor ’s bid will routinely be disqualified from the bidding course of .
For the Contractor merely in search of building and construction bond assist , South Coast Surety will provide you the instruments and information required to understand a surety bond credit line score .
Information To Bid Bonds For Professionals
A quote warranty is a kind of security guaranteeing that the bidder will not withdraw a quote throughout the interval defined for approval and will carry out a composed contract and provide necessary bonds , together with any obligatory coinsurance or reinsurance arrangements , inside the time defined within the quote , unless a longer time is allowed , after invoice of the preferred types .
A bid warranty often incorporate a firm commitment comparable to a bid bond , licensed validate , or different negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as guarantee that the bidder should , upon approval of the quote , carry out such contractual files as may be needed inside the time defined .
Quote guarantees are generally needed to be in a quantity equivalent to 5 p.c of the quantity quote .
As talked about above , the required bid request kind asks for agreement details such because the job worth breakdown , that includes profits , supplies , labor , subcontractors and overhead .
When trying to record in a paper system , providing these information can be troublesome and confusing .
That is the place building quote software application is available in ; it can be used to estimate your agreement expenses and consider and manage your company ’s most necessary metrics Utilizing the power of software application will offer you with a better probability at winning the efforts you require .
A Quote Bond , issued by a Surety in your behalf , is for the great thing about an Obligee .
Generally Bid Bonds are economical .
Usually , the performance bond expenses in between 1 % and 5 % of the worth of the “ penal sum , ” which is the quantity that the surety will require to pay to the obligee in case the contractor breaches the contract .
Research On Authorization of Surety for a Bid Bond
Private building contracts hardly ever require explicit bond language .
Rather , they often need bonds in a defined quantity with a surety appropriate to the owner , general specialist or other obligee .
The AIA ’s bond types , AIA Files A - 311 and A - 312 , are instructional and favored ; thus their arrangements benefit a brief discussion .
Additionally utilized at the Tender Stage , the Approval of Surety ( often referred to as an Settlement to Bond ) is an enterprise by the Surety to offer Performance and Labor & Product Payment Bonds for the Professional if their tender is accepted by the Owner and a written contract got in into .
The Approval of Surety is a commitment solely made by the Surety .
It is really important observe , nevertheless , this does not guarantee the Contractor will enter into the agreement .
A Guide For You about Bid Bonds and Building And Construction Contracts
Within the United States , beneath the Miller Act of 1932 , all Building Agreements provided by the Federal Authorities must be backed by Efficiency and cost bonds .
States have actually enacted what is understood as ” Little Miller Act ” statutes requiring efficiency and fee bonds on State Funded efforts as correctly .
If , upon examination , the surety declares the power of lawyer to have actually been legitimate at the time of bid opening , the contracting officer might require correction of any technical error .
Another way surety firms can remain inside their authorized surety underwriting limitation , and spread their threat , is to get coinsurance or reinsurance , wherein they essentially receive an agreement from one other surety company to cowl a part of their threat on the bond they have actually provided .
When a surety gets reinsurance for part of its danger under a Miller Act bond , it needs to go through the contracting officer a reinsurance settlement for a Miller Act performance bond and a reinsurance settlement for a Miller Act cost bond .
The regards to both reinsurance arrangements are stated in the policies .
Building And Construction Surety Bonds In Plain English
Generally utilized within the building market , but additionally appropriate to several non-construction legal relationships , contract surety bonds safeguard the Owner ( referred to as the Obligee ” or beneficiary ) from financial loss in case the Specialist ( the Principal ” ) stops working to meet their contractual commitments with the Proprietor .
A quote bond does n’t listing the United States as obligee , but appropriately determines the offeror , the solicitation number , and the determine and location of the undertaking involved , as long as it is acceptable in all various respects .
At the Building and construction Stage , upon execution of a composed contract in between the Specialist and the Owner , a Performance Bond safeguards the Owner from financial loss ought to the Contractor stop working to carry out the Agreement in accordance with the legal commitment .
While usually asked for by the Proprietor within the amount of 50 % of the distinct agreement worth , the bond will also be issued for as much as one hundred % .
The Surety is just not accountable for more than the whole amount of the bond .
Why Company Requirements To Be Concerned With Bid Bonds and Building And Construction Arrangements
( b) When a brand brand - new surety bond is licensed , the contracting officer will inform the principal and surety of the special bond of the effective date of the new bond .
Public Key Infrastructure ( PKI ) is a critical technology in today 's computer oriented world .
Without it there would be no secure e-commerce transactions or secure connections .
Remember the days when clear - text passwords regularly flew across the Net ?
That 's history now due to the increasing diligence of " bad people " sniffing the Net , looking for potential security loopholes to exploit .
These days , paranoia is the normal state for computer security , and PKI plays a role in helping to ease that paranoia .
PKI provides a high level of protection by allowing the signing of e-mails , encryption of sockets and other cryptographic functions .
A large standards base has evolved around PKI , and the open - source domain has taken on the task of implementing those standards to a high degree .
PKI is based on the now well known public / private key - pair interaction .
In this interaction a public / private key - pair is generated , and the public - key is used by external entities to verify data signed or encrypted by the private key .
The private - key is held securely by the owner .
The key can be held secure by a passphrase on either an encrypted file or a hardware token .
Another important component of PKI is a certificate ( X.509 format ) , a document that is signed by a known authority ( known as a certificate authority or CA ) and says the originator of the public - key is who they really say they are .
In order to obtain a valid certificate , the key - pair owner must sign a certificate request using their private - key and send it to the CA .
The certificate request provides the certificate authority with information about the owner of the key and a copy of the public - key .
Integrating a Token With this background , I can start explaining our adventure with PKI .
A client wanted to provide digitally signed e-mails for critical data originating from a Linux PC .
The critical data had to arrive at a site and be assured that it originated from a given Linux PC .
The client needed to perform this task using S/ MIME , a standard designed for this purpose ( see glossary ) .
The client also wanted to use a hardware cryptographic token for security reasons .
Hardware tokens are nearly tamper proof and assure that the data are originating from a given Linux PC provided that the token is plugged into it .
Tamper switches on the PC and the token prevented either from being moved without authorities ' knowledge .
Since my company prefers to start with open source tools , rather than dive into proprietary libraries or write new code from the " ground up " , we quickly discovered the OpenSSL project .
The OpenSSL project supported almost all of the necessary components needed to complete our client 's project .
I say almost all , otherwise our story would have ended here and proven rather boring .
The client required the ability to store a 1,024 - bit DSA private - key on a specific PCMCIA - based hardware token , generate a certificate request and then , using the certificate and the private - key , clear sign an e-mail using the S / MIME format .
As luck would have it , back in September 2000 , the OpenSSL project released version 0.9.6 and a parallel release that included an engine component .
The engine component caught our eye because it dealt with using cryptographic hardware tokens .
Sadly , the token we were requested to integrate , the Chrysalis - ITS Luna2 PC card , was not on the list of the three tokens implemented in the engine .
This forced us to go under the hood of the OpenSSL engine code .
Chrysalis-ITS provided our client with the libraries needed to interact with their token under both Solaris and Linux and the OpenSSL code - base compiles for both .
Chrysalis-ITS 's Luna2 toolkit library is based on the PKCS # 11 standard that is documented by RSA Laboratories .
The PKCS # 11 is a C/C++ programming standard library for using a cryptographic hardware token with public - key technology .
A quick e-mail to the author of the OpenSSL engine component , Geoff Thorpe , confirmed that it would be possible to use a PKCS # 11 library with the way the engine was designed .
Unfortunately , none of the other 3 cards implemented in the engine were using this standard library ( they all had proprietary libraries ) , so we had to develop an engine implementation without any example code .
Actually , it is not true that we did n't have any example code to work with ; we had access to the implementations for the other three hardware tokens .
We also had done some work with the PKCS # 11 library for the Luna2 token .
However , each of these other hardware tokens used RSA ( see glossary ) and not DSA as the cryptographic mechanism .
It seems RSA is the more prevalent method because it is a stronger cryptographic mechanism than DSA .
One step forward with an example , but two steps backward since none implemented DSA .
However , the CryptoSwift token implementation in OpenSSL , by Geoff Thorpe , did provide a DSA acceleration , so this was the best starting point to implement a solution for the Luna2 .
It 's interesting to watch different people 's approaches to integrating systems .
Some like to sit down and spend time reading manuals , and others like to dive in and get into the guts .
I am one of the latter types .
Rather than rely on reading volumes of manuals to understand how something is glued together , I prefer to run through the code with a debugger ( ups is my particular favorite open source debugger ) .
That way I can step in and out of all the functions , look at structures and see all the details being passed around .
Once I get a handle on how it all glues together , I proceed to the manuals to get more specifics on code not presented clearly .
While the OpenSSL project is doing a great job , some of the documentation on the cryptographic library ( libcrypto ) is a bit sparse .
After testing the command line OpenSSL interface by running all of the tasks , without using the engine ( using only text files holding the keys ) , I had a pretty good understanding of the way it was pieced together .
I next implemented the necessary engine structures for the token and tied the PKCS # 11 calls to the appropriate functions .
The only conversions necessary were the data types from the native PKCS # 11 data into the OpenSSL values .
The tricky part was binding all of the necessary PKCS # 11 function calls dynamically at run time to the OpenSSL engine .
The EMI Group , the British music giant , has been considering a plan to offer a broad swath of its recordings for sale online without anti-copying software , executives involved in discussions with the company said .
EMI , which releases music by artists including Coldplay and the Beatles , has discussed various proposals to sell unprotected files through an array of digital retailers , including Apple , Microsoft , Real Networks and Yahoo , said the executives , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
EMI declined to comment .
It is far from clear that the company , which has tested the concept recently by selling a song from Norah Jones in unprotected form , will reach a deal .
But if it does , it would be the first of the four major music companies to distribute its catalog without software designed to limit copying .
Because various online retailers use different forms of security software , known as digital - rights management , their services are not always compatible with all music - playing devices on the market .
The human brain is extremely difficult to study , especially when a person is still alive .
Without euthanizing their subjects , the closest that researchers can get to seeing what goes on in there is through a functional M.R.I. machine , which measures the size and shape of the brain and , unlike a standard M.R.I. machine , tracks blood flow and electrical activity .
This spring , neuroscientists at Columbia University in New York City published a study in which a group of men and women , ranging in age from 21 to 45 , began working out for one hour four times a week .
After 12 weeks , the test subjects , predictably , became more fit .
Their VO2 max , the standard measure of how much oxygen a person takes in while exercising , rose significantly .
But something else happened as a result of all those workouts : blood flowed at a much higher volume to a part of the brain responsible for neurogenesis .
Functional M.R.I.’s showed that a portion of each person ’s hippocampus received almost twice the blood volume as it did before .
Scientists suspect that the blood pumping into that part of the brain was helping to produce fresh neurons .
The hippocampus plays a large role in how mammals create and process memories ; it also plays a role in cognition .
If your hippocampus is damaged , you most likely have trouble learning facts and forming new memories .
Age plays a factor , too .
As you get older , your brain gets smaller , and one of the areas most prone to this shrinkage is the hippocampus .
( This can start depressingly early , in your 30’s . )
Many neurologists believe that the loss of neurons in the hippocampus may be a primary cause of the cognitive decay associated with aging .
A number of studies have shown that people with Alzheimer ’s and other forms of dementia tend to have smaller - than - normal hippocampi .
The Columbia study suggests that shrinkage to parts of the hippocampus can be slowed via exercise .
The subjects showed significant improvements in memory , as measured by a word - recall test .
Those with the biggest increases in VO2 max had the best scores of all .
“ It ’s reasonable to infer , though we ’re not yet certain , that neurogenesis was happening in the people ’s hippocampi , ” says Scott A. Small , an associate professor of neurology at Columbia and the senior author of the study , “ and that working out was driving the neurogenesis . ”
Other recent studies support this theory .
At the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , a group of elderly sedentary people were assigned to either an aerobic exercise program or a regimen of stretching .
( The aerobic group walked for at least one hour three times a week . )
After six months , their brains were scanned using an M.R.I .
Those who had been doing aerobic exercise showed significant growth in several areas of the brain .
These results raise the hope that the human brain has the capacity not only to produce new cells but also to add new blood vessels and strengthen neural connections , allowing young neurons to integrate themselves into the wider neural network .
“ The current findings are the first , to our knowledge , to confirm the benefits of exercise training on brain volume in aging humans , ” the authors concluded .
Thoughts on a very British banking crisis at Northern Rock
As I write , people are queuing outside a major British lender , Northern Rock , to take all their money out .
Only in Britain would a run on a bank see customers forming an orderly line from the back .
Reading comments in the press , it ’s clearly something that many people never expected to see in their lifetimes .
Certainly , frightened customers demanding their money from a bank they fear is going bust is a scene you ’d more expect to see in black - and - white images from the 1930s rather than on the Six O’Clock News on a flatscreen TV .
But that never meant it could n’t happen .
Indeed , the belief that instability and crisis is something that only ever occurred in some unreal yesterday is exactly why financial markets turn in cycles ( if you wait long enough ) and crises repeat themselves ( if you read back enough ) .
Is it blind panic to take your money out of Northern Rock ?
Not necessarily .
Perhaps many Northern Rock savers are panicking , but taking your money out is also a perfectly rational choice .
Just because it walks like a lemming and jumps off a cliff like a lemming , it does n’t mean it is a lemming .
What secured the hapless lemmings ’ reputation was a Disney movie , White Wilderness , which appeared to show the beasties leaping off a glacier to their doom .
In reality , it was footage of rather callous film - makers hurling their just - purchased lemmings into the sea .
The lemming then is a more complicated creature than it first appears .
As is this unfolding credit crisis .
Why should I leave my cash in a riskier operation when there are safer alternatives available ( such as the 100 % secure and government - backed National Savings ) ?
After all , this credit crisis is a direct result of bankers themselves not trusting each other enough to lend .
Moreover , unlike the banks , everyday savers who do decide to leave their money in Northern Rock are not receiving any benefit ( such as higher interest rates ) for taking on the extra risk that ’s emerged that they could lose some of their savings .
Equally , why should I wait for another bank to step in to acquire Northern Rock and ensure the security of deposits when I can secure my cash myself ?
Sure , in the doomsday scenario most Northern Rock savers would get most of their money back – indeed very probably above and beyond the Financial Services Compensation Scheme ’s £ 35,000 limit , for reasons of national interest .
But why take the risk ?
It could well be a pain claiming and then waiting for compensation .
Who knows ?
We have n’t had people queuing in the streets outside banks for generations .
We ’re into unknown territory .
What does a depositor owe Northern Rock ?
Banks have ceaselessy encouraged us to jump ship with great rates for new customers , whilst shafting existing customers by letting the interest paid on their older accounts dwindle away to nothing , and even refusing to move their money into the higher rate ‘ teaser ’ accounts if they do happen to notice .
They ’ve turned banking into another branch of Buyrite Britain PLC .
Well , if you live by the sword , you die by the sword .
Indeed , it ’s almost amusing that a company that ’s trailblazed a new banking model / carelessly abandoned centuries old banking practices ( take your pick ) is now asking its customers to loyally stand by it .
Rightly or wrongly , banks no longer care for customers in the old - style paternal way .
Why should customers care about a bank ?
Adam Applegarth , Northern Rock ’s chief executive , has had the funniest line of the crisis so far :
“ The media coverage makes it look as if the Bank [ of England ] has pulled up a dumper truck and dumped cash in . ”
Er , yes it does .
But whose fault is that ?
There are people queuing in the streets outside your branches , Mr Applegarth .
They ca n’t all be BBC reporters .
Publicly at least , Northern Rock does n’t seem to grasp that its vulnerability has come about because of its business model .
A banker might very well say : “ Ah , but we ’re in a credit crunch , normal money market conditions are n’t like this at all ” .
But surely one of the cornerstones of a national bank should be that it has the financial strength to withstand ALL reasonable conditions ?
Most UK lenders are n’t suffering near - fatal duress , despite the credit crunch , because most ( though not all ) banks follow a relatively sounder business model .
For most , these are unusual but not life - threatening conditions .
You do n’t have to bank on it
I do n’t see why for its depositors , Northern Rock ’s position is any different to me as a small businessman waving overdue but unpaid invoices at a worried creditor and asking them to trust me .
A potential cashflow shortfall is a potential cashflow shortfall for any company , whether it ’s a bank or a lemonade stall .
However you dress up Northern Rock ’s position , the fact is it went to the Bank of England because at some point in the future it might not have had sufficient capital to meet its obligations .
As such , the bank ’s problems are only guaranteed to be temporary because the Bank of England has agreed to stand behind it .
When a lemonade stall looks like it might run out of money – despite having copious stocks of lemons and plenty of customers – the stallholder is to blame for badly managing his business .
Whereas when it happens to a bank manager , he seemingly believes it ’s appropriate to blame butterflies in California flapping their wings .
Do n’t be embarrassed about moving your money out of Northern Rock .
It will almost certainly prove unnecessary , but your finances are your responsibility and you should do what you feel is best .
The pundits now calling you a lemming will be just as quick to laugh if the bank goes bust .

“ Off the rocker ” agents prevailed since the safety margins for other agents , including anaesthetic agents , sedatives , and opiate analgesics , were not considered sufficiently wide for them to perform as ‘ safe ’ military incapacitating agents .
Writing in 1971 , Perry - Robinson noted :
*“ The psychomimetics in fact seem to be one of the very few classes of incapacitating drug which have sufficient selectivity to give a wide enough margin of safety .
Some of them are sufficiently potent for CW purposes . ” *
In fact , it looks like the military are all set to start deploying a new generation of – well , as the report points out , they carefully avoid calling them chemical weapons .
The preferred terms are nonlethal techniques , riot control agents , or , more commonly , calmatives .
How ’s that ?
Calmative originally meant something quite specific , but researchers at the Army ’s Edgewood Chemical Biological Center have started using their own definition :
A calmative agent can be defined as an antipersonnel chemical that leaves the victim awake and mobile but without the will or ability to meet military objectives or carry out criminal activity .
So anything from tear gas to LSD to a dozen tequilas would count as a calmative .
However , although the report describes work looking at a whole range of substances including THC ( the active ingredient in cannabis ) , LSD , PCP , Valium and Ketamine - as well as ' selected club drugs ' - the biggest development recently seems to have been in the area of Fentanyl derivatives .
Fentanyl is an opiate which was used as an intravenous analgesic in the 1960’s .
It ’s classified as a narcotic in the US , with effects said to be similar to heroin .
It ’s first known use a weapon was in the Moscow Theater siege , when a Fentanyl derivative called Kolokol - 1 ( believed to be carfentanil ) was pumped into the building .
All of the terrorists were overpowered without firing a shot , but over a hundred hostages died as a result of respiratory depression .
US work is said to involve a Fentanyl derivative combined with an antagonist which will counter the respiratory depression .
According to the Bradford report , it may already be in use :
Since the 2003 National Research Council ( NRC ) report confirming renewed US Military research on incapacitating agents there has been no further openly available information on the programme , due to likely classification of the ongoing work … .
It is unclear whether these types of chemical weapons can now be accessed for US military operations .
Two unconfirmed reports in 2003 quoted Rear Admiral Stephen Baker , the Navy 's former Chief of Operational Testing and Evaluation , as saying that US Special Forces had “ knock - out ” gases available for use in Iraq .
By a bizarre coincidence , the report comes outjust as we 're getting stories of campers being rendered unconscious by thieves using some sort of gas , but that 's probably just a silly season story .
Any such gas is probably in ( fairly ) safe hands .
Stay calm .... but do n't overdo it .
Online gambling is gaining momentum because there are so many people passionate about playing online casino games .
It ’s easy to understand why this industry is so popular today .
Players get the chance to win millions just by playing their favorite casino game .
When asked why they visit online gambling websites , many players say their monthly income is supplemented by their gambling winnings and their level of stress decreases by having so much fun after a hard day at work .
The online gambling industry was worth $ 41.4 billion in 2015 and it ’s growing .
There are so many branches that it ’s hard not to find a game that you like .
Some like the stories told by themed slot games while others want to use their skills and not leave it all to fate .
Either way , success comes if you practice responsible gambling .
Otherwise , you will come down a slippery slope and you risk addiction .
Luckily , these cases are rare and most online casino players are very satisfied and keep coming back to their favorite website .
Be it a themed popular slot game or one of the classics ( poker , roulette , blackjack etc. ) , casino games are played by both men and women of all ages .
Underage gambling is an important issue that our society deals with .
That ’s why reputed online casinos take certain measures to lower the number of minors involved in gambling .
For all of you who are at least 18 years old , it ’s so convenient to play online casino games instead of wasting your time in land based casinos .
There are plenty of people who make a living out of online gambling .
This certainly contradicts the phrase that “ the house always wins . ”
It ’s a myth that should no longer be promoted because it makes many people dismiss the idea of online gambling instantly thus preventing them from winning a lot of money .
Will it ever stop ?
Years after his death , President Richard Nixon ’s secrets keep rising from the archives — as the latest batch did just last week .
With the release of each classified memo and secretly recorded tape , more is learned about the inner workings of the Nixon White House — and of the people who advised a polarizing president at one of the most divisive times in modern political history .
People like Billy Graham , the Montreat - based , world - famous evangelist .
Graham has offered his personal counsel to every president — Democrat and Republican — since Harry S. Truman , and has always maintained that his advices were n’t intended to sway the body politic .
For example , at a 1980 press conference , he said , “ People took for granted that I was for Eisenhower , they took for granted that I was for Lyndon Johnson , they took for granted that I was for Nixon , and they were right , but I did n’t endorse them openly in public . ”
But behind closed doors , Graham was closer to some presidents than to others , and may have been closest of all to Nixon .
Previous declassifications have revealed much back - and - forth between the preacher and the president .
Now still more of their correspondence has gone public :
On July 11 — when the Nixon Presidential Library passed from control by private backers to the U.S. National Archives — the library released 78,000 pages of previously secret documents , along with 11 - and - a - half hours of recordings .
A selection of the documents posted on the library ’s Web site ( view them at www.nixon.archives.gov/virtuallibrary/documents) includes five dealing directly with Graham .
The papers — and at least one of the recordings — reveal back - room discussions about how Graham could best buoy Nixon ’s bid for reelection in 1972 , and suggest that Graham was a willing , if sometimes conflicted , player in the strategizing .
Among the key disclosures :
• The black vote : In a Dec. 30 , 1969 , memo , Nixon instructed White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman to “ follow up with Billy Graham in his work with Negro ministers across the country .
He feels this is our best chance to make inroads into the Negro community .
I am inclined to agree with him . ”
( In his posthumously published diaries , Haldeman wrote on July 11 , 1972 , that Graham “ feels we have a good chance on the blacks by splitting them and getting the religious blacks who are scared of the criminal elements and so on to come over to our side . ” )
• Evangelical politics :
In a prescient letter to Nixon on Aug. 4 , 1972 , Graham predicted the rise of the Christian right as a potent political force .
He enclosed a Los Angeles Times article reporting on a study that indicated “ the presidential candidate whose values seem closest to that of the Rev. Billy Graham stands the best chance to win in November . ”
Graham suggested that Nixon read the article because it “ emphasize[s ] what I have been pointing out to you in a number of conversations we have had that there is an emerging evangelical strength in the country that is going to have a strong bearing on social and political matters probably for a generation to come . ”
• Nixon vs. McGovern :
In the same letter , Graham offered up some advice for Nixon ’s reelection bid against Democrat George McGovern .
“ I would seriously question the wisdom of your becoming personally involved in the campaign before early September , ” Graham advised .
“ If the polls and the mood of the country continue as is you may be wise to do only a minimum of campaigning .
I think Senator McGovern is perfectly capable of making further mistakes . ”
• A lost prayer : A mere three days after penning those campaign tips , Graham called the White House to discuss a potentially thorny matter — a request by a prominent Democrat for a public show of support from the evangelist .
On Aug. 7 , 1972 , Deputy Assistant to the President Alexander P. Butterfield wrote a “ CONFIDENTIAL / PERSONAL ” memo for the files titled “ Telephone Call from Reverend Billy Graham . ”
In it , he recounted that Graham had called concerning a “ strictly personal ” matter : a request from his longtime friend Sargent Shriver to lead a prayer at Shriver ’s acceptance speech as the Democrat ’s vice - presidential candidate .
Graham , Butterfied noted , hoped to strike a “ bipartisan posture ” — “ at least until about October , ” when he could , if need be , “ throw his support to the side of the President more effectively . ”
The minister “ went on to say that he was truly in a quandary about what to do and that he very much wanted the President ’s personal advice , ” and that “ he would abide by any decision made at this end of the line — that he would do nothing to hurt the President or to help McGovern . ”
Butterfield took the question to Nixon .
“ The President listened carefully , then answered firmly , ‘ He should not do it [ give the prayer for Shriver ] , ” the memo says .
“ ‘ You should call him back and tell him that it would be tantamount to his having attended the Democratic National Convention . ’ ”
Butterfield then relayed Nixon ’s answer in two phone calls to Graham , who , according to the memo , ultimately responded , “ Fine .
Then , that ’s exactly what I will do . ”
• Nixon ’s “ morality issue ” :
One of the newly released tapes is of a phone call on Nov. 3 , 1972 — four days before the election — in which White House Special Counsel Chuck Colson gave Nixon a detailed status report on numerous campaign issues .
“ Billy Graham ’s thing has moved very well — his statement supporting us , supporting you , on the integrity and on the morality issue , ” Colson told the president .
“ He came through very well . ”
Cryptic species – animals that appear identical but are genetically quite distinct – may be much more widespread than previously thought .
The findings could have major implications in areas ranging from biodiversity estimates and wildlife management , to our understanding of infectious diseases and evolution .
Reports of cryptic species have increased dramatically over the past two decades with the advent of relatively inexpensive DNA sequencing technology .
Markus Pfenninger and Klaus Schwenk , of the Goethe - Universitat in Frankfurt , Germany , analysed all known data on cryptic animal species and discovered that they are found in equal proportions throughout all major branches of the animal kingdom and occur in equal numbers in all biogeographical regions .
Scientists had previously speculated that cryptic species were predominantly found in insects and reptiles , and were more likely to occur in tropical rather than temperate regions ( see Trends in Ecology and Evolution , vol 22 , p 148 ) .

“ Species that are seemingly widespread and abundant could in reality be many different cryptic species that have low populations and are highly endangered , ” says Pfenninger .
Until the genetic information of all species in at least one taxon is thoroughly studied , no one will know just how many cryptic species exist .
“ It could be as high as 30 % , ” Pfenninger says .
Call to arms
“ I ’m flabbergasted by their results , ” says Alex Smith of the University of Guelph in Ontario , Canada .
“ It ’s a call to arms to keep doing the broad kind of genetic studies that we are doing . ”
Smith is a part of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life , an international effort to map a unique genetic “ barcode ” for all species on earth .
Sampling as many individuals as possible , they hope to complete work on all fish and birds in another 5 to 10 years .
Once either of these taxonomic groups is completed , Pfenninger says researchers will able to extrapolate how many cryptic species exist throughout the animal kingdom .
Examples of cryptic species include the African elephant .
A 2001 study found the elephants were actually two genetically distinct , non-interbreeding species , the African bush elephant and the African elephant .
The species are currently listed as vulnerable and threatened , respectively , by the World Conservation Union .
In the case of the neotropical skipper butterfly , genetic testing revealed the “ species ” was actually 10 distinct cryptic species .
Mistaken mosquitoes
The reclassifications are more than an academic exercise .
They define populations that have evolved independently of each other and whose genetic differences can have significant consequences .
In the early 1900s misidentification of mosquito species based on morphology confounded attempts to control malaria in Europe .
Ultimately , what was thought to be a single species was actually made up of six sibling species , only three of which transmitted the disease .
“ The basic unit in biology is always the species , and you have to know what you are dealing with , ” Pfenninger says .
Much previous research is now obsolete , he says , because it is not clear what species was being studied .
Pfenninger is now trying to determine whether cryptic differentiation is simply an early stage of morphological differentiation – but preliminary results suggest not .

Three months after Congress failed to pass a broad immigration overhaul , lawmakers are quietly returning to the hot - button issue , discussing narrower measures that address illegal immigrants and low - skilled laborers .
Already , critics are promising fireworks .
As early as this week , Democratic senators are set to introduce an amendment that would give conditional legal status to young illegal immigrants .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) hopes to bring up a visa program that eventually would allow farmhands to gain citizenship , whereas Republican senators are discussing a short - term guest worker program for low - skilled laborers .
Advertisement
Republicans also are considering a bill that would overhaul visas for high - skilled foreigners .
In the House , Republicans have been steadily introducing initiatives aimed at ensuring that illegal immigrants could not gain access to federal benefits .
“ We may be heading for another immigration battle , ” Sen . Jeff Sessions ( R - Ala . ) said of the measures headed for the Senate floor .
“ Hopefully it can be avoided . ”

After the Senate failed in June to pass the broad immigration bill , rebuffing President Bush , who supported it , many on Capitol Hill predicted the issue would lie fallow until after the 2008 presidential election .
But that has not been the case .
The Bush administration in August unveiled a roster of aggressive enforcement initiatives , provoking a legal challenge from labor and business groups and outrage from immigrant advocates .
The Department of Homeland Security has continued its stepped - up raids on work sites that use illegal laborers , and in August it deported a high - profile illegal immigrant activist who had spent months in a Chicago church , declaring it a sanctuary .
Immigrant groups nationwide have staged vigils , protests and letter - writing campaigns to demand changes in policy .
Groups that want to limit immigration also have kept a sharp eye on Congress , on the lookout for any attempts to pass what they view as “ amnesty ” -- proposals that would open the way to legalization for illegal immigrants .
Since the comprehensive bill ’s failure , some of the focus on immigration has served political goals .
Advertisement
Republican senators quickly brought up an enforcement bill , a hit with their conservative base .
The Democratic - sponsored measures generally appeal to Latino voters .
Staff members from both parties say immigration - related amendments could turn up on any major piece of legislation expected to pass .
Some of the measures now in the works do n’t have much bipartisan support , limiting their chances of success .
And some lawmakers express doubts that it is possible to restructure the immigration system through separate bills rather than sweeping legislation .
“ I ’m personally very skeptical of a piecemeal approach , ” said Sen. Mel Martinez ( R - Fla . ) , a member of the bipartisan coalition that tried to pass the overhaul earlier this year .
“ The hardest thing to do . . . is take care of ” the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S.
“ The minute we start doing the easy things , like taking care of agribusiness interests because they need the workers , . . . then we ’re leaving the hard things ” unaddressed .
The central conflict that tripped up the comprehensive bill remains the question of whether illegal immigrants should be given the chance to earn legal status .
That question will be an issue in at least two of the measures headed for the Senate .
Advertisement
The first to come up is expected to be the “ Dream Act , ” a bill championed by Sen. Richard J. Durbin ( D - Ill. ) that would give conditional legal status to immigrants brought to the U.S. at a young age .
To qualify under it , they must have been in the country for at least five years , have a high school diploma and meet other requirements .
Over the next six years , they would have to spend two years in college or the military , after which they could become legal permanent residents , a step toward citizenship .
Durbin plans to attach the bill as an amendment to a defense funding measure scheduled to come before the Senate today , his staff said .
The bill has broad support , prompting immigration restrictionist groups to send alerts warning that the Senate was planning “ to pass an amnesty act by hiding language in the defense authorization bill . ”

Feinstein has championed an AgJobs program with increasing intensity as farms have struggled to find labor .
The program would allow up to 1.5 million agricultural workers to gain legal status through a “ blue card , ” provided they did farm work for a certain number of days every year .
Those who met the criteria could apply for legal permanent resident status after five years .
The bill ’s prospects are uncertain .
Feinstein lost a crucial AgJobs ally when Sen. Larry E. Craig ( R - Idaho ) recently announced he would resign because of the scandal surrounding his arrest in a Minneapolis airport restroom .
In July , Feinstein and Craig had won a commitment from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) that the AgJobs proposal would be considered , possibly as an amendment to the farm bill expected to be debated in the early fall .
“ We know that virtually all of the agricultural workforce is undocumented , ” Feinstein said .
“ Today there are shortages .
. . .
AgJobs is a pilot program that would provide a reliable workforce to plant and harvest crops in this country . ”
Advertisement
Sessions is actively campaigning against both Durbin and Feinstein ’s initiatives , arguing that the two proposals would give more than 4 million illegal immigrants eventual citizenship .
He said he would support a plan under discussion among Republicans , including Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - Texas ) , to create a version of AgJobs that would limit workers to short - term stays in the U.S. and not provide any kind of longer - term legal status .
Stripping legalization provisions from a farm worker program would vastly increase its chances of passing , Republicans say .
“ The question is , what is it going to take to . . . get anything moving in order to reform ” the existing farm guest worker program ?
asked a Republican Senate aide .
Advertisement
“ In order to do that , you have to recognize that this is the issue that the immigration bill failed on , the issue of amnesty . ”
Senate Republicans are also discussing ways to increase the number of visas for high - skilled workers , now capped at 65,000 a year .
In the House , Republicans have continued the effort they pushed when they controlled the chamber last year -- keeping the immigration debate focused on enforcement measures .
Republican lawmakers have introduced amendments to ban illegal immigrants from receiving federal benefits -- something that is already law -- to a range of bills , including a federal housing measure scheduled for debate this week .

CNN : Mystery 9/11 aircraft was military ' doomsday plane ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Shortly before 10 am on the morning of September 11 , 2001 , amid rumors of a fourth hijacked plane headed for Washington , DC , a mystery aircraft appeared in restricted airspace over the White House .
There has never been an official explanation for this incident , which has provided abundant fuel for 9/11 conspiracy theories .
CNN has now learned from two government sources that the mystery plane was a military aircraft and has determined that the blurry image on video appears to match photos of the Air Force 's E - 4B ( discussed here on Wikipedia ) , a specially modified Boeing 747 with a communications pod behind the cockpit .
" The E - 4B is a state of the art flying command post , " CNN explained , " built and equipped for one reason -- to keep the government running no matter what , even in the event of a nuclear war , the reason it was nicknamed the ' doomsday plane ' during the Cold War . "
9/11 Commission co-chair Lee Hamilton told CNN he was aware of the incident and that it had simply never seemed important enough to make it into the commission 's report .
He called conspiracy theories involving government complicity in 9/11 " ludicrous . "
The plane was previously identified as the E - 4B a year ago by one researcher on a forum associated with the 9/11 conspiracy film , Loose Change .
CNN acknowledges that , despite its identification , the absence of the aircraft from official investigations , together with the Pentagon 's denial that it was a military plane and the insistence by the Pentagon , Secret Service , and FAA that they have no explanation for the incident , may continue to raise suspicions .
The following video is from CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 , broadcast on September 12 .
Mirror copy of video :
The United States government has almost perfected a method of intervention that is able to penetrate and infiltrate all sectors of civil society in a country which it deems to be of economic and strategic interest .
In the case of Venezuela , this strategy began to take form in 2002 , with the increase in financing of sectors of the opposition via the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) and the opening of an Office of Transition Initiatives ( OTI ) of USAID in Caracas .
These efforts were able to achieve the consolidation of an opposition movement during those moments , which , despite the failure of the coup d’etat , was able to cause severe damage to the oil industry and the national economy via economic sabotage and a “ stoppage ” by managers and business owners .
Following the division in the opposition , the strategy reoriented its principal focus towards poor communities , the ' Chavista ' sectors , media and the necessities in the interior of the country .
The US embassy in Caracas opened up a series of “ satellite consulates ” ( American Corners ) in five states across the country – without the authorisation of the Ministry of Foreign Relations – it has an official presence in regions seen as important to the energy vision of Washington .
These states , Anzoátegui , Bolívar , Lara , Monagas , and Nueva Esparta ( Margarita ) are rich in oil , minerals and other natural resources , which the US is seeking to control .
These US headquarters found spaces inside lawyers associations and municipal councils controlled by the opposition , and continue to function as centres of propaganda , conspiring against the Bolivarian revolution .
The work of USAID and its OTI in Venezuela has led to a deepening of the counterrevolutionary subversion in the country .
Up until June 2007 , more than 360 “ scholarships ” have been granted to social organisations , political parties , communities and political projects in Venezuela through Development Alternatives Inc. ( DAI ) , a company contracted by USAID , which opened an office in the El Rosal sector of Caracas in June 2002 .
From the centre of Caracas , the DAI / USAID has given more than US $ 11,575,509 to these 360 groups and projects in Venezuela , under the program “ Venezuela : Initiatives for the Construction of Trust ” ( VICC ) .
The majority of the programs funded by DAI focus ( according to their materials ) on “ political dialogue , public debate , citizen ’s participation and the training and capacitation of democratic leaders ” .
Participating and funded organisations include Súmate , Primero Justicia ( Justice First ) , Un Nuevo Tiempo ( a New Time ) , la Alcaldía de Chacao ( Mayoralty of Chacao ) , Liderazgo y Visión ( Leadership and Vision ) , Los del Medio ( Those from the Middle ) , Convive , Transparencia Internacional ( International Transparency ) , Instituto Prensa y Sociedad ( Media and Society Institute ) , Queremos Elegir ( We Want to Chose ) , la Universidad Metropolitana ( Metropolitan University ) , and other groups generally tied to the opposition sector .
USAID -OTI also funded opposition political parties , such as Primero Justicia ( Justice First ) , Un Nuevo Tiempo ( A New Time ) , Acción Democrática ( Democratic Action ) , COPEI , MAS ( Movement Towards Socialism ) , amongst others , through its international arms of US parties : the International Republican Institute ( IRI ) and the National Democratic Institute ( NDI ) .
Since 2002 , more than seven million dollars have been invested as “ technical assistance ” to this opposition parties in Venezuela by USAID , together with IRI and NDI .
The so - called “ defenders of human rights ” in Venezuela , and NGOs ( non-government organisations ) , receive a large part of their funding through Freedom House , another group contracted by USAID - OTI in Venezuela .
Freedom
House has sponsored events such as “ The threats to freedom of expression in the 21st century ” with the participation of Marcel Granier , president of the coup - plotting television station RCTV , together with Karen Hughes , the Sub secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs ( the propaganda office of the State Department that supervises Voice of America and other propagandistic media coming from Washington ) and the US Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen ( R-FL , Republican - Florida )
Freedom
House also funds US institutions , such as the International Centre for Non-violent Conflict ( ICNVC ) that gives courses in Gene Sharp ’s techniques of “ resistance ” , and which has advised youth and students movements in Serbia , Ukraine , Georgia , Belorussia and Venezuela .
Its president during 2003 - 2005 was James Woolsey , ex-Director of the CIA and its current president , Peter Ackerman , is a multimillionaire banker who has sponsored “ regime changes ” in Serbia , Ukraine , and Georgia through the Albert Einstein Institute and its ICNVC .
The son of Ackerman participated in the massacre of the Iraqi people in Fallujah .
The last company to be contracted by USAID in Venezuela was the Foundation of Pan-American Development ( PADF ) , whose mission is to “ support civil society ” .
The PADF has granted $ 937,079 to fourteen Venezuelan NGOs since the end of 2006 .
For now , the names of these groups are unknown .
The last public reports of USAID point out that in August 2007 , they organised a conference with 50 mayors from all the country to cover the issue of “ decentralisation ” and the “ popular networks ” .
This issue seems very much like the project that Leopoldo Lopez , opposition mayor of Chacao , is currently promoting .
The USAID program in Venezuela promises to continue in its efforts to “ strengthen civil society and political parties ” , “ promote decentralisation and municipal councils ” and “ train human rights defenders ” .
The US Congress has already approved $ 3.6 million for this office in Venezuela for the year 2007 - 8 , which indicated that this subversion will continue increasing and threatening the Bolivarian revolution .
Bolivia
But Venezuela is not the only target of US subversion and intervention via USAID and its millions of dollars poured into funding opposition movements .
In March 2004 , USAID opened up another Office of Transition Initiatives ( OTI ) in Bolivia , to supposedly help “ reduce tensions in zones of social conflict and help the country with preparations for electoral events ” .
In this case , USAID contracted the US company Casals & Associates , Inc. ( C&A ) to manage the more than $ 13.3 million that they had already granted to 379 organisations , political parties and projects in Bolivia .
C&A plays the role in Bolivia which the DAI does in Venezuela , and just like the DAI , C&A is a company with large contracts with the Defence Department , the US Army , US Navy , the Energy Department , Broadcasting Board of Governance , the Voice of America , the Office for Transmissions ( of propaganda ) to Cuba , the Interior Security Department , the State Department and many more .
Up until today , C&A has worked on executing interventionist programs for the different Washington agencies , in more than 40 countries across the world , including Albania , Armenia , Bolivia , Colombia , Dominican Republic , El Salvador , Guatemala , Madagascar , Malawi , Mexico , Nicaragua , Panama and Paraguay .
In Bolivia , USAID - OTI has focussed its efforts on combating and influencing the Constituent Assembly and the separatism of the regions rich in natural resources , such as Santa Cruz and Cochabamba .
The majority of the $ 13.3 million has been given to organisations and programs working towards “ reinforcing regional governments ” , with the intention of weakening the national government of Evo Morales ; “ creating links between indigenous groups and democratic structures ” , “ offering economic opportunities and communitarian development ” ; “ civic education for emergent leaders ” ; and “ the spreading of information ” .
The noble themes of these programs indicate that Washington is seeking to suffocate the national power of Evo Morales in Bolivia , penetrate and infiltrate the indigenous communities , which constitute the majority of the country , promote the capitalist model , and have influence over the mass media , promoting pro-US , pro-capitalist and anti-socialist propaganda .
The USAID - OTI program in Bolivia is openly supporting the autonomy of certain regions , such as Santa Cruz , Beni , Pando and Tarija , and therefore promoting separatism and the destabilisation of the country and the government of Evo Morales .
The National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) , another one of Washington ’s financial organs , which promotes subversion and intervention in more than 70 countries across the world , including Venezuela , is also funding groups in regions such as Santa Cruz , which fight for separatism .
The current US ambassador in Bolivia , Philip Goldberg , is an expert in issues of separatism , having been the head of the US mission in ex-Yugoslavia that was divided into two countries : Bosnia and Serbia , with US “ help ” .
The Evo Morales government has already publicly denounced this subversion via USAID in Bolivia , giving notice to the US government that it must obey the laws of the country or chose to leave .
“ The door is open ” , declared the Bolivian government spokesperson recently , making reference to US intervention in his country .
Nevertheless , Washington will not go so easily .
This network of intervention and subversion will not be so easily eradicated .
President Chavez has proposed in his constitutional reform , a change to article 67 which included the prohibition of funding of groups with political aims and political campaigns by public or private foreign entities .
It is essential to define the concept of “ political aims ” , because in many cases , the NGOs and groups that work for human rights would attempt to evade being classified as organisations with “ political ” motives .
But no one can deny that human rights is fundamentally a political issue , and it is the terrain , more than any other , where today Washington ’s subversion hides , using NGOs as a cover .
What is clear is the urgent necessity of developing strategies to impede and shake this subversion in Venezuela , Bolivia and all our sister countries , today in the sights of the empire , and which are fighting to express their own will and sovereignty .

I have started this piece numerous times , and on each occasion I ’ve been unable to keep the momentum going .
This subject matter is so vitally important to me , to you , and to all Americans , that it must be dealt with carefully and thoroughly .
I thought of doing what I usually do , toss out some facts and surround it with my opinion and interpretation of whatever the subject matter was about .
In this case , the facts would be that Habeus Corpus has always been a mainstay of our judicial system , a last bastion for those who are facing less than credible charges .
Or , that I began to see the impact of the erosion of these rights soon after the Republicans took office in 1994 , as avenues of appeal disappeared for those who could least afford their absence , those being Death Row inmates .
Done with the simple goal in mind of speeding up the death machine , regardless of the guilt or innocence of the accused or convicted .
Or that now , the destruction of this once standard of American jurisprudence , has unalterably changed all of our lives .
All of that would have been true , make no mistake about it .
The new Military Commissions Act , recently signed into law by George W. Boosh does just that , changes all of our lives .
It erases the line between “ us and them , ” in more ways than one .
It hurts us morally and in world standing by allowing us to detain and torture whoever we want to without regard to any law , either international or domestic .
At least as , if not more importantly , it allows the US government , OUR government , to treat any of the thousands of Muslims or would be Muslims , Al Qaeda operatives or would be Al Qaeda operatives , or ANY ONE OF US who happen to fall within the bizarre fantasy world definition by Boosh or one of his thugs , as an “ enemy combatant . ”
We could end up in Gitmo or any other CIA hellhole at the whim of a madman , without recourse .
Yes , this act allows for all of that .
Do not pass go , do not collect $ 200 , you can be simply whisked away without notice to anyone nor access to any court for however long they choose to keep you .
This possibility is now indisputable .
Yes , that is what I could have done , but in this case it just was n’t working .
I do n't know , maybe later I will come back and cover this topic in a more conventional manner .
But for now , I decided not to “ stay the course , ” but to change direction entirely and look at this from a different angle , an angle that allows me to use my father as Exhibit A .
This is not an easy thing for me to do , and may well be why I have struggled with it so much .
Any of you who had a father , grandfather , uncle , or anyone close to you who fought in WWII might to be able to relate .
Fighting For Your CountryIn my view , the last war that was fought under the grand old US notion of “ fighting for your country ” was WWII .
Since then , each and every war we have entered into has had nothing to do with actually protecting America or the American people , but has always had some hidden agenda that would allow for us to gain something that we needed at the time .
Sometimes that agenda is obvious , such as the current Iraq fiasco and its connection to Oil , other times the agenda has not been so obvious .
Some to this day are inexplicable , at least to me .
Regardless , they have not been fought for the right reasons .
But , back to my father .
My Father and WWIIMy father was an Army soldier in WWII , a “ grunt ” if you will .
He also became a Prisoner of War , held on a German Hospital ship for a few months .
His “ company ” was attacking a wooded position held by the Germans outside of Woelfling , France .
Specifically , according to letters received by my grandfather from the Adjutant General ’s Office of the War Department , his “ point of departure ” was : FIFTY YARDS OF RAILROAD , 1 ¼ MILES NORTH OF WOELFLING , FRANCE .
There my father dove into what he thought was an empty machine gun nest , only to find that it was not empty .
He was shot five to seven times in the neck , jaw and face .
It was only when his “ company ” regrouped that it was realized that he was not with them , along with an unknown number ( to me at least ) of other soldiers .
This event occurred on January 6 , 1945 .
Using today ’s terminology that is when he officially “ went missing . ”
After spending 90 + days on a German hospital ship , then in a land based hospital , he was eventually located by American Military Officials on April 8 , 1945 .
The Army , in a telegram , notified my grandfather that he had been found , hospitalized “ IN EUROPEAN AREA PERIIOD ( sic ) HOSPITAL . ”
My father was released to the US Army shortly thereafter , and eventually returned to the United States where the long process of rebuilding his face began .
Thankfully , he recovered for the most part , physically at least .
Mentally , I ’m not sure he ever left that machine gun nest FIFTY YARDS OF RAILROAD , 1 ¼ MILES NORTH OF WOELFLING , FRANCE .
This all happened many wars ago , and 11 years before my birth .
I only knew that I grew up with a father who had been wounded in WWII , an obvious thing when one looked at his face and tried to dig into his tortured soul .
I wish that I could tell you that you would know who my father was , that he was some Great War hero whose name you would recognize , but I can ’t .
He was merely a man who entered the military to fight for his country , at a time when his country and the rest of the world were in grave danger and truly needed his service .
My father returned home , married my mother and immediately became a functional alcoholic .
His alcoholism was not noticeable to me until I became an adult , or close to it , because he hid it well , and quite frankly I was n’t paying much attention .
I had a life to live , sports to be played , girls to chase and growing up to do .
As I became older , I asked him on several occasions about the war .
He would never speak of it , at least not until one of the last civil conversations I ever recall having with him .
During that conversation he told me that “ war was hell , ” that he had “ killed many people , ” and that “ had the Germans not run out of gasoline they would have won the war . ”
That was pretty much the extent of it , as near as I can recall today .
You see , my father and I did n’t get along too well near the end .
His alcoholism was too much for me to deal with , I did n’t understand how , or why one would “ choose ” to be the way he turned out to be .
I did n’t understand the complexities of what forms a human being and alters their conduct , nor should I have been expected to .
I was simply too young .
Now I do understand that he did not “ choose ” to be what he was , or became , but was simply escaping the “ hell ” that lived inside his mind .
My father could have been the poster child for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder , or PTSD .
That phraseology did n’t exist back then , it was simply known as shell shock .
Whatever you call it , I witnessed and lived it up close and personal .
Now that I better understand it , I can forgive him for all that happened .
What does any of this have to do with the Military Commissions Act , you must be asking by now ?
To me , it has everything to do with it .
My father , who by the way I am now proud of , was a prisoner of war during a brutal engagement with perhaps the future of the entire world at stake .
Yet , he was n’t tortured .
My father was “ fighting for his country ” in the truest sense of the phrase , against perhaps the most brutal dictator the world has yet to produce , and still he was n’t tortured .
I guess even Adolph Hitler believed in and played by a few rules .
My father gave his life for this country , for the freedoms we have or at least had .
No , he did n’t die in combat , like over 3000 of our young men and women have during this version of the Iraq war .
But , he gave his life nonetheless .
Because he never recovered from the horrors of the war .
Though functional , he was not far from the Vets that you see on the street these days mumbling to themselves .
I would venture to guess that he would have been died a happier man had he not survived the incident FIFTY YARDS OF RAILROAD , 1 ¼ MILES NORTH OF WOELFLING , FRANCE .
That is a sad statement , but one I believe to be true .
The stroke of a PenA short time ago , with one stroke of a pen , George W. Boosh made folly of the price that my father and thousands just like him paid for our freedoms , freedoms including the protections of the Geneva Conventions and Habeus Corpus .
A man chosen to lead this nation ; a dimwit cowboy who would make a poor used car salesman ; a coward who could not manage to fulfill the minimum requirements of service to keep himself out of a later war so that he had to be bailed out by Daddy and his name ; a man so desperate to hold onto power for his political party that he is willing to do anything to cover up his lies and deceit ; a man who in pursuit of OIL is willing to send our children and fathers and mothers and husbands and wives , but not his own , into the abyss called Iraq ; a man who without hesitation feeds the rich and starves the poor and laughs about it along the way while calling the rich his “ base , ” ; a man who I despise more than any on the face of this earth ; with one stroke of his pen , spit on the grave of my father .
He also spit on the graves or in the faces of all others who fought in the last legitimate war this country has been involved in .
He lied before he did it , lied while he did it , continues to lie afterwards , and will undoubtedly continue with his lies until he carries his smirk to his grave .
George W. Boosh has crossed a line that has never before been crossed , not even by the likes of a monster like Adolph Hitler .
I hope that I can someday learn to forgive him , like I learned to forgive my father .

SEPTEMBER 16-- Here 's the mug shot O.J. Simpson posed for today following his arrest for the alleged armed robbery of a memorabilia dealer in a Las Vegas hotel room .
Simpson , 60 , was booked into the Clark County Detention Center after he was taken into custody this morning by Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officers .
According to investigators , Simpson and several cohorts burst into a room at the Palace Station hotel Thursday evening and confiscated collectibles that Simpson claims were stolen from him ( the items were being offered for sale by a dealer with whom Simpson has had prior business dealings ) .
Simpson , who is facing six felony charges , is the second person arrested for the alleged memorabilia heist .
Walter Alexander , a 46 - year - old Arizona man , was nabbed last night on armed robbery , assault with a deadly weapon , and conspiracy raps .
Two firearms were seized during search warrants executed following the arrest of Alexander , whose booking photo can be found here .
The weapons , cops contend , were the ones used during the hotel heist .
Simpson last posed for a mug shot in June 1994 after he was arrested for killing his ex-wife and her male companion .
A Los Angeles jury later acquitted him of murder charges .

Software developers do love to code .
But very few of them , in my experience , can explain why they 're coding .
Try this exercise on one of your teammates if you do n't believe me .
Ask them what they 're doing .
Then ask them why they 're doing it , and keep asking until you get to a reason your customers would understand .
What are you working on ?
I 'm fixing the sort order on this datagrid .
Why are you working on that ?
Because it's on the bug list .
Why is it on the bug list ?
Because one of the testers reported it as a bug .
Why was it reported as a bug ?
The tester thinks this field should sort in numeric order instead of alphanumeric order .
Why does the tester think that ?
Evidently the users are having trouble finding things when item 2 is sorted under item 19 .
If this conversation seems strange to you , you probably have n't worked with many software developers .
Like the number of licks it takes to get to the center of a tootsie pop , it might surprise you just how many times you have to ask " why " until you get to something – anything – your customers would actually care about .
It 's a big disconnect .
Software developers think their job is writing code .
But it 's not . *
Their job is to solve the customer 's problem .
Sure , our preferred medium for solving problems is software , and that does involve writing code .
But let 's keep this squarely in context : writing code is something you have to do to deliver a solution .
It is not an end in and of itself .
As software developers , we spend so much time mired in endless , fractal levels of detail that it's all too easy for us to fall into the trap of coding for the sake of coding .
Without a clear focus and something to rally around , we lose the context around our code .
That 's why it 's so important to have a clear project vision statement that everyone can use as a touchstone on the project .
If you 've got the vision statement down , every person on your team should be able to pass the " elevator test " with a stranger – to clearly explain what they 're working on , and why anyone would care , within 60 seconds .
If your team can't explain their work to a layperson in a meaningful way , you 're in trouble , whether you realize it or not .
But you are in good company .
Jim Highsmith is here to help .
He explains a quick formula for building a project vision model :
A product vision model helps team members pass the elevator test – the ability to explain the project to someone within two minutes .
It comes from Geoffrey Moore 's book Crossing the Chasm .
It follows the form :
for ( target customer )
who ( statement of need or opportunity )
the ( product name ) is a ( product category )
is a that ( key benefit , compelling reason to buy )
unlike ( primary competitive alternative )
our product ( statement of primary differentiation )
Creating a product vision statement helps teams remain focused on the critical aspects of the product , even when details are changing rapidly .
It is very easy to get focused on the short - term issues associated with a 2 - 4 week development iteration and lose track of the overall product vision .
I 'm not a big fan of formulas , because they 're so , well , formulaic .
But it 's a reasonable starting point .
Play Mad Libs and see what you come up with .
It 's worlds better than no vision statement , or an uninspiring , rambling , ad - hoc mess masquerading as a vision statement .
However , I think Jim 's second suggestion for developing a vision statement holds much more promise .
Even within an IT organization , I think every project should be considered to produce a " product . "
Whether the project results involve enhancements to an internal accounting system or a new e-commerce site , product - oriented thinking pays back benefits .
One practice that I 've found effective in getting teams to think about a product vision is the Design - the - Box exercise .
This exercise is great to open up a session to initiate a project .
The team makes the assumption that the product will be sold in a shrink - wrapped box , and their task is to design the product box front and back .
This involves coming up with a product name , a graphic , three to four key bullet points on the front to " sell " the product , a detailed feature description on the back , and operating requirements .
Coming up with 15 or 20 product features proves to be easy .
It 's figuring out which 3 or 4 would cause someone to buy the product that is difficult .
One thing that usually happens is an intense discussion about who the customers really are .
Design - the - Box is a fantastic way to formulate a vision statement .
It 's based on a concrete , real world concept that most people can easily wrap their heads around .
Forget those pie - in - the - sky vision quests : what would our ( hypothetical ) product box look like ?
We 're all consumers ; the design goals for a product box are obvious and universal .
What is a product box if not the ultimate elevator pitch ?
It should ...
Explain what our product is in the simplest possible way .
Make it crystal clear why a potential customer would want to buy this product .
Be uniquely identifiable amongst all the other boxes on the shelf .
Consider the box for the ill - fated Microsoft Bob product as an example .
How do you explain why customers should want Microsoft Bob ?
How would you even explain what the heck Microsoft Bob is ?
It 's instructive to look at existing product boxes you find effective , and those you find ineffective .
We definitely know what our product box should n't look like .
Have a rock solid vision statement for your project from day one .
If you do n't , use one of Jim 's excellent suggestions to build one up immediately .
Without a coherent vision statement , it 's appalling how many teams can't pass the elevator test– they can't explain what it is they 're working on , or why it matters .
Do n't make that same mistake .
Get a kick - ass vision statement that your teammates can relate their work to .
Make sure your team can pass the elevator test .

The death report was asking the wrong questions — whether the patient had drunk four to eight glasses of water daily , whether his diet was low in saturated fats and salt .
Death had not been a result of junk food ; it had been a result of suicide .
When it is your patient who has died , there is a fugitive quality to it : someone has fled , and you were unable to capture or return him alive .
Diet and fluids are the least of the problem .
My patient had been an educated man , full of yearning .
He wanted a mate and a job .
Schizophrenia made both hard to find .
I knew about his voices , and sometimes knew what his voices told him , but had come to believe that voices and patient coexisted in a delicate yet stable ecosystem .
It was a false belief .
No one is immune from contemplating suicide .
Demographic studies show that the population most at risk is single , urban , substance - abusing older white men with physical illness , few supports and low incomes .
President Bush 's bill proposed tougher border controls
Senators voted against keeping the bill alive , effectively delaying action on the emotive immigration issue until after the 2008 presidential election .
The proposed legislation set out ways for some of the around 12 million illegal immigrants to seek citizenship .
The bill 's opponents said this amounted to an amnesty for breaking the law .
Hours before the vote , the Capitol 's switchboard was jammed by thousands of calls from groups and individuals arguing both for and against the bill , signalling its deeply divisive impact .
" The American people won today .
They care enough for their country to get mad and to fight for it , " said Republican Senator Jim DeMint .
Backers of the bill expressed their deep disappointment .
Democrat Senator Edward Kennedy insisted the immigration reform was inevitable , although it might take years .
Referring to the legislation 's opponents , he said : " What are they going to do with the 12 million who are undocumented here ?
Send them back to countries around the world ?
Develop a type of Gestapo here to seek out these people that are in the shadows ?
What 's their alternative ? "
As well as allowing some illegal immigrants to eventually seek citizenship , the planned legislation would have also offered some would - be migrants the chance to apply for a guest - worker programme .
The bill also proposed tougher border controls to prevent more illegal immigrants from entering the country .
' Stunning ' defeat
President Bush spent much of Thursday morning on the phone , trying to persuade senators to back the bill .
The American people understand the status quo is unacceptable when it comes to our immigration laws
President Bush
Q&A : US immigration debate US illegal immigrants : Facts
Eventually , 53 members of the 100 - seat Senate voted against limiting debate on the immigration bill and taking it to a final vote .
In a brief statement after the vote , President Bush said immigration was a burning issue for the American people and " Congress ' failure to act on it is a disappointment " .
" The American people understand the status quo is unacceptable when it comes to our immigration laws , " he said .
" A lot of us worked hard to see if we could n't find common ground .
It did n't work . "
The Senate now goes into summer recess .
Security priority
Mexican President Felipe Calderon said the US Senate had made a grave error .
Those from abroad may not be able to believe that anything recommended by Bush is good , but , believe it or not , this is one policy of his that should have been enacted

Business leaders and lobbyists for immigration reform voiced upset at the result .
" We were looking to politicians for leadership on this issue , and there has been none and it's deeply disappointing , " Sheridan Bailey , a co-founder of Arizona Employers for Immigration Reform , told Reuters news agency .
" It 's like in Vietnam when they said ' we had to destroy the village to save it , ' - well , here they are destroying the economy to save the US border . "
But opponents of the bill said the vote highlighted citizens ' concerns that boosting border security was the biggest priority .
Americans want " action , they want results , they want proof , because they 've heard all the promises before , " Republican Senator David Vitter told AFP news agency .
Click to viewA camera - toting tipster saw what appeared to be a giant armada of Chevy Cobalt cars in the Google parking lot , getting ready to take pictures of the entire world ( or thereabouts ) with special 360° cameras .
The tipster says he followed a Google camera van as it cruised back to its Mountain View , California , lair yesterday after that van finished a session of picture taking for Google 's Streetview navigation site .
Exactly what did he see ?

It was an entire fleet of at least 30 brand - new Chevy Cobalt cars parked behind the building , most without license plates yet .
As you can see in the pictures above , each had a metal device attached to its top , which looks suspiciously like a vertical extension for mounting Google 's Streetview 360° camera .
Our telltale tipster tells us he thinks Google is " preparing their invasion of US cities with an armada of C.C.C.Cs ( Chevy Cobalt Camera Cars ) .
I guess Cobalts are cheap but they certainly will be conspicuous .
Maybe that 's what they want . "

It looks like an auspicious addition to the camera car fleet , but it 's going to take more than thirty Chevy Cobalts to take a portrait of the entire Earth , or even of the Silicon Valley .
However , with Google 's zillions , just about anything 's possible .
It 's got its eye on you ; the end is near .
A Busy Developer 's Guide to Tcl / Tk 8.5
Current Status of this Document :
This document is current as of the production 8.5.0 release .
Last update December 21 , 2007 .
This document is intended to quickly introduce " mainstream " developers who have been using earlier versions of Tcl / Tk to the most important new features in Tcl / Tk 8.5 that they need to know about .
This is n't a manager 's high - level guide , but covers things that affect your code on a daily basis .
It 's also not something that would interest the type of people who follow daily commits to the Tcl / Tk CVS repositories .
I 'm not going to cover every features ( and there are lots ! ) , and many things that are n't covered or are covered in less detail are very important to some people ; my idea of " mainstream " developer is purely subjective .
If you want more comprehensive information , it 's available elsewhere .
A good starting point is the Changes in Tcl / Tk 8.5 page on the Tcler 's Wiki .
Tcl 8.5 :
What Every Developer Needs to Know
Along with the usual bug fixes and incremental improvements , Tcl 8.5 removes a lot of " warts " in previous versions , and adopting its features will make your programs better .
These are n't all necessarily big things , but many are so common that they 're definitely worth knowing about .
Dictionaries : like arrays , but pass - by - value
Dictionaries are similar to arrays ( i.e. hash tables ) , in that they allow you to store many values together , each indexed by a key .
Unlike arrays , they are values , meaning a dictionary can be efficiently passed as a value ( not just a name ) to a procedure .
They are the first new data type the Tcl core has gained in a long time .
Before 8.5 : To pass arrays around , you were forced to either use the " upvar " wart : # accept the name of an array
proc processarray {arrayName} {
upvar $ arrayName a ; # you just scared off the Tcl newbies ...
# use $ a( name ) , $ a( age ) , etc ...
}
...
array set data {name Bob age 20 country USA}
processarray data ; # eww , have to pass the name
Before 8.5 : Or , you could use " array get " and " array set " to pass by value , but with tons of copying , which is excruciatingly slow : # accept the flattened form of the array
proc processarray {arraydata} {
array set a $ arraydata ; # copy , copy ...
# use $ a( name ) , $ a( age ) , etc ...
}
...
array set data {name Bob age 20 country USA}
processarray [ array get data ] ; # copy , copy , copy ...
With 8.5 : While the string representation of dictionaries look like the " array get " form ( i.e. list of " key val key val ... " ) , internally they are very efficient .
# accept a dictionary
proc processdict {dict} {
# ... use [ dict get $ dict name ] , [ dict get $ dict age ] , etc ...
}
...
set data [ dict create name Bob age 20 country USA ]
processdict $ data ; # hey , actual pass by value !
The expected range of commands to manipulate dictionaries are bundled in the " dict " command .
The commands shown here are a useful subset .
dict create ? key value ...?
dict get dictValue ?
key ...?
dict set dictValue key value
dict exists dictValue key ?
key ...?
dict unset dictValue key ?
key ...?
dict replace dictValue ? key value ...?
dict keys dictValue ?
glob ?
dict values dictValue ?
glob ?
dict for {key Var valueVar} dictValue body
dict size dictVal
Dictionaries have a lot more features , and include support for things like nested dictionaries , modifying individual values in a dictionary in - place ( append , incr , lappend ) and more .
See TIP # 111 or the " dict " manual page for more information .
New {*} syntax : avoid abuse of eval
It is all too common in Tcl and Tk programs that you have a list of several things , that need to be passed as separate parameters to a command .
The existing mechanism is ugly , inefficient , error - prone and in fact can even be dangerous .
It is a frequent source of problems in even expert Tcl programmers ' code .
Before 8.5 : To break up a list into pieces to pass it to a command , you 'd use " eval " set kids [ winfo children . ] ; #returns a list
eval destroy $ kids ; # destroy needs each window as a separate arg
Before 8.5 : The actual correct and always safe way to do this is this ugly wart .
set kids [ winfo children . ]
eval [ linsert 0 $ kids destroy ] ; # this looks backwards ...
With 8.5 : This can be written more clearly and safely using the new {*} syntax , which breaks up the list in place and passes it as separate arguments to the command .
set kids [ winfo children . ]
destroy {* }$ kids
This is the first new piece of syntax in Tcl in many years ( the parser now has 12 rules , not 11 ) .
And yes , it 's itself an ugly wart , that was the subject of long consideration .
However , the problem it solves is so pervasive and damaging that it is unfortunately a much needed change .
It 's very much worth checking the " eval " calls in your existing code to see if they can be replaced by {*} , and certainly think twice before using eval in the future to explode arguments .
Note that earlier alphas of 8.5 used " {expand} " .
These should be changed to use " {*} " .
List membership with " in " and " ni " : enough with lsearch
This is a small one , but removes one of the most common warts in Tcl programs , checking whether something is a member of a list .
Before 8.5 : While lsearch does the job , it 's pretty verbose and indirect , making it harder to read .
Plus I can never remember the order of arguments to lsearch .
if {[lsearch - exact $ list $ item ] !=- 1} {
# item is in the list ...
}
With 8.5 : There are new expression operators which let you check if an item is in a list ( " in " ) , or if its not in the list ( " ni " ) .
if {$item in $ list} {
...
}
New expr operators : min , max , and **
With 8.5 : Again these are small but common things , but expr finally gains " min " and " max " operators , and can now use " ** " for exponentiation , which can be more readable than " pow ( ) " .
expr { min ( 1,10,20 ) }
expr { max ( 2,5 ) }
expr { 2.0*x** 3 - 1.2*$x** 2 + 3.0 * $x + 4.0}
Lassign : assign elements of list into variables
Breaking up a list and storing each element in a separate variable is not hard to do , but it 's a very common operation .
For example , commands in Tcl can only return a single value , so if they have to return more than one value they pack them all into a list .
The caller then has to unpack them .
Before 8.5 : The readable way to do this has always been using multiple " lindex " calls , but for the lover of obscurity , it was also possible with " foreach " .
set coords [ getBoundingBox $ thing ]
set x0 [ lindex $ coords 0 ]
set y0 [ lindex $ coords 1 ]
set x1 [ lindex $ coords 2 ]
set y1 [ lindex $ coords 3 ]
foreach { x0 y0 x1 y1} [ getBoundingBox $ thing ] {} ; # ewww ....
With 8.5 : The " lassign " command , originally from TclX , now makes this easy and clear .
lassign [ getBoundingBox $ thing ] x0 y0 x1 y1
Incr auto - initialization : simplify counters
Before 8.5 : Not hard , but doing counters in Tcl always involved the same dance .
if {![ info exists counter ] } {
set counter 0
}
incr counter
With 8.5 : Now if a variable does n't exist , incr will auto - initialize it with a value of 0 . incr counter
New " chan " command : deprecates several f* I/O commands
With 8.5 : A new " chan " command gathers together a number of operations that work on channels into a single command , to curb some of the global namespace usage for I/O .
This deprecates several existing commands , so plan to move to the new versions of those soon .
chan blocked ; # fblocked ( DEPRECATED )
chan close ; # close
chan configure ; # fconfigure ( DEPRECATED )
chan copy ; # fcopy ( DEPRECATED )
chan eof ; # eof
chan event ; # fileevent ( DEPRECATED )
chan flush ; # flush
chan gets ; # gets
chan names ; # file channels ( DEPRECATED )
chan puts ; # puts
chan read ; # read
chan seek ; # seek
chan tell ; # tell
chan truncate ; # ftruncate
Tcl Modules : a new , more effective way of packaging extensions
Tcl Modules are an important new mechanism to construct , deliver and deploy Tcl packages .
You 'll start seeing more and more packages available as Tcl modules , and in particular are the format used by Teapot , the new but long - awaited package repository that Activestate is providing .
Yes , after all these years , a central place to locate and download Tcl packages .
Tcl Modules complement , but do not replace the existing package mechanism
Because they are simpler , they offer several advantages .
Traditional packages consist of several files , with a " pkgIndex.tcl " script pulling the pieces together , identifying the package and version number , etc .
Tcl Modules consist of a single , source - able file ( with extension " .tm " ) whose package and version number must be encoded in the filename .
As a result , Tcl Modules are simpler to store ( a single file ) , and much more efficient to search and load ( the search paths are more restricted , and only the module 's filename needs to be examined ) .
For more on Tcl Modules , see TIP # 189 .
Tcl 8.5 : Other Things You Should Know
Less common or pervasive than the previous changes , the improvements in this section will still be of use in a good number of situations , or , like the new clock command , have undergone such significant change that it warrants being aware of .
Arbitrary - precision integers .
Tcl now transparently supports arbitrarily - sized integers ( bignums ) .
Rather than generating overflows that became a source of bugs , Tcl now promotes integer to bignums when needed .
Of course , this is particularly good if you know you 're going to be dealing with large integers , and are ( or otherwise would be ) using another library to do so .
A new " string is wideinteger " command lets you check if a string will fit into a bignum .
New clock command .
The " clock " command has been almost entirely rewritten , to deal with a wide range of corner cases , weird input formats , localization issues , platform - specific bugs , bizarre time zones , and more .
The new version is almost entirely compatible , unless you were depending on existing bugs .
There is also new finer - grained " milliseconds " and " microseconds " options .
Note that because the new clock implementation is mostly Tcl , it is somewhat slower than before .
As well , Tcl now includes a very sizable collection of timezone data files , which may present issues for packaging and deployment .
New and improved list operations .
A new " lrepeat " command makes constructing large lists easy .
Lsearch gets a new " - index " option for searching in nested lists ( like lsort ) .
Finally , lsearch , lsort , and switch get new " - nocase " options to do case - insensitive comparisons , which should remove a few " string tolower " commands from your programs .
Encodings for Tcl scripts .
Both the " source " command and the " tclsh " and " wish " applications now allow specifying a script 's encoding via a " - encoding " flag , as opposed to assuming the system encoding .
New " apply " command for anonymous ( lambda ) procedures .
This will be a welcome addition for people who enjoy functional programming .
But it 's also a way to create commands on the fly that you can pass around and call , without needing to create new entries in the command table .
If you often create new commands with dummy names , and then pass around the names , this may be a better solution .
Files , pipes and exec .
Both the " open | " and " exec " commands get a new " 2> @1 " syntax , which allows you to merge and capture both stdout and stderr .
Open also gets a new " b " access mode for opening binary files , which automatically does the equivalent of a " fconfigure - translation binary " for you .
Finally , " file attributes " and " file copy " add support for several Mac OS X specific features .
Namespace improvements .
For developers who make extensive uses of namespaces in creative ways ( more common than perhaps it need be ) , there are new " namespace ensemble " , " namespace unknown " , and " namespace upvar " commands , that may simplify some of your existing namespace manipulations .
Modernized TEA build system .
For developers who build
Tcl extensions who were scared off by earlier , increasingly complex versions of the TEA package specification and tools , newer versions of TEA have removed many of the most annoying problems , so it 's worth revisiting converting your extension to use TEA .
Tk 8.5 :
What Every Developer Needs to Know
On the Tk side , far and away the most significant change is the inclusion of the " themed Tk " widgets .
If you care at all about look and feel , this is one thing you definitely need to know about .
Themed Tk Widgets
Alongside the classic
Tk widgets , 8.5 introduces a new , complementary set of widgets , collectively referred to as " themed Tk " widgets .
This is based on work done by Joe English , originally under the name " Tile " .
Better platform look and feel .
For developers working on mainstream
Tk applications , the most important aspect of these themed widgets is that they deliver a look and feel more closely resembling the platform they are running on , as opposed to the often - dated appearance on some platforms ( e.g. Linux ) that many people have complained about .
They also include some new widgets , e.g. combobox , that are common in today 's user interfaces , but were only available as extensions in standard Tk .
As the name suggests , underlying the themed widget set is a mechanism allowing you to define new appearances via themes or styles , rather than via widget - by - widget customization or option database changes as is done with Tk.
However , for most applications , the theming aspect will be secondary ; the main value will be in the better appearance and new widgets .
How to use .
The existing Tk widgets still remain , available through commands such as " button " , but they also now are accessible via a " tk : : " namespace , e.g. " tk:: button " .
The themed widgets exist in a " ttk : : " namespace , so there is now a " ttk::button " command .
Though the themed widget commands work similarly to the originals , there are important differences .
Themed widgets are not a drop - in replacement .
In particular , themed widgets generally provide less options for customizing their appearance than regular Tk widgets ( e.g. they will often not have options like " - background " ) .
Such changes , if needed ( and they should be needed much less often ) must be done by defining new widget styles , using the facilities offered by the themed widget package .
Complement , not replacement .
Themed
Tk widgets provide a better match for the " typical " uses of a widget , at the expense of the flexibility in many regular
Tk widgets to turn themselves into something barely recognizable as the original .
Because of this , applications will mostly want to use the themed widgets .
However , to achieve particular effects , in special situations , it may make sense to use the regular Tk widget , if the flexibility it offers is all you need .
One does not replace the other , and they can be mixed - and - matched as necessary within the same application .
Available ttk : : widgets .
Alternatives to standard
Tk widgets and containers : button , checkbutton , entry , label , menubutton , radiobutton , scale , scrollbar , frame , labelframe , panedwindow .
New widgets not present in standard Tk : combobox , notebook , progressbar , separator , sizegrip .
Note that these standard Tk widgets do not have ( nor really need ) an alternative in themed Tk : canvas , listbox , menu , spinbox , text .
The " widget " demo program that comes with Tk , though not currently fully updated to use Ttk everywhere , has added new demos that incorporate the new themed widgets .
This is a good starting point to see how to use the new widgets and what they look like .
These themed widgets are the most significant upgrade to Tk in over ten years ( since 8.0 , the original port to Mac and Windows ) , and application developers should very seriously consider planning to migrate .
This transition is non-trivial , because of the different approach to widget appearance that themed widgets take .
The likely gains however are a better look and feel , removal of many existing hacks needed to make standard Tk widgets look better , and replacement of some extensions used to add widgets like notebooks .
Widget builders should also examine the themed widget foundations , which provide a powerful way to construct new widgets .
Because the themed widgets are still in rapid development , with new widgets planned , it 's worth keeping an eye on future changes here .
Tk 8.5 : Other Things You Should Know
Again , a few things that may well improve your programs , some without any changes needed on your part .
Antialiased text under X11 , Mac OS X .
This allows
Tk to fit in much better with modern desktops ; the lack of antialiased fonts has been a frequent criticism recently , particularly on Linux .
Based on Xft on X11 , ATSUI on OS X .
Mac Improvements .
The Mac OS X version has received substantial improvements in look and feel of both the core and themed widgets , as well as many underlying optimizations , enhancements and modernizing .
Many text widget enhancements .
These include smooth - scrolling ( e.g. across tall images ) , new commands for counting characters , replacing text , handling display lines ( not just logical lines ) , and more .
See TIP # 155 and TIP # 169 for more .
Grid configure with widget name .
It is now possible to pass the widget name to grid column / rowconfigure , whereas previously these accepted only a row / column index .
This should make your grid layout code much more clear and obvious .
It also simplifies things when adding new columns or rows after the fact , because you no longer have to adjust all the index numbers in your grid calls .
Tristate checkbutton and radiobuttons .
Added a " - tristatevalue " that can be used to set a state where some but not all members of a collection of items are selected .
Full - Screen toplevels .
A new " - fullscreen " option allows top - levels to be created which take up the entire screen , removing some of the pitfalls inherent in existing ad hoc methods of doing this .
Color window icons .
A new " wm iconphoto " command allows specifying a color window icon , akin to the black and white icons you could use by " wm iconbitmap " .
Enhanced font handling .
There are now a wider variety of named fonts that you should use rather than specifying a particular font family , size , etc. to ensure that you get the right font for interface elements on each platform ; see TIP # 145 .
Photo images catch memory errors .
Photo images will now generate appropriate
Tcl errors if enough memory is not available .
User -Data for virtual events .
Virtual events can now specify a user - defined , event specific data value , useful for e.g. passing around an object or other additional information the event refers to .
The " event generate " command now takes a " - data " option , while a " %d " in the event binding captures the data .
New panedwindow options .
A new " - stretch " option allows more control over how different panes share the available space , while " - hide " is now available to control visibility .
This light - switch technology promises to accelerate scientists ’ efforts in mapping which clusters of the brain ’s 100 billion neurons warble to each other when a person , for example , recalls a memory or learns a skill .
That quest is one of the greatest challenges facing neuroscience .
The channelrhodopsin switch is “ really going to blow the lid off the whole analysis of brain function , ” said George Augustine , a neurobiologist at Duke University in Durham , N.C .
Dr. Deisseroth , who is also a psychiatrist who treats patients with autism or severe depression , has ambitious goals .
Brain cells in those disorders show no damage , yet something is wrong with how they talk to one another , he said .
“ The high - speed dynamics of the system are probably off , ” Dr. Deisseroth said .
He wants to learn whether , in these neuropsychiatric diseases , certain neurons falter or go haywire , and then to find a way to tune patients ’ faulty circuits .
A first step is establishing that it is possible to tweak a brain circuit by remote control and observe the corresponding behavioral changes in freely moving lab animals .
On a recent Sunday at Stanford , Dr. Deisseroth and Feng Zhang , a graduate student , hovered over a dark brown mouse placed inside a white plastic tub .
Through standard gene - manipulating tricks , the rodent had been engineered to produce channelrhodopsin only in one particular kind of neuron found throughout the brain , to no apparent ill effect .
Mr. Zhang had implanted a tiny metal tube into the right side of the mouse ’s partly shaved head .
Now he carefully threaded a translucent fiber - optic cable not much wider than a thick human hair into that tube , positioned over the area of the cerebral cortex that controls movement .
That the trial was so fruitful and revelatory was quite a surprise .
It rather looked like all the big enchiladas had gotten away with the outing of C.I.A. agent Valerie Plame , wife of former ambassador Joe Wilson , who , after being sent on a fact - finding mission to Niger , climbed on a soapbox and announced that a central element of the case for war was fraudulent .
In the end , all the prosecutor had gotten — and only for the Martha Stewart breach of legal etiquette of trying not to get caught for a crime that seems not to have been committed — was the vice president ’s factotum .
Only Scooter .
And yet — and this became the fulcrum of prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald ’s narrative — Libby ’s very scooterness , his being the vice president ’s eager sidekick , gave him vast power and his behind - the - scenes machinations deep reach into the workings of the Bush administration .
Libby was , after all , the chief of staff , as well as the closest confidant , to the most powerful vice president in history ( in addition , he was also Cheney ’s national - security adviser and part of the neocon group instigating the war in Iraq ) , which made him one of the most influential men in this government .
( Worth noting : the veep goes into a clear eclipse and becomes the subject of increasing mockery after Libby is indicted and no longer at his side . )
What ’s more , Fitzgerald , aware , no doubt , of the weakness of the charges — mere perjury and obstruction , acts of omission rather than commission — and , perhaps , defensive about the tens of millions he ’d spent to produce them , put on trial the “ state of mind ” that led the administration to sell the case for W.M.D. , which , in turn , made it go a little batty when Joe Wilson started flapping about there being no deal between the Iraqis and the Nigerois for uranium , and hence no rationale for war ( the lawyers and judge kept reminding the jury that , while it was n’t supposed to judge the war , it could judge the “ state of mind ” that might have motivated the various players ) .
And , to boot , Fitzgerald , for all practical purposes , put the vice president on trial .
It was his war and , scribbled on the talking points , his marginalia directing the counter - P.R. pursuit of Wilson .
If that was n’t enough , from the opening bell , Ted Wells , the defense lawyer , drew the White House in : Libby , he argued , was in the dock precisely because Karl Rove , the greater message genius , had to be kept out of it .
The entire Iraq - war marketing operation was on trial .
I was reading , as the trial unfolded , Thomas Evans ’s new book , The Education of Ronald Reagan , about Lemuel Boulware , the remarkable General Electric P.R. genius who shaped Reagan during the years when the future president was stumping for G.E. and who assembled — largely as a way to counter the growth of organized labor — the first great conservative message apparatus , the model for the Republican media machine and for the party ’s ascendancy ( “ a managed - news program ” that , according to Evans , “ was the envy of corporate America ” and “ an inspiration for the Reagan White House ” ) .
Boulwarism is part of the DNA which makes Republicans return a reporter ’s calls — and not grudgingly but eagerly ( in contrast , you should hear the impatient and dismissive tone of the Democrats when you call them up ) .
In every one of Scooter ’s calls to reporters , dramatized throughout the trial in loving detail , you sensed his eagerness : he wants to talk , to negotiate , to schmooze , to convince .
Republicans are good at this .
Here ’s a perfectly revealing moment in the trial , when you paused and appreciated the different professional values of Democrats and Republicans .
It came during the recitation of the résumé of Cathie Martin , the vice president ’s former communications director .
Although Martin is a graduate of Harvard Law School , the greatest professional qualification in the political power structure , and should have , more conventionally , become a framer of policy and legislation or a jurist , in the Bush administration she becomes a P.R. girl — that ’s where the power is .
In fact , she takes the job held by Mary Matalin , another P.R. girl and one of the icons of the Republican Party .
The other day while I was procrastinating from doing things I should have been , I found several interesting google links I have never seen before …
http://www.google.com/intl/xx-hacker/why_use.html
http://www.google.com/intl/xx-hacker/
This one is strange , everything is in “ hacker speak ” , and all the links work and keep that same encoding of the words …
http://www.google.com/3.html
This one is just old .
It makes reference to indexing 3 billion pages .
Rumor has it they are way passed that number .
http://www.google.com/lucky.html
Reminiscent of the old google , I ’m not really sure what this one is .
http://www.google.com/default.reg
http://www.google.com/google_rsearch.reg
These two are just strange because they are registry files for internet explorer settings .
I would n’t expect to see that in the google root directory .
http://www.google.com/ig/currentcomm/current_links_module.html
This one is only interesting because of the reference to the online file backup account …
http://www.google.com/ig/current
This is funny because this looks like their new customized home page …
http://www.google.com/imghp?hl=km&tab=di&ie=UTF-8
This is another interesting encoding of the google page
http://www.google.com/sitemap.xml
Maybe this is n’t a big deal , but I was surprised to see this xml sitemap in their root .
http://www.google.com/mozilla/google.xul2
I have never seen this before , so I thought it was strange .
Looks like it is for a mobile device or something …
http://www.google.com/ie_rsearch.html
This one looks like what shows up in the IE sidebar at times .
Maybe thats what the above one was for too ?
http://code.google.com/webstats/2005-12/elements.html
If you like numbers , I just thought this was an interesting break - down of the pages they index and elements of those pages .

Woman Arrested at Airport with Fake Bomb
Anyone know what ’s going on ?
Star Simpson , 19 , had a computer circuit board , wiring and a putty that later turned out to be Play - Doh in plain view over a black hooded sweat shirt she was wearing , said State Police Maj .
Scott Pare , the commanding officer at the airport . [ … ]
She was arrested about 8 a.m. outside Terminal C , home to United Airlines , Jet Blue and other carriers .
A Massachusetts Port Authority staffer manning an information booth in the terminal became suspicious when Simpson – wearing the device – approached to ask about an incoming flight , Pare said .
Simpson then walked outside , and the information booth attendant notified a nearby trooper .
The trooper , joined by others with submachine guns , confronted her at a traffic island in front of the terminal .
Geez .
She ’s lucky to be alive .
What in the world was she thinking ?
EDITED TO ADD ( 9/21 ) : Okay , clearly we need a lot more information :
The woman later told police the circuit board with lights on it was a work of art .
And this :
“ She claims that it was just art and she was proud of the art and wanted to display it .
I am not sure why she had the Play - Doh in her hands .
She could not explain that , ” Pare said .
I have to admit that I would trust the authorities more if it were n’t Boston .
EDITED TO ADD ( 9/21 ) : Here ’s a picture .
I ’m leaning towards stupid police overreaction right now .
EDITED TO ADD ( 9/21 ) : Okay , she made it for MIT ’s career day :
“ She said that it was a piece of art and she wanted to stand out on career day , ” Pare said at a news conference .
Definitely stupid police overreaction .
Refuse to be terrorized , people !
EDITED TO ADD ( 9/21 ) : A better photo .
EDITED TO ADD ( 9/22 ) : More news .
I now have complete symathy for the student , and none for the police .
I wonder if anyone wore their DefCon badge to the Las Vegas airport this year .
EDITED TO ADD ( 9/26 ) : Really good information here :
Last week was Career Week at MIT .
As usually happens during such events , the students turned out in high numbers to speak with company representatives
and examine the “ free ” items that are handed out to students who visit certain booths .
Star Simpson , an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science major who enjoys playing around with electronics , wore a bulky handmade nametag to the event .
It consisted of a breadboard , LEDs in the shape of a star ( for her name ) , some wires , and a nine - volt battery .
She taped it to her sweatshirt to keep it in place , possibly hoping that the company representatives would better be able to remember a student with a flashing nametag .
She also , as is custom , acquired a number of neat little items from the vendors there .
I ’ve seen some of what was available – bleach pens for clothing , large foam ‘ pills ’ that you could squeeze as a method of stress relief , small containers of Play - Doh .
She picked up a canister of Play - Doh and placed it in her pocket .
Some time after this – I do n’t know how long , sorry – she went to the Logan Airport to meet a friend of hers .
I can easily see her losing track of time and being too rushed to put her sweatshirt away before leaving .
Or perhaps she forgot the breadboard entirely – just as someone with a bandaged wrist will soon ignore its presence .
Or perhaps she thought no one would care — she is from MIT , after all , and the culture here does not regard breadboards as weapons of mass destruction .
Or perhaps she thought that it would n’t matter , since she knew that she would not be going through the security checkpoint .
And the authories are going to make her pay for their mistake .

My first experience was with a life - long lesbian , and , given her experience and comfort with the whole thing , she took the lead .
I was n't really aware of that because , as a life - long heterosexual , it did n't play out all that differently from the encounters I 'd had with men ( until we started touching each other , that is ) .
A few months later I met Jen through a mutual friend .
Jen and I had a lot in common and as we chatted we learned we had something very interesting in common : we both wanted to have sex with another woman .
This revelation came very early in our friendship , and we were obviously attracted to each other , so it seemed inevitable we would end up in bed together .
Jen had never been with a woman before , though , so as the more experienced person I ended up taking the lead , taking the male role .
So there we were , two young , healthy , horny women , hot for each other .
I figured getting her naked would be no big deal .
Was I fucking mistaken .
We went on date after date , talking endlessly about who knows what .
The whole time I could n't relax - I kept trying to read her signals , what she said , her body language , trying to figure out if tonight would be the night .
It was very strange - I usually loved talking with girlfriends , but this just made me feel exhausted and stupid .
What was I doing wrong ?
Why could n't I make it happen ?
And then it dawned on me : this is what guys do ALL THE TIME .
So we did eventually do it , and we had a great time .
I thought after that I would be more relaxed , but I was wrong again .
It did get easier with each successive encounter , but only slightly .
I still felt that pressure to read her mind .
Only after 3 or 4 times did I finally feel comfortable with her , and then she moved out of town .
We still email and see each other occasionally .
So guys , I have seen into your world , and I can say now , you definitely have it tougher than we do .
I feel your pain .
And ladies , if you 're reading this , go easy on them .
If you want to get it on , just let them know .
They 're killing themselves trying to figure it out .
And that 's just getting in the way of some potentially good fucking .
エロ動画に出演しているAV女優は、普通に見た目がかわいい子も最近ではあまり珍しくはない存在になってきていますね。
レベルが全体的に高くなって来ているエロ動画の業界において、新人のAV女優が出てくるのは新しい世界を広げるというか今まで見ることが出来なかったような物を発見することが出来たりして非常に興味深い物になっていますね。
その中でも、今注目を浴びているむっちり系の新人AV女優にあげることが出来る一人が野口まりやという名前の女の子です。
どんなAV女優か
むっちり系の体つきをしている全体的に肉付きがいいのが特徴的ですね。
エロくて見るからに美味しそうな体つきをしていて、白い肌をしているところが余計にそのムチムチ加減を際立たせているように見えます。
パッと見AV女優とは思えないような可愛らしい顔立ちをしていて目はぱっちりした大きな感じで鼻筋も通っていて唇がややぽってりとした厚みがあるところが吸いつきがよさそうで非常に魅力的です。
太っているわけではないのですが、むっちりした体つきが抱き心地がよさそうで、非常に男の性欲をそそるような見た目をしているのが特徴的です。
内面的にもかなりエロい感じの子でAVの作品でも大体積極的な姿勢をとることが多いですね。
男性に自分からオナニーを見せつけたり、おまんこをいじられると気持ちよさそうに幸せそうにうっとりした顔を浮かべるドMなところも特徴の一つに数えていいでしょう。
出演傾向
出演する作品は、企画系の作品が多いですね。
もともと、AV女優としてデビューした作品がいわゆる企画物でしかも複数の女優が出ている物ですので、そこから単体作品などにもちらほらと出演しています。
複数の企画物へのAV出演のほうが全体的に多く、単体でもJK物だったり巨乳物だったりと、むっちりした体つきをピックアップしているような物が多いですね。
パイズリ系や、ロリ系、中出し物などにも精力的に出演しており、非常に出演するAVのジャンルの傾向はかなり広い方ですね。
ストーリー系の物にも出るなど、演技力の方もそこそこで割とマルチな才能というか、マルチな方面でのAV出演をしており、いろんなジャンルでその姿を見ることができます。
割とばかばかしいというか、サイトでも人気なギャグ系のシチュエーションなども多数出演しており、かなりマニアックなジャンルの作品もカバーしています。
来歴
野 口まりやは、別名剛力美沙都や野口まりあなど複数の芸名を使い分けているAV女優です。
東京出身で、AV女優としてデビューしたのは2013年です。
元々、デビューしたのは複数女優の企画物だったのですが、そこからどんどん単体女優としても活躍するようになってきており、企画単体女優としてもAV女優出演をするようになってきました。
かわいい顔して、実は柔道四段という結構な武闘派でもありスポーツ少女でむっちりした体つきでありながらも太っているというようなイメージがないところも野口まりやの荷力の一つですね。
剛力美沙都の芸名では、おもに柔道家だったことを押し出したような作品に出演しており、AVでもよくある対決物のAVにも出演しています。
こちらでは、処女喪失をかけたAVとなっているのですがそもそもそれ以前にAV女優としてデビューしているので処女喪失自体は結局嘘だったわけですね。
しかし、やはり本物の柔道経験者なだけあって劇中での柔道の動きのキレは中々の物で、対決物のAVの中でも非常によくできている方の作品だと言っていいのではないでしょうか。
魅力
野 口まりやの魅力は、やはり柔道で鍛えたしっかりとした肉付きのあるむっちりした体つきでありながらもちゃんと引き締まっている部分があってメリハリのある体つきをしているところですね。
むちむちだけど太っていない、という一番エロい体つきをしているのでそれに夢中になってしまう人も多いかと思います。
顔立ちも、ちょっとかわいい芸人系の物なので親しみやすく好きな人はかなり好きというようなタイプなのも魅力の一つでしょう。
総括
いわゆる、むっちり系AV女優に入るのですがスポーツをやっていたのもあってむっちりしているけど、おっぱいとウェストとお尻とのくびれがしっかりしているところがとても魅力的です。
美味しそうなムチムチボディは、野口まりやの最大の武器で特にパイズリプレイのときなんかはチンポをむっちり挟み込む大迫力の映像になるのがいいですね。
Via Alternet :
Should the legal ties between parents and their adopted child unravel if the family leaves the state where the adoption decree was handed down ?
Of course not .
The very idea is outrageous .
But that 's what Oklahoma lawmakers were striving for in 2004 with their chillingly titled " Adoption Invalidation Law , " which targeted adopted children with gay parents .
That wrongheaded statute declared that Oklahoma would refuse to recognize " an adoption by more than one individual of the same sex from any other state or foreign jurisdiction . "
In other words , if a gay couple and the child they adopted in , say , California or Maryland moved to Oklahoma or simply drove through Oklahoma on vacation , they would not be treated as a legally recognized family by any Oklahoma official -- whether a police officer , public school teacher or judge .
Sounds un -American , does n't it ?
It 's also unconstitutional .
That 's what a federal court of appeals told Oklahoma on Aug. 3 in striking down the law .
A panel of three judges -- all of them Republican appointees -- of the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with a lower court ruling that Oklahoma 's anti-family law violated the U.S. Constitution 's Full Faith and Credit Clause , which requires states to honor one another 's judicial judgments , including adoptions .

The two youths vandalised a children 's campsite
Peter Addison , of Heaton Mersey , Stockport , and his friend Mark Ridgeway of Poynton , Cheshire , smashed crockery and let off fire extinguishers .
Addison received a conditional discharge .
Ridgeway , 18 , must carry out 60 hours ' unpaid work .
Both pleaded guilty to burglary at Macclesfield Magistrates ' Court .
Addison was ordered to pay £ 725 compensation and £ 20 costs .
Ridgeway has to pay £ 20 costs .
There are some pretty stupid criminals around , but to leave your own name at the scene of the crime takes the biscuit
Inspector Gareth Woods
Apart from writing his own name in black marker pen at the Toc H centre in Adlington , Cheshire , Addison also left his gang 's name on the wall - The Adlington Massiv !.
The teenager vandalised a Garden Birds of Britain poster by adding " R Gay " .
He then left a final message to the campsite owners - " thanks for the stay " .
Police found him after entering his name in a computer system .
Inspector Gareth Woods , of Cheshire Police , said : " This crime is up there with the dumbest of all in the criminal league table .
" There are some pretty stupid criminals around , but to leave your own name at the scene of the crime takes the biscuit .
" The daftness of this lad certainly made our job a lot easier . "
Unpaper ist ein Nachbearbeitungswerkzeug für gescannte Papierseiten , insbesondere für Buchseiten , die aus zuvor erstellten Fotokopien gescannt wurden .
Der Hauptzweck besteht darin , gescannte Buchseiten nach der Konvertierung in PDF auf dem Bildschirm besser lesbar zu machen .
Darüber hinaus kann Un - Paper nützlich sein , um die Qualität der gescannten Seiten zu verbessern , bevor Sie die optische Zeichenerkennung ( OCR ) durchführen .
Unpaper versucht , gescannte Bilder zu bereinigen , indem es dunkle Kanten entfernt , die beim Scannen oder Kopieren von Bereichen außerhalb des eigentlichen Seiteninhalts entstanden sind ( z.B. dunkle Bereiche zwischen der linken und der rechten Seite eines doppelseitigen Buchseitenscans ) .
Das Programm versucht auch , eine falsch ausgerichtete Zentrierung und Drehung der Seiten zu erkennen und richtet jede Seite automatisch aus , indem es sie in den richtigen Winkel dreht .
Dieser Prozess wird als “ Deskewing ” bezeichnet .
Beachten Sie , dass die automatische Verarbeitung manchmal fehlschlägt .
Es ist immer eine gute Idee , die Ergebnisse von unpaper manuell zu kontrollieren und die Parametereinstellungen entsprechend den Anforderungen der Eingabe anzupassen .
Jeder Verarbeitungsschritt kann auch einzeln für jedes Blech deaktiviert werden .

Her face bloodied and battered , this is Bethany James , the latest victim of the pupil - on - pupil violence blighting Britain 's schools .
The appalling injuries inflicted on the 15 - year - old are shocking enough .
But what is more horrifying is that they were the work of two teenage girls .
This photo of Bethany was taken in hospital by her mother , Tracey James , who said : ' The picture is shocking .
I want people to know what the reality of bullying means . '
Scroll down for more ...
Bethany had been tormented by bullies at her school in Bradford , West Yorkshire , for four years – including being subjected to a torrent of insults and abusive text and internet messages .
But it was as she was leaving a video shop near her home in Undercliffe with friends on September 7 that she was beaten up .
She was kicked and punched to the ground by the girls , whom she recognised from school .
They pulled her hair and stamped on her head as she lay helpless on the pavement .
One friend called her mother , who arrived in time to pull one of the girls away from Bethany and drive the injured girl to Bradford Royal Infirmary .
Mrs James , a 46 - year - old hairdresser , and her husband Anthony rushed to the hospital .
Mr James , 47 , a telecoms engineer , said : ' It was horrific as a parent to see one of your children in a hospital bed covered in blood .
I could n't believe it .
It was only when I got to the hospital that I realised the full extent of the attack . '
Mrs James added : ' I 've never seen anything like it .
One of the doctors said she looked like she 'd been in a car crash .
' Her nose was split open , her mouth had been kicked and her braces caused lacerations , her lips were badly swollen , she was covered in blood , it was all over her clothes , and lumps of her hair were missing . '
Mrs James claimed teachers had failed to put a stop to the repeated bullying endured by her daughter at Immanuel CE Community College in Thackley .
She said : ' I 've been to the school on at least six occasions to tell them Bethany was being bullied , but it has continued .
' Since the attack she has been going to school for only two hours a day in the isolation unit , while these girls carry on as normal .
The school wants her back in class as soon as possible , but who wants to go back to these animals ? '
Two weeks on , Bethany is still in pain .
She said : ' My nose is still bruised and hurts at the top .
I 'm too embarrassed to go out . '
Police said two girls have been questioned as witnesses but no arrests have been made .
Chris Robinson , deputy head
at Immanuel College , said : ' Any bullying that the college becomes aware of is dealt with in a robust manner supported by the additional care we show for
each other through our strong Christian ethos . '
This is mostly the fault of Kevin Lawver ( that 's me ) .
At work , on August 6th , 2007 , one of our interns ( Freddie Maneiro ) suggested that we have a celebration of my awesomeness ( it 's been a running joke on this project ) .
This cracked me up , and I said there should be a International Day of Awesomeness , and said that I 'd post it to twitter , which I did .
That started a very funny , very un-serious conversation among my friends about just what this holiday would entail .
And well , here we are .
The International Day of Awesomness occurs every year on March 10th .
Why ?
Because that 's Chuck Norris ' birthday .
No offense to Mr. Norris , but this is n't really a salute to Chuck Norris , the man .
This is a tribute to the awesomeness of the the myth of Chuck Norris ( see the Wikipedia entry ) .
The International Day of Awesomeness is also strongly inspired by The Show with Ze Frank .
Ze 's year - long internship in the League of Awesomeness is something special , and if you did n't experience while it was going on , you should go back and watch the shows .
Ze and his audience frequently performed feats of awesomeness , which could be used as inspiration for your own feats .
Dan Lurie came up with the original tag line ( " Because everyone needs an excuse to be awesome " ) , and my daughter , May , came up with the new one .
A bunch of people endorsed the date .
I 'm open to suggestions for where we take this next .
This is a single page and only took about an hour to build .
The domain name only took about five minutes to register .
What I 've done so far is not awesome , but I think this day could be extremely awesome .
Any ideas are welcome !
So , there you have it : The International Day of Awesomeness .
How will you be awesome ?
What feats of awesomeness will you perform ?
If you 're planning an event for The International Day of Awesomeness , Chris Radcliff has set up an umbrella event you can post your event to !
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled today that terminally ill patients do not have the right to decide for themselves whether a potentially risky , but possibly life - saving , treatment is in their best interest :
WASHINGTON — Terminally ill patients do not have a constitutional right to be treated with experimental drugs , even if they likely will be dead before the medicine is approved , a federal appeals court said Tuesday .
The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned last year ’s decision by a smaller panel of the same court , which held that terminally ill patients may not be denied access to potentially lifesaving drugs .
The full court disagreed , saying in an 8 - 2 ruling that it would not create a constitutional right for patients to assume “ any level of risk ” without regard to medical testing .
“ Terminally ill patients desperately need curative treatments , ” Judge Thomas B. Griffith wrote for the majority .
But “ their deaths can certainly be hastened by the use of a potentially toxic drug with no proven therapeutic benefit . ”
In other words , if you ’re dying you still do n’t have the right to take the risk of undergoing a treatment that , while it could kill you , could also cure you .
Your wishes , your life , your choice to take the risk that a new treatment might mean the difference between dying in a month and seeing your child graduate college … none of that matters , because the government knows better than you do .
One of the two dissenters , Judge Judith Ann Rogers , said the following :
Today , the court rejects the claim that terminally ill patients who have exhausted all government approved treatment options have a fundamental right to access investigational new drugs .
The court ’s opinion reflects a flawed conception of the right claimed by the Abigail Alliance for Better Access to Developmental Drugs and a stunning misunderstanding of the stakes .
The court shifts the inquiry required by Washington v. Glucksberg , 521 U.S. 702 ( 1997 ) , by changing the nature of the right , by conflating the right with the deprivation , and by prematurely advancing countervailing government interests .
The court fails to come to grips with the Nation ’s history and traditions , which reflect deep respect and protection for the right to preserve life , a corollary to the right to life enshrined in the Constitution .
The court confuses this liberty interest with the manner in which the Alliance alleges that the liberty has been deprived , namely by denying terminally ill patients access to investigational medications under the narrow conditions described by the Alliance .
The court conflates the inquiry as to whether a fundamental right exists at all with whether the government has demonstrated a compelling interest , when strictly scrutinized , rendering its restrictive policy constitutional .
These missteps lead the court to rely upon how rights and liberties have been limited and restricted — addressing regulations to prevent fraud in the sale of misbranded and adulterated medications or safety restrictions applicable to all medicines for any palliative purpose — which says little about the historic importance of the underlying right of a person to save her own life .
. . .
In the end , it is startling that the oft - limited rights to marry , to fornicate , to have children , to control the education and upbringing of children , to perform varied sexual acts in private , and to control one ’s own body even if it results in one ’s own death or the death of a fetus have all been deemed fundamental rights covered , although not always protected , by the Due Process Clause , but the right to try to save one ’s life is left out in the cold despite its textual anchor in the right to life .
This alone is reason the court should pause about refusing to put the FDA to its proof when it denies terminal patients with no alternative therapy the only option they have left , regardless of whether that option may be a long - shot with high risks .
. . .
It bears outlining the history and common law basis for the Alliance ’s claim in order to demonstrate , once again , that the history and traditions of this Nation support the right of a terminal patient , and not the government , to make this fundamentally personal choice involving her own life .
Because judicial precedents and the historical record require strict scrutiny before upsetting rights of this magnitude , the FDA must demonstrate a compelling governmental interest before its policy restricting access can survive .
Which brings to mind this particular provision of the Constitution :
The enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people .
As well as this one :
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people .
Where , please tell me , does it say in the Constitution that the Federal Government has the right or the authority to tell someone who is terminally ill , or anyone for that matte , what chemical substances they can put in their bodies , and for what purpose ?
And , more important , where is the justice in a legal system where people who are dying are forbidden from doing everything they want to do to try to stay alive ?
Have you ever wondered how Adolph Hitler - a mediocre painter of Austrian origin - transformed himself into Germany 's Fuhrer during the 1930s and 1940s ?
The Nazi phenomenon was no historical coincidence , and far less a philosophical whim made real by just one man .
Nazism had its followers , many of them exceptionally wealthy , veritable alchemists of the financial world back then .
According to research carried out over the last few years , Wall Street bankers ( amongst others ) financed Hitler 's rise to power whilst making large profits at the same time .
What is yet still more deplorable is the fact that relatives of the current U.S. president were amongst this group of individuals .
U.S. authors Webster G. Tarpley and Anton Cheitkin reveal in the recently published George Bush : The Unauthorized Biography that Prescott Bush ( George W. Bush 's grandfather ) and other directors of the Union Banking Company ( UBC ) were Nazi collaborators .
The book relates how in 1922 - when national socialism was emerging - railroad impresario W. Averell Harriman traveled to Berlin and interviewed the Thyssen family with a view to founding a German - U.S. bank .
The Thyssens were already behind - the - scenes owners of several financial institutions that allowed them to transfer their money from Germany to the Netherlands and from there onto the United States .
The banks in question were the August Thyssen Bank whose headquarters were located in Berlin ; the Bank voor Handel ( Netherlands ) and the Union Banking Corporation ( New York ) .
At the beginning of the 1920s , one of the members of this family , Fritz Thyssen - author of I Paid Hitler - contributed some $ 25,000 USD to the recently formed German National Socialist Workers '
Party , becoming the prime and most important financier of the Fuhrer in his ascent to power .
According to the book 's authors , Thyssen was fascinated by Hitler , citing his talent as a public speaker and his ability to lead the masses .
However , what impressed him most was the order that prevailed at his rallies and the almost military discipline of his followers .
And so , in 1931 Thyssen joined the Nazi party , becoming one of the most powerful members of the Nazi war machine .
At that time , the magnate presided over the German Steel Trust , a steel industry consortium founded by Clarence Dillon , one of Wall Street 's most influential men .
One of Dillon 's most trustworthy collaborators was Samuel Bush : Prescott 's father , George Senior 's grandfather and great - grandfather of the current U.S. president George W. Bush .
In 1923 , Harriman and the Thyssens decided to set up a bank and appointed George Herbert Walker - Prescott 's father - in - law - as president .
Later , in 1926 , they established the Union Banking Corporation ( UBC ) with Prescott Bush at the helm .
That same year , he was also named vice president and partner at Brown Brothers Harriman .
Both firms allowed the Thyssens to send money to the United States from Germany via the Netherlands .
U.S. economist Victor
Thorn has noted that although a large number of other corporations aided the Nazis ( such as Standard Oil and Rockefeller 's Chase Bank , as well as U.S. automobile manufacturers ) Prescott Bush 's interests were much more profound and sinister .
Thorn adds that UBC became a secret channel to protect Nazi capital leaving Germany for the United States via the Netherlands .
When the Nazis needed to retrieve their funds , Brown Brothers Harriman sent them directly to Germany .
In this way , UBC received money from the Netherlands and Brown Brothers Harriman sent it back .
And who was on the executive of both of these companies ?
Prescott Bush himself , the Nazis ' first money launderer .
In their book , Tarpley and Chaitkin explain that in this way a significant part of the Bush family 's financial base is related to supporting and aiding Adolph Hitler .
Therefore , the current U.S. president , just like his father ( former CIA director , vice president and president ) reached the peak of the U.S. political hierarchy thanks to his great - grandfather and grandfather and generally his entire family , who financially aided and encouraged the Nazis .
Some time later , in October 1942 , the U.S. authorities confiscated Nazi bank funds from the New York UBC , whose then president was Prescott .
The firm was condemned as a financial and commercial collaborator with the enemy and all its assets were seized .
Later , the U.S. government also ordered the seizure of the assets of a further two leading financial agencies directed by Prescott through the accounts of the Harriman banking institution : the Holland - America Trading Corporation ( a U.S. - Dutch commercial firm ) and the Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation .
Then on November 11 , 1942 , an embargo was imposed on the Silesian - American Corporation - another firm headed by Bush and Walker - under the same Trading with the Enemy Act .
However , in 1951 , the embargo was lifted and the enterprising businessman recovered some $ 1.5 million USD , earmarked for new investments largely to swell the Bush family 's patrimony .
To this should be added a resumé of files belonging to Dutch and U.S. information services confirming the direct links between Prescott Bush , the German Thyssen family and the blood money of a group of rich U.S. families from the Second World War .
Tarpley and Chaitkin affirm that the great financial crash of 1929 - 1931 affected the United States , Germany and Britain , weakening their respective governments .
At the same time , Prescott Bush became even more diligent , still more desirous of doing everything that was necessary to safeguard his place in the world .
It was during this crisis that some members of the Anglo - U.S wealthy class supported the installation of Hitler 's regime in Germany .
To sum up , the authors categorically state that the Bush family 's fortune arose as a result of its unconditional support for Adolph Hitler 's political project .
The UBC , under Prescott Bush 's direction and with the long - term cooperation of Fritz Thyssen 's German Steel Trust participated in the emergence , preparation and financing of the Nazi war machine through the manufacture of armored vehicles , fighter planes , guns and explosives .
The Bush family 's habit of dominating territories and wealth is nothing new .
Their fascist genes were generated during the 1930s .
Therefore defining the occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq and the threats to other countries as a continuance of blitzkreig offensives as fascist is no blunder .
Neither is convening an anti-fascist front is a rhetorical exercise .

Scores of Haitian refugees killed in shark - infested waters
By Bill Van Auken
7 May 2007
The deaths of over 75 Haitian refugees , whose boat capsized in shark - infested Caribbean waters as they sought to make their way to the United States , is one more tragic consequence of the stark poverty and protracted political oppression that have been inflicted upon the island nation .
Washington announced Saturday that the US Coast Guard had suspended its search for more than 40 Haitian immigrants who were missing after their 25 - foot boat — crowded with some 160 people — capsized the day before .
The bodies of 36 others — 23 men and 13 women — were recovered , many of them missing limbs and badly mauled by sharks .
The ship floundered off the British colonial territory of the Turks and Caicos , about 100 miles north of Haiti and a frequent first stop for refugees trying to make their way to the US .
A US Coast Guard spokesman told the Associated Press Saturday that Turks and Caicos authorities had asked for a suspension of the search , “ apparently because they believed the likelihood of finding more survivors was very slim . ”
British investigators are conducting a probe into the catastrophe .
According to initial reports , the boat capsized after it had been intercepted by Turks and Caicos police and was being towed towards land .
The British colonial authorities collaborate closely with Washington in an attempt to prevent Haitian refugees from reaching the US .
Survivors of the disaster are being held in a detention camp on the Turks and Caicos main island of Providenciales .
Authorities rebuffed attempts by members of the local Haitian community to speak with them and offer assistance .
They will soon be deported back to the country they fled .
There are unmistakable indications that the flow of refugees from Haiti is once again rising .
Last month , the US Coast Guard captured a total of 704 Haitians seeking to reach the US , nearly equal to the total number interdicted in all of 2006 .
The numbers are the highest since 2004 , when over 3,000 Haitians fled their island nation in the wake of a bloody US - backed coup by ex-soldiers and death squad leaders that ousted the government of elected President Jean - Bertrand Aristide .
Last March 28 , over 100 Haitian migrants — including 13 children — reached the Florida coast after a harrowing three - week voyage in a rickety sailboat during which one of the refugees died .
The survivors of the voyage were rounded up by Border Patrol agents and hauled off to south Florida detention centers to face what US immigration officials refer to as “ expedited removal proceedings . ”
The treatment of these Haitian migrants stands in stark contrast to the reception granted Cubans who reach the US coast by the same means .
Under the “ wet - foot , dry - foot ” policy implemented by the Clinton administration in 1994 , any Cuban migrant setting foot on US land is allowed to stay .
Haitians have also been denied temporary protected status , or TPS , which has been granted to refugees from nine countries , including three in Central America and several in Africa .
These refugees are given a renewable stay of deportation for 12 - to - 16 months .
The selection of these countries is made on the basis of existing wars , political crises , natural disasters or the inability of governments to handle the repatriation of their citizens .
On all accounts , Haiti confronts among the worst conditions in the world .
It is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere , with an estimated 80 percent of the population living on less than $ 150 a year .
Remittances sent home by expatriates working in the US and other countries constitute Haiti ’s largest source of income , amounting to 30 percent of the gross domestic product and twice the national budget .
Political instability and repression continue , despite the election of President René Préval , a former Aristide ally .
UN occupation troops have continued to clash with residents of poor neighborhoods , claiming scores of lives , while in some parts of the country right - wing death squads remain active .
Moreover , the impoverished island nation has yet to recover from severe damage inflicted by successive hurricanes .
A bill providing TPS for Haitian migrants was introduced in the US House of Representatives at the beginning of the year .
A similar measure initiated in 2005 died in a House subcommittee .
The vast majority of those Haitians intercepted at sea as well as those detained on land are shipped back to Haiti .
The few who are able to establish their refugee status by convincing an immigration judge that they have “ credible fear of persecution ” are shipped to the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba where they are held in a detention center .
US immigration authorities are using the US military base for the same reason that the Bush administration selected it to house its infamous prison for so - called enemy combatants — to deny basic democratic rights on the spurious grounds that the base is not US territory .
Last month , the Bush administration and the Australian government of Prime Minister John Howard announced a cynical and macabre scheme in which a “ swap ” of Haitian as well as Cuban refugees held by Washington at Guantanamo will be made for refugees that Australia is holding — most of them Sri Lankans and Burmese — on the Pacific island of Nauru .
The blatantly illegal deal treats refugees , many of them traumatized , as little more than livestock that can be traded on an international market .
The aim of the scheme is obvious .
Both governments hope that by transporting these refugees many thousands of miles away from the countries where they had originally sought asylum , they will deny them contact with family , friends and compatriots .
This cruel punishment , both countries hope , will serve to discourage others tempted to escape intolerable conditions in their homelands .
With the ongoing debacle in Iraq , it is seldom recalled in the mass media or in establishment circles that the US administration also bears direct responsibility for the catastrophic conditions in Haiti .
Within less than a year of the US invasion of Iraq , Washington orchestrated a right - wing coup and then sent in special forces troops to kidnap and forcibly evict Aristide from the country , paving the way for an occupation by some 1,500 US marines who were used to prop up a US puppet regime .
As in Iraq , Bush claimed that US intervention was launched for purely altruistic motives , seeking to “ bring order and stability to Haiti ” and give the country ’s people “ a hopeful future . ”
Within short order , however , faced with pressing military demands in Iraq , the US administration washed its hands of Haiti , redeploying the Marines to the Middle East and handing the dirty work of occupying Haiti over to a UN force led by Brazilian troops .
The episode was only the latest in a century - long use of US military and economic might to suppress the Haitian people and prevent revolutionary social change in the island nation .
This included the US occupation of the country from 1915 to 1934 and its support of the three - decade - long dictatorship of the Duvalier dynasty .
Thus , those risking their lives to escape Haiti today on ramshackle boats sailing through shark - infested waters are fleeing conditions for which Washington bears principal responsibility .
The cruel and punitive treatment that they receive from US authorities , including the latest proposal to forcibly “ transport ” them to Australia , represents one more in a long litany of crimes .

The UAW has struck General Motors , and as you read this , pickets are going up through Michigan and across the country .
It 's a strike that -- as the UAW explains -- is primarily about health care .
As you know if you 've been following the story , the big questions are 1 ) whether the UAW will accept the risk of health care liability by bringing its GM members out of the employer - sponsored plan and into a union - controlled health trust called a VEBA , and 2 ) how much GM is willing to put into the VEBA to get it started .
The lack of national health care is at the core of American automakers ' difficulties -- it 's the reason why Canadian plants are more profitable than American plants , despite the fact that Canadian auto workers make as much ( if not more ) than their American bretheren .
Hell , it 's a big part of the reason that the Canadian Auto Workers union split off from the UAW in the ealy ' 80s , when the Canadian locals were offered a better deal than the Americans .
It 's just cheaper for manufacturers to build in Canada , because all employers ( even Wal - Mart ! ) are on a level playing field when it comes to health costs .
But as critical of an issue as health insurance is , this strike is about something even bigger .
It 's about whether we 're going to have a middle class in this country .
The UAW was at the heart of the creation of what we know as the American middle class -- more than any other force in society , it institutionalized the idea that workers should be entitled to health care , vacation , and a secure and comfortable retirement .
Before the rise of the UAW , blue - collar workers had no hope of securing their family and their future , and lived in constant fear of injury or layoff , with no prospect of anything resebling " retirement . "
The UAW changed that .
The UAW made sure that the workers at the base of the postwar boom got their share .
The UAW made it possible for a man like my grandfather , a brilliant guy from the Irish ghetto in Buffalo who never had the opportunity to study past high school , to send every single one of his kids to college .
And the victories won by the UAW bore fruit well beyond the homes of their members -- because of the size and importance of the union , every UAW contract had a massive ripple effect .
Employers in other industries -- even non-union employers -- had to raise their standards to attract employees .
In short , the UAW allowed workers to get a taste of a life where leisure was possible , where relaxation and economic security were something that could be earned with hard work , and where their labor was treated with honor and dignity .
All of that has been under assault for the past 25 years .
The prevailing political forces have been pushing to dismantle the network of fairness and justice on the job woven by the UAW and its visionary leader , Walter Reuther .
And it 's no secret that the union has lost influence in direct relation to the decline of American manufacturing .
But as the UAW stands out on strike to win a fair settlement that protects their heath care , and the health care that every American deserves as a matter of right , they 're standing for all of us once more .
Do n't for a second let the media try and convince you that this is an isolated fight , the dying throes of a union in decline .
This is a fight for the fundamental idea that if you work hard , and play by the rules , you should be able to sleep contented at night knowing that you and your family have got health insurance and a fair pension .
And if that 's not a fight that every American should support as much as they can , then there really is no such thing as society .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The top aide to White House political adviser Karl Rove refused to answer at least a dozen questions from a Senate committee Thursday about the firings of eight U.S. attorneys last year , asserting -- as expected -- a claim of executive privilege by President Bush .
Jennings , right , consults with attorney Mark Paoletta before declining to answer a question .
Scott Jennings , who also is a special assistant to Bush , arrived at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with his attorney , Mark Paoletta , to avoid a contempt citation .
The panel had subpoenaed both Jennings and Rove , but Rove refused to show up , angering Chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont .
" I consider that blanket claim ( of executive privilege ) to be unsubstantiated , " Leahy said he told Jennings before the meeting .
White House Counsel Fred Fielding had informed the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that Rove , " as an immediate adviser to the president , " can't be ordered to testify and was told not to attend .
Sen . Dick Durbin , D - Illinois , asked Jennings , " Where is Karl Rove ?
Why is he hiding ?
Why does he throw a young staffer like you into the line of fire while he hides behind the White House curtains ? "
The White House says it is trying to protect the president 's ability to receive candid advice and offered to let top aides discuss the firings only if they were not placed under oath and no transcript was taken .
The senators sought answers about e-mail sent by dozens of White House staff using e-mail accounts provided through a Republican National Committee Internet address .
In March , congressional investigators found evidence that White House staffers had used those e-mail accounts to discuss government business -- including the firings of the U.S. attorneys -- in violation of the Presidential Records Act .
The law is aimed at keeping government business separate from partisan political activities .
Last month , the House Judiciary Committee expanded its executive privilege fight with the White House to the RNC , formally demanding information from the RNC e-mail accounts .
Leahy asked Jennings why he had used his RNC e-mail account to set up a conference call to discuss U.S. Attorney Tim Griffin .
In June 2006 , the Justice Department informed Bud Cummins , then - U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas , that he would be replaced by Tim Griffin , a former lieutenant of Rove who had recently returned from service as a military lawyer .
Griffin began the job in December as an interim federal attorney .
He resigned in June as the controversy increased .
Jennings replied : " Senator , pursuant to the president 's assertion of executive privilege over consideration , deliberations or communications related to the U.S. attorneys matter , I must respectfully decline to answer your question at this time , " an answer that he gave on many times during his testimony .
As Jennings repeatedly refuses to answer , he 's accused of getting paid to ' stonewall ' »
Jennings also was asked whether he had sent an e-mail to Monica Goodling , then - counsel to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , about New Mexico U.S. Attorney David Iglesias , who was fired late in 2006 .
Jennings worked for the president 's re-election campaign in New Mexico in 2004 .
" Were you in contact in that capacity with Monica Goodling at the Department of Justice ? " Durbin , D asked .
Jennings : " No , not that I recall . "
Durbin : " Were you aware of any conversations by members of Congress or members of the White House staff with Mr. Iglesias about the conduct of his office in New Mexico ?
Jennings : " No , I 'm not aware of any conversations that were taking place . "
When Jennings was quizzed about whether he had communicated with Goodling via e-mail about New Mexico politics after he had worked in that state , he said he could n't recall .
Durbin then pulled out an e-mail exchanged between Jennings and Goodling in June 2006 , and asked Jennings to explain it .
Jennings declined , invoking executive privilege .
According to Gonzales , Republican Sen. Pete Domenici , New Mexico 's senior senator , complained to Gonzales about Iglesias in the fall of 2005 , saying the U.S. attorney " was in over his head . "
Iglesias contends Domenici wanted him to push harder on a corruption probe of state Democrats before last November 's midterm elections .
Jennings said he began using the RNC e-mail system because it was always available to him .
Eventually , he added , it became a kind of " default " e-mail address .
Sen .
Arlen Specter , the committee 's ranking Republican , who has sharply criticized Gonzales and repeated his desire to " end his tenure , " pushed to have Leahy agree to join Specter and other congressional leaders who seek a meeting with Bush in an effort to resolve the controversy over the firings .
But Leahy replied to the suggestion of resolving the impasse with , " If I thought that there was any willingness to work it out instead of stonewalling , I would feel a lot better about this . "
The privilege claim can be challenged in court .
But Specter has said the courts would be unlikely to resolve any challenge before Bush leaves office .
Vice President Dick Cheney dismissed the congressional investigation of the attorney firings as a " witch hunt " during a CNN interview Tuesday .
Democratic congressional leaders , however , say administration officials have been unable to answer their most basic questions -- who compiled the list of prosecutors to be dismissed , and why were they selected ?
" It is regretted that the committee has forced this action , as the president 's offer of accommodation to you and to the House Judiciary Committee could have provided information being sought in a manner respectful of presidential prerogatives and consistent with a spirit of comity , " Fielding wrote .
But Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vermont , accused the White House of trying to cover up Rove 's role in the firings .
He questioned why Rove discussed the matter publicly when the issue first made news , but now " is suddenly unable to talk it about when he is under oath . "
" Mr. Rove has given reasons for the firings that have now been shown to be inaccurate , after - the - fact fabrications , " Leahy said in a statement issued Wednesday evening .
" Yet he now refuses to tell this committee the truth about his role in targeting well - respected U.S. attorneys for firing and in seeking to cover up his role and that of his staff in the scandal . "
Mark Paoletta , a lawyer for Jennings , told CNN his client will appear before the Judiciary Committee but would refuse to answer questions he feels are covered by executive privilege .
Former White House political director Sara Taylor testified under similar circumstances in July .
The White House already has invoked executive privilege to block previous testimony by Taylor and former White House counsel Harriet Miers , who skipped a hearing in the House two weeks ago , and to keep Chief of Staff Josh Bolten from turning over documents subpoenaed as part of the inquiry .
The panel voted to cite Miers and Bolten for contempt of Congress for failing to comply with subpoenas .
The decision on whether to pursue any action on those citations lies with the Justice Department .
The privilege claim can be challenged in court .
But Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee , has said the courts would be unlikely to resolve any challenge before Bush leaves office .
Vice President Dick Cheney dismissed the congressional investigation of the attorney firings as a " witch hunt " during a CNN interview Tuesday .
Democratic congressional leaders , however , say administration officials have been unable to answer their most basic questions -- who compiled the list of prosecutors to be dismissed , and why were they selected ?
While the Bush administration has maintained that the prosecutors ' firings were handled properly , the controversy has led to the resignations of at least three top Justice Department officials and triggered widespread criticism of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , who repeatedly told a Senate committee in April that he did not recall details of the firings .
Critics say the attorneys were forced out for political reasons , such as for failing to bring voter fraud cases pushed by Republican activists , and administration officials have acknowledged that one was fired to allow a Rove protege to take a post in Arkansas .

Special forces sometimes have to stay awake for 48 hours or more
Modafinil pills - known on the drugs scene as " zombies " - are used to treat the rare sleeping disorder narcolepsy .
The Ministry of Defence reportedly stockpiled thousands of pills ahead of the Iraq war but they have never been given to combat personnel .
Defence contractor Qinetiq told the commons ' science committee the drug had recently been tested for military use .
Qinetiq scientist Dr Anna Casey told the Science and Technology Committee the MoD funded research into stimulant and performance - enhancing drugs and dietary supplements .
" One is always looking for something that would give military personnel an extra edge , " she told the committee which is investigating the use of such drugs in sport .
' Safety concerns '
She said the military was not under the same constraints as the International Olympic Committee , which had banned Modafinil and another stimulant , Ephedrine , which she said had also been tested by the MoD .
But Erythropoietin , or EPO , which is used by athletics drug cheats to boost the production of red blood cells had been ruled out due to " safety concerns " .
She stressed that no illegal substances were being researched by the MoD .
But she said Modafinil had been " shown to enhance physical and mental performance " .
" There is still research going on into things like that .
It does n't mean they are being used .
We are keeping an open mind , " she told the MPs .
Modafinil has also been trialled by the US and French military but its use remains controversial .
' Zombies '
It works by " turning off " a person 's need to sleep , and allowing them to remain mentally awake for days on end .
Its makers say there are no side effects , but experts are worried about the drug being abused .
In the US , where it is easier to get hold of , revising students and clubbers are known to use it to keep going .
Speaking after Wednesday 's hearing in Westminster , Dr Casey said Modafinil had recently been tested by Qinetiq , formerly known as the Defence Research Agency .
It had not yet been approved for use by British soldiers but Qinetiq had asked the MoD for funds to carry out further tests , she said .
" It is worthy of further research , " she told the BBC News website .
' Human science '
Ephedrine , which is similar in effect to amphetamine or " speed " , had so far been ruled out for use by British combat personnel due to its side effects , which included anxiety .
But caffeine was " something we may well end up using in the future , " she added .
She said the MoD was also funding research into " human science " , including the enhancement of the physical and mental performance of combat personnel .
Among other things , scientists are investigating new dietary supplements and remote monitoring technology , allowing soldiers ' physical performance to be tracked in the field .
Under pressure
The consortium will also be looking at ways of improving the performance of combat personnel in hot climates such as Iraq , to cut down the amount of time , currently about a week , needed for them to acclimatise .
There has long been a demand for reliable stimulants for use by special forces , who may be expected to go 48 hours or more without sleep , and pilots on long flights .
The issue came under the spotlight in April 2002 , when two US military pilots mistakenly bombed a Canadian infantry unit in Afghanistan , killing four .
During the ensuing legal arguments , the pilots ' lawyers said they had felt under pressure to take amphetamines before the mission .

This is the latest shock image to
jolt the fashion industry into
action over the problem of
anorexia .
The picture of emaciated
Isabelle Caro , 27 , an anorexic
who weighs just 31 kilos ( 4 stone ,
12lb ) , has been displayed on
Milan billboards as the city
celebrates its fashion week .
Caro , who is French and has
her own blog site , said that she
had suffered from anorexia since
she was 13 as the result of a
" difficult childhood " .
Scroll down for more ...
She added : " I 've hidden myself
and covered myself for too long .
Now I want to show myself
fearlessly , even though I know my
body arouses repugnance .
" I want to recover because I
love life and the riches of the
universe .
I want to show young
people how dangerous this
illness is . "
Should size zero models be banned from the catwalk ?
Join the debate in readers ' comments below ...
The campaign was paid for by
Italian clothing company Flash &
Partners to publicise a fashion
brand for young women called
Nolita and the photograph was
taken by Italian photographer
Oliviero Toscani .
Flash & Partners said in a statement
that Toscani's aim was " to
use the naked body to show
everyone the reality of this
illness , caused in most cases by
the stereotypes imposed by the
world of fashion " .
Many people blame the fashion
industry and the obsession with
stick - thin size zero models for
the rise in cases of anorexia .
Calls for action within the
British fashion industry led to a
full - scale investigation into the
problems by a panel of experts
this year .
The report by the Model Health
Inquiry , which was published
last week on the eve of London
Fashion Week , made 14
recommendations including requiring
models to pass medical checks
before being allowed on the
catwalk and barring appearances
from those under 16 .
Unveiling the report , chairman
of the inquiry , Baroness
Kingsmill , slammed the fashion
world for allowing young girls to
be exploited .
" Just because modelling is seen
as glamorous , [ the industry ]
seems to think it is outside
normal health and safety issues , "
she said .
" It is time it started taking care
of its workers . "
But London has failed to go as
far as Madrid and Milan , where
the authorities have banned the
appearance of ultra-skinny
models on catwalks by forcing models
to carry certificates proving they
are healthy .
The move , which dominated
Milan Fashion
Week last year ,
followed the death of 22 - year - old
model Luisel Ramos , who
collapsed at a show in Uruguay .
It
was claimed she had gone days
without eating properly .
Speaking at the time , Tiziana
Maiolo , Milan 's city council
official in charge of promoting
fashion , said : " We will work together
with modelling agencies , with
the chamber of commerce for
fashion and with doctors to
ensure that the agencies and
stylists do not favour this
phenomenon of anorexia .
" I do n't think men want to see
skeletal women and I want to
say to women who are fuller -
figured there is absolutely
nothing wrong with this .
They are
undoubtedly the prettiest
women about and the most
intelligent . "
Despite this , fashion designers
in Milan dismissed fashion as
having anything to do with the
illness .
Commenting on the poster
Giorgio Armani said he thought
such a shocking image was
' opportune ' as a way of making
people face up to the dangers of
anorexia , which he said had
little to do with models on
catwalks .
He added : " Anorexia has
reasons which are not linked to
fashion .
Even people who take
no notice of fashion get
anorexic . "
Designers Domenico Dolce and
Stefano Gabbana said : " Finally
someone is saying the truth
about anorexia that it has
nothing to do with fashion but is
a psychiatric problem .
" We have always maintained
this despite all the political
campaigns on the argument . "
However , Italy 's health
minister Livia Turco backed the
campaign and said : " The disturbing
image of Isabelle Caro could
open an original channel for
communication and encourage
people to shoulder their
responsibilities in the area of
anorexia . "

" ... the chief end I propose to myself in all my labours is to vex the world rather than divert it . "
- Jonathan Swift
AN OPRAH FIASCO
This will be a rather long item , but it deals with an important subject – how Oprah Winfrey manages to promote woo - woo ideas on her program by careful management of the content .
Before we begin , you must understand how TV programs are recorded and put together for later broadcast .
First and most important is the image of the host ; this must be supported , and audience expectations must be met in that regard .
Second , the sponsors must be satisfied that nothing unpopular or politically incorrect is used ; that wo n’t sell the product .
Third , secondary guests are expendable , and are there only to be used , in any way that serves the intent of the producers .
Back in April of 1995 , I ’d been contacted by the Oprah show and made an offer to do a second appearance with them .
I simply told them , “ No thanks ” ; I ’d already been sandbagged by that show .
In that appearance , I ’d been told , just before I left my hotel for the studio , that the previously - scheduled “ psychics ” – for whom I was well prepared – would not be showing up .
I went all the way out to the location and then found out , moments before the show went on the air – live – that those major " psychics " actually were appearing on the show .
Though I ’d prepared video and newspaper material to contradict the pompous and false claims of those two scheduled “ psychics , ” I ’d left the data behind at the hotel when told I 'd be without opposition , and I had nothing in hand .
It was a blatant , calculated lie designed to trap me , and I fell for it .
But I ’d not do it again .
I 'm sure Oprah does n't need me , and I have no need of such unethical behavior .
There are rules , even though Oprah does n't seem to know them .
Recently , Oprah Winfrey aired a lopsided interview with “ psychic / mediums ” John Edward and Allison DuBois .
Things immediately took on a circus air when Oprah began by describing human life as “ vibrating energies . ”
The perfunctory skeptics were present , but of course the producers took great pains to be sure that they were ineffective .
One woman from Evansville , Indiana , who had repsonded to a call for skeptics , was handled as we might have expected .
Her sister , Cristina Michelassi , wrote to me :
My sister , Laura McMahon , was a guest on the Oprah Winfrey show taped Thursday , 2/8/07 , for a segment that was purported to be a discussion between skeptics and “ believers ” on the subject of psychics .
My sister believes in critical thinking and scientific study , and thought that the panel of guests would be open to having an intelligent discussion on the topic , albeit with their differing perspectives .
She had responded to the on-air call for show participants via Oprah 's website , explaining that she was skeptical in regard to paranormal or supernatural abilities that psychics claimed to possess .
I thought you might be interested in the account I 've written about the experience , as it illustrates how the producers of the show very deftly controlled and orchestrated the whole show to ensure an outcome that would be well received by Oprah 's audience .
Once again , it was made quite clear to me that most people will believe what they want to believe , no matter how much logic and facts are presented to them .
I am very thankful that you and your organization exist !
Cristina wrote this report :
I wish I could be writing to all of you about what a wonderful experience Laura had when she went on the Oprah Winfrey show , but the truth of the matter is that she did not .
We all knew beforehand that her viewpoint would not be the “ popular ” one , especially in such a venue as this show .
We did , however , hold some hope that it would offer an opportunity for a reasonable discussion about the topic , as she had been led to believe that there would be a panel interspersed with individuals who believed in psychic abilities and those who held a more skeptical view .
Unfortunately , this was not the case whatsoever , as she was the only guest on the show with a truly skeptical perspective .
Now that I 've had some time to reflect a bit on the whole process , it is quite apparent that the show is not ever meant to be a discussion about the topic at hand at all , but is instead a strictly controlled forum to showcase what Oprah 's audience wants .
Although the planning for this starts well before the topic 's blurb on the website looking for show participants , that blurb seems to be the initial “ hook ” which allows the producers to not only get a good sense of the audience 's position on a specific topic , but also to begin their search for individuals who , unbeknownst to them , will be filling the roles in the play that ’s already been scripted .
My brother , Roberto , said it best when he observed :
I think it is quite clear that this was all orchestrated to get the outcome they wanted .
The show is after all – business .
They obviously know their audience quite well – and set up a show that would appeal to them .
They needed to set up an environment where on the surface it appears as if they were really trying to be fair and balanced – so that the people on the fence might still get drawn into the show .
But they had to make sure that the outcome would be clear , and the one that they knew the majority of their audience would agree with .
The truth of this observation was evidenced by Oprah 's own behavior and remarks throughout the tapings of the two shows and the “ after show ” segment .
The producers seated Laura in the first row of the audience , directly across from Oprah .
The first guest to join Oprah on the stage was John Edward , a popular self - proclaimed psychic .
Each time he either related a “ supernatural ” experience from his past or a videotaped segment of one of his “ readings ” was shown , Oprah would immediately look at Laura , and rather than address her by name , would make remarks such as " What do you say to that , science lady ? " or " Any response , skeptic woman ? " and on one occasion , “ Skeptico ? ” directed at her with a questioning look .
The next step in fostering the show 's outcome was to bring into question Laura 's scientific background and education .
This was done by suddenly identifying a “ surprise ” guest in the audience who was introduced as a psychologist studying paranormal phenomena .
[ Randi : this was an electrical engineer , Dean Radin , author of “ The Conscious Universe ” ]
This man stated that there have been a lot of experiments and studies done in the last 100 years that have indicated to scientists that there 's " definitely something there . "
This meaningless statement seemed to sufficiently convince the audience that the whole of the scientific community worldwide believes in psychics , so who does " science lady " think she is ?
As the second show taping began , it became more obvious that we had been “ had . ”
Oprah related how some people believe that Harpo Studios [ where Oprah tapes ] is haunted by the spirits of the people who died when the Eastland ferry sank and the building was used as a temporary morgue to house their bodies .
Videotape was shown of various staff members claiming to have heard , seen or felt a supernatural presence while working in the studio alone late at night .
Then videotape was shown of one of the “ psychics ” on the show , walking around Harpo Studios late at night with a film crew , claiming to be experiencing precisely the very things the staff members had .
When asked about how the dead people looked , the “ psychic ” said they appear to her as whitish energy blobs .
Oprah chose this moment to admit , a bit hesitantly , that she herself had been visited once in the middle of the night by a presence that looked exactly as the psychic had just described !
( She does know how to act , after all ! )
When Oprah had announced who would be on the show , she had referred to Laura as a mother of two from Indiana who is a skeptic , “ Laura McMahon . ”
That was the only time she actually ever said Laura 's name .
Although she consistently addressed the other audience guests by their names , she never once addressed Laura by hers .
By the time Laura 's pre-taped “ reading ” was shown , the tide had pretty much turned .
When Laura told how the psychic was wrong in all her statements about our father save one , the response was that Laura was “ blocked , ” not open to receiving my father 's “ energy , ” and that she had issues with closeness and emotional ties .
In other words , it was her fault that the psychic had failed so miserably .
Whether you only met my sister once or have known her since her birth , I am confident in saying that all can attest to the fact that she is an extremely approachable human being .
On more than one occasion , total strangers have remarked upon her genuineness and warmth upon meeting her for the first time .
After the two shows were finished , they continued to tape the “ after show ” segment .
All three “ psychics ” claimed to possess these “ abilities ” because of their personal and special connection to God .
They insisted that their ability to speak with the dead , or predict the future , or get into a criminal 's mind , was a God - given gift that they constantly improved and perfected through meditation and prayer .
Oprah turned to Laura and asked her point - blank if she believed in God .
When Laura replied that she was a humanist , the audience reaction was one of total disapproval and disbelief , though I 'm quite sure the majority of them had absolutely no clue what a humanist is .
Oprah 's last remark to the audience before she left the stage was her admission that she believes in the supernatural .
We find here the tried - and - true ploy of casting aspersions on a victim by establishing that they ’re not superstitious or credulous , or might even be an agnostic or atheist ; being naïve is regarded as a highly admirable trait ..
It ’s a cheap shot , but it works .
Cristina continues :
If nothing else comes of this , just know that these shows are not interested in people , they do n't care to know your stories , they are n't interested in your joys or sorrows , and they certainly do n't want to bother with your thoughts …
They want good ratings , for continued monetary success .
And as Roberto said ,
I think that they do n't even consider us as real people .
We are just members of the " Audience , " a thing that is to be manipulated , cajoled and otherwise persuaded into behaving in a manner that delivers to them the rewards they so richly deserve .
Laura ’s husband Roberto also gave us his individual account of this event :
My wife Laura accepted an invitation to be a guest on the Oprah show , which was taped today , about mediums who speak to the dead .
She was identified by the show based upon a response to a question in which she wrote about her skepticism of this phenomenon .
She was flown to Chicago , where she was first asked to do a 1:1 reading with a psychic , who stated upon beginning the session that my wife would have to answer either " yes " or " no " to each of the medium 's questions about my wife 's deceased father – essentially reducing the exercise to a child 's game of “ 20 questions . ”
When my wife asked why she would have to do that if the medium could actually speak with the deceased , the medium rose out of her seat and proclaimed , " I ca n't work with this woman ! "
Eventually , she sat back down and continued the cold reading , but apparently the look on my wife 's face had already made her position clear .
Part of it was fairly offensive as the medium chuckled , in apparent response to something funny that my wife 's deceased father " said " to her .
The session finished , and my wife awaited the taping of the show .
While on the show , that same psychic misrepresented what she ’d said to Laura during the reading .
For example , she had told Laura that her father did n’t like to show his romantic side to his wife .
Laura had denied this , citing the numerous times that he ’d bought her jewelry or surprised her with flowers and chocolates .
And , on the broadcast – edited – show , the “ reader ” said that she had correctly gotten that the father liked to show his romantic side to his wife – the exact opposite of what she ’d “ divined . ”
Roberto continues :
Laura and I talked about how the taping of the show might go , and we certainly anticipated that she might not be the hero of this story , given the earnestness with which people seek out and buy into this type of activity .
We were not , however , prepared for what actually occurred at the taping .
As it turned out , my wife was not only the sole guest who did not believe , but was likely the only person in the entire audience or at least the only one courageous enough to voice her opinion .
The other guests were other famous mediums and a " professor " of paranormal psychology .
[ Randi : this was Radin , the electrical engineer . ]
As you can imagine , my wife was clearly out of her depth , and swimming with the big fish .
I 've just spoken with my wife after the taping , and it was a terribly difficult position for her as the audience , and to some degree , Oprah , hammered away at my wife for being " closed , " " blocked , " and " narrow minded . "
Oprah even had taken the position of calling my wife the " science lady " in a not - so - positive reference .
( I hold a Ph.D. in biochemistry , and my wife worked for quite a few years as a research assistant ) .
My wife actually sat next to John Edward during the taping , and after being reminded yet once again of her " blocked " state , turned to him and said " Are you getting any signals yet ? "
Needless to say it was a very challenging and , to be transparent , upsetting experience for my wife , particularly since we figured that while she would probably be in the minority , she would not be alone in her position .
Clearly our mistake .
I have told my wife that it took a person of enormous courage and character to stand up for her principles in such a highly emotionally charged and one sided environment .
I am struck by the thought that my wife was essentially fed to the lions in the taping of the show , which of course will probably make great television , but that under different circumstances she might have been cheered for standing up against this deplorable act of pretending to speak with the dead .
My wife and I can only imagine how she will be portrayed in what will be the final product , once the editing of the show is completed ...
Roberto , what your wife did was very courageous .
She saw the minefield she was walking into , and yet decided that the confrontation was worth risking .
Of course , she could not have anticipated the extent to which creative editing , selection , timing , and emphasis would be employed to slant the outcome of the show .
As I wrote above , even I was once the victim of this same process , at the hands of the Oprah team .
They got what they wanted : Oprah looked good , decisive , powerful ; the skeptical point of view was derided and suppressed .
An “ expert , ” Dean Radin , was pulled out of the air like a bunny from a hat , and presented as if he represented the scientific view on these matters .
No other really scientific point of view , which could have offered a very different opinion – though easily available to the producers – was presented .
Radin said his piece , and the show closed .
Laura , thank you , sincerely .
Without good folks like you to stand up against this humbuggery , we ’d have no soldiers out there to offer a defense of reason .
Oprah is powerful both in influence and image , and she ’s opted to join , support , and endorse the forces of woo - woo .
Her huge staff , her producers , and her money are brought into the battle against rationality and common sense , and she sees a God on her side , as well .
I ’ve known this ever since I saw her fall for Geller ’s spoon - bending on a co-hosted show out of Baltimore , many years ago , well before she was an icon of American – and international – television .
History will be the final judge …
A QUESTION TO BE ANSWERED
Our most excellent friend Dr. Hal Bidlack ( US Air Force , ret. ) is alarmed at the recent actions of Montel Williams in supporting the flummery of “ psychic ” Sylvia Browne .
He expresses himself eloquently at www.stopsylviabrowne.com/articles/openlettertomontel.shtml.
I suggest that you click in and see how he asks that Williams show some consideration and responsibility in his position as a former military man , and as a US citizen …
ANOTHER COMPLAINT SENT IN
Reader Daniel Calder rightfully points out what has happened to what we might assume to be a company connected with our friend Norman Edmund – who just turned a remarkable 91 years of age this last Tuesday , and is still active and frisky , and working on a new project .
Norm lives here in Florida , very near to the JREF .
His name is attached to the famous Edmund Scientific Company , and for many decades he dealt in science kits , scientific equipment , lenses , lab apparatus , and teaching tools .
And , he ’s written extensively on the subject .
Well , Norm is no longer connected with the company , which has leased out its name to other outlets , and essentially lost the pioneering attitude of the original organization .
A company known as “ Edmund Scientifics ” – note the attached “ s ” – is currently advertising quack devices and systems , a fact that got the attention of Mr. Calder .
He wrote to them :
Dear Edmund Scientifics ,
I am disturbed by the inclusion in your otherwise excellent science catalog of an item called a " Microcomputer Therapy Apparatus , " a product listed as # S30813 - 83 .
Link : www.scientificfun.com/details.php?pid=586766833.
In your online catalog , you claim that this device can " Diagnose and cure a range of acute and minor illnesses , " including " everything from diarrhea to arthritis . "
This device claims to do this by means of " the six traditional Chinese medical functions of hammering , acupuncture , naprapathy , cupping , scraping , and massage . "
If any one of these so - called " medical functions " has been shown through clinical trials to diagnose or cure any diseases , I am unaware of it .
Since such specific and important claims are made for this instrument , I believe that these claims need to be substantiated .
Please refer me to the peer - reviewed studies that back up these claims .
If no such studies exist , you have an obligation as an educational and scientific company to stop making these spurious health claims , and to remove this product from your Scientifics catalog .
I anxiously await your reply .
Well , Daniel , do n’t let your anxiety overpower you , because you ’ll get no response , I assure you .
Norm Edmund is as concerned as you are , and he ca n’t get an answer , either .
This is typical quackery at work , offering no evidence , nor communication .
It ’s a blind alley …
SNIFFEX CONTINUES TO DRONE ON
Correspondent “ Steve ” informs us :
In your latest commentary , you wrote : " ... page 42 of the Instruction Manual for this toy states ... " " ... doing a demo of their toy ... "
Maybe you need to re-read the manual .
On page 47 they plainly state ,
Keep Sniffex® away from children .
Sniffex® is not a toy .
Other than " Container 19 , " the " Sniffex is not a toy " line is one of my favorites .
After seeing the link to the apparently fake JamesRandi1 Myspace webpage someone posted on the JREF forum ( http://profile.myspace.com/jamesrandi1), the blog entries on that Myspace page , and the stuff on the freewebs webpage that the Myspace page links to , I would say Mr. Johnson does n't seem too happy with you .
Certainly we can't assume he created those pages , but it does seem to be someone close to the company and sympathetic to it .
Despite his opinion to the contrary , I think it is only fair that consumers are informed that the explosive detection product they might be considering buying is deemed by the scientific and engineering community as " bogus " and worthless .
From what I have seen on the internet , your site seems to be the only one with readily available information on the product and the fact that it has never been proven to work .
In fact , the Navy tests show pretty well that it does n't work at all .
Does Johnson 's comment in the e-mail exchange about not being able to afford to continue to sue you mean he dropped his lawsuit ?
If so , congratulations .
Steve , that is , as you surmised , a fake James Randi MySpace page .
Whoever put it up there , merely runs the correspondence I ’ve had with this strange Johnson person , all of which has already been published here .
The real MySpace page is at www.MySpace.com/theamazingrandi, though I admit that I ’ve not had the time to go there and peruse it to any extent .
Yes , Johnson dropped the suit as soon as he found that he’d be deposed by our lawyer .
Due to the remarkably inept way American law works , we were unable to collect any legal costs from Johnson ; the USA is the only country in the world where a civil legal attack does not call for the attacker to pay the legal expenses of the attacked if the case is lost or dropped .
Reader Doug Fraser opines :
The Sniffex reincarnation of the MOLE reincarnation of the Quadro tracker makes one wish that we could have a set of special laws to get these people behind bars immediately to protect the public good .
Anyway , as a science teacher , I routinely use your commentary examples in my classroom – both as serious examples of " bad evidence " quackery , pseudoscience etc. , and also as comic relief – these things really would be hilarious if they were not doing so much damage .
I also like to let these quacks know that they are the subject of discussions within our schools .
I try to make this point whenever I can – my hope is that they wo n't like the idea that they are being talked about and " made fun of " when they take themselves so seriously and often consider themselves quite clever .
Of course I could not do this without the wonderful examples afforded me in your weekly commentary for which I am most grateful .
HUXLEY SAID IT
The prominent biologist T.H. Huxley ( 1825 -1894 ) said and wrote many witty and perceptive things , among which is :
The only good that I can see in the demonstration of the truth of “ Spiritualism ” is to furnish an additional argument against suicide .
Better live a crossing - sweeper than die and be made to talk twaddle by a “ medium ” hired at a guinea a séance .
Aldous Huxley , ( 1894 -1963 ) , an English novelist and critic , was a grandson of biologist T.H. Huxley , and though he dabbled in spiritualism and other such foolishness , he also wrote :
You never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religions .
Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly .
It is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but not , as yet , intelligent enough .
Right on , Huxleys !
APPLICANT – MAYBE
Jeff
Wagg received a note from someone who we believed might be trying to apply for the JREF prize :
Greetings Challenge Team .
I would like to let you know that certain events will soon be happening for all the peoples of the Earth to see .
When I was a boy I seen things in the physical realm happen from the pricipalites [ sic ] of the spirit world .
I was very scared and nervous of certain encounters .
I tried so hard to keep things in perspective by trying to look for a ' ' logical explantion ' ' [ sic ] .
Yet sometimes logic falls and fails very short of reasoning with normalities [ sic ] .
I had to block most of it out of mind [ sic ] .
Yet not only was I contending with that , but I was also having increased visions of the future in my wreckless [ sic ] sleep .
Good will , John .
This was followed by another note , saying that “ John ” would only be interested if the JREF increased the prize to a billion dollars .
That ’s really out of our price range , John .
He wrote :
Greetings .
You only offer a small amount of money for a big task .
Good will , John .
Drat !
Yet another opportunity to award the prize , thwarted !
FENG SHUI FOOEY
Reader Peter Ilott has written to the Los Angeles Zoo Public Relations Representative Laura Stegman ( see www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/021607failure.html#i5) to register his concern :
In an article in the press I am informed that the Zoo has paid $ 4500 to a " Feng Shui " consultant ( Simona Mainini ? ) to ensure the " life force " of some new monkeys .
If this is true , I would like to express my strongest objections to the use of zoo funds for such an idiotic and superstitious waste of money .
I am a zoo member , and I am shocked to find out that my contributions to the zoo every year are being essentially thrown down the drain by hiring such charlatans .
Feng Shui is just another of many fraudulent methods to separate the credulous from their money .
It has no basis in reality , has been shown to be nothing but a humbug , and despite its proponents using the term , “ science of Feng Shui , ” it is about as far from science as is reading the entrails of a chicken to predict the future .
In short it is a fraud , and I am most dismayed that the zoo would waste valuable funds on it .
As a member I must demand that the money be recovered from the con artist who received it , or at least from the " architect " Charles Mays , and be used for real expenses rather than imaginary ones .
I am forwarding this email to several organizations that specialize in refuting quack claims , as well as the city of Los Angeles , and anyone else who might be a zoo stakeholder .
Rest assured that this egregious misuse of zoo funds will be made public .
The amount paid for this fraud is more than all my contributions to the zoo in total .
This means I could have just as well flushed it down the toilet .
I am a great supporter of the zoo and its efforts to educate the public and save endangered species .
I cannot however support the zoo any longer as long as the zoo allows its funds to be used for such pseudoscience nonsense .
When can I expect to hear that the zoo has recovered the money spent on this foolishness , and when will the zoo make public the name of any persons connected with the zoo staff or administration responsible for this transaction ?
Accountability is paramount in a charitable organization , especially one doing work as important as the LA Zoo .
Until I hear that steps are being taken to rectify this situation I will withhold any further contributions to the zoo , and will encourage my friends to do likewise .
Peter , I wish that others would care enough to send similar letters off to officials concerned with such matters .
Thank you for caring .

BAD MOMENTS
My friend Rick Sapphire just sent me a copy of out - takes from a Wonderama TV appearance he made in 1962 .
Sonny

THAT “ SECRET ” MOVIE
Reader Aaron Murray was on to “ The Secret ” of life long before the movie ( see www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/022307sniffex.html#i2) came out :
I was taught " The Secret " when I was younger by a well - guarded book shown to only those who can understand the secret .
It 's called " The Little Engine that Could " .
He thought he could do it , he worked towards his goal and he took the chance to prove he could do it when the situation presented itself .
AMAZING !
In light of this DVD and the stupid amount of press it 's received , I 'd like to announce a DVD that I 'm going to release soon .
It 's called " The Secret 2 : The Secret to Strength . ” I figure I can trust you with the secret , Mr. Randi , so I 'll let you know now what it is in a nutshell .
Ready ?
If you lift weights you will become stronger .
Yes , if you sit around and do nothing and think about how weak you are you will not get stronger , but if you harmonize your mind with the vibrations of the universe and lift certain amounts of weight , you WILL get stronger .
I 'm sure I just changed your life indeed and I will retail the DVD for $ 29.99 , naturally .
MOON - COUNTERS
Reader Leonard Tramiel – and a few others – corrected me re the item at www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/022307sniffex.html#i13:
Saturn does n't have 19 moons .
The number you refute , 33 , is close to the number of officially named moons , 35 .
The current total is 56 .
Your claim of 19 with " smaller orbiting chunks " does n't match the facts .
The real mistake in the quoted sentence is the claim the Phoebe orbit is " almost perpendicular to Saturn ’s equator . "
The inclination is only about 30 degrees .
A first class source of such data is : sse.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/index.cfm .
For more information on the sizes of these moons please see : www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~sheppard/satellites/satsatdata.html
Well , Leonard , I got my info at http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/saturn/moons.html, and that inclination of Phoebe ’s orbit was claimed by the nutters , not by moi …
WILL THIS NEVER BE RESOLVED ?
Dr. Bruce Flamm , still hot on the supernatural pray - to - get - pregnant paper ( see www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/021607failure.html#i7 and www.randi.org/jr/2007-02/022307sniffex.html#i7) that has so embarrassed the Journal of Reproductive Medicine ( JRM ) , tells us :
[ Dr. ]
Cha appears to be violating state law by using MD after his name on websites and in news releases in California in spite of the fact that he is not licensed to practice medicine in the state .
Also note that Cha still claims to be a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University , although the medical school dean states that he was only a " visiting scientist " – never a professor or even an assistant professor .
In any case they say he has had no connection whatsoever with the university for many years .
But this next item you will really get a kick out of : Cha 's website also indicates that his astrological sign is Sagittarius !
Astrological sign ?
Yikes !
See http://tinyurl.com/3e4hmc.
Is this a joke ?
Apparently not .
His site also indicates that his Zodiac year is the Dragon !
Zodiac year ?
Yep !
Although Cha does not appear to have a license to practice medicine and although he does not appear to be board certified in ob / gyn in the USA , the doctor 's astrological credentials apparently remain uncontested !
Reader Doug Fraser – referred to earlier – took an opportunity this week to send this note off to the JRM :
Dear Dr. Lawrence D. Devoe ,
As you are well aware your journal is rapidly losing its credibility within the scientific community due to your refusal to retract the fraudulent Cha / Wirth / Lobo " pray for pregnancy " study published in the JRM .
I thought I would also bring it to your attention that your journal 's standards will now be used as an example of " bad " science in classrooms across the country and around the world .
As a teacher and textbook author I routinely describe and champion the powerful and highly successful " objective " nature of science .
However I always take care to note that while the methods of science are successful because they reduce bias , they are still conducted and interpreted by humans and you can't always take the " scientist " out of the science .
Perhaps I should be thanking you – my students prefer " modern day examples " that they can relate to .
When describing bogus science I usually refer to the case of Blondlot and his mysterious " N - rays " – now I have a recent and " excellent " example to add to the mix – and right out of a peer - reviewed science journal , no less !!
Your refusal to retract the clearly fraudulent study – which is now presumably a significant embarrassment – serves to highlight the worst abuse of scientific standards .
Perhaps you are a " believer " yourself and cannot overcome your own wishful thinking , but for the sake of your journal I suggest you do otherwise .
Until such time as you take action , I will continue to present your journal to young aspiring scientists as a model of credulity and disrepute .
Well , as they say , it ’s better to serve as a bad example , than no example at all …
IT ’S BAD LUCK TO BE SUPERSTITIOUS
Sent to us anonymously :
The superstitious public seems to have quite an influence on the travel industry .
A quick sampling of European airlines on SeatGuru shows that there is rarely a seat row 13 on an airplane .
SAS , Air France , Lufthansa , KLM and Swiss all disguise row 13 under a different number .
British Airways does not , nor does Aer Lingus seem to , as far as I can tell from their online seat reservation demo .
It does n’t seem to bother the Americans much either , with American Airlines , Delta , Northwest and Southwest happy to acknowledge the modern , rational age .
Not Continental though .
Hotels often “ lose ” floor 13 .
In Asia , floor 4 might be missing , since that number is considered unlucky .
In Hong Kong , where East and West collide , a hotel might pander to the superstitions of both traditions and omit both 4 and 13 ( and possibly 14 and 24 too , since they both contain a “ 4 ″ ! ) .
MORE OF POPOFF ’S SECRETS
We ran a video clip of a recent “ Inside Edition ” item – http://www.randi.org/media/popoff-ie.mp4 – at the head of last week ’s column , and it ’s on this one , as well .
Now , we can also see – courtesy of Dr. Mark A. Duva of Norwalk , California – the entire promo package sent out by Popoff , at www.deceptioninthechurch.com/popoffback.html.
This reveals just how bizarre , ritualistic , and witchcraft - like his operation is .
But federal and state officials shield their eyes , ears , and mouths when they we tell them about it …
Now , this is interesting : though YouTube ran the Inside Edition item immediately after it was broadcast , they withdrew it the very next day , giving as the reason that it had unspecified “ inappropriate content ” !
Inappropriate ?
Perhaps truth and evidence – when it deals with wealthy scam - artists – is inappropriate ?
Popoff ’s $ 2,100,000 home , his $ 110,000 Porsche , the $ 1,200,000 annual salary he pays himself and his wife , the $ 23,000,000 annual income his organization brings in for selling “ Miracle Spring Water ” and iodized (? ) salt from the Dead Sea , could well be considered to be “ inappropriate ” information to pass on to the public …
IN CLOSING …
There ’s nothing like a good laugh to close out the week , after hearing about all those grubby people out there who lie , cheat , swindle , and steal …

Sometimes going a little nutty is a good thing .
For weeks , " Jericho " junkies have been firing e-mails ( effectively shutting down InBoxes at CBS and this newspaper ) , signing petitions and sending bags of nuts to CBS headquarters in protest .
The assault seems to have worked , " Jericho " creator and executive producer Carol Barbee said Tuesday .
CBS executives are in discussions with the show 's producers and actors to resuscitate the show -- killed just last month -- for an eight - episode run in mid-season .
" The idea would not be to bring it for eight and out , but to bring it back for eight with the hope that it would keep going , " Barbee said .
" They 're making deals with the actors and there 's other logistical stuff to work out too .
' Swingtown ' [ a new drama ] was supposed to take over the same stages so it 's a lot about the logistics of how to work out a schedule that works for all of us . "
Barbee said the fan fever for the show did not surprise her - she had been keeping a close eye on the show 's viewers on the Web .
But she never expected CBS to change its mind because of the devotion .
" I was so kicked in the gut when we were canceled , " she said .
" I was really upset and angry and mourning over this amazing experience we had this year and this amazing family we put together and this show we were all so proud of .
I did n't see the end coming so it felt like it was n't over . "
When the fan fight to save the show would not let up , CBS began talks with producers about a two - hour movie that would wrap up the show , but the writers were not interested , Barbee said .
" We just felt like that was doing it short - shrift , and it 's too big of a story to wrap up in a two - hour movie , " she said .
" I really think that what has been learned here is that networks are going to have to look at numbers and who is watching their show and who is downloading their show in a different way from here on out .
I think they have to understand that the Nielsens are not telling the story anymore and that the 18 - 49 demographic they 're all so keen on is online and that 's how increasingly they are getting their news and entertainment . "
Since the fan revolt began , " Jericho " viewers have insisted they also would not be satisfied with a TV movie or online re-cap that told them how the " Jericho " story ends .
If the actors sign on the dotted line -- and those deals should be in place in the next day or two -- Barbee said " Jericho " junkies will get their way .

Daddy Was Watching : Secret Photos of Nude Daughter Were n't Illegal Under Massachusetts Law Dad's nude pics of unknowing daughter would now be considered illegal .
July 3 , 2007 --
This story originally aired May 29 , 2003 .
Crystal 's parents were away on vacation when she made a disturbing discovery on her father 's computer : nude pictures — and she was the subject .
Spied on by Dad
Crystal says her father , Ron , who had adopted her when she was a young girl , retrieved the pictures via a computer Web camera in her bedroom , which had previously been in his office .
The photos stretched back five years , to when she was 19 .
She made the discovery while her parents were on vacation .
Crystal told her mother when they returned from their trip .
" When I think about it , I feel like I 'm going to vomit , " Crystal said .
Crystal would not give her last name to protect her family 's privacy , and she did n't want pictures of her family , including her father , shown .
When Crystal tried to turn copies of the photos over to police to press criminal charges against her dad , she got another surprise .
Under state law in Massachusetts , it was not a crime to take pictures of someone without his or her knowledge , even nude pictures .
At the time in 2003 , Elizabeth Scheibel , Northwestern District Attorney for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts , told ABC News that state law had a major loophole .
While it was a crime to make audio recordings of adults without their knowledge , people could take all the pictures they wanted without being arrested or prosecuted .
Camera Aimed at Bed
The trouble began when Crystal moved back into her family home in Easthampton , Mass . , at age 19 .
While she was gone , her father had used Crystal 's old bedroom as his home office , complete with a computer equipped with a Web camera .
When she moved back into her old room , his computer remained in her bedroom .
Crystal had no idea that the Web camera could be on when the computer was off .
But one day Crystal was lying in bed when she noticed the lens of the camera that had been sitting on top of the computer was now aimed at her bed .
Previously , it had always been pointed in a different direction .
Crystal then called her computer - savvy friend , Jordan Shapiro , to help her do a little detective work .
Shapiro said the images he found shocked him .
" I found hundreds of pictures of Crystal , " he said .
" There were no photographs of her with clothes on .
In every single one she was partially dressed , or getting undressed , or doing something undressed . "
Crystal said she still can't believe that her father would n't face any criminal charges for taking the pictures .
Since no formal charges could be made against him , the computer and all the images were returned to her father 's possession .
" That made it even worse .
That made it 10 times worse , " Crystal said .
" It 's like being kicked twice .
I did n't believe it . "
Crystal said her mother filed for divorce , and her father moved in with his parents .
She said her mother told her that her father said he took the pictures to make sure she was n't using drugs .
Scheibel said the case still angers her , since she knew there was nothing she could do to help Crystal .
" Our hands are tied , " Scheibel said .
" It 's reprehensible .
It makes people sick to know that this goes on . "
Crystal 's efforts to share her painful story with the world were eventually successful in encouraging Massachusetts lawmakers to pass legislation in 2004 that now makes it illegal for anyone to take nude photos of an adult without his or knowledge .
Her father was never prosecuted for his actions .
" That 's the point of this , " Crystal said .
" A lot of people did n't know it was n't illegal .
A lot of people thought it was illegal . "
Princeton University emeritus professor and renowned oil analyst Ken Deffeyes thinks that the all - time production peak for petroleum , or " peak oil , " will occur on or around this Thanksgiving .
The peak oil theory predicts that the world 's oil production output , like any nonrenewable resource , will eventually reach an all - time high and afterward gradually decline .
Although it will be impossible to tell precisely when the peak occurs until it has already occurred and the world is in a definite production decrease , many experts are already predicting that the moment will happen in a few short years .
Deffeyes is one of the more pessimistic of the prognosticators .
If he is correct , the global oil peak will just have occurred when he presents his Caltech lecture on December 1 .
Afterward , the commodity will become more and more scarce -- and therefore more and more expensive and hard to obtain .
The end result will be massive economic and social disruptions in a 21st - century world that has fueled itself for decades with cheap and plentiful energy .
Deffeyes has spent a lifetime in the oil business and the academic study of petroleum .
Born in the middle of an Oklahoma City oilfield to a pioneering petroleum engineer , Deffeyes joined the Shell research lab in Houston after graduate school .
At Shell he was a colleague of M. King Hubbert , who was the first person to predict that production peaks were even possible .
Hubbert 's prediction that U.S. oil production would peak around 1970 was at first laughed at by industry analysts , but was later taken quite seriously when domestic production indeed peaked in much the manner that he had forecasted .
Experts then realized that the entire planet would eventually reach a production peak , and that the effects would be highly disruptive .
Deffeyes joined the Princeton faculty in 1967 and continued to be involved in the oil industry as a consultant and expert witness .
After his retirement in 1998 , he published two books on the subject , Hubbert 's Peak and Beyond Oil .
His prediction that the global oil peak will occur at Thanksgiving comes with stern warnings that severe consequences are to be expected for transportation and agriculture .
In fact , he advises that the possibility of a " soft landing " may have already passed .
Ken Deffeyes will discuss the evidence supporting his theory at the Lauritsen Memorial Lecture , to take place at 8 p.m. on Thursday , December 1 , in Beckman Auditorium on the California Institute of Technology campus .
The Lauritsen Memorial Lecture at Caltech commemorates two former professors of physics at Caltech , Charles C. and Thomas Lauritsen .
Together , they served the Institute for more than 68 years , playing a significant role in Caltech 's development and accomplishments .

Real - life Robocops , robots armed with lethal weaponry and a programmed determination to eliminate foes , could become a key element in global counter - terrorist and military operations within 10 years , a US security expert said yesterday .
John Pike , director of GlobalSecurity.org in Virginia , was commenting on plans announced this week by a US firm , iRobot Corp , to arm its track - wheeled PackBot robot with a Taser X26 stun gun .
Until now , the PackBot , which looks like a small first - world - war tank , has been used for remote - controlled bomb disposal , dangerous search and surveillance missions .
Now it will have the ability to " remotely engage , incapacitate and control dangerous suspects " , iRobot said .
" The addition of Taser technologies on to iRobot platforms will provide a critical tool for Swat ( Special weapons and tactics ) , law enforcement and military to handle a variety of dangerous scenarios , " said Admiral Joe Dyer , president of iRobot Government & Industrial Robots .
" The new Taser - equipped robots will add a new ability to control dangerous suspects while keeping personnel , the suspect , and bystanders out of harm 's way , " a company statement said .
The first robot of its kind " with an onboard , integrated Taser payload " would go on show next month in Chicago .
A spokesman for iRobot said the firm had no plans to equip its machines with lethal weaponry .
Nor would the robots be able to decide on their own whether to open fire , without a human being " in the loop " .
Mr Pike said development of robot cops , similar in purpose if not appearance to the crime - fighting characters in the Robocop and Terminator films , could be complete within 10 years and in use by police , prisons and military .
" For sure machines could be armed with guns , for sure they could be autonomous , " Mr Pike said .
" You already have UAVs ( unmanned aerial vehicles ) with an autopilot .
You tell the autopilot where to go , what altitude and speed .
Then it starts making its own judgments .
" So with the robot , you give it an instruction like : ' Clear the building - anybody pointing a weapon at you should be killed ' .
Robots are infinitely brave .
They have no hesitation in killing and feel no remorse .
And the great thing is you do n't have to send condolence letters to their families if you put them in harm 's way , " Mr Pike said .
What would happen if police ordered " robot soldiers " to clear a building , not realising that a child was inside ?
" First of all , the child had better not be pointing a weapon at you , " Mr Pike said .
" Second , people will think about that before they programme them .
They will have criteria for that . "

A record number of British citizens are leaving the country , according to official figures published yesterday .
An unprecedented 196,000 left the country last year , with Australia , Spain , America , New Zealand and France the most popular destinations for those seeking a new life .
scroll down for more ...
The exodus is countered by high levels of immigration , with the Office for National Statistics saying that 574,000 people came to live in Britain between June 2005 and 2006 .
Overall , the population has risen by 349,000 to more than 60 million .
The news came as it was revealed that hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers will be granted an ' amnesty ' to live in Britain on human rights grounds .
Many have been waiting years to have their cases processed , meaning deporting them now would breach their right to a family life .
The ONS figures also showed the numbers arriving from Eastern Europe are still close to the boom levels seen after eight countries including Poland joined the European Union in the spring of 2004 .
scroll down for more ...
The new figures also suggested that middle - class Britons are beginning to move out of towns in southern England that are home to large numbers of immigrants .
This phenomenon - called ' churn ' by Whitehall officials and ' middleclass flight ' by other commentators - saw 240,000 people move out of London last year .
Independent experts said the high emigration figures showed that many Britons are fed up with life here and believe they will do better elsewhere .
Liam Clifford , of consultancy firm globalvisas.com , said his company had 50,000 inquiries from would - be emigrants last month alone .
" They do not believe that the services and the system can cope with the number of people coming into the UK at the moment , " he said .
" Even fairly rural areas and villages seem to be coming under the threat of having an increased population and lack of services . "
scroll down for more ...
Dean Morgan , of the workpermit.com website , added : " Normally in July and August it is quite quiet but this year we have been inundated .
" People are worried about their children and they worry about their jobs and their future here and possibly the economy as well .
" Perception of crime is another of the main reasons for people wanting to leave . "
A study by the Institute for Public Policy Research think - tank earlier this year said there are now 1.3 million British emigrants living in Australia .
Another 761,000 live in Spain , and 678,000 in the United States .
The ONS yesterday estimated that last year 's emigration figures were the highest since 1991 , when modern counting methods were adopted .
A total of 385,000 people are thought to have left the country , although this figure includes many foreigners who were in Britain temporarily .
Current levels are far above those in previous high emigration periods such as the 1970s and early 1980s .
The 574,000 who came into Britain last year included many types of people , some of them successful applicants from highly - skilled migrant programmes .
Another 91,000 were Britons who had lived abroad coming home .
It also included 74,000 who came from Eastern Europe , the ONS said .
This brings the official estimate of migration from the new EU countries since the middle of 2004 to 151,000 .
However , ministers admit that in reality more than 600,000 have come over here .
Sir Andrew Green of Migrationwatch said that the ONS calculated that only 57,000 of the recent Eastern European arrivals had stayed in Britain .
But 210,000 signed the Government 's register to work in Britain over the period .
He added : " This once again highlights that the Government has no real grip of immigration or any meaningful idea of the true number coming to and leaving the UK which makes planning for these large population increases extremely difficult . "
ONS officials , who continue to base immigration estimates on a largely - discredited survey taken at ports of entry , said compiling the figures was becoming " difficult " and " challenging " .
The figures include asylum seekers but do not count , and make no estimate of , the levels of illegal immigration .
MIDDLE CLASS QUIT CITIES
The middle class are increasingly moving out of towns and cities in southern England in a phenomenon known in Whitehall as ' churn ' .
The relocation to suburbs and rural areas is similar to the ' white flight ' that emptied American cities in the 1960s .
However , the exodus here includes successful ethnic minority families anxious to escape the growing tensions of life in big towns .
GP records showed that 243,700 people left London in the 12 months to June last year .
The capital 's population continues to grow because of large numbers of migrants moving in .
But for the first time other southern towns are experiencing ' middle class flight ' .
Since 2001 the populations of Reading and Bournemouth have dropped by one per cent despite the arrival of migrants .
The head of the ONS , Karen Dunnell , said : " We have seen a very active housing market and some people are moving out to take advantage of rising prices . "
However , experts also consider that concerns over schools , poor transport and rising crime are central factors in persuading families to move out of towns .
OUR AGEING POPULATION
The fastest - growing segment of the population is the over - 85s , the figures showed .
A record 1,243,000 have now passed the age of 85 and the group grew by 6 per cent last year .
The number of people over retirement age is now 11,344,000 - up 1 per cent in a year .
There are concerns that Britain 's ageing population will become difficult to sustain because there are fewer taxpayers to pay for older people 's pensions and health care costs .
The working age population is growing , although more slowly - it was up by 0.8 per cent to 37,710,000 .
At the same time the number of children under 16 dropped by 0.4 per cent to 11,537,000 .
Overall numbers went up by 349,000 to 60,587,000 , according to the figures .
Just over half of the increase was attributed to immigration , the rest to increasing birth rates .
These are rising largely because recent immigrants are having more children than the existing population .
One in four of the 734,000 babies born last year had a parent who was born abroad .
This is up from one in five in 2001 .
The rising number of children born to migrants compares with much lower birthrates among women whose background is wholly British .
The firm says it is determined to reduce its carbon footprint
The fast - food chain has pledged to convert all its 155 vehicles by next year , starting with 45 lorries based at its distribution centre in Hampshire .
By using the fuel - made by combining cooking oil and rapeseed oil - the firm said it would save more than 1,650 tonnes of carbon every year .
The move follows a successful trial last year .
' Environmental example '
McDonald 's has long faced criticism over its environmental record .
The firm said it was " delighted " to be putting its large stock of cooking oil to a " practical , efficient use " within its own business .
" This is a great example of how businesses can work together to help the environment , " said its senior vice president Matthew Howe .
The retailer added that it was working on a range of other initiatives spanning recycling and packaging to reduce its carbon emissions .
It said it was committed to working with its suppliers to reduce the use of pure rapeseed oil in its manufacturing process .
I ’m having a bit of trouble understanding all of the newly released reports coming out about Iraq .
Luckily for everyone , when Australia Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile recently asked President Bush for an update on Iraq , the President told him “ We ’re kicking ass . ”
OK .
Fair enough .
That sums it up for me .
It ’s terrific news and it ’s about time .
Because we ’re kicking ass over there , let ’s schedule a parade through Baghdad .
Let ’s have the Bush family lead the parade .
That includes George W. , Laura and the twins .
Let ’s make it a big parade .
We can have a prominent float on which Mr. Bush ’s friends and co-workers can ride : Donald Rumsfeld , Condoleeza Rice , Dick Cheney and Karl Rove .
What the heck .
Bring everyone : Gonzales , Ashcroft , Scooter ( I know that he ’s free ) .
Let ’ have everyone who ever worked closely with the President spread some red white and blue cheer .
This will give our highest ranking Republican officials a chance to mingle with the people we saved , the Iraqis .
Can you imagine Dick Cheney walking through the middle of Baghdad shaking hands with the people of Iraq and spreading the good news that we ’re kicking the asses of those terrorists ?
Let ’s plan for our parade to stretch two or three miles through the center of Bagdad , so there ’s room for everyone in Congress who authorized the invasion of Iraq .
Since we ’re kicking ass , there ’s no need for helicopters hovering overhead and there ’s no need for anyone to wear flak jackets ( like John McCain did during his visit ) .
Nor is there any need to bring in heavy security .
It ’s time to give the military the day off in Iraq .
Call it something like “ Iraqi Freedom Celebration Day . ”
Since we ’re kicking ass , let ’s announce to the people of Iraq ( by dropping thousands of leaflets by helicopter at least a few weeks ahead of time ) that this parade is a chance for the people of Iraq to come on out to meet the President of the United States , shake his hand and tell him what ’s on your mind .
Maybe the President could dress up in his cowboy boots .
Or maybe he could ride his bicycle .
Let ’s use this opportunity to show the citizens of Iraq that we ’ll never hesitate to bring a bit of America to Iraq .
Let ’s not forget that there are tens of thousands of Iraqi children whose parents have died during the Iraq liberation process .
Let ’s construct a few thousand large parade floats on which they can ride , places of special prominence .
Let ’s make the Parade Day an even bigger deal .
Let ’s invite hundreds of American high school students to travel over to Baghdad with our President to join the parade , then to begin an student exchange program , say for a semester or two .
Our students can live with real Iraqi families outside of the Green Zone , since we ’re kicking ass .
They can attend the finest Iraq high schools and colleges that still exist .
They can help tell the Iraqi students about American democracy .
They can tell the Iraqi students that in America , our political system works extra efficiently because money is speech .
In fact , since we ’re kicking ass , is n’t it about time to open a few McDonald ’s and Starbucks in downtown Baghdad ?
And how about putting a FOX News corporate office in the middle of town , right on an Iraqi Main Street , so that FOX reporters and editors can have easy access to the real people of Iraq : those outside the Green Zone .
Now that we ’re kicking ass , let ’s really start the reconstruction of Iraq .
I ’m sure that many of the people who favored the U.S. invasion are retired folks .
Perhaps they would be willing to come to Baghdad to help fix up at least some of bombed out schools and mosques .
Let ’s also invite thousands of American fundamentalists to make the trip too , so that they can open up one of their mega- churches in the heart of Baghdad .
They can tell the Iraqis to worship Jesus instead of Muhammad or Allah .
Now that we ’re well on our way to saving the Iraqis from terrorists , we can get busy saving them from going to hell .
I ’m getting excited even writing about this big parade .
Finally , this is our opportunity to step up to allow our President tell the people of Iraq , face - to - face , what he ’s done for Iraq .

In an emerging crisis for California 's elderly and poor , all Medi-Cal funding will be halted this week to an estimated 500 hospitals throughout the state and 11,000 nursing homes , hospices and adult day care centers .
Medi-Cal funds have run out because of the state 's monthlong budget impasse , forcing community programs and other facilities into a frantic scramble to cover their bills .
Some care facilities for the aged are making plans to close .
California has nearly 6.8 million elderly , frail and chronically infirm Medi-Cal beneficiaries , and many would be forced to find help elsewhere , or make do on their own , without emergency funding from the state Legislature .
But help is unlikely because both the Senate and the Assembly would have to approve an emergency bailout , and the Assembly has gone on summer recess .
" We have not been cut off from Medi - Cal funding before so early in the fiscal year , " said Lydia Missaelides , executive director of the California Association for Adult Day Services .
" The magnitude of this crisis is overwhelming . "
Medi-Cal coffers ran dry last week when the state was scheduled to issue $ 223 million to managed - care providers .
Instead , checks for only $ 143 million were issued .
On Thursday , $ 227 million was scheduled to be paid to assorted hospitals , clinics and other providers of Medi-Cal services .
No money will be paid .
" This is the perfect storm , " said H.D. Palmer , spokesman for the state Department of Finance .
" In the absence of an enacted budget , we do n't have the authority to pay certain vendors . "
Medi-Cal payment crises are nothing new to California , which has a long history of protracted budget battles .
In 1998 , the Legislature put into place a fail - safe measure allocating $ 2 billion to tide over Medi-Cal during a budget logjam .
That cushion was expected to last two months whenever budget negotiations dragged on , said Palmer .
But Medi-Cal changed accounting processes several years ago and , with the addition of inflated medical costs , " We had to start tapping those funds earlier , " Palmer said .
" The effect was the two - month cushion became a one - month cushion , which has led to our inability to issue checks at all this week . "
One man who could be affected is 75 - year - old Roy A. , a San Leandro resident and veteran of the Korean War who spent Tuesday at his favorite place : an adult day health care facility in Berkeley .
He drew pictures of a fat bear and parrots , ate chicken tacos and chocolate cake and had some occupational therapy , and a nurse monitored his response to the 18 medications he 's taking .
" The center helps me tremendously , " said Roy , who has been diagnosed with 11 conditions , including hypertension and coronary heart disease .
" It gives me life . "
Because of the help Roy receives three days a week from Alzheimer 's Services of the East Bay 's Adult Day Health Care Program , he still lives at home with his wife instead of being confined to a hospital or a nursing facility .
But this program , like others around the state , is in peril , said Executive Director Karen Grimsich .
Her program serves 175 people whose average age is 86 .
All have dementia or Alzheimer's .
" There 's no time to find places for clients - and other programs are equally affected by the funding problem , " she said .
" People with Alzheimer 's can't just take two months off the disease while the state figures out its budget . "
As the current budget stalemate drags on , the emergency will worsen , said Missaelides .
The state , she said , has 340 adult day health care centers providing services to 38,000 Medi-Cal beneficiaries .
She said that a handful of centers are planning to close operations next week unless there is a budget reprieve .
Facilities most in jeopardy are small and independently owned , and with little financial wiggle room .
In the last few days , Manooch Pouransari has spent countless hours talking to bankers , hoping to secure a line of credit to keep afloat the Sunnyvale health center he runs with his wife .
Entirely funded by Medi-Cal , Grace Adult Day Health Care has 275 elderly participants , many of whom suffer from Alzheimer 's or dementia .
His center has a staff of 30 , including four nurses , four social workers , a physical therapist and a dietician .
On Tuesday , he learned that a hoped - for line of credit had fallen through .
Now he 's hoping a bank will extend him a personal loan .
" This is a life - threatening situation , " he said .
" It 's a borderline crime .
The state is literally kicking elderly people out on the street .
For many of them , this is the only meal they get .
The people who receive Medi-Cal are very poor .
If centers like ours close , these people will have to be placed somewhere . "
Assemblywoman Noreen Evans , D - Santa Rosa , predicted that Medi-Cal recipients will begin flooding hospital emergency rooms , " making the health crisis even worse ... ( as ) emergency rooms are already stretched to the breaking point . "
She called the Medi-Cal crisis " highly irresponsible . "
" It 's outrageous that in a state as rich as California , we could have people dying on the street for lack of medical care , " she said .
" This is going to affect the disabled , seniors , children and the poor ... people are going to start to get hurt . "
The state has been without a budget since July 1 .
On Tuesday , budget negotiations continued with little visible progress even though Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger met personally with the entire Republican Senate caucus for more than an hour .
Senate Leader Don Perata , D - Oakland , has scheduled a Senate session tonight to discuss the budget .
Senate Republican Leader Dick Ackerman , R - Irvine ( Orange County ) , said he is not overly concerned about the budget stalemate dragging out weeks or even months longer .
He said the state continues to take in tax revenue and most agencies have plenty of money in reserve .
Ackerman said that even if the budget is delayed another month , his goal of cutting spending is worthwhile .
" Our goal is to get a responsible budget , " he said .
" We 'd like to get it sooner than later , but I think the most important goal for the people of California is to have a budget that does not spend more than it takes in . "
But for Assemblyman John Laird , D - Santa Cruz , the current Medi-Cal crisis stirs disturbing memories .
Laird was the executive director of a nonprofit AIDS service center in the early 1990s when budget negotiations stalled for more than a month .
" I was just days away from closing our doors , " he said .
" I 'd borrowed from every fund I could .
People have to realize that real people are paying a price for this . "

Under a program developed by a Defense Department warfare unit , Army snipers have begun using a new method to kill Iraqis suspected of being insurgents , using fake weapons and bomb - making material as bait and then killing anyone who picks them up , according to testimony presented in a military court .
The existence of the classified “ baiting program , ” as it has come to be known , was disclosed as part of defense lawyers ’ efforts to respond to murder charges the Army pressed this summer against three members of a Ranger sniper team .
Each soldier is accused of killing an unarmed Iraqi in three separate shootings between April and June near Iskandariya , and with planting “ drop weapons ” like detonation wires or other incriminating evidence on the bodies of the victims .
In sworn statements , soldiers testifying for the defense have said the sniper team was employing a “ baiting program ” developed at the Pentagon by the Asymmetrical Warfare Group , which met with Ranger sniper teams in Iraq in January and gave equipment to them .
The Washington Post described the baiting program on Monday .
An Army spokesman , Paul Boyce , said Monday that the Army did not publicly discuss specific methods for “ targeting enemy combatants , ” and that no classified program authorized the use of “ drop weapons ” to make a killing appear justified .
Army officers involved in evidentiary hearings in Baghdad in July did not dispute the existence or use of a baiting program .
“ The government tries to make sure homes are paying a fair market value for things like rent and consulting and supplies , ” said John Villegas - Grubbs , a Medicaid expert who has developed payment systems for several states .
“ But when home owners pay themselves without revealing it , they can pad their bills .
It ’s not feasible to expect regulators to catch that unless they have transparency on ownership structures . ”
Formation and Warburg Pincus both declined to discuss disclosure issues .
Groups lobbying to increase transparency at nursing homes say complicated corporate structures should be outlawed .
One idea popular among organizations like the National Citizens ’ Coalition for Nursing Home Reform is requiring the company that owns a home ’s most valuable assets , its land and building , to manage it .
That would put owners at risk if care declines .
But owners say that tying a home ’s property to its operation would make it impossible to operate in leased facilities , and exacerbate a growing nationwide nursing home shortage .
Moreover , investors say , they deserve credit for rebuilding an industry on the edge of widespread insolvency .
“ Legal and regulatory costs were killing this industry , ” said Mr. Whitman , the Formation executive .
For instance , Beverly Enterprises , which also had a history of regulatory problems , sold Habana and the rest of its Florida centers to Formation because , it said at the time , of rising litigation costs .
AON Risk Consultants , a research company , says the average cost of nursing home litigation in Florida during that period had increased 270 percent in five years .
“ Lawyers were suing nursing homes because they knew the companies were worth billions of dollars , so we made the companies smaller and poorer , and the lawsuits have diminished , ” Mr. Whitman said .
This year , another fund affiliated with Mr. Whitman and other investors acquired the nation ’s third - largest nursing home chain , Genesis HealthCare , for $ 1.5 billion .
If investors are barred from setting up complex structures , “ this industry makes no economic sense , ” Mr. Whitman said .
“ If nursing home owners are forced to operate at a loss , the entire industry will disappear . ”
However , advocates for nursing home reforms say investors exaggerate the industry ’s precariousness .
Last year , Formation sold Habana and 185 other facilities to General Electric for $ 1.4 billion .
A prominent nursing home industry analyst , Steve Monroe , estimates that Formation ’s and its co-investors ’ gains from that sale were more than $ 500 million in just four years .
Formation declined to comment on that figure .
Editor 's note :
Some links in this story lead to adult material and are not suitable for viewing at work .
All links of this nature will be noted with " NSFW " after them .
The internet , once hailed for augmenting pornographers ' profits , is now blamed for reducing them .
An article in last weekend 's New York Times asserts that giving the milk away for free is no longer enticing consumers to buy the cow , and that the adult industry needs to come up with a better strategy .
The reporter notes that a $ 3.4 million rise in internet - related revenue from 2005 to 2006 does not balance the $ 6.6 million drop in DVD sales and rental revenue for the same period , according to numbers compiled by the AVN Media Network .
His sources bemoan the glut of amateur content online and express the hope that consumers will soon tire of it and shell out for higher quality material .
I 'm not convinced .
On the surface , I can see how one might conclude that too much of a free thing is bad for business .
But one might also note that no industry has a god - given right to exist , whether porn or music or journalism or television , all of which feel threatened by consumers taking content into our own hands and setting it free online .
Yet I can still give you 10 better reasons than " free porn " for why adult DVD revenue is dropping faster than internet revenue is rising .
Whether that 's a bad thing for " the adult industry " is open to debate .
1 . Porn is more socially acceptable than ever , yet remains oddly expensive .
Most people under 30 seem to take for granted that they can look at porn whenever they feel like it – and consequently are n't terribly worked up about it .
It 's just another item in a long list of entertainment options .
And when we think of smut as simply another layer of entertainment rather than a shameful vice to satiate in secret , we balk at paying a premium , even for " the good stuff . "
While average - quality porn DVDs list for $ 20 to $ 25 and you can take a chance on the $ 10 bin at the local mom-and - pop , several of the DVDs at Good Vibrations ( NSFW ) – which selects higher end products – sell for $ 40 or more .
Amazon lists Digital Playground 's Pirates for $ 47 .
By contrast , Disney 's Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl is $ 14 .
If you 're going to spend the price of a sushi dinner on one video , you want that video to be something special .
2. American consumers are n't limited to domestic porn .
AVN only tracks U.S. revenue , but Americans are as free to spend our porn money internationally as we are to keep it at home .
In 2006 , I subscribed to the Australia - based For the Girls ( NSFW ) for a couple of months ; a dear friend and neighbor of mine joined Canada - based Seska4Lovers ( NSFW ) .
That 's about $ 300 not included in AVN 's totals , and I know we are n't the only ones sending our money across the border .
( If you think Wired should reimburse me for work - related expenses like this , feel free to write my editor and suggest it ! )
3. Sisters are doin ' it for themselves .
As adult entertainment becomes more accepted in the mainstream , more women see it as an increasingly legitimate career path , one they do n't have to hide from friends and possibly not even family .
Gone are the big hats and sunglasses of the early ' 80s – these days , a porn star 's business partners may well be her parents .
And not all of these women choose to move to the San Fernando Valley and work in movie mills .
They set up on their own , performing live on the internet , selling monthly memberships that include real - time shows and archives of past performances .
They blog , they chat , they give sex advice , they sell their panties and custom t- shirts , and their annual revenue target is a drop in the lube bottle compared with what even a small production house needs to hit .
Yet for consumers , the end result is the same : content that turns them on and ( hopefully ) gets them off .
4 . Some consumers prefer porn with relationships .
Shhhh .
Part of porn 's appeal is the absence of a relationship .
You have nothing invested , no work to do , no feelings to consider .
You just start watching when you 're ready and stop when you 're done .
Yet now that we have the opportunity to form relationships with entertainers and fans , we often do .
People subscribe to independent cam - girl websites for months and years on end ; traditional porn actresses interact with fans on their websites .
You might join initially because you like her looks and her style , but you stay because you develop a relationship .
And once you get used to the personal attention , a DVD sometimes seems , well , dull .
5 . Porn works well in small doses .
Think about how we watch porn .
It 's a quick break in the day , an indulgence for an evening alone , a nudge in the right direction for a tired couple , a defense against loneliness , a dash of novelty and fantasy .
The thrill of the quest for good free content works just as well as an expensive DVD for a solo evening or a hankerin ' for something new .
Webcam communities and 3 - D worlds are less lonely than a DVD collection ; cam girls offer a blend of variety and consistency for a monthly fee that 's often less than the cost of one DVD .
Meanwhile , couples have to find porn that turns both people on .
They are n't going to drop $ 40 on just any ol ' DVD and hope it works , now that they have other options .
6 . The internet makes small guys big and big guys small .
As we become more porn - savvy , we also become more particular about what we want to see .
This is great for independent , niche content producers like Kink.com ( NSFW ) and Comstock Films ( NSFW ) who offer something special you can't get elsewhere .
It 's not so great for large studios trying to appeal to an " average " consumer by churning out the same old boring stuff .
7. Anonymity is so last century .
The Times notes that the internet gave porn an enormous boost because it made it possible to access pornography anonymously .
Ten years later , the anonymity is not nearly as important .
We joke about our porn collections and feel no need to hide that we have one .
( Not that we trot it out at a garden party or anything . )
Although if you do need discretion , downloaded files trump physical media , so the anonymity argument works both ways and still results in less interest in DVDs .
8 . Porn can't always compete with sex .
Enabling people to connect sexually across all kinds of obstacles – time , distance , marital status – is not conducive to maintaining a passive , force - fed consumer base for adult content .
When non -pros post sexy pictures of themselves and when baby boomers discover their inner ingénues , people find all kinds of ways to have sex ( cyber and otherwise ) in their spare time .
Given that we only get 24 hours each day and we have to sleep sometime , it 's hard to keep up that pace and still have time to curate our DVD libraries .
9 . Free porn expanded the industry so fast , we forgot growth has to slow at some point .
Maybe this is a stretch .
I know porn predates the internet by thousands of years .
And yet , without the internet , the changes listed here would not have happened .
Certainly fewer women would be spending their mad money on adult products had the internet not broken down the barriers between us and smut .
As it is , women now account for about 25 percent of adult industry revenue , says AVN editor - at - large Kathee Brewer .
The novelty side – toys , lube , games – would not be growing so fast without the internet , either .
You can't now claim that porn sales are threatened just because they have evened out a little bit .
10 . A 15 percent drop in revenue does n't mean a 15 percent drop in profits .
No one is saying whether profits are up or by how much .
But as technology continues to make porn production and distribution cheaper , it 's possible for profits to grow even while revenue shrinks .
When you add up all categories of the AVN Media Network numbers , including exotic dance clubs and cable TV along with the internet and DVD segments cited in the Times , you find an overall revenue growth of 2.4 percent between 2005 and 2006 .
The internet does not seem to be hurting pornographers ' pocketbooks at all .
See you next Friday ,

ATLANTA ( Reuters ) - Islam is growing fast among African Americans , who are undeterred by increased scrutiny of Muslims in the United States since the September 11 attacks , according to imams and experts .

Converts within the black community say they are attracted to the disciplines of prayer , the emphasis within Islam on submission to God and the religion ’s affinity with people who are oppressed .
Some blacks are also suspicious of U.S. government warnings about the emergence of new enemies since the 2001 attacks because of memories of how the establishment demonized civil rights leaders Martin Luther King and Malcolm X .
As a result , they are willing to view Islam as a legitimate alternative to Christianity , the majority religion among U.S. blacks .
“ It is one of the fastest - growing religions in America , ” said Lawrence Mamiya , professor of religion at Vassar College , speaking of Islam among black Americans .
He said there were up to 2 million black U.S. Muslims but acknowledged there are no precise figures .
“ It ’s not viewed ( by authorities ) as a threat because the numbers are small and once we get past the war on terror and all the negative images then it will continue to spread . ”
Black Americans typically attend mosques separate from Muslims from immigrant backgrounds despite sharing common beliefs , according to Aminah McCloud , religious studies professor at DePaul University in Chicago .
But imams in Atlanta , a U.S. center for black Muslims , said they were subjected to less scrutiny than Muslims from the Middle East and Indian sub -continent .
RAP BROWN’S MOSQUE
Many blacks converted during the civil rights era , when Malcolm X helped popularize the Nation of Islam , attracting boxer Muhammad Ali among others .
Islam still attracts prominent blacks such as rapper Scarface , a recent convert .
But the Nation of Islam has declined as a force at the expense of an association of mosques led by Warith Deen Muhammad , the son of Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad , who died in 1975 .
At a street - corner mosque in one of Atlanta ’s oldest and poorest neighborhoods , a recent Friday sermon illustrated the power of the history of Islam in the United States for blacks .
Men and women sat separately on the mosque floor , heads covered , as cleric Nadim Ali recounted stories from history of Muslim slaves brought from Africa who struggled to uphold their faith in the face of slaveholders ’ opposition .
If Muslims could remain true to Islam under slavery , the audience should follow their example , Ali said at the Community Masjid of Atlanta in the city ’s West End district .
“ You are talking about a people who were cut off from their roots ....
Islam reconnects you with Africa and with other parts of the world so your peoplehood transcends race , ” Ali said later in an interview .
The mosque has a direct link to a slice of black history .
It was founded by H. Rap Brown , a one - time member of the 1960s Black Panthers group .
Brown became a Muslim in prison in the 1970s and changed his name to Jamil al - Amin .
He was convicted for killing a sheriff ’s deputy in Georgia in March 2000 and is serving a sentence of life without parole , but in his absence the mosque has continued what Ali said was the low - profile work of building a local Muslim community .
CONVERSION
The mosque teaches there was no distinction between Sunni and Shi’ite within Islam , according to people who attend regularly .
Sermons urged Muslims to find work , stay free from crime and drugs and maintain stable family lives .
Ali said he assumed the mosque was bugged and infiltrated by informers , in part because its leaders remained skeptical about U.S. policies since September 11 .
“ They ( the government ) unplug black people and plug in Arabs or Muslims .
They unplug Arabs and plug in communists .
America needs war to maintain its economic status , ” he said .
The larger Masjid of al - Islam mosque in another mainly black neighborhood of Atlanta is part of Warith Deen Muhammad ’s group .
Its imam , Plemon el - Amin , said he was involved with local interfaith work as well as with a local Islamic school .
One recent Friday , Mark King , a new convert , and hundreds of others at the mosque listened to a preacher urge Muslims to seek God through the Koran .
Followers of other faiths should seek God through their own holy books , the preacher said .
King , who wears his hair in dreadlocks , converted after visiting Africa for the first time and in Gambia read the Koran and realized its teaching chimed with his own beliefs , not least in fighting injustice .
“ For young African Americans , there is some attraction to learning about traditions that have been associated with resistance to European imperialism , ” said King , who has adopted the name Bilal Mansa since his conversion .
Special Report : Cycling Is Bicycling Safe ?
If you follow the rules of the road and ride carefully , cycling is actually much safer than driving .
By Ryan McGreal
Published September 09 , 2007
Raise the Hammer promotes cycling as a great transportation choice .
It 's cleaner and healthier than driving , producing zero emissions and achieving the equivalent of 595 km/l ( 1,400 mpg ) in fuel economy .
Nevertheless , would - be cyclists often ask :
But is it safe ?
Will I have to pay for my environmental choice with crippling injuries or premature death ?
An article in View Magazine a couple of months ago advocated for better bicycle infrastructure by focusing on cycling dangers .
Though well - intentioned , it reinforced many preconceptions without examining them for accuracy .
In fact , cycling is arguably safer than driving .
Comparing the Risks
Every activity carries risks , and are many possible ways to compare the relative risks of cycling and other activities .
Looking at several can help to form a more complete picture .
Fatality by Distance Cycled
The most obvious comparison is the fatality risk per distanced traveled .
In this straight - up analysis , cycling is more dangerous than driving .
Every 1.6 million kilometres ( one million kilometres ) cycled produces 0.039 cyclist fatalities , compared to 0.016 fatalities for motorists .
They 're both very low , but the risk for cycling is more than double .
However , this is not the most useful way to compare risks .
Fatality by Time Spent Cycling
Failure Analysis Associates , Inc. performed a comparative analysis of fatality rates for a variety of activities per million hours spent performing a given activity .
They concluded that the fatality rate for every million hours spent cycling is 0.26 , compared to 0.47 per million driving hours ( on - road motorcycling comes in at a whopping 8.80 deaths per million motorcycling hours ) .
That is , riding a motor vehicle has nearly twice the risk of fatality as riding a bike for a given duration .
Overall Fatality and Commute Homeostasis
According to the US National Safety Council , for every million cyclists in the US , 16.5 die each year , whereas for every million motorists , 19.9 die each year .
This is important , because it helps us to draw conclusions about how the higher risk per distance traveled interacts with the lower risk per time spent traveling .
Cycling is more dangerous on a straight distance comparison , but because drivers travel farther on average , the overall risk to an individual is higher for drivers than for cyclists .
This is related to what we might call " commute homeostasis " , or the amount of time a person is willing to spend traveling .
All things being equal , a person is willing to travel a farther distance only if they can get there faster .
People who drive tend to live farther away from destinations ( e.g. work commute ) than people who cycle .
In fact , one benefit of cycling is that it saves so much money that cyclists can often afford to live much closer to where they work .
Cycling also tends to place a premium on proximity , so cyclists are more likely to locate in places where many destinations are nearby , which reduces the cycling distance and hence the risk as a function of distance .
Fatality Rate in Crashes
Another way of evaluating risk is to examine the odds of dying if you do crash .
Common sense dictates that crashing in a bicycle has a higher risk of death than crashing in a motor vehicle , but according to the NHTSA , bicycles compare rather well .
The odds of dying from a bicycle crash are one in 71 .
This compares to one in 75 for a light truck ( pickup truck , SUV , van ) , one in 108 for a car , one in 43 for a truck , one in 26 for a motorcycle , and one in 15 for a pedestrian .
In other words , the odds of dying in a bike crash are about the same as the odds of dying in an SUV crash .
The false sense of security that comes from an SUV tends to produce far more dangerous driving behaviour .
Collision From Behind Possibly the most feared collision among would - by cyclists is the collision from behind by a fast - moving car .
This only makes sense : it 's frightening because it seems unavoidable , because the novice cyclist feels powerless against a two - tonne projectile passing too closely .
However , such collisions make up only a small percentage of total bicycle crashes .
According to a 2003 study in Toronto , collisions involving a motorist overtaking a bicycle accounted for only 11.9 percent of the total .
Among those collisions , the cyclist contained minimal or minor injuries in nearly 90 percent of the incidents .
Ken Kifer provides some excellent advice on how to maximize your safety around passing vehicles .
" Life Years " Gained and Lost
In addition to the direct risk of death or injury , cycling and driving also carry indirect risks that must be factored into account .
According to a study by the British Medical Association , the average gain in " life years " through improved fitness from cycling exceeds the average loss in " life years " through cycling fatalities by a factor of 20 to 1 .
Driving confers no commensurate health benefits through improved fitness ; in fact , time spent driving actually correlates with poorer overall health and higher risk of heart disease , obesity , diabetes , cancer , and related lifestyle diseases .
Psychologically , it 's hard to weigh the slight risk of being hit by a car tomorrow against the vastly reduced risk of having a heart attack in twenty years , but it is far too significant to ignore .
Risk is Mutable
Since cyclists are not a homogeneous bunch , it makes sense to examine whether and how cycling behaviour affects fatality rates .
It turns out that cyclists who ignore the rules are much more likely to die than cyclists who follow the rules .
The difference is so stark that it would make more sense to regard them as two separate populations for the sake of comparison .
Averaging the two groups - cyclists who follow or who disregard the law - together obscures the vast differences in their relative risks .
It also obscures the fact that an individual cyclist 's choices strongly influence their risk of fatality .
Cyclists are not helpless victims of safety statistics ( even encouraging statistics ) .
In many bicycle crashes , the cyclist is at least partially responsible .
Cyclists are hit when they ride on the sidewalk and appear out of nowhere at intersections ; when they pass on the right ; when they ride at night without lights and reflectors ; when they ride the wrong way down one way streets ; when they ride too closely to parked cars ; and so on .
Bike infrastructure can certainly help : streets with clearly marked , well - maintained bike lanes are safer than streets without them .
It 's also clear that bike lanes increase the perception of safety for would - be cyclists , which increases the number of cyclists on the road .
That , in turn , makes cycling safer because drivers come to expect to share the road .
However , the way you ride is a big factor in accident prevention .
The absolute best way to avoid accidents is to ride as though you are driving a motor vehicle .
In other words : be visible , follow the rules of the road , pay close attention to what 's happening around you , and practice defensive riding .
You will earn the respect of motorists , maximize your safety , and get the most enjoyment from cycling .

Google 's head of patents believes the U.S. patent system is " in crisis " .
Discussing patent reform at the annual Stanford Summit in Northern California , associate general counsel Michelle Lee told conference attendees that the American system is " out - of - balance [ and ] needs to be remedied " .
" The Patent Office is overburdened , " she said .
" The volume of patents going in is huge .
And the quality of patents coming out - it could be better . "
There are too many businesses , she added , who do little more than use patents as a means of making money .
Such businesses , often referred to as trolls in patent law , have proved to be a serious minefield for tech companies over the last few years .
Lee highlighted the tribulations of Research in Motion , maker of the BlackBerry handheld , which settled a patent lawsuit for $ 612 m last May .
Speaking alongside Lee , Apple 's chief patent counsel , Chip Lutton , would n't go quite so far as his Google counterpart .
He said the US patent system was " not broken " and that it was " not in crisis , " calling it " the best in the world " .
But he acknowledged that there was a " huge bubble " of patent assertions that needs to be scaled back .
" The question with this bubble market , as with any bubble market , is ' Can we solve it without a crisis arising ? ' " he said .
Lutton believes that the key to fixing the country 's patent problems lies with the courts , not the patent office .
" Most patents issued are never litigated and never licensed , " he said .
" We need to focus on fixing the litigation system .
That 's most relevant . "
Lutton 's attitude was mirrored by that of fellow speaker David Kappos , vice president and assistant general counsel for intellectual property law at IBM , the company that has led the country in patent filling for the last 14 years .
Perhaps Google is still learning how to play the patent game as well as seasoned veterans like Apple and IBM .
When asked if the company 's own struggles with the patent system where mostly the result of an increase in the number software patents issued or the rise in Google 's popularity , Lee picked popularity .
" When you become successful , " she said , " all of a sudden everyone wants a piece of it . " ®
Dr. Gazzaniga is famous for his work with split - brain patients , whose left and right hemispheres have been disconnected as a last - ditch treatment for severe epilepsy .
These are the experiments that have led to the notion , oversimplified in popular culture , that the left brain is predominantly analytical while the right brain is intuitive and laid - back .

The left brain , as Dr. Gazzaniga put it , is the confabulator , constantly concocting stories .
But mine was momentarily dumbstruck when , after his talk , I passed through a doorway inside the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and entered an air - conditioned simulation of the Grand Canal .
My eyes were drawn upward to the stunning illusion of a trompe l’oeil sky and what I decided must be ravens flying high overhead .
Looking closer , my brain discarded that theory , and I saw that the black curved wings were the edges of discs — giant thumbtacks holding up the sky .
Later I was told they were automatic sprinklers , in case the clouds catch fire .
“ It ’s ‘ The Truman Show , ’ ” said Robert Van Gulick , a philosopher at Syracuse University , as I joined him at a table overlooking a version of the Piazza San Marco .
A sea breeze was wafting through the window , the clouds were glowing in the late afternoon sun ( and they were still glowing , around 10:30 p.m. , when I headed back toward my hotel ) .
How could we be sure that the world outside the Venetian — outside Las Vegas itself — was n’t also a simulation ?
Or that I was n’t just a brain in a vat in some mad scientist ’s laboratory .
Dr. Van Gulick had come to the conference to talk about qualia , the raw , subjective sense we have of colors , sounds , tastes , touches and smells .
The crunch of the crostini , the slitheriness of the penne alla vodka — a question preoccupying philosophers is where these personal experiences fit within a purely physical theory of the mind .
Like physicists , philosophers play with such conundrums by engaging in thought experiments .
In a recent paper , Michael P. Lynch , a philosopher at the University of Connecticut , entertained the idea of a “ phenomenal pickpocket , ” an imaginary creature , like Apollo the thief , who distracts your attention while he removes your qualia , turning you into what ’s known in the trade as a philosophical zombie .
You could catch a ball , hum a tune , stop at a red light — act exactly like a person but without any sense of what it is like to be alive .
If zombies are logically possible , some philosophers insist , then conscious beings must be endowed with an ineffable essence that cannot be reduced to biological circuitry .
Dr. Lynch ’s fantasy was a ploy to undermine the zombie argument .
But if zombies do exist , it is probably in Las Vegas .

The latest bending machine , made by Panasonic Bendy Labs .
The object in need of bending is first placed carefully inside the bending chamber .
Next , the bendometer dial is set between 1 and 11 , with 1 producing a slight kink , and 11 curling it right around into an almost circular shape .
Once the big red button is pressed , the machine works in silence as it cleverly rearranges the object 's molecules into a bent shape .
Brenda Saddleworth : patiently waiting for the invention of the straightening machine .
Bending machines are becoming more and more popular in Japan , though it 's widely accepted that they could do with some help in the looks department ....
The machine is perfect for bending straight fruit which look better bent , such as bananas .
More and more supermarkets are using the bending machine to repair their faulty fruit and veg .
Here 's an example of the wonders which the machine can work ..... Recently , the machine even came in handy for Mao Asada , just prior to her appearance at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver .
She underwent a partial body insertion into the bending chamber , the effect of which was both stunning and eye - watering , and helped her towards her silver medal triumph .
If only they 'd turned the bendometer dial right up to 11 - then she may well have got the gold .
It does n't always work like clockwork , though .
Poor Brenda Saddleworth recently fell inside the bending chamber and no one realised until it was too late ....
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidates need to make a “ clean break ” from President George W. Bush and the U.S. government or they will lose in November 2008 , a veteran Republican leader said on Friday .
Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich speaks at the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda , California May 24 , 2007 .
Republican presidential candidates need to make a " clean break " from President George W. Bush and the U.S. government or they will lose in November 2008 , Gingrich said on Friday .

“ If you do n’t represent real change , you just gave away the 2008 election , ” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who led the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives in 1994 and now is flirting with a White House run .
Gingrich cited the Iraq war , the failed federal response to Hurricane Katrina two years ago and the inability to control U.S. borders and illegal immigration as evidence of a need for a complete overhaul of the U.S. system of governing .
“ Now that may or may not make the White House happy .
But I think that ’s the whole point about making a clean break , ” Gingrich told a group of reporters over breakfast .
He added : “ I believe for any Republican to win in 2008 they have to ... offer a dramatic , bold change .
If we nominate somebody who has not done that , they get to be the nominee but there is very , very little likelihood that they can win . ”
Gingrich echoed the view of many political analysts who believe voters are looking for a big change in 2008 and that Democrats hold a natural advantage after eight years with Bush in the White House .
While Gingrich , who has been considering a late entry into the Republican presidential race , said “ the odds are very high that I wo n’t run , ” he did not completely rule it out .
He said he would not make a final decision before September 29 , depending on whether he feels a candidate from the current Republican group can defeat the Democratic nominee and whether he would be able to raise at least $ 30 million for a race .
But Gingrich , who represented Georgia for 20 years , indicated that a push he is making for a grass - roots change in how the country is governed , with less partisanship , would take at least five years to develop into a coherent alternative to the current system .
DOES NOT TARGET BUSH
Gingrich said he did not intend to specifically target Bush , just that he is the current leader of a government that has taken decades to become overly bureaucratic and ineffective .
“ This is n’t about Bush , ” he said , calling the president “ a very decent man ” who “ believes very deeply in what he is doing . ”
Still , he took issue with a number of Bush ’s policies , and questioned why Bush felt the need to make an address to the country on Iraq on Thursday night , after the top U.S. officials in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker , had already laid out the situation earlier in the week .
“ The right two people to talk about Iraq were Gen. Petraeus and Amb. Crocker , ” said Gingrich .
On Iraq , Gingrich said that “ to stay the course I think in the long run is not a very sound strategy , ” and that the United States should work quickly to stop Iran ’s “ proxy war ” against U.S. troops in Iraq .
He said this should be done in a non-violent way , such as through diplomatic sanctions , economic pressure and covert action and “ if necessary with indirect military application . ”
Washington accuses Iran of exporting improvised bombs to Iraqi militants that are killing Americans , a charge Tehran denies .

BAGHDAD , Sept. 21 — Iraq ’s Ministry of Interior has concluded that employees of a private American security firm fired an unprovoked barrage in the shooting last Sunday in which at least eight Iraqis were killed and is proposing a radical reshaping of the way American diplomats and contractors here are protected .
Meanwhile , for the first time since the shootings United States embassy convoys began to leave the Green Zone today on “ a very limited basis , ” Mirembe Nantongo , an American Embassy spokeswoman , said in a statement .
“ This decision has been taken after consultation with Iraqi authorities . ”
The convoys all but stopped on Tuesday , when the Iraqi government banned Blackwater USA , a company that guards all senior American diplomats here , from working in the country .
But neither the statement nor another embassy official confirmed whether Blackwater was involved today , or who was providing security or where they traveled .
The official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject , conceded that it was “ likely ” that Blackwater was involved .
There would appear to be few alternatives .
The embassy could turn to State Department diplomatic security officers or another military contractor , but these options appear unlikely .
Avalanches are normally something you only worry about when you are lost in snowy mountains or when coming home from vacation and dealing with your junk mail .
But researchers studying hard drive technologies have recently discovered that " magnetic avalanches " may pose a serious threat to data stored on rapidly - spinning drives .
Joshua Deutsch , a physics professor at the University of California - Santa Cruz ( go Banana Slugs ! ) , and Andreas Berger of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies , reported the effect in the Physical Review Letters on July 13 .
Hard drives store data by magnetizing small clusters — called domains — of atoms that sit on rapidly - spinning platters .
The magnetic effect is created when an external magnetic field aligns the rotation and spin of electrons in the atom .
While the spin of an electron is not physically the same as that of a rotating body such as a planet or top , scientists have found that it can exhibit similar characteristics .
One of these is precession , the wobbling effect seen in spinning tops as they lose energy , and the cause of a 25,765 - year cycle on Earth that slowly changes the direction of the north and south axis .
Electrons that have their spin direction modified exhibit precession effects for a few nanoseconds , before they settle down and continue their quantum mechanical lifestyles .
However , during this period of precession , the electrons can exert forces on neighboring atoms that could cause those atoms ' electrons to flip spins as well , triggering an " avalanche " of bit - flipping that only dies down due to the damping effect of the physical material on the platter .
As PC World noted , Deutsch and Berger 's letter suggests that today 's hard drives are mostly immune to runaway avalanches because of this damping effect , something achieved by trial and error over the years as manufacturers found out what materials made for reliable hard drives .
However , as drive storage densities continue to increase , the problem could start to reassert itself unless more research is done to find the best materials for damping magnetic avalanches .

Antiwar demonstrators
Anyone who thought that the Brownites would be less zealous in the war on civil liberties will have to revise their opinion .
The government has threatened environmental protesters with the use of anti-terror laws so that they can be stopped and searched without evidence or reasonable suspicion , detained for up to a month without charge , have their homes searched etc .
Naturally , the police insist that they 're concerned about a ' minority ' of protesters who are intent on disruption .
Imagine someone disrupting something .
Imagine someone challenging the inalienable rights of private property .
Would n't that be simply
The anti-terror laws are nothing of the kind , of course .
That is sort of given away by the fact that they have been used almost exclusively against dissidents and protesters whoterrorists .
Those seeking to disrupt the Great British arms trade for instance Protesters outside the Labour conference .
And many others besides .
Which I do n't think is merely an odd coincidence .
Surely the only reasonable course of action is for as many people as can be there to attend and ensure that the camp is a little bit too big for the police to push around and bully .

-- Mayor Gavin Newsom vowed Sunday to maintain San Francisco as a sanctuary for immigrants and do everything he can to discourage federal authorities from conducting immigration raids .
The mayor cannot stop federal authorities from making arrests , Newsom told about 300 mostly Latino members of St. Peter 's Church and other religious groups supporting immigrants .
But no San Francisco employee will help with immigration enforcement .
" I will not allow any of my department heads or anyone associated with this city to cooperate in any way shape or form with these raids , " Newsom declared .
" We are a sanctuary city , make no mistake about it . "
The Board of Supervisors first declared San Francisco a " sanctuary city " in 1989 .
The designation , which many U.S. cities across the country took on during the 1980s , has no legal meaning .
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have since May 2006 conducted raids across the country , including arrests in San Rafael , Oakland , Richmond , San Pablo , Santa Clara and other cities across the Bay area .
Immigration officials have said they were executing arrest warrants for immigrants who had committed crimes or were in the country illegally and had ignored final deportation orders .
In the course of serving deportation warrants , the officials said , other people whom officers suspected of being illegal immigrants were questioned and then arrested .
Of at least 65 Marin County residents arrested in March , for example , just five had been ordered deported .
The raids , many of which conducted at private homes before dawn and some of which caught up legal immigrants and even citizens , have created an uproar in the Bay Area .
Politicians and community leaders have demanded they end , saying some immigrants parents are now afraid to send their children to school or leave home .
Immigration agents on Friday arrested 13 foreign nationals who were working illegally at Eagle Bag Corp. in Oakland , a packaging manufacturer whose clients include the U.S. military .
The arrests there of immigrants suspected of using counterfeit documents to obtain jobs were not related to the recent raids .
San Rafael Mayor Al Boro in March called on California 's U.S. senators , Democrats Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein , to push the immigration agency to change how it is enforcing immigration law because he believed children were the ones being hurt .
Marches and rallies are planned in coming weeks in Redwood City , San Francisco , Oakland , San Jose , Sacramento and other cities .
Porfirio Quintano was one of those who pleaded with Newsom , Senator Carole Migden and Assemblyman Mark Leno during Sunday 's meeting to do what they can to make San Francisco safe for immigrants .
The 42 - year - old immigrant from Honduras said his Richmond home was raided in 2003 by federal immigration agents based on what turned out to be bad information .
" We are victims , " said Quintano , adding that his wife and two daughters , then ages 4 and 10 , live in fear of another raid , even though they are in the country legally .
" They were looking for somebody unrelated to us , but they lined us up against the wall and held us for an hour .
It was terrifying , especially for our daughters . "
Newsom , Migden and Leno all vowed to work with other cities and legislators to put a stop to what they said was blatant intimidation of immigrants .
" Our action is to stand strong in opposition to these raids ... to make sure that we are not contributing in any way , shape or form , " Newsom said .
" Even legal immigrants are fearful .
This just sends a chill to a lot of people .
There are a lot of cities that want these raids .
That 's where the federal government should be spending their time . "
Geopolitics Democrats Roll Over Dead ( Figuratively - Iran Might Not Be So Lucky ) By Ryan McGreal
Published March 13 , 2007
US House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi has been working hard to bring a majority of Representatives around to her bill , which would tie the US $ 105 billion war - funding bill to a provision that the Bush administration withdraw its troops from Iraq by August 2008 .
It was a tough sell .
It seems every Democratic Representative had a different provision to tack on in exchange for support , and many of those provisions were antithetical to one another .
Liberal Democrats felt it did n't go far enough to compel the administration to adhere to the timeline .
Conservative Democrats felt that Congress should n't try to ' micromanage ' the war .
Jim McDermott ( D - Washington ) insisted that it prohibit the administration from attacking Iran without Congressional authorization , an authorization the Bush administration believes it does not need .
Conservative Democrats demanded that McDermott 's provision be stricken from the bill , presumably because they have n't read the US Constitution .
Yesterday the Associated Press reported that Pelosi and her backers caved into the demand by conservatives and pulled out McDermott 's provision .
AIPAC Impetus
Further , it seems much of the impetus for this came from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , an Israeli lobbying group with aggressively right - wing interests .
Cenk Uygur , a commentator on the HuffingtonPost blog , weighted in on AIPAC in an essay that also rips into the Democrats for giving in .
He said it better than I could have , so I 'll just excerpt his remarks :
These days the Israeli lobby no longer lobbies for Israel .
They lobby for the most right - wing , war - mongering part of the Israeli government .
They do n't represent the Israeli people or the whole government .
They certainly do n't represent what 's in Israel 's best interest .
They only represent hard right - wing , Likud politics .
If they represented what was in Israel 's best interest , why on God 's green earth would they have lobbied for the Iraq War ?
All that war has done is destabilize the region , created more Sunni and Shiite extremists - both of whom hate Israel , and strengthened Iran .
The Iraq War has been an utter disaster for Israel .
And yet the so - called Israeli lobby lobbied for it .
Now , they are doing the same with Iran .
And if you thought the Iraq War turned out badly for Israel , wait till you get a load of the Iran War .
Who knew that it would be so difficult for the elected representatives of the majority party to follow the will of the majority of US citizens in curtailing the warmongering of the reckless president and his administration ?
This is why the Democratic Party barely won the last election instead of sweeping it : unlike the Republicans , who know exactly what they want and successfully manage their various constituencies ( chiefly wealthy economic conservatives and dogmatic social conservatives ) , the Democrats are torn between their commitment to the public and their entanglements in the sources of US corporate and political power .
Deathly afraid of taking a stand that might alienate independents or turn out to be unpopular , the Democrats end up losing popularity anyway by disappointing their constituents and confirming the Republican accusation that they 're simply opportunists .
Partisan Lobbying
This leaves them susceptible to organizations like AIPAC , which have surprisingly strong and enduring sway over US politics out of a combination of deep pockets ( it reportedly has an annual budget of US $ 65 million ) , broad reach , and considerable political savvy .
AIPAC started out essentially non-partisan but , as Uygur notes , has tilted by degrees to the right .
Today it respresents the Likud / Kadima wing of Israeli politics and the Republican wing of American politics and presses its interests through a combination of " education " programs for elected officials and old - fashioned intimidation .
Juan Cole , a scholar of modern Middle Eastern history at the University of Michigan , wrote about AIPAC in August 2004 :
Note that over 80 percent of American Jews vote Democrat [ and ] that the majority of American Jews opposed the Iraq war ( more were against it than in the general population ) ...
The Likudniks like to pretend that they represent American Jewry , but they do not .
And they like to suggest that objecting to their policies is tantamount to anti-Semitism , which is sort of like suggesting that if you do n't like Chile 's former dictator Pinochet , you are bigoted against Latinos .
Ultimately , this all rests on the assumption that Iran is an enemy of the US and Israel and that Bush needs the latitude to respond quickly and effectively to Iran 's threats .
There 's just one problem : Iran is not the USA 's enemy ( or Israel 's , for that matter ) .
Iran is not doing anything illegal or dangerous , is in full compliance with international law , and is not threatening anyone with anything .
These are amply demonstrated facts , despite the relentless , high - frequency feedback whine of anti-Iranian propaganda .
The AIPAC claim that Bush needs the legislative freedom to act quickly to defend Israel against Iran is bogus .
" Wiped off the Map "
Since I know someone 's going to make it , let 's put the " wiped off the map " remark to bed right now .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is regularly accused of saying , " Israel must be wiped off the map " - which would certainly be disconcerting if it were true .
However , it 's not .
Ahmadinejad , like most Persians , speak Farsi .
No so such idiom as " wiped off the map " exists in that langauge .
Juan Cole debunked this interpretation in June 2005 :
The phrase he then used as I read it is " The Imam said that this regime occupying Jerusalem ( een rezhim- e ishghalgar -e qods ) must [ vanish from ] from the page of time ( bayad az safheh - ye ruzgar mahv shavad ) . "
Ahmadinejad was not making a threat , he was quoting a saying of Khomeini and urging that pro-Palestinian activists in Iran not give up hope - that the occupation of Jerusalem was no more a continued inevitability than had been the hegemony of the Shah 's government .
Whatever this quotation from a decades - old speech of Khomeini may have meant , Ahmadinejad did not say that " Israel must be wiped off the map " with the implication that phrase has of Nazi - style extermination of a people .
He said that the occupation regime over Jerusalem must be erased from the page of time .
Further , the quote is best understood in the context that Ahmadinejad is actually a figurehead , and that Iran 's policy toward Israel is determined by the Ayatollah Khamenei , Supreme Leader of Iran .
That policy was explained by Ali Ashgar Soltanieh , Iran 's representative to the IAEA :
[ I ] f in that region , the divine religion followers of the Jews , Christians and Muslims ... come with the Palestinians , homeless Palestinians , to come and through following the democratic process will decide on a government and live in peace as they were living a thousand years of coexistence of these divine religions , Iran will support because we are looking for and we support peaceful settlement of the whole issue and peaceful coexistence of these divine religions in the Middle East .
In other words , Iran believes everyone in Israel - Muslims , Jews , Christians , and every other religion - should be allowed to participate in a binding referendum on what form its government should take .
Iran Does n't Want War
Finally , it 's worth pointing out that Israel is oppressing the Palestinians in a number of unquestionably illegal ways , and has been since 1967 .
It 's hard to tease Ahmadinejad 's politics from his bigotry , since one reinforces the other , but you do n't have to be an anti-Semite ( I 'm not one ) to recognize that Israel really should end the regime occupying Palestine .
Iran has a long record of not being aggressive , expansionary , or threatening , despite over three solid decades of censure by the US ( ever since the Revolution overthrew the US - imposed and - backed despot Shah Reza ) .
Its real leadership is savvy and pragmatic enough not to launch an attack that would result in Iran 's obliteration under an Israeli and / or US nuclear retaliation .
Ahmadinejad says what he thinks his base wants to hear .
He actually miscalculated with his remark about Israel and lost a lot of popularity at home , mostly because Iranians know it has simply fed anti-Iranian sentiment in Israel and the US .
Of course , Iran does n't want to be invaded and wants to be left alone to develop its nuclear program , of which there is no evidence that Iran plans to build weapons ( and Iran allowed the IAEA full , unimpeded access to its facilities far beyond what is required under the Non Proliferation Treaty ) .
All in all , based on these considerations , I 'm more disposed to believe that the Iranian government and its spokespeople mean what they say about not wanting a fight than I am to believe anything the Bush Administration or AIPAC says about the situation .

3/10/04 - Congressional briefing on domestic wiretap program
3/10/04 - Gonzales hospital visit .
Negroponte and Mueller said they did n't know .
But Negroponte 's deputy , Gen. , who until recently was director of the NSA , said , " I 'd like to answer in closed session . "

2/11/04 - Senate Intelligence Committe hearing : " one of TIA 's strongest critics questioned whether intelligence officials knew that some of its programs had been moved to other agencies .
Sen. Ron Wyden , D - Ore. , asked Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte and FBI Director Robert Mueller whether it was " correct that when [ TIA ] was closed , that several ... projects were moved to various intelligence agencies ....
I and others on this panel led the effort to close [ TIA ] ; we want to know if Mr. Poindexter 's programs are going on somewhere else . "
1/04 - Given the pattern established in the prior three years twenty - seven months , there should have been a briefing of Congress in January 2004 , but it did not occur .
7/18/03 - Senate votes unanimously to block funding for the Total Information Awareness program .
According to the Defense Department appropriations , no funding " may be obligated or expended on research and development on the Terrorism Information Awareness program . " - - over Bush admin. objections .

I am retaining a copy of this letter in a sealed envelope in the secure spaces of the Senate Intelligence Committee to ensure that I have a record of this communication .
As I reflected on the meeting today , and the future we face , John Poindexter 's TIA project sprung to mind , exacerbating my concern regarding the direction the Administration is moving with regard to security , technology , and surveillance .
I am writing to reiterate my concerns regarding the sensitive intelligence issues we discussed today with the DCI , DIRNSA , Chairman Roberts and our House Intelligence counterparts .
7/17/03 - Briefing for Intelligence Committee leadership ( Pat Roberts , Jay Rockefeller , Porter Goss , and Jane Harman ) on domestic wiretap program .
This would be the last briefing before the crisis March 10 meeting .
7/17/03 - After his SECOND briefing on the program , Jay Rockefeller writes his CYA memo to Cheney , which states ( thanks to Ann for the reminder on the date ) :
5/20/03 - 90 days later , Pentagon changes name of TIA from Total Information Awareness to Terrorist Information Awareness and calls it new program .
Problem solved !
I 'd like to pull out just a few salient dates and add four ( in bold italics ) to what joejoejoe did .
I think the time line lends support for the argument that one of the problems -- a big problem -- with the domestic wiretap program is that it violated clear instructions from Congress .
Commenter joejoejoe sent me a superb timeline to show the chronology of Congress ' building opposition to the Total Information Awareness program as it relates to the NSA 's domestic wiretap program ( how cool is that ?
I , the chronology weenie , am getting timelines out of the blue !
Better than Christmas !! ) , which appears at the bottom of this post .
In other words , the Administration briefed Congress on the domestic wiretap program the day before the Senate made it explicit that they would not permit any data - mining of American citizens .
That July 2003 briefing occurred in the normal pattern established in the previous two years , so it may be a coincidence .
Or it may be that the Administration briefed Congress when they did before they would have a legal obligation to inform them they were breaking the law prohibiting data - mining of Americans .
But that was also the briefing after which Rockefeller wrote his memo to Cheney expressing concerns about the program .
I had always understood that Rockefeller sent that memo after his first briefing on the program .
But that 's not right -- he was briefed on January 29 , 2003 , but presumably sent no memo after that meeting .
In other words , something about the July 17 briefing raised new concerns for him , and one of those concerns was the program 's apparent similarity to the TIA program , which the Senate was just about to vote to explicitly prohibit funding .
Then , as I 've pointed out before , the Administration skipped the briefing they should have held in January 2004 , the first briefing after the law went into effect .
They do n't hold a briefing until March 10 , when they 've hit a crisis .
Significantly , this is the first ( of two , the second being in January 2006 , after the NYT has exposed the program ) briefing that includes Congressional leadership , in addition to the Intelligence Committee leadership ; plus , there 's the Tom DeLay briefing the next day , on March 11 .
We know they asked whether it'd be possible to pass legislation to make the program legal , so it 's likely they finally included Congressional leadership in the briefings because they wanted legislation passed .
Were they trying to legislate a work - around of the Appropriations Act ?
That might explain why the Gang of 8 told them it would n't happen , there was no way Congress would permit the program legislatively .
And of course , they do n't brief Congress ( though they do brief Pete Hoekstra , when he becomes Chair of HPSCI ) again until February 2005 .
Eleven long months when they did n't tell Congress they ( may have ) been breaking the law .

Sandra Camille Bridewell lives these days in a cramped cell in the Brunswick County Jail in North Carolina , a long way away from her days as a charming and attractive Marin County socialite whom male admirers showered with money and gifts .
Now 62 , she is awaiting trial on charges of swindling an elderly woman she was hired to care for .
Investigators say heartache and tragic death have followed her from coast to coast .
Over the years , at least one of her three husbands and a best friend have died under strange circumstances .
She is , to this day , the only suspect in the death of her third husband in 1985 , a homicide case that Oklahoma City detectives recently reopened .
Which explains the unusual step taken by Brunswick County sheriff 's Detective Marty Folding , who is pulling out the stops to keep Bridewell behind bars .
He put out a nationwide plea for law enforcement officers and people who have known Bridewell to come forward with anything they know about her criminal exploits .
" We need to get the other agencies to start looking at her again , " said Folding , who is leading the investigation .
" If they do n't , this woman is going to walk out again free . "
What is it about this woman that has created so much alarm ?
Numerous interviews and searches through newspaper archives , court documents and dozens of articles on the Internet paint a picture of a person who apparently uses people for their money , status and connections and drops them as soon as they are no longer useful to her .
She has used a variety of names over the years , including Sandra Camille Powers , Sandra Stegall , Sandra Rehrig and Camille Bridewell .
But she is best remembered by acquaintances as the Black Widow .
She comes off as intelligent and charming , but investigators believe she should never again be out on the streets .
" It 's nothing we 've been able to establish on the evidence , but , boy , I 'd be scared to live with her , " Folding said .
" As far as financial fraud , I feel that 's the way she has made her living for years .
If she committed ( any ) murders , I want her to pay for them .
That 's why we wanted the media and the national attention on this -- to try to get the eyes opened again . "
Bail in the North Carolina fraud case is set at $ 1.5 million , with a bail reduction hearing scheduled for Wednesday .
Bridewell did not respond to a written request for an interview , but she is presenting herself as a devout Christian and has made it clear that she believes she is doing God 's work .
Bridewell easily wove herself into the social fabric of wealthy Marin County after she arrived in the Bay Area in 1987 , according to those who encountered her .
Dark - haired and curvaceous , she moved into a home on the water in Belvedere and used her Southern belle allure to mesmerize wealthy men .
Elizabeth Merrill of Tiburon said she met Bridewell at a ladies ' luncheon at the Franciscan Club in 1988 and later introduced her new friend to a wealthy financier from Hong Kong .
He was smitten , Merrill said the other day .
Dennis Kuba , a horseman and Santa Rosa lawyer , and Thomas Finney , a married insurance executive from Southern California , were similarly captivated .
According to subsequent lawsuits , Bridewell allegedly persuaded the men to lend her what was calculated to be about $ 100,000 .
The money was never paid back , and Kuba and Finney sued in an attempt to collect the debt , but by then Bridewell had disappeared .
That 's when rumors surfaced about a previous life in Dallas , one that prompted investigators , former friends and in - laws of Bridewell to begin calling her the Black Widow .
That life began in 1967 , according to court records , when Bridewell married a Dallas dentist named David Stegall .
The couple had three children and traveled in wealthy circles , friends and relatives said .
On Feb. 22 , 1976 , Bridewell found her husband dead in a bedroom with slashed wrists and a bullet in the left temple , according to several news accounts .
Dallas investigators concluded the fatal wounds were self - inflicted .
Records showed that Bridewell collected more than $ 300,000 after selling the house and receiving her husband 's life insurance .
In 1978 , she married Bobby Bridewell , a hotel and real estate developer , who also hobnobbed with the cream of Dallas society , acquaintances said .
He adopted her children and then , in 1980 , was stricken with cancer .
He died two years later at 41 .
Meanwhile , according to investigators and acquaintances , Bridewell had made friends with her dying husband 's doctor , John Bagwell .
She called Bagwell 's wife , Betsy , her " best friend , " investigators confirmed .
One night in June 1982 , Betsy Bagwell put some meat in the sink to thaw and told her children not to " pig out " while she went out to do an errand , according to various accounts to reporters and investigators .
Before she could prepare the meal , though , she was found dead inside her Mercedes , which was parked near a rental car lot , investigators have said .
The county medical examiner ruled that Bagwell had shot herself in the right temple with a stolen . 22 - caliber revolver .
Two years later , Bridewell met Alan Rehrig , a handsome 29 - year - old former basketball and football player at Oklahoma State University .
Rehrig married Bridewell after she told him she was pregnant .
She was 40 at the time , but she told the groom she was 36 , according to his mother , Gloria Rehrig , who said Bridewell later informed her new husband that she had miscarried .
Her obsession with the Dallas beau monde put a strain on their marriage , and in 1985 they separated .
Then , on Dec. 7 , 1985 , Rehrig agreed to meet Bridewell at a storage locker in Dallas to move some belongings .
His body , dressed in shorts , was discovered four days later by Oklahoma City police slumped inside his Ford Bronco .
He had been shot twice with a .32 - revolver and his body had frozen in the cold .
Bridewell , who was the beneficiary of her husband 's life insurance policy , insisted that Rehrig never showed up at the storage locker .
Oklahoma police and the FBI began investigating Bridewell .
Among the things they and the Rehrig family learned was that Bridewell had undergone a hysterectomy almost a decade earlier .
Rehrig 's mother filed a petition in Texas to prevent Bridewell from getting the insurance money .
" It took two or three years for her to bleed me dry in terms of legal fees and I finally had to give up and she got the insurance money , " Gloria Rehrig said .
" She got $ 100,000 from Al . "
Some years later , Bridewell traveled through the South , presenting herself as a Christian missionary , according to Folding , the North Carolina detective .
Allegations of credit card misuse and unpaid debts followed her wherever she went , Folding said .
In December 2003 , Bridewell was back in California and ingratiated herself to Stephen and Karen Retter of Novato .
Stephen 's then 92 - year - old father , John Retter , needed help , so they let Bridewell , now using the name Camille , move into his Santa Rosa home .
One day the elderly man 's wife found Bridewell whispering " I love you " to him and kicked her out , according to Stephen Retter .
The family said they later discovered that Bridewell was soliciting checks from the elder Retter .
Santa Rosa police were called in but no arrest was made , Retter said .
Last September , Bridewell moved into the Southport , N.C. , home of 77 - year - old Sue Moseley .
This time using the name Camille Powers , she ran up a $ 1,900 bill on Moseley 's credit card and dipped into her bank account to purchase clothes and other items , according to Folding .
She was arrested on March 2 on charges of credit card fraud , theft of credit cards , forgery and passing forged checks .
Folding said two people in two different states have come forward saying she scammed them also .
Oklahoma City detectives , meanwhile , are investigating the Rehrig slaying anew .
Bridewell , Folding said , is using her time in the North Carolina jail to spread the Lord 's word .
" She 's a very , very smart lady , and she is good , " Folding said .
" She 's back there right now , I can tell you , preaching to the other inmates . "

Ivory Coast 's Wolosso music is all the craze in Conakry
Teenagers wearing skirts or hipsters , associated with Wolosso , which partly expose their buttocks and midriff have been stripped naked and beaten up .
The attacks follow a performance by an Ivorian Wolosso group last week .
The provocative dance is considered by many in the mainly Muslim West African country to be pornographic .
Craze
The police have confirmed a few cases of alleged rape committed by the rampaging youths and more than 30 men have been detained in connection with the violence .
Young Guinean girls and African women in general should not dress themselves like European girls
Conakry resident
Some girls refuse to go to the Bambeto and Cosa suburbs of the capital , Conakry , for fear of being a target .
Others have resorted to donning the long traditional wraps to avoid incurring their wrath .
The craze for Wolosso music and the dress style adopted by fashionable teenagers and women in the capital has become a hot topic of debate .
" Young Guinean girls and African women in general should not dress themselves like European girls , " one man told the BBC .
One woman decried " this Wolosso business " .
" In a Muslim country like ours , we should not be watching and imitating these music videos .
I advise all girls and women to dress themselves in proper clothes . "
A younger woman said that wearing revealing outfits at night was not advisable .
" But during the day I do n't see what the problem should be .
Everyone has the right to wear what makes them happy .
I 'm a young girl - should I be forced to dress in a certain way ? "
Ivorians I have spoken to in Conakry deny that the lyrics themselves are pornographic .
They claim the music is used as a backing for pirate videos with lewd dances .
Seven very dark holes on the north slope of a Martian volcano are seen in this undated handout photo .
An orbiting spacecraft has found evidence of what look like seven caves on the slopes of a Martian volcano , the space agency NASA said on Friday .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
An orbiting spacecraft has found evidence of what look like seven caves on the slopes of a Martian volcano , the space agency NASA said on Friday .
The Mars Odyssey spacecraft has sent back images of very dark , nearly circular features that appear to be openings to underground spaces .
“ They are cooler than the surrounding surface in the day and warmer at night , ” said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey ’s Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University .
“ Their thermal behavior is not as steady as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature , but it is consistent with these being deep holes in the ground . ”
The holes , which the researchers have nicknamed the “ Seven Sisters , ” are at some of the highest altitudes on the planet , on a volcano named Arsia Mons near Mars ’ tallest mountain , the researchers report in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
“ Whether these are just deep vertical shafts or openings into spacious caverns , they are entries to the subsurface of Mars , ” said USGS researcher Tim Titus .
“ Somewhere on Mars , caves might provide a protected niche for past or current life , or shelter for humans in the future . ”
But not these caves .
“ These are at such extreme altitude , they are poor candidates either for use as human habitation or for having microbial life , ” Cushing said .
“ Even if life has ever existed on Mars , it may not have migrated to this height . ”
Okie here , back from the SENS3 conference in Cambridge , and slowly recovering from jet lag .
General thoughts :
As a scientist , it is a challenge to present my work to a mixed group of scientists and ( particularly well - educated ) lay people .
Where translational research is concerned , however , I think that lay people do a great job keeping us researchers focused on the prize and not just on ( interesting ) esoteric points .
As in my previous conference reports ( see here and here ) I will cover general themes of the meeting , as well as summarizing specific presentations that I found most interesting .
Unfortunately I can’t cover them all ; what I decide to cover is purely subjective and perhaps even a bit arbitrary .
Also , I may skip or gloss over talks / themes that were repeated from the Edmonton conference with little progress .
Themes :
Biomedical remediation
The fascinating field of biomedical remediation ( essentially the brain - child of Aubrey de Grey ) is moving along quickly .
We heard from two collaborating / competing groups : Pedro Alvarez from Rice and John Schloendorn , a student from Tempe , Arizona being supported directly by the Methuselah Foundation .
Pedro is a brilliant environmental chemist / bioremediation guy turning some of his talents on the biological problem of lipofuscin accumulation .
The work is progressing rapidly .
Both teams have identified strains of bacteria capable of using 7 - ketocholesterol ( one precursor of the poorly defined lipofuscin ) as energy .
The next goal is to clone the genes .
After that they want to purify the enzyme responsible and feed it to people and see if it will break down our lipofuscin .
My only criticism is n’t with the method , results , or rate of progress ( which are all fantastic ) .
My issue is that they are trying to solve a problem that has n’t been proved to be a problem yet .
Lipofuscin accumulation has long been associated with aging in many tissues , but never ( as far as I am aware ) proved to be responsible for any illness , ailment , or disease .
Now , do n’t get me wrong , Aubrey makes an excellent argument for this being a serious problem with no traditional biomedical solution in sight , but it ’s still just theory .
As one of my old mentors used to say , “ In this game you ’ve got to have data ! ”
Here ’s my 2 cents :
Now that they ’re homing in on the genes , how about cloning the gene and making a transgenic mouse ?
Might be easier to look at toxicity , long - term affects , and efficacy with a transgenic ; though dosage control is problematic with transgenics .
Wound Healing / Artificial Repair
In my opinion , this was the most provocative and promising aspect of the research at SENS 3 .
Really cool stuff below .
Cato Laurencin is an amazing individual .
He is one of those rare clinicians who can aim high - quality research directly at clinical applications .
He calls his approach “ regenerative engineering . ”
As I work in a bioengineering department , I sit through a lot of boring biomaterials talks .
It was amazing , however , to see someone actually using a few in something practical !
In my opinion , this is the reality of regenerative medicine : an innovative surgeon combining technology and knowledge of biology to partially repair injuries such that they will heal as well , or better than they started .
Dr. Laurencin showed results from his work on 3D absorbable poly L - lactide ( PLLA ) scaffolds that seem to promote recovery from surgery much more efficiently than traditional methods .
This is a microsphere - based scaffold , which promotes efficient invasion and engraftment of osteoblasts to help repair bone .
He is also investigating surfaces with nano - scale grooves , which are more conducive to mesenchymal stem cell proliferation .
Rutledge Ellis- Behnke spoke on his work with SAPNS : Self Assembling Peptide Nanofiber Scaffold .
Essentially , he squirts a solution containing these nanofibers into wound sites and reportedly achieves amazing results .
He reports dramatic recovery from serious brain injury : both scarless repair of bulk brain tissue removal and reinnervation .
In addition , he claims that the nanofibers can dramatically stop bleeding in wounds ( he showed video of this ) .
These results are so dramatic that they are almost unbelievable .
There are some videos attached to this paper that are pretty darn amazing .
The mechanism of action is unknown .
Right along these lines , Robin Franklin gave an interesting talk about myelin repair / regeneration .
To summarize the take - home message : the presence of differentiated tissue / cells / debris inhibits efficient re-myelination .
If they inhibit clearance of dead myelin by artificial or natural means , re-myelination does not occur .
The real trick now is to figure out how to stimulate clearance of damaged myelin ( especially in old animals ) , and the holy grail will be to discover which factor (s ) in the damage / differentiated tissue inhibit regeneration .
Muscle aging
Two groups and three speakers addressed the issue of aged muscle , muscle regeneration , and muscle stem cells .
Gillian Buttler - Brown summarized her previous work on human cells , establishing that myoblasts ( muscle progenitors ) senesce in culture and that cells from old people senesce slightly faster than those from young donors .
Interestingly , she showed preliminary work analyzing the “ secretome ” of myotubes generated from old or young myoblasts .
This was inspired by the work of the Campisi lab on the secretome of senescent cells .
Michael Conboy summarized the recent work from the Conboy lab showing how old muscle stem cells can be revitalized after being exposed to a young systemic environment and how embryonic stem cells can have a similar paracrine affect on revitalizing old muscle cells .
He then described his recent work on asymmetric cell division in muscle stem cells .
Basically , the stem cells tend to divide so that the original copy of the DNA stays with one daughter cell and the newly synthesized DNA segregates with the other daughter cells .
This ensures that some stem cells remain behind with original copies of the DNA ( which are presumably of higher fidelity ) .
Another talk from the Conboy lab ( by yours truly ) was a short study on the telomere regulation of muscle stem cells .
Basically , we discovered that truly pure , undifferentiated muscle stem cells ( satellite cells ) have very high telomerase activity .
Furthermore , they continue to fully maintain their telomerase activity and telomeres with age .
This supports the idea that muscle stem cells remain intrinsically young , even while their tissue ages around them .
Other topics
If you ’re not already familiar with Sangamo , I highly suggest you check out this exciting young company .
This is n’t garden - variety gene therapy – it ’s gene editing , for lack of a better word .
It ’s not introducing exogenous DNA into your cells , it ’s editing your genomic DNA .
Right now ( since gene therapy does n’t work ) the best approaches ( in my opinion ) involve ex vivo manipulation of cells ( and the immune system is the most amenable to this approach ) .
As you can imagine , this technology could also be extremely useful for cell culture lab experiments .
No more need to create knockout mice just to generate knockout cells .
You can do it with many cell types and should work in any species .
Right now it is ridiculously expensive to have them generate a cell line for you ( I heard $ 20 k a while ago ) , but they just made a deal with Sigma to start selling the tech to labs , so I figure they are planning on making it large - scale and affordable to researchers .
What I would like to hear are ways to apply this tech to make cells better , in addition to curing diseases ( like AIDS ) .
There is an NIA project to test various compounds on the lifespan of mice .
No real results are available yet , but if you have a favorite drug , vitamin , or supplement of any kind then you too can recommend that it be tested on mice !
Randy Strong of UT - San Antonio gave this presentation .
A great disappointment to me was the cancellation of Rita Effros ’ talk .
A rather , um , interesting talk was pulled together at the last minute to replace her .
A gentleman from a small company collaborating with Geron is selling a “ nutraceutical ” which is supposedly a potent activator of hTERT expression .
For the low , low price of $ 25 k per year , you too can extend your telomeres .
They are avoiding FDA regulation by calling it a nutraceutical instead of a drug and by NOT doing any clinical trials .
I find it ironic that it ’s possible to escape regulation by not doing any testing to ensure its safety .
They do n’t know what tissues the drug nutraceutical is targeted to .
About a dozen clients have been taking the compound for 3 - 9 months .
They report extension of mean telomere length of granulocytes ( but not yet other immune cells ) and an improvement in vision .
There are no placebos or negative controls of any kind ( controls would make it an experiment , which would make it a drug ) .
Honestly , I ’m really glad that there are people out there willing ( desperate enough ) to do this sort of self - experimentation and I ’m anxious to see the long - term results .
Ruth Itzhaki has made an interesting connection between Alzheimer ’s disease and herpes virus infection .
According to her results , people with the APOE4 allele and an HSV1 infection ( that ’s the “ kissing disease ” with which 90 % of people are infected , not genital herpes ) were more likely to develop symptoms of Alzheimer ’s , and more severe symptoms , than patients with the APOE4 allele alone .
She finds that viral load is concentrated in AB plaques and speculates that one HSV1 glycoprotein has a similar structure to the AB protein .
Finally , she finds increased phosphorylation of Tau protein after HSV1 infection .
Currently , no HSV1 vaccination is approved for use in humans …
Zheng Cui ( Winston - Salem , NC ) is a man with a mission to cure cancer .
You may have heard about his method before : it ’s a sort of brute force immunotherapy approach .
He isolates white blood cells from a donor and injects them into the “ patient ” ( in most cases a mouse ) .
The granulocytes then attack the tumor and “ cure ” the cancer .
One drawback from this type of therapy is that it requires 10 donors for every recipient .
He has done some human work and human granulocytes definitely do the job in vitro .
These are just a sampling a lot of fantastic talks and I wish I had time to write about all of them .
The videos of all of the talks will eventually be posted online and I urge you to check them out when they become available at the conference website .
There were also a number of talks of questionable scientific quality or virtue .
I like to think that the field of aging science is separating from the age - old snake - oil stereotypes , but there was definitely a fair amount of what I would term “ pseudo - science . ”
You can check those talks out too .
On a final note , I would like to make a comment about the state of the art .
I would like to see more theoretical and statistical work on which problems of aging are the most pressing / serious ones .
I think Aubrey ’s “ 7 deadly things ” is a well thought out plan for tackling the problem of universal aging .
What I would like to see is some data on which problem (s ) are rate limiting .
For example , what if solving the problem of “ too few cells ” ( cell death and senescence in aging ) would double human lifespan all by itself while all the others put together would barely accomplish the same ?
The keynote talk ( by Ryan Phoenix ) included some modeling of how soon SENS treatments could be available , how soon we would need to solve the 7 things in order to treat people alive today , and how often treatments would need to be repeated .
This all relied , however , on the assumption than all 7 deadly things were created equally .
Everyone agrees that we should take steps to provide the most immediate benefits to humankind , but no one agrees on what these are .
In closing :
The humorous poster of my friend and fellow conference attendee George Hinkal , who helped with this piece by encouraging me to add a couple things and helping to clarify a couple others .

For all the tokers and plant people .
The world 's cuddliest diplomats are out of a job .
China will no longer give giant pandas to foreign countries as a way of improving international relations , the domestic media has reported .
Ending an ancient tradition , wildlife officials said the endangered animals would only be lent for breeding and biological research .
But questions are likely to be raised about the financial motives behind a decision that looks likely to boost the lucrative business of renting out the animals to zoos for as much as $ 1 m ( £ 490,000 ) a year .
Panda diplomacy dates back more than a thousand years .
Tang dynasty records show that two of the bear - like beasts were presented to the Japanese court during the reign of the empress Wu Zetian ( 624 to 705 ) .
The practice reached its peak in the early 1970s , when Mao Zedong sent the furry black - and - white ambassadors across the globe on a diplomatic charm offensive .
A breakthrough summit with Richard Nixon in 1972 was sealed with the gift of Hsing Hsing and Ling Ling .
Two years later the British prime minister Edward Heath was rewarded for his friendship with the present of Chia Chia and Ching - Ching to London 's zoo .
These days the world 's fastest growing major economy is more likely to seek international influence through trade , aid and investment .
Conservationists are also concerned that pandas are too rare to be given away as diplomatic trophies .
There are believed to be only 1,600 pandas in the wild , living in the nature reserves of Sichuan , Gansu and Shaanxi provinces .
But the captive population has made a comeback in recent years , providing a ready supply for foreign zoos .
Even so , according to ChinaNews , the age of the free panda friendship symbol is over .
" The Chinese government has stopped giving pandas as gifts abroad .
We will only be conducting research with foreign countries , " the website quoted Cao Qingyuan , a state forestry administration spokesman , as saying .
But airlines have not seen their last panda passengers .
Under an international research and breeding programme the forestry administration rents them out on 10 - year leases .
The charge to foreign zoos depends on a a number of factors , including visitor revenues .
In the US and Japan the yearly fees are about $ 1 m .
Extra payments are made if the pandas give birth .
This summer the mainland presented a pair of pandas to Hong Kong to mark the 10th anniversary of the handover from British rule .
Two others have been offered to Taiwan , but , with cross-straits relations fractious , they have not yet left their birthplace in Wolong , Sichuan province .
Mr Cao said the gifts to the two Chinese islands were a special case of " sending pandas between brothers " .
Backstory
President Richard Nixon 's trip to China in 1972 ended 25 years of isolation between the US and the People 's Republic and resulted in the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979 .
As a result , China gave the US two pandas .
In this edited conversation , Nixon and his wife Pat discuss the animals ' impending arrival in Washington :
Richard Nixon
The weather 's good here , they [ the pandas ] can live in this kind of weather when they get here .
We do n't know when it [ the arrival ] is , but around the first of April , if you 're here , it'd be awfully nice if you go out [ to meet them ]
Pat Nixon
Oh , yeah .
I 'd like to ...
Richard Nixon
Ya know , and uh , it 's ... it 's gonna be a hell of a story .

TOMORROW NIGHT ON NOW : RAPING AMERICANS IN IRAQ
Our military can no longer function without women .
But with roughly one in seven of America 's active - duty military soldiers female , a NOW investigation found that sexual assault and rape are widespread .
A study of National Guard and Reserve forces found that almost one in four women had been assaulted or raped .
Last year alone , almost 3,000 soldiers reported sexual assault and rape by other soldiers .
Tomorrow night , Friday , September 7 , the PBS program NOW features women who speak out for the first time about what happened to them .
One woman recounts her ordeal of rape by her superior officer .
Many more do n't report the incidents for fear of how it will affect their careers .
The shocking phenomenon has a label : military sexual trauma , or MST .
NOW meets women courageously battling to overcome their MST , bringing light to an issue that 's putting the Army to shame .
No wonder there has been so much effort on the part of those who run PBS to get NOW cancelled .
They did manage to reduce it from an hour long to half an hour despite its popularity , making it difficult for producers to report in depth .
It 's the only program on PBS to wander much beyond the corporate media parameters .
A NOW exclusive investigation tomorrow night on your local PBS station .
CORPORATE MEDIA BLACKOUT : KUCINICH
Margaret Kimberley has a magnificent piece at Black Agenda Report this morning discussing the shameful corporate media censorship of the Kucinich campaign .
Those in power fear nothing more than an outbreak of democracy , and that would be more likely if voters knew there was a candidate who represented their interests .
If we are to follow opinion polls , Dennis Kucinich is the most mainstream of candidates .
Corporate media , in the rare times his name is mentioned , often lie that he is " out of the mainstream " in an attempt to turn potential voters against him .
They condemn his candidacy by censoring his words and pictures and then in a self - fulfilling prophecy say he has no chance .
In the recent ABC News Democratic candidate 's debate Kucinich was given almost no chance to speak by moderator George Stephanopoulos , followed by ABC 's publishing a picture of the event with the other eight candidates shown and Kucinch cropped out .
They then ran a poll question on their web site " Who won the debate " and when the public responded by saying Kucinich won , they shut down the poll to hide the results .
Kucinich is feared by those in power more than any other candidate because he represents the interests of average citizens , interests largely ignored by corporate media and corporate government .
_________
More media coverage has been given to the non-campaign of Fred Thompson , who only announced last night , and is given a massive blitzkrieg of coverage by corporate media this morning because he represents corporate greed at any cost to the public interest .
Nothing could illustrate this more than a visit to Thompson 's web site , which hides almost everything he stands for from the public .
The long - running drama between the RIAA and Debbie Foster is about to come to an end , but not without an additional bit of fighting about the attorneys ' fees .
After Debbie Foster triumphed in the copyright infringement case brought against her by the record labels , she sought and obtained an award for attorneys ' fees .
After the RIAA exhausted its appeals — and after some further prodding from Foster — it finally cut Foster a check for $ 68,685.23 on August 30 .
Case closed , right ?
Wrong .
Foster subsequently filed a motion to amend the attorneys ' fees award citing two major factors : the amount of the payment and the way in which it was paid .
Although the RIAA paid in full up to the time that the amount of the award was finalized , it neglected to include fees incurred by Foster 's attorney pertaining to a hearing on July 5 .
It also neglected to include the interest that had accrued since the date of the award .
Foster 's attorney Marilyn Barringer - Thomson was also displeased that the plaintiffs overnighted her a single check payable to Debbie Foster instead of electronically transferring the funds to the accounts of those in line for payments .
As a result , the plaintiff would not have immediate access to the funds due to the bank 's policy of placing a hold on checks .
Copyright attorney Ray Beckerman commented that it is " highly unusual for a judgment debtor 's attorneys not to follow the judgment creditor 's attorney 's payment instructions . "
The RIAA countered by filing a motion to deem the judgment satisfied .
Their argument was simple : we cut the check in the proper amount , and it's now in Foster 's possession , so let 's call it a day .
An RIAA spokesperson told Ars that Foster 's filing " misstates the facts and misconstrues the judgment in this case , " saying that they made payment in " strict compliance " with the order .
" As a professional courtesy , we were willing to pay the fees to counsel 's trust account via wire transfer .
When we asked defendant 's counsel to confirm that doing so would be in satisfaction of the judgment — which it clearly is — she refused and insisted we pay her money above the amount set forth in the judgment , " the RIAA spokeswoman told Ars .
" Because counsel met our professional courtesy with a lack of cooperation and an unreasonable insistence that we pay her sums beyond what were ordered , we chose to avoid any dispute and made payment in strict compliance with the Court 's judgment . "
In an order issued earlier today , Judge Lee R.
West pointed out that it's not the fault of the plaintiffs that the bank places a hold on checks and said that there is no authority barring the payment of attorneys ' fees by check .
Judge West denied Foster 's motion to amend the judgment but instructed the RIAA to calculate post - judgment interest and cut Foster another check on or before September 13 .
Once that has occurred , he 'll rule on the RIAA 's motion to deem the attorneys ' fees judgment satisfied .
Given how the whole case played out , there 's little surprise that it is ending with this level of acrimony .
At the end of the day , Foster has been cleared of copyright infringement , while the RIAA is left paying the legal bills for both parties .
THE NEW HEADQUARTERS FOR Barry Diller 's InterActiveCorp stick up from the low - rise terrain of Manhattan 's West Chelsea neighborhood like Space Mountain at Disneyland .
The 10 - story asymmetrical protuberance has outer walls that veer every which way , a typical design for architect Frank Gehry .
But the building 's showstopper is a facade that looks like sails billowed by the wind .
Gehry , famous for his complex compositions in titanium and stainless steel , had never before designed a major building in glass , and he was shocked to learn how difficult it would be to soften and mold the material around the contours of the building .
Each of the 2,541 pieces of glass would have to be heated to 1,148 degrees Fahrenheit , then cooled and shaped .
It was physically possible , but the sheer size of the project made it seem inconceivable .
" We did n't think we could do it , " Gehry says .
" We were going to abandon it . "

Take a look at a major city skyline .
Buildings have become more complicated , like engineering riddles that seem to defy both physics and common sense .
For leading architects , every commission is an invention , an intricate one - of - a- kind experiment .
Gehry , of course , is the leader of the starchitects , conjuring from his computers shapes so modern and complex they 're practically baroque .
But Gehry and his fellow designers do n't actually build what they dream up – that 's not their job .
They rely on a new breed of contractor , the kind that can translate an architect 's lofty vision into a physical structure .
For the InterActive HQ , Gehry turned to a longtime collaborator , the Connecticut - based branch of Permasteelisa , the Italian curtain - wall couturier .
The firm has spent nearly a decade figuring out how to fabricate the sort of brainteaser building " envelopes " that have made Gehry a household name .
Permasteelisa has quietly erected the facades of some of the most significant buildings in the US , from Thom Mayne 's Federal Building in San Francisco to Yoshio Taniguchi's MoMA in Manhattan .
Permasteelisa also engineered towers for Skidmore , Owings & Merrill , Norman Foster , and the new partnership of Cook + Fox .
" They 've become the go - to people when you have a difficult job , " says architect Richard Cook , for whom the company is fabricating the shell of One Bryant Park , a conspicuously asymmetrical 55 - story tower in Manhattan .
" We can be thinking whatever we want , but if you can't build it , what 's the point ? "
Much has been written about how Gehry conjures complex shapes from his computer , or how Mayne relies on data processors to create exteriors that ripple and shimmer in response to fresh air and daylight .
But little has been said about how these digital models become buildings or about the surprising ingenuity of the teams of engineers and craftsmen more technically adept than the architects whose designs they execute .
Companies like Permasteelisa must figure out how to mass - produce custom high - end architectural components – the only way to turn fantastical renderings into structures that developers can afford to finance .
And because no part of a project is more crucial to an architect 's reputation than the curtain wall – the glass , metal , or masonry skin that is the public face of a building – the specialized contractors who fabricate and hang the material can make or break an architect 's career .
Where other contractors are quick to push back on the feasibility of an architect 's design , the engineers at Permasteelisa rarely say it can't be done .
For the InterActiveCorp building , Alberto De Gobbi , a 44 - year - old civil engineer and the president of Permasteelisa 's US operation , started with a simple principle : Glass bends – a lot – before it breaks .
" We said , ' Why do n't we take the natural , physical capability of the glass and see how much we can push it ? ' "
He demonstrates by holding up a sheet of paper with his left hand and gently pushing one of its corners with his right .
In the end , Permasteelisa gave each 14 - foot panel of glass a 4 - inch curve .
That may not sound significant , but it was enough to achieve the startling effect Gehry had in mind .
" This is the first time in the world that this has been done to such an extreme , " De Gobbi says .
Permasteelisa learned an early lesson about dealing with complexity from Gehry himself .
In 1992 , the not - yet - famous architect designed a 260 - ton steel - mesh fish for the Barcelona Olympics .
Gehry recalls Permasteelisa 's founder , Massimo Colomban , saying , " I can't do it .
I can't get it .
I can't build it . "
The architect advised him to invest in a 3 - D modeling technology developed for aircraft design .
Columban bought the $ 100,000 software and the outsize workstation needed to run it .
" Two weeks later , " Gehry says , " Massimo called me and said , ' Perfetto ! ' "
With the software , the company 's engineers could finally draw up Gehry 's ideas , something they could n't do with traditional 2 - D CAD drawings .
Later , they carried out the architect 's designs by hiring about a dozen mountain climbers to weave 90,000 feet of gold - hued metal onto the 135 - foot - high fish - shaped frame .
Since then , Permasteelisa has collaborated with Gehry on a dozen projects .
Currently , the firm is working with him on both the InterActiveCorp headquarters and a 75 - story hospital - school - condo tower , known as the Beekman , planned for lower Manhattan .
A few years ago , the firm hung the gleaming stainless steel skin that covers the Gehry - designed Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles .
Before that , it helped Gehry build the cafeteria at the New York headquarters of Wired 's parent company , Condé Nast .
Permasteelisa succeeds by breaking hugely complicated projects into more parts , not fewer .
Then , even a topological nightmare like the Disney Concert Hall becomes manageable .
" We broke it down into elements , " De Gobbi says .
" We 're talking about 700,000 parts .
The stainless steel sheets were pretty easy to fabricate once you had the design of each individual piece . "
A stroll through the firm 's 300,000 - square - foot factory in Windsor , Connecticut – strategically located midway between New York and Boston – is an education in the prefab nature of skyscraper construction .
It 's a full - on assembly line for making one - off buildings .
Thousands of " units " – the sophisticated assemblages of glass , coatings , and sealants surrounded by a crust of precisely extruded and trimmed metal – are shipped to building sites , where they 're pieced together into huge exteriors .
But something more interesting is out back .
Test sections of recognizable facades line the property :
There 's the Hearst Tower , 7 World Trade Center , and a chunk of the new Louis Vuitton store .
( " We dress the building ; we do haute couture , " De Gobbi says . )
It 's like visiting the New York set on a Hollywood back lot – except instead of creating illusion , Permasteelisa builds reality .
American Entropy By Bush 's definition , the " surge " has failed In George Bush 's prime time address to the nation Thursday night he laid out the basic premise of of his escalation strategy in Iraq .
The premise of our strategy is that securing the Iraqi population is the foundation for all other progress .
For Iraqis to bridge sectarian divides , they need to feel safe in their homes and neighborhoods .
For lasting reconciliation to take root , Iraqis must feel confident that they do not need sectarian gangs for security .
The goal of the surge is to provide that security and to help prepare Iraqi forces to maintain it .
So that 's it , the Iraqis need to feel safe .
And he 's right .
But he misses the point that the escalation has not made people feel safer .
A recent poll points this out , Marc Lynch summarizes the findings :
... The BBC / ABC / NHK survey , conducted in all 19 provinces during August , finds that 70 % of Iraqis believe that security has deteriorated in the areas covered by the US " surge " , and 11 % say it has had no effect .
Only 11 % say that security in the country as a whole has improved in the last six months .
...
95 % of Sunnis say that the presence of US troops makes security worse .
...
56 % described the " security situation " in the neighborhood in which they live as bad , up slightly from 53 % in February , while only 24 % say that the security situation in this neighborhood has improved in the past six months .
79 % of Sunnis say that security in their neighborhood is bad - despite all those American walking tours of happy , safe markets .
Only 7 % of Sunnis say that security in their neighborhood has improved in the last 6 months , and only 6 % feel safe in their neighborhood .
...
Do n't get too excited that 43 % say that the neighborhood in which they currently live is relatively safe , because it 's probably because this is where they fled to escape from ethnic cleansing : 74 % describe their " freedom of movement - the ability to go where you wish safely " as bad , and 77 % say that " freedom to live where you wish without persecution " is bad .
An astonishing 98 % say that the separation of people along sectarian lines is a bad thing .
...
65 % say that the current national government is doing a bad job ...
The Iraqis do n't feel safe in the neighborhoods .
The Iraqis have n't answered , in this poll , whether or not they want / need sectarian gangs for security .
But , our plan in Anbar is facilitating just that .
Meanwhile the Iraqi security forces are rife with Shiite sectarianism .
All - in - all , by Bush 's " premise " the ' surge ' has failed .
Furthermore , hope that this will change much in the next 6 to 12 months when the surge is forced to end do to the stress it has put on our military is just hope .
And a slim hope at that .
By this time next year we 'll be back at the troop level we started at , with no end in sight .

Denis O'Brien bought Belmont , on the Shrewsbury Road , Ballsbridge , for € 35 m last year .
Despite its luxury swimming pool , sauna and seven bedrooms , he is determined to have it demolished to make way for a new home .
Permission has so far been refused
BILLIONAIRE businessman Denis O'Brien has gone to An Bord Pleanala in his bid to demolish the exclusive Ballsbridge home he bought last year for € 35 m , the second highest price ever for a house in Dublin .
After being refused permission by Dublin City Council , Mr O'Brien has now applied to An Bord Pleanala for permission to level the Tudor - style property , Belmont , built in 1904 .
It boasts an indoor swimming pool , seven bedrooms , sauna and steam room and a putting green on two - thirds of an acre .
Mr O'Brien wants to replace it with a new detached house , keeping the existing line of the building but extending the living space into the basement as well as into an annex .
Dublin City Council refused permission on the grounds that the scale , form and design of the existing house " contributes to the character and identify of the streetcape on Shrewsbury Road " .
The council also said the proposal would conflict with the Dublin City Development Plan 2005 - 2011 to protect and improve the amenities of residential conservation areas .
Refusing Mr O'Brien permission , the council said the development would " set an undesirable precedent for similar development which would cumulatively undermine the character of a conservation area " .
He has now appealed this decision to An Bord Pleanala .
A submission on his behalf to the board says the proposed new house is of a high qualiy of architectural design and materials , and reuses many elements and materials conserved from the existing house .
Negative
Mr O'Brien says that the new house will have no negative impact on the character , architectural quality or residential amenity and is also fully compatible with the city development plan .
His ' A - list ' neighbours include developer Sean Dunne .
Mr O'Brien already has a several valuable properties in the capital .
In 2000 he paid an estimated €9 m for a large detached house , also located in Dublin 4 .
I am a fan of using GUIDs as primary keys .
They are databaseindependent , object independent and I can either create them in myapplication or in the database ( MySQL since 5.0 has had a UUID ( ) function but since it does not replicate I do n't use it normally ... this has been fixed in 5.1 though ) .
What I have heard for years was that Innodb did n't handle them verywell .
I have had my doubts , but never taken the time to see if thiswas true or not .
This week I finally got around to putting this to a test./mysqlslap --concurrency=1,50,100,150,200,250,300 --iterations=10 --number-int-cols=2 --number-char-cols=3 --auto-generate-sql --auto-generate-sql-add-autoincrement --auto-generate-sql-load-type=update --auto-generate-sql-execute-number=10000 --auto-generate-sql-unique-write-number=10 --auto-generate-sql-write-number=100000 --csv=/tmp/innodb-auto.csv --engine=blackhole,innodbSo 10 K of rows , with increasing numbers of threads makingmodifications .
Unlike a lot of tests I do this is a growth test ... aka as a site would grow this is what you would see .
Normally when Ilook at how SMP machines handle problems I am more interested inseeing how it would split the problem with more threads and more CPU .
In this case I wanted to look at just how the database would behaveas a site grew .
The test I am looking at is primary key focused , and its all updates .
So a read is occurring and a write follows up .
As you can tell from the graph , the overhead , as seen via blackhole , is nearly identical in cases where UUID ( ) was used and Autoincrementwas used .
The only issue I ran into was that Innodb started gettingdeadlocks when I cranked up the connections to 300 on my quad PPCrunning Ubuntu .
I am going to play with this a bit further and see if Innodb would have similar issues on a dual processor .
The binlog wasnot enabled during any of these tests so the row locks that we seefor updates when running with statement based replication wo n't beseen ( but I really want to see how that effects things ! ) .
Just to confirm results I am going run the same test but just do keylookups and see if any difference pops up .
I am doubting it will butyou never know until you try :)
In November 2003 , Stephen King received a lifetime achievement medal from the National Book Foundation for his “ distinguished contribution to American letters . ”
The foundation ’s notion of “ distinguished contribution ” is a fairly broad one :
The medal has been awarded to Oprah Winfrey as well as to Eudora Welty .
Still , America ’s most famous horror writer made the most of it .
His acceptance speech commended the judges for having the courage to honor “ a man many people see as a rich hack ” — and then attacked the whole world of literary prize - giving for its snobbery , its willful ignorance of popular and genre fiction , and its tendency to grant itself “ social or academic brownie points for deliberately staying out of touch ” with American culture .
It was a characteristic performance for King , who has always been at once hungry for literary prestige and scornful of it , self - deprecating about his writing and combative when criticized .
He gives the impression of being acutely conscious of his peculiar position in American letters , where he occupies a gray zone between the pulpy authors who can match his sales figures — the Dan Browns and Danielle Steeles — and the literary writers whose company he obviously craves , the writers who stand a chance of winning , not a lifetime achievement medal , but the National Book Award itself .
The ambiguity has dogged King for decades , and it ’s unlikely to be resolved soon , not least because his best work as a writer is well behind him .
There will doubtless be many more books to come :
He ’s only fifty - nine ; he seems fully recovered from the 2001 hit - and - run accident that nearly killed him ; and , although he has murmured unconvincingly about giving up writing , the novels and short stories keep on coming .
( Last fall ’s Lisey ’s Story was the second book King published in 2006 alone . )
But in spite of his astonishing output and none - too - subtle campaign for literary respectability — the National Book Foundation speech , the blurbs on his books from upper - middlebrow novelists such as Michael Chabon , the publication of his ruminative quasi-memoir On Writing — most of the novels he ’s written since the early 1990s feel like reruns of his greatest hits , afterthoughts to the titles that still haunt our pop culture ’s consciousness like the unquiet ghosts in the Overlook Hotel .
Carrie , The Shining , Salem ’s Lot , and The Stand in the 1970s , together with Pet Sematary and It the following decade — these books are the best of Stephen King , the heart of his dark territory , and their persistence in the popular imagination ought , at the very least , to give the lie to Harold Bloom ’s dyspeptic claim that King is a writer of “ penny dreadfuls ” whose books do “ little more for humanity than keep the publishing industry afloat . ”
A thousand potboilers have been bought , devoured , discarded , and pulped in the thirty years since Carrie was published , and only King , out of all his million - selling peers , has managed to maneuver his way out of the mass - market ghetto and into a kind of quasi- respectability .
You wo n’t find many critics eager to champion him , exactly , but there ’s a sense that he needs to be at least grappled with , a courtesy that ’s extended to few other members of the rich - hack club .
In part , King has pulled off this unlikely feat by his steady work as a genre writer , where the relative dimness of the competition makes his talents shine brighter than they otherwise would .
Indeed , there ’s a sense in which he invented the modern horror novel , doing for the form what Agatha Christie did for the murder mystery : taking a genre that was defined by the short story and pulling it off at novel length — not once or twice , a Dracula here and a Frankenstein there , but over and over again .
He may not at first have realized what he was doing .
Just as Christie spent her early years as an author alternating between murder mysteries and mediocre international thrillers , so King has recalled telling an editor , early in the 1970s , that his “ horror novelist ” reputation was only temporary : “ ‘ Bill , ’ I said , amused , ‘ no one can make a living writing just horror stories in America . [ H.P. ]
Lovecraft starved in Providence .
[ Robert ]
Bloch gave it up for suspense novels and Unknown - type spoofs .
The Exorcist was a one - shot .
You ’ll see . ’ ”
Last spring , thirty - two years after making this prediction , King published Cell , a novel about a mysterious pulse that turns cell - phone users into murderous zombies .
( “ Stephen King lives in Maine , ” the author ’s page noted .
“ He does not own a cell phone . ” )
It reached number one on the New York Times bestseller list .
This achievement alone would probably earn King a certain kind of literary immortality , the sort reserved for such genre pioneers as Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne , authors whose historical significance may outstrip their creative gifts .
But King has the rare distinction of being both a pioneer and a perfecter ; he has both created the modern horror novel and imbued it with an unexpected literary respectability .
In this regard , he is to horror what both Louis L’Amour and Larry McMurtry are to westerns , or C. S. Forester and Patrick O’Brian are to Napoleonic - era sea novels , or James M. Cain and Raymond Chandler are to hard - boiled detective fiction — the breakthrough author who defines a form for huge popular audiences and simultaneously the elite author who pushes it up toward literature .
That ’s not because he has the artistic gifts of McMurtry or O’Brian or Chandler , necessarily , but because , like them , he ’s made popular genre books seem more than just the fulfillment of their genre .
This helps explain why his readership is so vast — rivaling those of Agatha Christie and Erle Stanley Gardner at their peak — and why his cultural footprint is much more significant than you would expect even from the emperor of horror .
The ghosts and vampires ( and the sex and violence ) may lure book buyers in , but what keeps them coming back is something else entirely : namely , King ’s ability to imbue his tales of the uncanny with a realism , a cultural relevance , and a theological heft that ’s missing in even the highest of contemporary American fiction .
When Tom Wolfe in his 1989 Harper 's essay “ Stalking the Billion - Footed Beast ” urged a revival of literary realism and called for novelists to abandon their introspection and produce for America “ a literature worthy of her vastness , ” he primarily had himself in mind .
His manifesto reads , in retrospect , like a long advertisement for his then recently published novel Bonfire of the Vanities .
But King ’s vision of contemporary America is billion - footed enough to make Wolfe ’s look provincial by comparison .
In forty - odd novels and an endless stream of short stories , Stephen King — the bard of Bangor , Maine — has given form and substance to almost every dark facet of contemporary American life : AIDS and abortion , rape and rock ‘ n ’ roll , child abuse and the shadow of Vietnam , baseball and cocaine .
There are happy marriages , divorces , and wife beatings ; alien abductions and alcoholism ; the death penalty and political assassinations ; serial killers and cell phones ; tabloid journalism and all the endless miseries of childhood .
“ You do n’t achieve Stephen King ’s sort of Vulcan mind - meld with America unless you are in intimate touch with the communal fantasies of the whole culture , ” John Leonard once wrote — and sure enough , when the authorities in Paducah , Kentucky , searched the locker of the student who gunned down three of his high - school classmates in 1997 , they found a copy of King ’s 1977 school - shooting novel , Rage , written under his Richard Bachman pen name .
It ’s American pop culture , above all , that comes to life in a Stephen King story — in a stream of references and quotations and nods and shout - outs , a perfect reproduction of our media - drenched way of talking and thinking , and all of it untouched by the sense of chilly irony with which so many contemporary novelists approach our television / Internet age .
A critic once dismissed King ’s novels for their willingness to traffic in “ pre-existing images from cartoons , old movies , television shows and commercials . ”
In King ’s landscape , he complained , “ sinister men wear ‘ white Andromeda Strain suits . ’ . . .
A ruffled adulterer , when caught , looks ‘ like Alfalfa in the old Little Rascals . ’
Men wish for guns ‘ like the one Dirty Harry wore . ’
Slacks are ‘ the color of Bazooka bubble gum . ’ ”
That ’s true enough , but such preexisting images provide the vernacular of most Americans ’ inner lives .
There is nothing aesthetically glorious about King ’s prose — he is no student of Nabokov , to put it mildly — but there is something defiantly plausible and distinctively American about how his characters tend to regard the world .
And then , of course , there are all those pesky ghosts and vampires .
What kind of realistic novel includes a demonic clown , or a haunted car , or a literary pseudonym that comes to life and stalks his creator ?
Except that they are our ghosts , our vampires , our haunted houses , and our monsters :
They ’re at once horrifying and entirely recognizable , intruders from an alien dimension and just another part of the great America pantomime .
The UFO that Bobbi Anderson digs up in her backyard in The Tommyknockers is n’t just a spaceship — it ’s nuclear power and environmental contamination , the military - industrial complex and the just - as - oppressive drug culture that tried to overthrow it , with the strains of “ Wo n’t Get Fooled Again ” playing in the background .
In Needful Things , the devil seduces the residents of a small Maine town with bits and pieces of Americana : a rarer - than - rare Sandy Koufax baseball card , a pricey fishing rod , a photograph of Elvis .
In The Stand , Satan ’s avatar , Randall Flagg , remembers spending time as a member of the KKK and the Weather Underground ; he once attended high school “ with a red - haired , bandy - legged boy named Charles Starkweather ” ; played a part in the wave of civil rights - era violence ( “ the beatings , the night rides , the churches that had exploded as if some miracle inside them had grown too large to be contained ” ) ; and recalls “ drifting down to New Orleans in 1962 , and meeting a demented young man who was handing out tracts urging America to leave Cuba alone . ”
Flagg is history ’s string - puller and a walking compendium of dark Americana :
His pockets were stuffed with fifty different kinds of conflicting literature - pamphlets for all seasons , rhetoric for all reasons .
When this man handed you a pamphlet you took it no matter what the subject : the dangers of atomic power plants , the role played by the International Jewish Cartel in the overthrow of friendly governments , the CIA - Contra - cocaine connection , the farm workers ’ unions , the Jehovah ’s Witnesses ( If You Can Answer These Ten Questions “ Yes , ” You Have Been SAVED ! ) , the Blacks for Militant Equality , the Kode of the Klan .
He had them all , and more , too .
There was a button on each breast of his denim jacket .
On the right , a yellow smile - face .
On the left , a pig wearing a policeman ’s cap .
“ Walt Disney ’s evil twin , ” John Leonard called King , and sure enough the psychic powers that Johnny Smith acquires in The Dead Zone carry him to a moment “ as American as The Wonderful World of Disney . . . the politician and the man in the high place with a gun . ”
Except that , in the wonderful world of King , the assassin is the good guy .
This kind of supernatural realism is a hard trick to pull off .
Most writers who deal in the supernatural tend either to abandon the everyday in favor of landscapes ( Poe ’s House of Usher , Anne Rice ’s New Orleans , Lovecraft ’s New England ) that exist at a sharp angle to the real world , or else domesticate the supernatural so that it fits snugly in the confines of normal reality .
( Magical realism , in particular , introduces magical happenings by pretending that they are n’t magical at all ; no character in Toni Morrison or Gabriel Garcia Marquez ever seems truly surprised by a supernatural event . )
But King has it both ways .
His great achievement — which covers a multitude of literary weaknesses — has been to join the supernatural to the natural in a marriage of equals that leaves the verisimilitude of both intact .
King has occasionally compared himself to Theodore Dreiser and Frank Norris , two turn - of - the - century social realists who specialized in urban miseries and workmanlike prose , and he loves to quote Norris ’ riposte to critics :
“ What should I care if they single me out for sneers and laughter ?
I never truckled , I never lied .
I told the truth . ”
But King has effectively expanded the definition of realism to include a set of human experiences that have been systematically excluded from the novel ’s purview for two centuries or more .
At their best , his works are n’t just a wide - open window into the bedlam of recent American life .
They ’re the first significant attempts at literature for a post - secular age .
Midway through Salem ’s Lot , King ’s second published novel , a schoolteacher named Matt Burke informs the local Catholic priest that their hometown is being taken over by vampires .
The time is the early 1970s , and the priest , Fr. Callahan , explains the Church ’s post - Freud , post - Vatican II posture on such things :
“ The Catholic Church has been forced to reinterpret its whole approach to evil - bombers over Cambodia , cop-killings and ghetto riots , the billion smaller evils loosed on the world each day like a plague of gnats .
It is in the process of shedding its old medicine - man skin and re-emerging a socially active , socially conscious body .
The inner-city rap center ascendant over the confessional .
Communion playing second fiddle to the civil rights movement and urban renewal .
The church has been in the process of planting both feet in the world . ” . . .
Matt said deliberately , “ And you hate it , do n’t you ? ”
“ Yes , ” Callahan said quietly .
“ I think it ’s an abomination .
It ’s the Catholic Church ’s way of saying God is n’t dead , only a little senile . ”
As with Fr. Callahan and the Church , so with King and the novel .
His career is an act of rebellion against literature ’s nineteenth - century decision to abandon the numinous and “ plant both feet in the world . ”
There are exceptions , scattered here and there across the canon , that are attuned to the mysterious aspects of human affairs .
Henry James ’
The Turn of the Screw , for instance , demonstrates that it ’s perfectly possible to write a great novella about invisible worlds without taking a position on whether they ’re objectively real .
The last chapter of Anna Karenina contains a depiction of religious epiphany , Hermann Hesse successfully documented sojourns in Jungian mysticism and the occult , and there ’s always D. H. Lawrence ’s windy sex worship and pantheistic ecstasy .
But such attempts are rare enough to make one almost grateful for even the contemptuous attention of an atheist like Flaubert , who depicted religious experience with rancid mockery : “ When she sighed her last breath she thought she saw an opening in the heavens , and a gigantic parrot hovering above her head . ”
Even novelists known for their religious beliefs have tended to depict the supernatural ’s immanence through its absence , preferring psychological pain to demonic affliction , and dark nights of the soul to the voice from the whirlwind .
You can find God in Evelyn Waugh or Graham Greene but more often as a significant absence than as a presence ; so too with modern novelists such as John Updike , whose Almighty resembles nothing so much as the senile divinity that King ’s Fr. Callahan so loathes .
Actual encounters with the divine or the demonic are left to occasional taboo - busters like the British writer Hilary Mantel , herself subject to paranormal visitations .
( “ I am used to ‘ seeing ’ things that are n’t there , ” she writes in her memoir , Giving Up the Ghost .
“ Or — to put it in a way more acceptable to me — I am used to seeing things that ‘ are n’t there . ’ ” )
And then there is Stephen King .
Whether he has ever seen a devil , as Mantel did as a girl —
“ It has no edges , no mass , no dimension , no shape except the formless ; it moves ” — is ultimately unimportant ; his novels are the work of a man who believes in devils , or at least in their possibility , and the possibility that one of his ordinary Americans could encounter one by chance .
Or perhaps not by chance : King ’s stories , like human life , are replete with examples of the randomness of evil , but the worse the monster , the more likely that we have invited it in to feed .
In The Shining , the ghosts in the Overlook Hotel embody the hotel ’s overflow of sins — suicides , New Year ’s Eve debaucheries , mafia killings — and they turn Jack Torrance into their willing tool by playing on his private failings , his alcoholism , and his rage .
In The Stand , King ’s magnum opus — or at least his best book , since he would probably give the magnum - opus nod to his bloated , interminable seven - volume Dark Tower saga — the survivors of a global superflu face off in an apocalyptic battle royale , but the superflu itself is an entirely human creation , a dark thing conjured up by the just - doing - our - job good men in the U.S. military and released into the world by simple human error .
Near the end of Salem ’s Lot , a local sheriff remarks of his suddenly vampire - haunted town :
“ It ai n’t alive . . . .
That ’s why he came here .
It ’s dead , like him .
Has been for twenty years or more .
Whole country ’s goin ’ the same way .
Me and Nolly went to a drive - in show up in Falmouth a couple of weeks ago , just before they closed her down for the season .
I seen more blood and killin’s in that first Western than I seen both years in Korea .
Kids was eatin ’ popcorn and cheerin ’ ‘ em on . ”
He gestured vaguely at the town , now lying unnaturally gilded in the broken rays of the westering sun , like a dream village .
“ They prob ’ly like bein ’ vampires . ”
This passage is steeped in the rot - from - within despair of the 1970s , and it is not a coincidence that King did his best work in the decade of Jonestown and The Exorcist , the Ayatollah Khomeini and The Late Great Planet Earth , the decade that stripped away the confident science - and - progress ethos of the 1950s and early 1960s .
( The Stand was originally conceived as a novel about the Symbionese Liberation Army , and Cujo , the titular rabid Saint Bernard from one of King ’s bleaker novels , is named after one of Patty Hearst ’s kidnappers . )
The 1970s made King ’s supernatural realism possible , in a sense , by teaching Americans that reason and progress and enlightenment might be little more than convenient fictions , and that there are darker things in heaven and earth than had been dreamt of by George Eliot or John Cheever .
This realization gave birth to the paranoid style in American literature — Thomas Pynchon , Don DeLillo , and all their endless imitators .
But even the most complicated conspiracy theories did n’t get at the change in the American consciousness quite the way King did when he kicked off his career by having a girl named Carrie destroy her high school with telekinesis and followed it up with vampires devouring a small Maine town .
The Pynchonesque paranoid style is clinical and detached , whereas King ’s is defiantly fleshly :
His stock in trade is menstrual blood and diarrhea , vomit and dismemberment .
“ If I cannot terrify , ” he once declared , “ I will try to horrify ; and if I cannot horrify I will go for the gross - out .
I ’m not proud . ”
The paranoid style ’s evils are distant , invisible , corporate ; King ’s are terribly corporeal and groaning with the desperate hunger of hell .
The paranoid style is steeped in agnosticism or a wary deism , whereas King ’s novels do n’t deal just in devils but in a personal , active Almighty as well .
God does n’t make an appearance in most of King ’s stories , which is understandable enough :
The horror genre requires the supernatural , but it does n’t require the divine .
Indeed , a too - powerful divinity sucks all the suspense out of a supernatural thriller , since the outcome of a God - and - the - devil showdown is never really in doubt .
Sometimes the demons King summons up are opposed by a generic white magic of one kind or another , which balances the evil but is n’t necessarily strong enough to overcome it .
Occasionally he tilts toward the supernatural nihilism that Lovecraft cultivated , in which the universe is a thin membrane spread over a screaming abyss .
But God does elbow his way into King ’s America — it would n’t be a recognizable America if he did n’t — and when he appears it is n’t as a distant , half - glimpsed presence , a philosopher ’s God or the wan deity of wistful almost - believers .
He is instead “ the Lord God of Hosts , ” as Mother Abagail , his prophet in The Stand , might put it , intervening directly in the lives of his people and demanding that they conform those lives to his will — whether it ’s the chosen few who survive The Stand ’s superflu and end up shepherded west to Boulder , Colorado , to form a new Israel set against the Babylon of Las Vegas ; or the motley heroes of Desperation , King ’s finest 1990s novel , who coalesce around a “ God- bombed ” eleven - year - old to battle a demon called Tak , accidentally let loose in the Nevada desert .
These divine manifestations have led some over - eager believers to claim King as a Christian novelist — or at least a writer with “ an authentic Christian sensibility , ” in the words of Paul F. M. Zahl , writing for Christianity Today .
A Christian of some sort King may be , but the religious landscape of his fiction is something else .
His America has passed beyond secularism , but it has n’t come back to Jesus .
Instead , it finds itself in what King seems to imagine is the world of the Old Testament , in which God is a hard and inscrutable taskmaster rather than a God of love , more to be feared and obeyed than worshiped and adored .
Indeed , insofar as King has a theology , it involves an Almighty who wills not only sacrifice but also suffering and death to serve a larger purpose that ’s beyond any mortal ken .
Such a
God is awesome and cruel all at once , with no interest in answering to his creatures — even if many of King ’s characters react with appropriately Joban outrage to his demands .
“ He ca n’t take them all and leave me ! ” wails David Carver , the preteen prophet from Desperation , when it becomes clear that his whole family will die at the demon ’s hands while he is required to live .
“ Killer God , ” a woman screams in The Stand , when Mother Abagail delivers God ’s demand that her husband go out into the desert unarmed to confront their adversary .
“ Killer God ! . . .
Millions — maybe billions — dead in the plague .
Millions more afterward . . .
Is n’t he done yet ?
Does it just have to go on and on until the earth belongs to the roaches ?
He ’s no God .
He ’s a daemon , and you ’re His witch . ”
There ’s never an answer in King ’s fiction to these outbursts .
Nobody steps forward to offer any C. S. Lewis - style theodicy or hopeful promises of the resurrection and life everlasting .
“ God will dispose as He sees fit , ” Mother Abagail says .
“ You are not the potter but the potter ’s clay . ”
To David Carver ’s agony , one of his companions — a Norman Maileresque aging literary legend who will shortly give his own life in service to God ’s will — can only reply : “ You said ‘ God is cruel ’ the way a person who ’s lived his whole life in Tahiti might say ‘ Snow is cold . ’
You knew , but you did n’t understand .
. . .
Do you know how cruel your God can be , David ?
How fantastically cruel ? . . .
Sometimes he makes us live . ”
A similar spirit is at work in The Green Mile , King ’s serial novel set on a Tennessee death row , which seems superficially like a Christian allegory .
A huge black prison inmate , falsely accused of murder , has the suggestive name of John Coffey and the power to cure the sick and raise the dead , but he ends up executed anyway , despite his jailers ’ awareness that they are killing an innocent man .
It is a Christian story — without the resurrection .
God sacrifices the Christlike Coffey for purposes that remain inscrutable , and the prison guard who narrates the story is left stuck somewhere between hope and despair :
I think back to the sermons of my childhood , booming affirmations in the church of Praise Jesus , The Lord Is Mighty , and I recall how the preachers used to say that God ’s eye is on the sparrow , that He sees and marks even the least of His creations .
Yet this same God sacrificed John Coffey , who tried only to do good in his blind way , as savagely as any Old Testament prophet ever sacrificed a defenseless lamb , as Abraham would have sacrificed his own son if actually called upon to do so . . . .
If it happens , God lets it happen , and when we say “ I do n’t understand , ” God replies , “ I do n’t care . ”
Nor is King ’s God disposed to handle every supernatural flare - up .
He coexists with a multitude of lesser powers , and he allows most of them more or less free rein .
Not only ghosts and demons are loose in King ’s post - secular landscape but also a Who ’s Who of stranger spiritual influences , some benign and some malignant , some distinctively American and some very much Old World .
In Rose Madder , there ’s Circe and the Minotaur ; in Insomnia , the three Fates , spinning , measuring , and cleaving away ; in Pet Sematary , the Native American Wendigo .
And then there is the host of quasi-mythic beings that King himself invents , from the dizzying cast of his Dark Tower saga to the unearthly Long Boy , which haunts the visions of a writer and his wife in last year ’s Lisey ’s Story , fixing them with “ the hideous pressure of its insane regard . ”
Writing in Books and Culture several years ago , Susan Wise Bauer complained that the willingness of King ’s God to tolerate these lesser rivals — and his insistence that his human surrogates take them on — made him “ an undemanding fellow ” who outsources the hard work to human beings “ and then desperately hopes they can pull it off . ”
King ’s Almighty , she suggested , “ is much like Rabbi Kushner ’s God—creative , good , well - meaning , but limited . ”
But , if anything , the opposite is true .
King ’s
God is n’t a well - meaning weakling , holding our hands and hoping things turn out OK ; rather , he ’s so far above the various adversaries , from Tak to Randall Flagg , that the possibility of their winning passing victories concerns him not at all .
The demons are a means to chastise and test a struggling humanity , not a threat to God himself ; they are the potter ’s wheel on which King ’s characters can be broken without placing God ’s providence in doubt .
This is questionable theology , but it is genius as a literary move and a perfect solution to the problem that God ’s omnipotence poses for dramatic tension in a supernatural novel .
Instead of preserving suspense through nihilism ( in which God is either nonexistent or malign ) or through Manichaenism ( in which dark and light are equally matched and equally likely to prevail ) , the novelist gives us a God too powerful and too aloof to bother with anything so interventionist as the Incarnation .
King may describe his theology as Christian — “ this long tale of dark Christianity , ” he called The Stand — but his God is one whose power is unmatched but whose wrath exceeds his love , a God with a taste for blood sacrifice , and a God who is prepared to let his people perish for purposes beyond our understanding .
The result , across King ’s body of work , is a vision of contemporary America as a spiritual realm that is out of joint and up for grabs , thick with competing forces and watched over by an Almighty whose goals are inscrutable , whose demands are peremptory , and whose methods are sometimes cruel .
It ’s a landscape out of Ecclesiastes , in a sense , defined by its “ essential fragility , its constant , unstoppable movement toward death , ” as King puts it — a landscape where time is a thief and death is a mystery and where the hope of a resurrection is weaker than the fear of the dark .
King ’s characters are asked to reconcile themselves to mortality less out of any Christian hope than because the alternative is something far , far worse — eternity in the Overlook Hotel , say , or joining up with the vampires of Salem ’s Lot , or sharing the fate of Louis Creed in Pet Sematary , King ’s most horrifying work , whose attempt to bring his son back from the grave teaches the terrible lesson that “ sometimes , dead is better . ”
As for what awaits past death , King offers only uncertainty .
Dying characters walk away down long shadowy corridors with God - knows - what at the end ; they are carried off to the netherworld by huge flocks of preternatural sparrows ; they ride a “ steepening spiral of darkness . . . down and down , to whatever dreams there are . ”
Even in the novels where God is an active , demanding presence , encounters with the numinous inspire awe but rarely confidence .
“ We each owe a death , ” the aging narrator of The Green Mile says , “ there are no exceptions , I know that , but sometimes , oh God , the Green Mile is so long . ”
The age of reason is over , but the age of faith has not yet returned .
And so Stephen King ’s America endures in fear and trembling — waiting for a messiah or a second coming .

PAPER RESISTS TAMPERING PAPER RESISTS TAMPERING
Tamper - resistant prescription pads come in many shapes and sizes but share similar characteristics : • Forms can't be counterfeited
• Paper can't be copied
• Writing can't be erased or modified
For the first year of the new rule , states can settle for one type of protection .
Thereafter , all three must be met .

An obscure provision slipped into a $ 120 billion Iraq spending bill in May threatens to leave some poor and disabled Medicaid recipients without prescription drugs in October .
In a case of unintended consequences , Congress inserted a rule cracking down on Medicaid fraud that requires that all non-electronic prescriptions for Medicaid patients be written on tamper - resistant paper .
The rule was devised as a way to raise nearly $ 150 million over five years for public hospitals , the amount that Medicaid fraud costs the federal government .
It has been criticized as too much , too soon by pharmacists , doctors , patient advocacy groups and state Medicaid officials .
They say doctors could leave Medicaid , pharmacists could lose money and patients could be denied drugs .
" Nobody really knew where this came from , " says Jamila Edwards of the California Primary Care Association .
" The patient 's going to be in the middle thinking , ' How come I did n't get my medication ? ' " Today , the state Medicaid directors and more than 100 organizations will send a letter to congressional leaders asking for a one - year delay to the rule , according to Martha Roherty , director of the National Association of State Medicaid Directors .
Under the rule , if a patient has a prescription on the wrong type of paper , pharmacists can fill it while seeking the prescriber 's confirmation by phone , fax , e-mail or tamper - proof paper within three days .
Jeffrey Kelman of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services says that should protect patients from being denied needed drugs .
Also , the rule should help prevent overdoses and other problems caused by fraudulent prescriptions , he says .
Medicaid serves more than 50 million people .
Doctors , pharmacists and patient advocates say the new federal rule can't be implemented by Oct.
1 . They warn that pharmacists could be forced to return Medicaid payments if they fill prescriptions improperly , and patients could be denied medications if the prescriptions are n't written on tamper - resistant pads .
" In our state , very few doctors use these kinds of pads , " says Doug Porter , the Medicaid director in Washington .
" I think some people will be denied service , and that will be a very bad situation . "
Must - pass legislation such as May 's spending bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan usually attracts unrelated amendments .
In this case , Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , won a one - year delay on a federal rule that would limit payments to public hospitals .
Under Democrats ' budget rules , it had to be paid for , and the Medicaid fraud crackdown was chosen .
Twelve states already require the use of tamper - resistant pads in some instances , including for heavy - duty narcotics such as morphine and OxyContin .
New York requires it for all prescriptions .

Circumcision losing favor with U.S. parents
When Nancy McIlvaine told her parents that her newborn son would n't be circumcised , her mother gasped .
McIlvaine , who lives in Napa with her husband , Willem Maas , said she consulted with health professionals about circumcision and never heard a compelling reason to snip her baby 's foreskin .
" It 's just inflicting pain to a newborn when there does n't seem to be any evidence of it being beneficial , " said McIlvaine , who gave birth to Theodore on June 8 .
McIlvaine is part of a growing trend away from male circumcision .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the circumcision rate in the United States dropped to 55.9 percent in 2003 -- an all - time postwar low .
In the early '60s , it peaked at 90 percent .
In the Bay Area , the numbers are even lower .
Dr. Laurence S. Baskin , chief of pediatric urology at UC San Francisco , said , " I would say it 's only 40 percent in San Francisco .
People are more educated about the reasons for it now .
In the past it was part of the package :
You had a boy , he was circumcised and you would be sent home with a car seat , and that was it . "
Immigration also is a big factor in the decrease in male circumcision nationwide , Baskin said .
Among Asian cultures and Latin American cultures , circumcision is the exception , not the norm .
During the 1950s , the rate of routine infant circumcision leapt from 50 to 90 percent in response to the advice of medical doctors , like the author Dr. Benjamin Spock , who argued that it was beneficial .
But in 1999 , after decades of debate , the American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement on circumcision stating , " Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision ; however , these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision . "
When Baskin speaks to parents of infant boys , he describes the pros and cons of the procedure .
On the pro side : Circumcision can decrease the likelihood of urinary tract infections , penile cancer , HIV and sexually transmitted diseases .
On the con side : Circumcision has a small risk factor , like any surgery , and in most cases is unnecessary .
With good hygiene , an uncircumcised male can maintain good health throughout life .
Baskin said that most of the clinical studies measuring the reduction of HIV , STDs and penile cancer were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and " not really germane to people living in San Francisco . "
Penile cancer , he said , is a problem in Africa but almost unheard - of in the United States .
Dan Savage , a popular sex adviser whose Savage Love column is syndicated to 70 newspapers , has a 9 - year - old adopted son , Daryl .
When he and his partner , Terry Miller , made the decision not to circumcise , he said , " My parents did n't interfere .
They had their three sons circumcised because that 's what everyone did , but they 're informed enough now to know that it 's not what everyone does .
It 's a choice that parents make . "
Initially , Savage said , " there was some discussion on my boyfriend 's part of wanting him to look like us .
All I had to tell him was , ' I do n't remember ever comparing penises with my dad .
You do n't sit around the Thanksgiving dinner table , haul it out and say , ' Hey , do n't we all look alike ! ' "
Stacy Nye of Redwood City agrees .
She has an uncircumcised 8 - year - old son and says the like - father - like - son argument is absurd .
" Dr. Dean Edell ( the talk - show host ) made a good point on his show once when he said the penis is the last thing that others see to compare a father and a son , unless you hang out at a nudist colony . "
Even among young Jewish parents , there has been a change .
Jonathan Marks , a Marin County real - estate agent , said he and his wife , Paula , did a " vast amount of research " when their son , Gabriel , was born five years ago .
" I can't say we were torn about it .
Actually , we were torn , but only in the expectation of others around us and especially my Jewish heritage .
But after doing the research and speaking with midwives and others around us with boys , we decided that the trend at the time was moving away from this blanket circumcision edict that comes down from God knows where . "
" It comes up frequently in my column , " Savage said .
" Where it really creates conflict and stress for my readers is when they 're young , hip , alternative - scene Jews who may not even be practicing .
But suddenly they 're having a boy , and they get all this pressure from their families .
I know one couple who were disinherited , and they went ahead and did n't do the circumcision anyway . "
Jeff Lewis , a San Francisco optometrist who practices in Orinda , is Jewish and is expecting a daughter with his wife , Shem .
If they have a boy in the future , he said , " We would circumcise , not only for the sake of tradition , but also because I 've seen in hospital training too many elderly men go through the circumcision process for hygiene reasons .
The trauma is measurable . "
For a lot of parents , the notion of inflicting pain on their newborn son is loathsome .
David Fortner of Berkeley , whose son Wyatt was born seven months ago , said , " He was such a small , little , delicate guy that the last thing I 'd want to do was start carving up his little ween . "
" I 'm not going to buy the argument that it 's brutal , " Baskin said .
" There 's a general anesthetic involved , so they 're not going to experience any pain , because they 're asleep .
And afterwards , with good nerve blocks , they basically do fine . "
Infants 3 to 6 months old are given a general anesthetic ; newborns 1 to 8 days are given a local anesthetic .
Baskin also dismissed the argument that circumcised men experience less sexual pleasure because of the loss of foreskin .
" I think that 's been pretty much debunked by a number of articles in the British Journal of Urology and the Journal of Urology . "
Regarding men who endeavor to restore their foreskin in their adult years --
Web sites are devoted to the practice -- Baskin said , " In my mind that would go under the heading , ' Get a life . ' "
" It 's pretty hard to scientifically quantify pleasure under any circumstances , " said retired San Francisco urologist Dale McGhee , " and particularly hard to compare pleasure quantitatively between circumcised and uncircumcised penises .
I know that in all my career in medicine , I never met one man who was circumcised in adulthood and who said he experienced less sexual pleasure after than before . "
Curiously , one of the least - mentioned factors in the cut versus uncut debate is the sexual experience of women .
" Friends who have made love to men who were not circumcised have told me it felt a whole lot better to them than men who were circumcised , " said Nye .
" That may have more to do with the skills of the man than the circumcision .
But who knows ? "
Update : the site has now launched officially at iphone.facebook.com
A reader tipped us off today that Facebook has launched a version of the site for the iPhone .
And - wow !
- have they done a spectacular job with this .
Go to themob.facebook.com on your iPhone or web browser to behold what might be the best iPhone app so far .
The interface slides horizontally as you choose options , and the site is laid out in such a way that the essential features are much easier to find than on the main site - browse friends , check your Facebook mail , read the news feed and use pretty much every other Facebook feature from this more compact viewpoint .
The red number is your unread mail : my inbox is unusually empty at 35 mails , but I guess that 's no consolation for those who tried to contact me through the site .
This is a good job by Facebook , and hopefully other social networks will launch iPhone versions that are even half as good .
Karl Rove has worked with Mr Bush since 1993
" I just think it 's time , " Mr Rove said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal , adding that he was quitting for the sake of his family .
Mr Rove has worked with Mr Bush since 1993 when he ran for Texas governor .
As Mr Bush 's chief strategist , he is seen as instrumental in delivering election victories in 2000 and 2004 .
There 's always something that can keep you here , and as much as I 'd like to be here , I 've got to do this for the sake of my family

' Architect ' quits White House Profile : Karl Rove Karl Rove in his own words
For this he is highly regarded by Republicans , but at the same time equally reviled by Democrats .
" Obviously , it 's a big loss to us , " White House deputy press secretary Dana Perino told the Associated Press news agency .
" He 's a great colleague , a good friend , and a brilliant mind .
He will be greatly missed . "
" He will continue to be one of the president 's greatest friends , " she added .
Delayed departure
Mr Rove has been accused of underhand political tactics since his teenage years .
HAVE YOUR SAY If Rove has been Bush 's chief advisor , he has given a lot of very very bad advice .
Rory Morty , Giessen , Germany
Send us your comments
As a student , he invited Chicago vagrants to turn up for free beer at a plush reception for a Democrat state candidate - an incident he later described as a " youthful prank " that he regretted .
He has continued to be dogged by controversy .
Last month , the US Senate issued a subpoena against him as part of an investigation into the sacking of eight federal prosecutors , but Mr Bush ordered him not to testify , citing executive privilege .
ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN KEY DEPARTURES
Karl Rove , chief political strategist , leaves 31 Aug Donald Rumsfeld , defence secretary , quit after 2006 mid-term elections Andrew Card , chief of staff , quit March 2006 Paul Wolfowitz , deputy defence secretary , quit March 2005 Colin Powell , secretary of state , resigned after President Bush 's first term , Nov 2004 SURVIVORS FROM 2000 Dick Cheney , vice - president Condoleezza Rice , secretary of state , was national security adviser in first term Alberto Gonzales , attorney general , was White House counsel
Mr Rove was also investigated in connection with the exposure of CIA agent Valerie Plame , though prosecutors decided he should not face any charges .
Mr Rove told the Wall Street Journal that he had first floated the idea of leaving last year , but had delayed his departure when the Democrats took control of Congress .
He said he took a final decision to leave after White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten told aides that if they stayed after the end of August they would be obliged to stay in the administration until Mr Bush 's own departure in January 2009 .
" There 's always something that can keep you here , and as much as I 'd like to be here , I 've got to do this for the sake of my family , " he said .
He said he expected Mr Bush 's current poor ratings to improve , and that conditions in Iraq would get better as the military surge continued .
A Republican had a good chance of winning the 2008 presidential election , he said , because Democrats would choose the " fatally flawed " Hillary Clinton as their candidate .
In general , changes to a Wikipedia page cannot be traced to an individual , only to the owner of a particular network .
In 2004 , someone using a computer at ExxonMobil made substantial changes to a description of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska , playing down its impact on the area ’s wildlife and casting a positive light on compensation payments the company had made to victims of the spill .
Gantt Walton , a spokesman for the company , said that although the revisions appeared to have come from an ExxonMobil computer , the company has more than 80,000 employees around the world , making it “ more than a difficult task ” to figure out who made the changes .
Mr. Walton said ExxonMobil employees “ are not authorized to update Wikipedia with company computers without company endorsement . ”
The company ’s preferred approach , he said , would be to use Wikipedia ’s “ talk ” pages , a forum for discussing Wikipedia entries .
Mr. Wales also said the “ talk ” pages are where Wikipedia encourages editors with a conflict of interest to suggest revisions .
“ If someone sees a simple factual error about their company , we really do n’t mind if they go in and edit , ” he said .
But if a revision is likely to be controversial , he added , “ the best thing to do is log in , go to the ‘ talk ’ page , identify yourself openly , and say , ‘ I ’m the communications person from such and such company . ’
The community responds very well , especially if the person is n’t combative . ”
Mike Sitrick , a longtime public relations consultant in Los Angeles , agreed .
“ I ’m a big believer that if you ’re going to correct it , correct it with a name , ” he said .
“ Otherwise it hurts your credibility . ”
An Anheuser - Busch employee eventually took responsibility for the changes to the SeaWorld page  but only after being challenged about them twice by another user .
A person identifying himself as Fred Jacobs , communications director for the company ’s theme park unit , said on the entry ’s “ talk ” page that discussion of the ethics of keeping sea creatures captive “ belongs in an article devoted to that subject . ”

For the most part , the thousands of languages in the world today fall into one of two categories ( notable exceptions being Japanese , some Scandinavian dialects and northern Spain 's Basque tongue ) : tonal or nontonal .
Two linguists believe they know the genetic underpinnings for these differences .
During a study of linguistic and genetic data from 49 distinct populations , the authors discovered a striking correlation between two genes involved in brain development and language tonality .
Populations that speak nontonal languages ( where the pitch of a spoken word does not affect its meaning ) have newer versions of the genes , with mutations that began to appear roughly 37 thousand years ago .
" You can consider this as the first of the many possible studies that we could do to try to find a genetic basis for language and language typology and the different populations that speak a language , " says Patrick Wong , an assistant professor of communication sciences and disorders at Northwestern University , who was not involved in this study .
In English , the pitch at which a word is spoken conveys emotion but usually does not affect its meaning .
But in many sub-Saharan Africa , Southeast Asian and Latin American languages tone changes the meaning of words .
For instance , the Chinese word huar said in a high pitch means flower , but in a dipping pitch means picture .
The new research , published this week inProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA ties this difference to two genes , ASPM and Microcephalin .
The exact functions of both genes are still open to debate , but they are known to affect brain size during embryonic development .
" They presumably have something to do with brain structure , because there are deleterious mutations of the genes that lead to microcephaly " ( a condition in which a person 's brain is much smaller than the average size for his or her age ) , says senior study author , Robert Ladd , a professor of linguistics at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland .
Ladd and colleague Dan Dediu , a fellow linguist at the university , focused on one particular variation of each of these two genes .
" They 're versions of these genes that are not only newer , but also show signatures of strong natural selection in modern humans , " Ladd says .
In their report , the authors note that previous studies indicate that these popular new mutations do not appear to affect intelligence , brain size or social ability .
But based on their strong correlation with language tone , they surmise that they may contribute to slight differences in the cerebral cortex , the outermost layer of the brain , which , among many other functions , plays a role in our ability to understand language .
Ladd and Dediu compared 24 linguistic features — such as subject - verb word order , passive tense , and rounded vowels — with 981 versions of the two genes found in the 49 populations studied .
Most of the language contrasts could be explained by geographic or historical differences .
But tone seemed to be inextricably tied to the variations of ASPM and Microcephalin observed by the authors .
The mutations were absent in populations that speak tonal languages , but abundant in nontonal speakers .
Northwestern 's
Wong says that in a field in which researchers struggle to determine whether differences arise from experience or genetics , the new study " gives us an idea that there is a genetic side to things . "
He says the research indicates that small differences in brain organization determined by genetic makeup may be amplified by cultural factors and contact with other languages through war or migration , creating today 's dichotomy in language tonality .
" Even remarkable correlations can arise by coincidence — or , in this case , possibly by prehistoric migration factors that are currently unknown to anthropology and archaeology — so we can't rule that out , " Ladd says .
" The next step is to attempt to correlate individual genotypes with measurably different behaviors on experimental tasks that are plausibly related to language and speech . "

Compendium of Lost Words
What is a Lost Word ?
A- E F -M N - R S - Z Index
There are rare words , and there are rarer words , but only a very special word qualifies as a bona fide lost word .
Of course , no word in the Compendium can be completely lost , or I could never have found it .
To as great an extent as possible , I have tried to use a set of criteria by which truly rare but real English words can be classified as lost words .
They are as follows : 1 . The word must have a header entry in the Oxford English Dictionary .
Every single one of the words in this list is found in the Oxford English Dictionary .
Using the OED online subscription service , I have tracked down these words .
The OED is the largest English dictionary , and is generally regarded as a canonical source for the study of the language .
2 . The word may not appear in its proper English context on any readily accessible web page .
Using the Google search engine , I have ensured that none of these words appear on any English - language web page in its proper context .
Many of these words turn up no hits whatsoever .
Others occur only as part of long alphabetic word lists that lack definitions .
Still other pages ( often pornographic websites ) use scripts that automatically interpolate any keyword from such word - lists in a futile effort to attract more traffic .
Others are legitimate words in a foreign language , or are place - names or proper nouns in English .
None of these ' hits ' excludes a word from status as a ' lost word ' .
However , if even one hit was returned where the word was defined , or where it was used in its proper sense in a sentence , it was excluded .
Because the online OED is subscription - based , it is not indexed by the search engines and thus its definitions do not show up in search engines .
3 . The word must have been used in Modern English .
The question of what exactly constitutes ' Modern English ' is tricky , and any answer must necessarily have an element of arbitrariness .
Some linguists distinguish only Middle English from Modern English , while others use an intermediate category , Early Modern English , which includes , among other things , the writings of Shakespeare , Spenser , and the King James Bible .
I have chosen a cut - off date of 1650 as the earliest limit of true Modern English , following the classification used by some linguists .
Because the OED contains dated usage sentences for every word it defines , including its earliest use and later uses throughout its history , it was relatively easy for me to distinguish those words used since 1650 and those that died out earlier .
Not entirely coincidentally , this border date of 1650 is just barely early enough to allow entries from the first large English - only dictionary , the very interesting Glossographia ( 1656 ) by Thomas Blount .
4 . The word must have been used in a standard English variety rather than simply in a regional dialect .
There must be literally thousands of dialectal English words used since 1650 that have never been used online .
Most numerous among these are probably Scots dialectal terms .
While I am not a linguistic prescriptivist , and do not think in any way that Scots , Australian , Indian and other English dialects are in any way inferior , they are really another subject entirely , and do n't belong in this inquiry .
By ' standard ' English , I mean words that appear in print in British or American English , the major varieties of the language as used today .
5 . The word must not be a simple variation in spelling of another word .
Particularly in the early part of the ' modern ' period from which my words are drawn , English spelling was far from regular .
The OED , along with many other dictionaries , includes such spelling variations when they are used with some frequency and are not idiosyncratic errors .
While these variations are of interest to lexicographers , they are not particularly interesting from the perspective of this study , since their more ordinary versions will be found online in many places .
In addition , there are many criteria that identify a truly ideal lost word , but do not apply to all the words in the Compendium .
Ideally , a word should not be a nonce - word or an idiosyncratic coinage , and , even better , should have been used by two or more authors .
Words whose meanings do not relate to entirely obsolete concepts are preferred over those that could only be used historically .
Lastly , though these gems are quite rare , twentieth century words that meet all the other criteria are especially desirable .
I hope you have found this site to be useful .

A senior official in the ruling Syrian Ba'ath party said Thursday there was growing consensus among the Syrian leadership for the need to launch a military response to Israel 's reported airstrike in Syria two weeks ago .
The official said the Syrian air force has been placed on high alert .
The official made the remarks to a reporter from the Arab - Israeli newspaper Al - Hadath during a visit to Jordan .
The official said Israel ordered the flyover in Syrian airspace to test air defense systems newly acquired from Russia .
The official reject reports that Israel destroyed nuclear equipment sent to Syria from North Korea who has agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities in exchange for generous aide packages .
The official accused Israel and the United States of conspiring to ignite a war in the region in Iran and Syria did not bow to Washington 's demands .
Washington has accused Syria of smuggling Iranian arms to Hizbullah in Lebanon and of facilitating the flow of insurgents into Iraq .
The United States is also pushing for a third round of UN sanctions against Iran over its disputed nuclear program .
" The Syrians are well aware of the Israel threat and are following Israel 's military maneuvers in the north and in the Golan Heights and are wary that Israel would seek to salvage itself from the internal crisis by igniting crises abroad , " he said .
The official also brushed off reports that Israel had targeted an Iranian weapons shipment to Hizbullah .
" Israel is seeking to impose a certain policy on the Syrian leadership so that it retracts on its national objective to reclaim occupied lands and to punish it for supporting the resistance in Lebanon , Palestine and Iraq , " the official said .
INFLATION AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE By Joan Veon
April 4 , 2006
NewsWithViews.com
Itï¿½s about time Americans woke up to the fact that their future is intricately woven into the web of a black widow spider called ï¿ ½The Federal Reserve .ï¿½
Just as the black widow has jaws and fangs that spring out of it and inject a poison that is 15 times that of a rattle snake , so too does the Federal Reserve have jaws and fangs .
The best way to explain it is that it is not federal ( the jaws ) and it has no reserves ( the poison ) .
The name , however , IMPLIES that it is federal and that they have endless streams of money to lend to the American government .
They do not .
The Federal Reserve Act was passed at 11:45 p.m. on Christmas Eve , after all the opposing Senators had gone home to celebrate Christmas .
Those who wanted the Federal Reserve had a quorum and passed the legislation in an unprecedented move .
At the time , Congressman McFadden gave testimony in the House when he said , Mr. Chairman , we have in this Country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known .
I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks , hereinafter called the Fed .
The Fed has cheated the Government of these United States and the people of the United States out of enough money to pay the Nationï¿½s debt .
The depredations and iniquities of the Fed has cost this County enough money to pay the National Debt several times over [ poison ] .
Some people who think that the Federal Reserve Banks are United States Government institutions .
They are not Government institutions .
They are private monopolies which prey upon the people of these United States for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers ; foreign and domestic speculators and swindlers ; and rich and predatory money lenders .
These twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully and disloyally foisted upon this Country by the bankers who came here from Europe and repaid us our hospitality by undermining our American institutions .
Those bankers who took money out of this Country to finance Japan in a war against Russia .
They created a reign of terror in Russia with our money in order to help that war along .
They instigated the separate peace between Germany and Russia and thus drove a wedge between the Allies in the World War .
They financed Trotskyï¿½s passage from New York to Russia so that he might assist in the destruction of the Russian Empire .
They fomented and instigated the Russian Revolution , and placed a large fund of American dollars at Trotskyï¿½s disposal in one of their branch banks in Sweden so that through him Russian homes might be thoroughly broken up and Russian children flung far and wide from their natural protectors .
We were opposed to the Aldrich plan for a central bank .
The men who rule the Democratic Party then promised the people that if they were returned to power there would be no central banks established here while they held the reigns of government .
Thirteen months later that promise was broken , and the Wilson administration , under the tutelage of those sinister Wall Street figures who stood behind Colonel House , established here in our free Country , the worm - eaten monarchical institution of the ï¿ ½Kingï¿½s Bankï¿½ to control us from the top downward , and to shackle us from the cradle to the grave .
In other words , the Federal Reserve Bank is a private corporation that controls the entire monetary and financial system of the United States .
As such , it is not part of our government but controls it through creating highs and lows in the business cycle .
What that means is that a small group of insiders can ï¿½buy low and sell highï¿½ while the rest of us ï¿½hold .ï¿½
This is a direct transfer of wealth from us to them !
Furthermore , every time our government borrows from this monopoly , they print money out of the thin air and charge us interest .
Unfortunately those who think money grows on trees have no idea that it only pertains to a few well placed thieves .
The inflation and economic imbalances that we are hearing about are not created by us but they are created by the system which has been foisted upon us by deceit and deception .
The money lenders , in order to give themselves access to the rest of the chickens in the chicken coop , had to eliminate the gold system which our monetary system was based on because a gold system canï¿½t inflate money endlessly .
As a result of the created depression in 1929 , President Roosevelt took that opportunity to completely change our entire political and economic system .
Again , the testimony of the Honorable Louis T. McFadden explains ,
At noon on the 4th of March , 1933 , FDR , with his hand on the Bible took an oath to preserve Protect and defend the Constitution of the U.S.
At mid-night on the 5th of March , 1933 , he confiscated the property of American citizens .
He took the currency of the United States off the gold standard of value .
He repudiated the internal debt of the Government to its own citizens .
He destroyed the value of the American dollar .
He released , or endeavored to release , the Fed from their contractual liability to redeem Fed currency in gold or lawful money on a parity with gold .
Two of the steps include taking the common man off the gold standard and relying on British economist John Maynard Keynes .
Shortly after Roosevelt was sworn in as President , he instructed the banks not to convert the gold backed dollars which our government used to print before the Federal Reserve was created that our parents and grandparents held into gold .
In addition , all gold that they might have held was confiscated .
However , Roosevelt allowed foreign countryï¿½s who held our gold - backed certificates to cash them in for gold up until President Nixon closed the ï¿½gold windowï¿½ in 1971 .
British economist and Fabian socialist , John Maynard Keynes , told Roosevelt that the best way to get out of the depression was to borrow .
Today , 73 years later , we have a Federal deficit of $ 12T .
Every level of government is broke : local , county , state , and federal .
Thanks to Keynes economic successor , Frederic von Hayek who advocated that government sell their assets to help pay down their debt .
Governments are not only selling their assets but are entering into partnerships with corporations which are called public - private partnerships - PPP .
PPP ï¿½s do not allow for representative government since the structure of government is being changed and there is no recourse for injustice .
When Nixon closed the gold window in 1971 , he not only took the strongest country in the world off the gold standard , but that act succeeded in changing the entire monetary system of the world .
No longer would the finances of any country in the world be tied to gold which prevented them from spending more than they had , but it opened the door for the black widow spider to weave a web of debt and place the people of the world inside the web by a small group of evil - intended international bankers who have no problem in stealing from their own grandmother .
Furthermore , as Congressman McFadden testified , the Federal Reserve and the Bank for International Settlements could and did present American gold certificates for payment in the gold that used to belong to the individuals that Roosevelt confiscated gold from .
He further testified , The text of the Executive Order which seems to place an embargo on shipments of gold permits the Secretary of the Treasury , a former director of the Fed of New York , the practices of which have been corrupt , to issue license at his discretion for the export of gold coin , or bullion , earmarked or held in trust for a recognized foreign government or foreign central bank for international settlements .
Now , Mr. Chairman , if gold held in trust for those foreign institutions may be sent to them , I see no reason why gold held in trust for Americans as evidenced by their gold certificates and other currency issued by the U.S. government should not be paid to them .
By the terms of this executive order , gold may be exported if it is actually required , for the fulfillment of any contract entered into prior to the date of this order by an applicant who , in obedience to the executive order of April 5 , 1933 , has delivered gold coin , gold bullion , or gold certificates .
This means that gold may be exported to pay the obligations abroad of the Fed which were incurred prior to the date of the order .
If a European Bank should send 100,000,000 dollars in Fed currency to a bank in this country for redemption , that bank could easily ship gold to Europe in exchange for that currency .
Then , in 1980 , President Carter passed the Monetary De-Regulation
Act which de-regulated the amount of interest banks charged and paid .
Instead of charging and paying a required amount of interest , banks can now pay and charge ï¿½market rates .ï¿½
Today , people are being paid 2 % on their savings while they are being charged up to 21 % to 25 % for borrowing !
Then under President Reagan , the tax laws were changed so that you and I can ï¿½t deduct interest paid from the amount of taxes owed .
In response , the banking system came up with the idea of having people spend the ï¿½equity ï¿½ in their home through ï¿½home equity lines of credit .ï¿½
Interestingly enough , these loans are tax - deductible .
I donï¿½t know what these people are going to do when the government eliminates any kind of interest on home loans and lines of credit .
Does anyone see the intricate weave of the black widow spider yet ?
Now add in the Nasdaq crash which wiped out $ 7T in investments and savings .
In response , the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates to 45 year lows of 1 % in June , 2004 .
This achieved the unbelievable .
People who were constrained by the amount they could borrow determined they could live like kings in the BIGGER home and went out and borrowed MORE as they moved up .
Since interest on home equity lines of credit is based on prime , it became reasonable to build up a tremendous amount of debt based on the rising ï¿½equity ï¿½ in the residential property .
Then after sufficient Americans have followed their pipe dreams and increased their debt , Greenspan announced the Fed needed to rein in inflation and interest rates began rising .
Just the other day , his successor , Ben Bernanke raised interest rates for the 15th time to 4.75 % .
Stating that ï¿½further policy firming may be needed , ï¿½ it is the intent of the Fed to ï¿½keep the lid on inflation .ï¿½
Oh yeah ?
Letï¿½s talk about inflation .
What is inflation ?
According to geo-political expert Terry Hayfield , capitalism is inflationary all by itself .
Capitalism , which is an ï¿½ismï¿½ like socialism , Marxism , or Fabian socialism , is the economic philosophy of the international bankers .
Capitalism has to be in constant motion .
It has to constantly have a new product , a new market , a new buyer .
Without it , capitalism will deflate and go into depression .
Furthermore , how are you going to buy the product that capitalism produces ?
You are going to pay for it with a Federal Reserve Noteï¿ ½which was printed up like any other piece of paper .
The act of printing up a piece of paper which becomes ï¿ ½a dollarï¿½ is inflationary because it was not there before you wanted to buy .
It comes into being as you spend money which the Fed does not have to begin with .
However , the Fed charges the Federal government interest on all the money in the banking system .
Are you smelling the coffee yet ?
In other words , when you BORROW monies to buy the house , the car , the dress , the motorboat , you are borrowing money you did not have and money which did not exist before your demand .
Furthermore , you are borrowing it at usurious rates .
Hayfield explains , ï¿ ½Every time the Federal Reserve CREATES money to meet a demand , it is inflationary !!!ï¿½
Do you get it ?
The truth of the matter is that our system is based on money being created according to our demand and then our paying it back at Mafia levels of interest to a bunch of evil people who will literally skin you alive to get every since cent you have .
What is our response ?
To play their game .
Since capitalism needs a new product and continuous demand at all times , to trump them is to reduce our buying to necessities and to stop charging .
Turn in your Wal - Mart , Pennyï¿½s , Sears , Nordstromï¿½s , Neiman - Marcus and Discover , MasterCard and Visa cards .
Write them nice letters stating that you can no longer afford to pay 21 % interest and that you are closing your account .
Start using cash and start living within your means .
If we do that , we can trump these evil doers who are waiting for us to buy Chinese products that are building up the Chinese army .
Next , pay down what you owe and keep your cards closed !
Take any excess that you have , when you have it and pay down your mortgage .
If you are living in the BIG house , sell it and move to a smaller house while you can .
If you have a pretty substantial home equity line of credit , remember that you still owe that debt and putting it into your mortgage is not smart but dangerous .
Do what you have to in order to pay it off .
If you have money in your 401k , borrow it out .
If you have an asset that you could sell , sell it and eliminate that home equity loan .
In addition , start buying products from your friends who sell Nikken , Amway , and Avon , etc .
Buy from only private corporations that are not part of the system .
The world has entered the final stages of rape , robbery and pillaging by the central bankers .
The whole economic infrastructure of the world has been primed for them to grab .
How will they do it ?
They will use the excuse of inflation to literally squeeze us like turnips .
Inflation is a joke on us .
Every time we spend , we are creating inflation since our employer probably had to borrow to pay the payroll because they are waiting for others to buy their products .
Get yourself out of the system as much as possible .
Remember that McFadden was testifying on the heels of the Great Depression and the confiscation of gold .
He rightly states our plight :
The people of these United States are being greatly wronged .
They have been driven from their employments .
They have been dispossessed from their homes .
They have been evicted from their rented quarters .
They have lost their children .
They have been left to suffer and die for lack of shelter , food , clothing and medicine .
The wealth of these United States and the working capital have been taken away from them and has either been locked in the vaults of certain banks and the great corporations or exported to foreign countries for the benefit of the foreign customers of these banks and corporations .
So far as the people of the United States are concern , the cupboard is bare .

Time travel has been a staple of science fiction .
With the advent of general relativity it has been entertained by serious physicists .
But , especially in the philosophy literature , there have been arguments that time travel is inherently paradoxical .
The most famous paradox is the grandfather paradox : you travel back in time and kill your grandfather , thereby preventing your own existence .
To avoid inconsistency some circumstance will have to occur which makes you fail in this attempt to kill your grandfather .
Does n't this require some implausible constraint on otherwise unrelated circumstances ?
We examine such worries in the context of modern physics .
You are very depressed .
You are suicidally depressed .
You have a gun .
But you do not quite have the courage to point the gun at yourself and kill yourself in this way .
If only someone else would kill you , that would be a good thing .
But you can't really ask someone to kill you .
That would n't be fair .
You decide that if you remain this depressed and you find a time machine , you will travel back in time to just about now , and kill your earlier self .
That would be good .
In that way you even would get rid of the depressing time you will spend between now and when you would get into that time machine .
You start to muse about the coherence of this idea , when something amazing happens .
Out of nowhere you suddenly see someone coming towards you with a gun pointed at you .
In fact he looks very much like you , except that he is bleeding badly from his left eye , and can barely stand up straight .
You are at peace .
You look straight at him , calmly .
He shoots .
You feel a searing pain in your left eye .
Your mind is in chaos , you stagger around and accidentally enter a strange looking cubicle .
You drift off into unconsciousness .
After a while , you can not tell how long , you drift back into consciousness and stagger out of the cubicle .
You see someone in the distance looking at you calmly and fixedly .
You realize that it is your younger self .
He looks straight at you .
You are in terrible pain .
You have to end this , you have to kill him , really kill him once and for all .
You shoot him , but your eyesight is so bad that your aim is off .
You do not kill him , you merely damage his left eye .
He staggers off .
You fall to the ground in agony , and decide to study the paradoxes of time travel more seriously .
The standard worry about time travel is that it allows one to go back and kill one 's younger self and thereby create paradox .
More generally it allows for people or objects to travel back in time and to cause events in the past that are inconsistent with what in fact happened .
( See e.g. , Gödel 1949 , Earman 1972 , Malament 1985 a&b , Horwich 1987 . )
A stone - walling response to this worry is that by logic indeed inconsistent events can not both happen .
Thus in fact all such schemes to create paradox are logically bound to fail .
So what 's the worry ?
Well , one worry is the question as to why such schemes always fail .
Does n't the necessity of such failures put prima facie unusual and unexpected constraints on the actions of people , or objects , that have traveled in time ?
Do n't we have good reason to believe that there are no such constraints ( in our world ) and thus that there is no time travel ( in our world ) ?
We will later return to the issue of the palatability of such constraints , but first we want to discuss an argument that no constraints are imposed by time travel .
Wheeler and Feynman ( 1949 ) were the first to claim that the fact that nature is continuous could be used to argue that causal influences from later events to earlier events , as are made possible by time travel , will not lead to paradox without the need for any constraints .
Maudlin ( 1990 ) showed how to make their argument precise and more general , and argued that nonetheless it was not completely general .
Imagine the following set - up .
We start off having a camera with a black and white film ready to take a picture of whatever comes out of the time machine .
An object , in fact a developed film , comes out of the time machine .
We photograph it , and develop the film .
The developed film is subsequently put in the time machine , and set to come out of the time machine at the time the picture is taken .
This surely will create a paradox : the developed film will have the opposite distribution of black , white , and shades of gray , from the object that comes out of the time machine .
For developed black and white films ( i.e. negatives ) have the opposite shades of gray from the objects they are pictures of .
But since the object that comes out of the time machine is the developed film itself it we surely have a paradox .
However , it does not take much thought to realize that there is no paradox here .
What will happen is that a uniformly gray picture will emerge , which produces a developed film that has exactly the same uniform shade of gray .
No matter what the sensitivity of the film is , as long as the dependence of the brightness of the developed film depends in a continuous manner on the brightness of the object being photographed , there will be a shade of gray that , when photographed , will produce exactly the same shade of gray on the developed film .
This is the essence of Wheeler and Feynman 's idea .
Let us first be a bit more precise and then a bit more general .
For simplicity let us suppose that the film is always a uniform shade of gray ( i.e. at any time the shade of gray does not vary by location on the film ) .
The possible shades of gray of the film can then be represented by the ( real ) numbers from 0 , representing pure black , to 1 , representing pure white .
Let us now distinguish various stages in the chronogical order of the life of the film .
In stage S 1 the film is young ; it has just been placed in the camera and is ready to be exposed .
It is then exposed to the object that comes out of the time machine .
( That object in fact is a later stage of the film itself ) .
By the time we come to stage S 2 of the life of the film , it has been developed and is about to enter the time machine .
Stage S 3 occurs just after it exits the time machine and just before it is photographed .
Stage S 4 occurs after it has been photographed and before it starts fading away .
Let us assume that the film starts out in stage S 1 in some uniform shade of gray , and that the only significant change in the shade of gray of the film occurs between stages S 1 and S 2 .
During that period it acquires a shade of gray that depends on the shade of gray of the object that was photographed .
I.e. , the shade of gray that the film acquires at stage S 2 depends on the shade of gray it has at stage S 3 .
The influence of the shade of gray of the film at stage S 3 , on the shade of gray of the film at stage S 2 , can be represented as a mapping , or function , from the real numbers between 0 and 1 ( inclusive ) , to the real numbers between 0 and 1 ( inclusive ) .
Let us suppose that the process of photography is such that if one imagines varying the shade of gray of an object in a smooth , continuous manner then the shade of gray of the developed picture of that object will also vary in a smooth , continuous manner .
This implies that the function in question will be a continuous function .
Now any continuous function from the real numbers between 0 and 1 ( inclusive ) to the real numbers between 0 and 1 ( inclusive ) must map at least one number to itself .
One can quickly convince oneself of this by graphing such functions .
For one will quickly see that any continuous function f from [ 0,1 ] to [ 0,1 ] must intersect the line x=y somewhere , and thus there must be at least one point x such that f( x ) =x .
Such points are called fixed points of the function .
Now let us think about what such a fixed point represents .
It represents a shade of gray such that , when photographed , it will produce a developed film with exactly that same shade of gray .
The existence of such a fixed point implies a solution to the apparent paradox .
Let us now be more general and allow color photography .
One can represent each possible color of an object ( of uniform color ) by the proportions of blue , green and red that make up that color .
( This is why television screens can produce all possible colors . )
Thus one can represent all possible colors of an object by three points on three orthogonal lines x , y and z , that is to say , by a point in a three - dimensional cube .
This cube is also known as the ‘ Cartesian product ’ of the three line segments .
Now , one can also show that any continuous map from such a cube to itself must have at least one fixed point .
So color photography can not be used to create time travel paradoxes either !
Even more generally , consider some system P which , as in the above example , has the following life .
It starts in some state S 1 , it interacts with an object that comes out of a time machine ( which happens to be its older self ) , it travels back in time , it interacts with some object ( which happens to be its younger self ) , and finally it grows old and dies .
Let us assume that the set of possible states of P can be represented by a Cartesian product of n closed intervals of the reals , i.e. , let us assume that the topology of the state - space of P is isomorphic to a finite Cartesian product of closed intervals of the reals .
Let us further assume that the development of P in time , and the dependence of that development on the state of objects that it interacts with , is continuous .
Then , by a well - known fixed point theorem in topology ( see e.g. , Hocking and Young 1961 , p 273 ) , no matter what the nature of the interaction is , and no matter what the initial state of the object is , there will be at least one state S 3 of the older system ( as it emerges from the time travel machine ) that will influence the initial state S 1 of the younger system ( when it encounters the older system ) so that , as the younger system becomes older , it develops exactly into state S 3 .
Thus without imposing any constraints on the initial state S 1 of the system P , we have shown that there will always be perfectly ordinary , non-paradoxical , solutions , in which everything that happens , happens according to the usual laws of development .
Of course , there is looped causation , hence presumably also looped explanation , but what do you expect if there is looped time ?
Unfortunately , for the fan of time travel , a little reflection suggests that there are systems for which the needed fixed point theorem does not hold .
Imagine , for instance , that we have a dial that can only rotate in a plane .
We are going to put the dial in the time machine .
Indeed we have decided that if we see the later stage of the dial come out of the time machine set at angle x , then we will set the dial to x+90 , and throw it into the time machine .
Now it seems we have a paradox , since the mapping that consists of a rotation of all points in a circular state - space by 90 degrees does not have a fixed point .
And why would n't some state - spaces have the topology of a circle ?
However , we have so far not used another continuity assumption which is also a reasonable assumption .
So far we have only made the following demand : the state the dial is in at stage S 2 must be a continuous function of the state of the dial at stage S 3 .
But , the state of the dial at stage S 2 is arrived at by taking the state of the dial at stage S 1 , and rotating it over some angle .
It is not merely the case that the effect of the interaction , namely the state of the dial at stage S 2 , should be a continuous function of the cause , namely the state of the dial at stage S 3 .
It is additionally the case that path taken to get there , the way the dial is rotated between stages S 1 and S 2 must be a continuous function of the state at stage S 3 .
And , rather surprisingly , it turns out that this can not be done .
Let us illustrate what the problem is before going to a more general demonstration that there must be a fixed point solution in the dial case .
Forget time travel for the moment .
Suppose that you and I each have a watch with a single dial neither of which is running .
My watch is set at 12 .
You are going to announce what your watch is set at .
My task is going to be to adjust my watch to yours no matter what announcement you make .
And my actions should have a continuous ( single valued ) dependence on the time that you announce .
Surprisingly , this is not possible !
For instance , suppose that if you announce “ 12 ” , then I achieve that setting on my watch by doing nothing .
Now imagine slowly and continuously increasing the announced times , starting at 12 .
By continuity , I must achieve each of those settings by rotating my dial to the right .
If at some point I switch and achieve the announced goal by a rotation of my dial to the left , I will have introduced a discontinuity in my actions , a discontinuity in the actions that I take as a function of the announced angle .
So I will be forced , by continuity , to achieve every announcement by rotating the dial to the right .
But , this rotation to the right will have to be abruptly discontinued as the announcements grow larger and I eventually approach 12 again , since I achieved 12 by not rotating the dial at all .
So , there will be a discontinuity at 12 at the latest .
In general , continuity of my actions as a function of announced times can not be maintained throughout if I am to be able to replicate all possible settings .
Another way to see the problem is that one can similarly reason that , as one starts with 12 , and imagines continuously making the announced times earlier , one will be forced , by continuity , to achieve the announced times by rotating the dial to the left .
But the conclusions drawn from the assumption of continuous increases and the assumption of continuous decreases are inconsistent .
So we have an inconsistency following from the assumption of continuity and the assumption that I always manage to set my watch to your watch .
So , a dial developing according to a continuous dynamics from a given initial state , can not be set up so as to react to a second dial , with which it interacts , in such a way that it is guaranteed to always end up set at the same angle as the second dial .
Similarly , it can not be set up so that it is guaranteed to always end up set at 90 degrees to the setting of the second dial .
All of this has nothing to do with time travel .
However , the impossibility of such set ups is what prevents us from enacting the rotation by 90 degrees that would create paradox in the time travel setting .
Let us now give the positive result that with such dials there will always be fixed point solutions , as long as the dynamics is continuous .
Let us call the state of the dial before it interacts with its older self the initial state of the dial .
And let us call the state of the dial after it emerges from the time machine the final state of the dial .
We can represent the possible initial and final states of the dial by the angles x and y that the dial can point at initially and finally .
The set of possible initial plus final states thus forms a torus .
( See figure 1 . )
Figure 1
Suppose that the dial starts at angle I .
The initial angle I that the dial is at before it encounters its older self , and the set of all possible final angles that the dial can have when it emerges from the time machine is represented by the circle I on the torus ( see figure 1 ) .
Given any possible angle of the emerging dial the dial initially at angle I will develop to some other angle .
One can picture this development by rotating each point on I in the horizontal direction by the relevant amount .
Since the rotation has to depend continuously on the angle of the emerging dial , ring I during this development will deform into some loop L on the torus .
Loop L thus represents the angle x that the dial is at when it is thrown into the time machine , given that it started at angle I and then encountered a dial ( its older self ) which was at angle y when it emerged from the time machine .
We therefore have consistency if x=y for some x and y on loop L. Now , let loop C be the loop which consists of all the points on the torus for which x=y .
Ring I intersects C at point < i , i >.
Obviously any continuous deformation of I must still intersect C somewhere .
So L must intersect C somewhere , say at < j , j > .
But that means that no matter how the development of the dial starting at I depends on the angle of the emerging dial , there will be some angle for the emerging dial such that the dial will develop exactly into that angle ( by the time it enters the time machine ) under the influence of that emerging dial .
This is so no matter what angle one starts with , and no matter how the development depends on the angle of the emerging dial .
Thus even for a circular state - space there are no constraints needed other than continuity .
Unfortunately there are state - spaces that escape even this argument .
Consider for instance a pointer that can be set to all values between 0 and 1 , where 0 and 1 are not possible values .
That is , suppose that we have a state - space that is isomorphic to an open set of real numbers .
Now suppose that we have a machine that sets the pointer to half the value that the pointer is set at when it emerges from the time machine .
Figure 2
Suppose the pointer starts at value I .
As before we can represent the combination of this initial position and all possible final positions by the line I .
Under the influence of the pointer coming out of the time machine the pointer value will develop to a value that equals half the value of the final value that it encountered .
We can represent this development as the continuous deformation of line I into line L , which is indicated by the arrows in Figure 2 .
This development is fully continuous .
Points < x , y > on line I represent the initial position x=I of the ( young ) pointer , and the position y of the older pointer as it emerges from the time machine .
Points < x , y > on line L represent the position x that the younger pointer should develop into , given that it encountered the older pointer emerging from the time machine set at position y.
Since the pointer is designed to develop to half the value of the pointer that it encounters , the line L corresponds to x=1 / 2 y .
We have consistency if there is some point such that it develops into that point , if it encounters that point .
Thus , we have consistency if there is some point < x , y > on line L such that x=y .
However , there is no such point : lines L and C do not intersect .
Thus there is no consistent solution , despite the fact that the dynamics is fully continuous .
Of course if 0 were a possible value L and C would intersect at 0 .
This is surprising and strange : adding one point to the set of possible values of a quantity here makes the difference between paradox and peace .
One might be tempted to just add the extra point to the state - space in order to avoid problems .
After all , one might say , surely no measurements could ever tell us whether the set of possible values includes that exact point or not .
Unfortunately there can be good theoretical reasons for supposing that some quantity has a state - space that is open : the set of all possible speeds of massive objects in special relativity surely is an open set , since it includes all speeds up to , but not including , the speed of light .
Quantities that have possible values that are not bounded also lead to counter examples to the presented fixed point argument .
And it is not obvious to us why one should exclude such possibilities .
So the argument that no constraints are needed is not fully general .
An interesting question of course is : exactly for which state - spaces must there be such fixed points .
We do not know the general answer .
( But see Kutach 2003 for more on this issue . )
Time travel has recently been discussed quite extensively in the context of general relativity .
Time travel can occur in general relativistic models in which one has closed time - like curves ( CTC's ) .
A time like curve is simply a space - time trajectory such that the speed of light is never equalled or exceeded along this trajectory .
Time - like curves thus represent the possible trajectories of ordinary objects .
If there were time - like curves which were closed ( formed a loop ) , then travelling along such a curve one would never exceed the speed of light , and yet after a certain amount of ( proper ) time one would return to a point in space - time that one previously visited .
Or , by staying close to such a CTC , one could come arbitrarily close to a point in space - time that one previously visited .
General relativity , in a straightforward sense , allows time travel : there appear to be many space - times compatible with the fundamental equations of General Relativity in which there are CTC's .
Space - time , for instance , could have a Minkowski metric everywhere , and yet have CTC 's everywhere by having the temporal dimension ( topologically ) rolled up as a circle .
Or , one can have wormhole connections between different parts of space - time which allow one to enter ‘ mouth A ’ of such a wormhole connection , travel through the wormhole , exit the wormhole at ‘ mouth B ’ and re-enter ‘ mouth A’ again .
Or , one can have space - times which topologically are R4 , and yet have CTC 's due to the ‘ tilting ’ of light cones ( Gödel space - times , Taub - NUT space - times , etc . )
General relativity thus appears to provide ample opportunity for time travel .
Note that just because there are CTC's in a space - time , this does not mean that one can get from any point in the space - time to any other point by following some future directed timelike curve .
In many space - times in which there are CTC 's such CTC 's do not occur all over space - time .
Some parts of space - time can have CTC 's while other parts do not .
Let us call the part of a space - time that has CTC 's the “ time travel region " of that space - time , while calling the rest of that space - time the " normal region " .
More precisely , the “ time travel region " consists of all the space - time points p such that there exists a ( non-zero length ) timelike curve that starts at p and returns to p .
Now let us start examining space - times with CTC 's a bit more closely for potential problems .
In order to get a feeling for the sorts of implications that closed timelike curves can have , it may be useful to consider two simple models .
In space - times with closed timelike curves the traditional initial value problem cannot be framed in the usual way .
For it presupposes the existence of Cauchy surfaces , and if there are CTCs then no Cauchy surface exists .
( A Cauchy surface is a spacelike surface such that every inextendible timelike curve crosses it exactly once .
One normally specifies initial conditions by giving the conditions on such a surface . )
Nonetheless , if the topological complexities of the manifold are appropriately localized , we can come quite close .
Let us call an edgeless spacelike surface S a quasi-Cauchy surface if it divides the rest of the manifold into two parts such that a ) every point in the manifold can be connected by a timelike curve to S , and b ) any timelike curve which connects a point in one region to a point in the other region intersects S exactly once .
It is obvious that a quasi-Cauchy surface must entirely inhabit the normal region of the space - time ; if any point p of S is in the time travel region , then any timelike curve which intersects p can be extended to a timelike curve which intersects S near p again .
In extreme cases of time travel , a model may have no normal region at all ( e.g. , Minkowski space - time rolled up like a cylinder in a time - like direction ) , in which case our usual notions of temporal precedence will not apply .
But temporal anomalies like wormholes ( and time machines ) can be sufficiently localized to permit the existence of quasi-Cauchy surfaces .
Given a timelike orientation , a quasi-Cauchy surface unproblematically divides the manifold into its past ( i.e. , all points that can be reached by past - directed timelike curves from S ) and its future ( ditto mutatis mutandis ) .
If the whole past of S is in the normal region of the manifold , then S is a partial Cauchy surface : every inextendible timelike curve which exists to the past of S intersects S exactly once , but ( if there is time travel in the future ) not every inextendible timelike curve which exists to the future of S intersects S. Now we can ask a particularly clear question : consider a manifold which contains a time travel region , but also has a partial Cauchy surface S , such that all of the temporal funny business is to the future of S .
If all you could see were S and its past , you would not know that the space - time had any time travel at all .
The question is : are there any constraints on the sort of data which can be put on S and continued to a global solution of the dynamics which are different from the constraints ( if any ) on the data which can be put on a Cauchy surface in a simply connected manifold and continued to a global solution ?
If there is time travel to our future , might we we able to tell this now , because of some implied oddity in the arrangement of present things ?
It is not at all surprising that there might be constraints on the data which can be put on a locally space - like surface which passes through the time travel region : after all , we never think we can freely specify what happens on a space - like surface and on another such surface to its future , but in this case the surface at issue lies to its own future .
But if there were particular constraints for data on a partial Cauchy surface then we would apparently need to have to rule out some sorts of otherwise acceptable states on S if there is to be time travel to the future of S .
We then might be able to establish that there will be no time travel in the future by simple inspection of the present state of the universe .
As we will see , there is reason to suspect that such constraints on the partial Cauchy surface are non-generic .
But we are getting ahead of ourselves : first let 's consider the effect of time travel on a very simple dynamics .
The simplest possible example is the Newtonian theory of perfectly elastic collisions among equally massive particles in one spatial dimension .
The space - time is two - dimensional , so we can represent it initially as the Euclidean plane , and the dynamics is completely specified by two conditions .
When particles are traveling freely , their world lines are straight lines in the space - time , and when two particles collide , they exchange momenta , so the collision looks like an ‘ X ’ in space - time , with each particle changing its momentum at the impact .
[ 1]
The dynamics is purely local , in that one can check that a set of world - lines constitutes a model of the dynamics by checking that the dynamics is obeyed in every arbitrarily small region .
It is also trivial to generate solutions from arbitrary initial data if there are no CTCs : given the initial positions and momenta of a set of particles , one simply draws a straight line from each particle in the appropriate direction and continues it indefinitely .
Once all the lines are drawn , the worldline of each particle can be traced from collision to collision .
The boundary value problem for this dynamics is obviously well - posed : any set of data at an instant yields a unique global solution , constructed by the method sketched above .
What happens if we change the topology of the space - time by hand to produce CTCs ?
The simplest way to do this is depicted in figure 3 : we cut and paste the space - time so it is no longer simply connected by identifying the line L− with the line L+. Particles “ going in ” to L+ from below “ emerge ” from L− , and particles “ going in ” to L− from below “ emerge ” from L+.
Figure 3 : Inserting CTCs by Cut and Paste
How is the boundary - value problem changed by this alteration in the space - time ?
Before the cut and paste , we can put arbitrary data on the simultaneity slice S and continue it to a unique solution .
After the change in topology , S is no longer a Cauchy surface , since a CTC will never intersect it , but it is a partial Cauchy surface .
So we can ask two questions .
First , can arbitrary data on S always be continued to a global solution ?
Second , is that solution unique ?
If the answer to the first question is no , then we have a backward - temporal constraint : the existence of the region with CTCs places constraints on what can happen on S even though that region lies completely to the future of S .
If the answer to the second question is no , then we have an odd sort of indeterminism : the complete physical state on S does not determine the physical state in the future , even though the local dynamics is perfectly deterministic and even though there is no other past edge to the space - time region in S 's future ( i.e. , there is nowhere else for boundary values to come from which could influence the state of the region ) .
In this case the answer to the first question is yes and to the second is no : there are no constraints on the data which can be put on S , but those data are always consistent with an infinitude of different global solutions .
The easy way to see that there always is a solution is to construct the minimal solution in the following way .
Start drawing straight lines from S as required by the initial data .
If a line hits L− from the bottom , just continue it coming out of the top of L+ in the appropriate place , and if a line hits L+ from the bottom , continue it emerging from L− at the appropriate place .
Figure 4 represents the minimal solution for a single particle which enters the time - travel region from the left :
Figure 4 : The Minimal Solution
The particle ‘ travels back in time ’ three times .
It is obvious that this minimal solution is a global solution , since the particle always travels inertially .
But the same initial state on S is also consistent with other global solutions .
The new requirement imposed by the topology is just that the data going into L+ from the bottom match the data coming out of L− from the top , and the data going into L- from the bottom match the data coming out of L+ from the top .
So we can add any number of vertical lines connecting L- and L+ to a solution and still have a solution .
For example , adding a few such lines to the minimal solution yields :
Figure 5 : A Non-Minimal Solution
The particle now collides with itself twice : first before it reaches L+ for the first time , and again shortly before it exits the CTC region .
From the particle 's point of view , it is traveling to the right at a constant speed until it hits an older version of itself and comes to rest .
It remains at rest until it is hit from the right by a younger version of itself , and then continues moving off , and the same process repeats later .
It is clear that this is a global model of the dynamics , and that any number of distinct models could be generating by varying the number and placement of vertical lines .
Knowing the data on S , then , gives us only incomplete information about how things will go for the particle .
We know that the particle will enter the CTC region , and will reach L+ , we know that it will be the only particle in the universe , we know exactly where and with what speed it will exit the CTC region .
But we cannot determine how many collisions the particle will undergo ( if any ) , nor how long ( in proper time ) it will stay in the CTC region .
If the particle were a clock , we could not predict what time it would indicate when exiting the region .
Furthermore , the dynamics gives us no handle on what to think of the various possibilities : there are no probabilities assigned to the various distinct possible outcomes .
Changing the topology has changed the mathematics of the situation in two ways , which tend to pull in opposite directions .
On the one hand , S is no longer a Cauchy surface , so it is perhaps not surprising that data on S do not suffice to fix a unique global solution .
But on the other hand , there is an added constraint : data “ coming out ” of L− must exactly match data “ going in ” to L+ , even though what comes out of L− helps to determine what goes into L+.
This added consistency constraint tends to cut down on solutions , although in this case the additional constraint is more than outweighed by the freedom to consider various sorts of data on L+/L- .
The fact that the extra freedom outweighs the extra constraint also points up one unexpected way that the supposed paradoxes of time travel may be overcome .
Let 's try to set up a paradoxical situation using the little closed time loop above .
If we send a single particle into the loop from the left and do nothing else , we know exactly where it will exit the right side of the time travel region .
Now suppose we station someone at the other side of the region with the following charge : if the particle should come out on the right side , the person is to do something to prevent the particle from going in on the left in the first place .
In fact , this is quite easy to do : if we send a particle in from the right , it seems that it can exit on the left and deflect the incoming left - hand particle .
Carrying on our reflection in this way , we further realize that if the particle comes out on the right , we might as well send it back in order to deflect itself from entering in the first place .
So all we really need to do is the following : set up a perfectly reflecting particle mirror on the right - hand side of the time travel region , and launch the particle from the left so that — if nothing interferes with it — it will just barely hit L+.
Our paradox is now apparently complete .
If , on the one hand , nothing interferes with the particle it will enter the time - travel region on the left , exit on the right , be reflected from the mirror , re-enter from the right , and come out on the left to prevent itself from ever entering .
So if it enters , it gets deflected and never enters .
On the other hand , if it never enters then nothing goes in on the left , so nothing comes out on the right , so nothing is reflected back , and there is nothing to deflect it from entering .
So if it does n't enter , then there is nothing to deflect it and it enters .
If it enters , then it is deflected and does n't enter ; if it does n't enter then there is nothing to deflect it and it enters : paradox complete .
But at least one solution to the supposed paradox is easy to construct : just follow the recipe for constructing the minimal solution , continuing the initial trajectory of the particle ( reflecting it the mirror in the obvious way ) and then read of the number and trajectories of the particles from the resulting diagram .
We get the result of figure 6 :
Figure 6 : Resolving the “ Paradox ”
As we can see , the particle approaching from the left never reaches L+ : it is deflected first by a particle which emerges from L- .
But it is not deflected by itself , as the paradox suggests , it is deflected by another particle .
Indeed , there are now four particles in the diagram : the original particle and three particles which are confined to closed time - like curves .
It is not the leftmost particle which is reflected by the mirror , nor even the particle which deflects the leftmost particle ; it is another particle altogether .
The paradox gets it traction from an incorrect presupposition : if there is only one particle in the world at S then there is only one particle which could participate in an interaction in the time travel region : the single particle would have to interact with its earlier ( or later ) self .
But there is no telling what might come out of L− : the only requirement is that whatever comes out must match what goes in at L+.
So if you go to the trouble of constructing a working time machine , you should be prepared for a different kind of disappointment when you attempt to go back and kill yourself : you may be prevented from entering the machine in the first place by some completely unpredictable entity which emerges from it .
And once again a peculiar sort of indeterminism appears : if there are many self - consistent things which could prevent you from entering , there is no telling which is even likely to materialize .
So when the freedom to put data on L− outweighs the constraint that the same data go into L+ , instead of paradox we get an embarrassment of riches : many solution consistent with the data on S .
To see a case where the constraint “ outweighs ” the freedom , we need to construct a very particular , and frankly artificial , dynamics and topology .
Consider the space of all linear dynamics for a scalar field on a lattice .
( The lattice can be though of as a simple discrete space - time . )
We will depict the space - time lattice as a directed graph .
There is to be a scalar field defined at every node of the graph , whose value at a given node depends linearly on the values of the field at nodes which have arrows which lead to it .
Each edge of the graph can be assigned a weighting factor which determines how much the field at the input node contributes to the field at the output node .
If we name the nodes by the letters a , b , c , etc. , and the edges by their endpoints in the obvious way , then we can label the weighting factors by the edges they are associated with in an equally obvious way .
Suppose that the graph of the space - time lattice is acyclic , as in figure 7 .
( A graph is Acyclic if one can not travel in the direction of the arrows and go in a loop . )
Figure 7 : An Acyclic Lattice
It is easy to regard a set of nodes as the analog of a Cauchy surface , e.g. , the set {a , b , c} , and it is obvious if arbitrary data are put on those nodes the data will generate a unique solution in the future .
[ 2 ]
If the value of the field at node a is 3 and at node b is 7 , then its value at node d will be 3W ad and its value at node e will be 3W ae + 7W be .
By varying the weighting factors we can adjust the dynamics , but in an acyclic graph the future evolution of the field will always be unique .
Let us now again artificially alter the topology of the lattice to admit CTCs , so that the graph now is cyclic .
One of the simplest such graphs is depicted in figure 8 : there are now paths which lead from z back to itself , e.g. , z to y to z .
Figure 8 : Time Travel on a Lattice
Can we now put arbitrary data on v and w , and continue that data to a global solution ?
Will the solution be unique ?
In the generic case , there will be a solution and the solution will be unique .
The equations for the value of the field at x , y , and z are :
x = vW vx + zW zx
y = wW wy + zW zy
z = xW xz + yW yz .
Solving these equations for z yields
z = ( vW vx + zW zx ) W xz + ( wW wy + zW zy ) W yz ,
or z = ( vW vx W xz + wW wy W yz ) / ( 1 − W zx W xz − W zy W yz ) ,
which gives a unique value for z in the generic case .
But looking at the space of all possible dynamics for this lattice ( i.e. , the space of all possible weighting factors ) , we find a singularity in the case where 1 − W zx W xz − W zy W yz = 0 .
If we choose weighting factors in just this way , then arbitrary data at v and w cannot be continued to a global solution .
Indeed , if the scalar field is everywhere non-negative , then this particular choice of dynamics puts ironclad constraints on the value of the field at v and w : the field there must be zero ( assuming W vx and W wy to be non-zero ) , and similarly all nodes in their past must have field value zero .
If the field can take negative values , then the values at v and w must be so chosen that vW vx W xz = −wW wy W yz .
In either case , the field values at v and w are severely constrained by the existence of the CTC region even though these nodes lie completely to the past of that region .
It is this sort of constraint which we find to be unlike anything which appears in standard physics .
Our toy models suggest three things .
The first is that it may be impossible to prove in complete generality that arbitrary data on a partial Cauchy surface can always be continued to a global solution : our artificial case provides an example where it cannot .
The second is that such odd constraints are not likely to be generic : we had to delicately fine - tune the dynamics to get a problem .
The third is that the opposite problem , namely data on a partial Cauchy surface being consistent with many different global solutions , is likely to be generic : we did not have to do any fine - tuning to get this result .
And this leads to a peculiar sort of indeterminism : the entire state on S does not determine what will happen in the future even though the local dynamics is deterministic and there are no other “ edges ” to space - time from which data could influence the result .
What happens in the time travel region is constrained but not determined by what happens on S , and the dynamics does not even supply any probabilities for the various possibilities .
The example of the photographic negative discussed in section 3 , then , seems likely to be unusual , for in that case there is a unique fixed point for the dynamics , and the set - up plus the dynamical laws determine the outcome .
In the generic case one would rather expect multiple fixed points , with no room for anything to influence , even probabilistically , which would be realized .
It is ironic that time travel should lead generically not to contradictions or to constraints ( in the normal region ) but to underdetermination of what happens in the time travel region by what happens everywhere else ( an underdetermination tied neither to a probabilistic dynamics or to a free edge to space - time ) .
The traditional objection to time travel is that it leads to contradictions : there is no consistent way to complete an arbitrarily constructed story about how the time traveler intends to act .
Instead , though , it appears that the problem is underdetermination : the story can be consistently completed in many different ways .
The two toys models presented above have the virtue of being mathematically tractable , but they involve certain simplifications and potential problems that lead to trouble if one tries to make them more complicated .
Working through these difficulties will help highlight the conditions we have made use of .
Consider a slight modification of the first simple model proposed to us by Adam Elga .
Let the particles have an electric charge , which produces forces according to Coulomb ’s law .
Then set up a situation like that depicted in figure 9 :
Figure 9 : Set - up for Elga's Paradox
The dotted line indicates the path the particle will follow if no forces act upon it .
The point labeled P is the left edge of the time - travel region ; the two labels are a reminder that the point at the bottom and the point at the top are one and the same .
Elga 's paradox is as follows : if no force acts on the particle , then it will enter the time - travel region .
But if it enters the time travel region , and hence reappears along the bottom edge , then its later self will interact electrically with its earlier self , and the earlier self will be deflected away from the time - travel region .
It is easy to set up the case so that the deflection will be enough to keep the particle from ever entering the time - travel region in the first place .
( For instance , let the momentum of the incoming particle towards the time travel region be very small .
The mere existence of an identically charged particle inside the time travel region will then be sufficient to deflect the incoming particle so that it never reaches L + .)
But , of course , if the particle never enters the region at all , then it will not be there to deflect itself … .
One might suspect that some complicated collection of charged particles in the time - travel - region can save the day , as it did with our mirror - reflection problem above .
But ( unless there are infinitely many such particles ) this can't work , as conservation of particle number and linear momentum show .
Suppose that some finite collection of particles emerges from L - and supplies the repulsive electric force needed to deflect the incoming particle .
Then exactly the same collection of particles must be “ absorbed ” at L + .
So at all times after L + , the only particle there is in the world is the incoming particle , which has now been deflected away from its original trajectory .
The deflection , though , means that the linear momentum of the particle has changed from what is was before L - .
But that is impossible , by conservation of linear momementum .
No matter how the incoming particle interacts with particles in the time - travel region , or how those particle interact with each other , total linear momentum is conserved by the interaction .
And whatever net linear momentum the time - travelling particles have when they emerge from L - , that much linear momentum most be absorbed at L + .
So the momentum of the incoming particle can't be changed by the interaction : the particle can't have been deflected .
( One could imagine trying to create a sort of “ S ” curve in the trajectory of the incoming particle , first bending to the left and then to the right , which leaves its final momentum equal to its initial momentum , but moving it over in space so it misses L + .
However , if the force at issue is repulsive , then the bending back to the right can't be done .
In the mirror example above , the path of the incoming particle can be changed without violating the conservation of momentum because at the end of the process momentum has been transferred to the mirror . )
How does Elga 's example escape our analysis ?
Why ca n't a contintuity principle guarantee the existence of a solution here ?
The continuity assumption breaks down because of two features of the example : the concentration of the electric charge on a point particle , and the way we have treated ( or , more accurately , failed to treat ) the point P , the edge of L + ( and L - ) .
We have assumed that a point particle either hits L + , and then emerges from L - , or else it misses L + and sails on into the region of space - time above it .
This means that the charge on the incoming particle only has two possibilities : either it is transported whole back in time or it completely avoids time travel altogether .
Let 's see how it alters the situation to imagine the charge itself to be continuous divisible .
Suppose that , instead of being concentrated at a point , the incoming object is a little stick , with electric charge distributed even across it ( figure 10 ) .
Figure 10 : Elga's Paradox with a Charged Bar
Once again , we set things up so that if there are no forces on the bar , it will be completely absorbed at L + .
But we now postulate that if the bar should hit the point P , it will fracture : part of it ( the part that hits L+ ) will be sent back in time and the rest will continue on above L + .
So continuity of a sort is restored : now we have not just the possibility of the whole charge being sent back or nothing , we have the continuum degrees of charge in between .
It is not hard to see that the restoration of continuity restores the existence of a consistent solution .
If no charge is sent back through time , then the bar is not deflected and all of it hits L + ( and hence is sent back through time ) .
If all the charge is sent back through time , then is incoming bar is deflected to an extent that it misses L + completely , and so no charge is sent back .
But if just the right amount of charge is sent back through time , then the bar will be only partially deflected , deflected so that it hits the edge point P , and is split into a bit that goes back and a bit that does not , with the bit that goes back being just the right amount of charge to produce just that deflection ( figure 11 ) .
Figure 11 : Solution to Elga 's Paradox with a Charged Bar
Our problem about conservation of momentum is also solved : piece of the bar that does not time travel has lower momentum to the right at the end than it had initially , but the piece that does time travel has a higher momentum ( due to the Coulomb forces ) , and everything balances out .
Is it cheating to model the charged particle as a bar that can fracture ?
What if we insist that the particle is truly a point particle , and hence that its time travel is an all - or - nothing affair ?
In that case , we now have to worry about a question we have not yet confronted : what happens if our point particle hits exactly at the point P on the diagram ?
Does it time - travel or not ?
Confronting this question requires us to face up to a feature of the rather cheap way we implemented time travel in our toy models by cut - and - paste .
The way we rejiggered the space - time structure had a rather severe consequence : the resulting space - time is no longer a manifold : the topological structure at the point P is different from the topological structure elsewhere .
Mathematical physicists simply do n't deal with such structures : the usual procedure is to eliminate the offending point from the space - time and thus restore the manifold structure .
In this case , that would leave a bare singularity at point P , an open edge to space - time into which anything could disappear and out of which , for all the physics tells us , anything could emerge .
In particular , if we insist that our particle is a point particle , then if its trajectory should happen to intersect P it will simply disappear .
What could cause the extremely fortuitous result that the trajectory strikes precisely at P ?
The emergence of some other charged particle , with just the right charge and trajectory , from P ( on L - ) .
And we are no longer bound by any conservation laws : the bare singularity can both swallow and produce whatever mass or change or momentum we like .
So if we insist on point particles , then we have to take account of the singularity , and that again saves the day .
Consideration of these ( slightly more complicated ) toy models does not replace the proving of theorems , of course .
But they do serve to illustrate the sorts of consideration that necessarily come into play when trying to spell out the physics of time travel in all detail .
Let us now discuss some results regarding some slightly more realistic models that have been discussed in the physics literature .
Echeverria , Klinkhammer and Thorne ( 1991 ) considered the case of 3 - dimensional single hard spherical ball that can go through a single time travel wormhole so as to collide with its younger self .
Figure 12
The threat of paradox in this case arises in the following form .
There are initial trajectories ( starting in the non- time travel region of space - time ) for the ball such that if such a trajectory is continued ( into the time travel region ) , assuming that the ball does not undergo a collision prior to entering mouth 1 of the wormhole , it will exit mouth 2 so as to collide with its earlier self prior to its entry into mouth 1 in such a way as to prevent its earlier self from entering mouth 1 .
Thus it seems that the ball will enter mouth 1 if and only if it does not enter mouth 1 .
Of course , the Wheeler - Feynman strategy is to look for a ‘ glancing blow ’ solution : a collision which will produce exactly the ( small ) deviation in trajectory of the earlier ball that produces exactly that collision .
Are there always such solutions ? [ 3 ]
Echeverria , Klinkhammer & Thorne found a large class of initial trajectories that have consistent ‘ glancing blow ’ continuations , and found none that do not ( but their search was not completely general ) .
They did not produce a rigorous proof that every initial trajectory has a consistent continuation , but suggested that it is very plausible that every initial trajectory has a consistent continuation .
That is to say , they have made it very plausible that , in the billiard ball wormhole case , the time travel structure of such a wormhole space - time does not result in constraints on states on spacelike surfaces in the non-time travel region .
In fact , as one might expect from our discussion in the previous section , they found the opposite problem from that of inconsistency : they found underdetermination .
For a large class of initial trajectories there are multiple different consistent ‘ glancing blow ’ continuations of that trajectory ( many of which involve multiple wormhole traversals ) .
For example , if one initially has a ball that is traveling on a trajectory aimed straight between the two mouths , then one obvious solution is that the ball passes between the two mouths and never time travels .
But another solution is that the younger ball gets knocked into mouth 1 exactly so as to come out of mouth 2 and produce that collision .
Echeverria et al. do not note the possibility ( which we pointed out in the previous section ) of the existence of additional balls in the time travel region .
We conjecture ( but have no proof ) that for every initial trajectory of A there are some , and generically many , multiple ball continuations .
Friedman et al. 1990 examined the case of source free non-self - interacting scalar fields traveling through such a time travel wormhole and found that no constraints on initial conditions in the non-time travel region are imposed by the existence of such time travel wormholes .
In general there appear to be no known counter examples to the claim that in ‘ somewhat realistic ’ time - travel space - times with a partial Cauchy surface there are no constraints imposed on the state on such a partial Cauchy surface by the existence of CTC's .
( See e.g. , Friedman and Morris 1991 , Thorne 1994 , and Earman 1995 ; in the Other Internet Resources , see Earman , Smeenk , and Wüthrich 2003 . )
How about the issue of constraints in the time travel region T? Prima facie , constraints in such a region would not appear to be surprising .
But one might still expect that there should be no constraints on states on a spacelike surface , provided one keeps the surface ‘ small enough ’ .
In the physics literature the following question has been asked : for any point p in T , and any space - like surface S that includes p is there a neighborhood E of p in S such that any solution on E can be extended to a solution on the whole space - time ?
With respect to this question , there are some simple models in which one has this kind of extendibility of local solutions to global ones , and some simple models in which one does not have such extendibility , with no clear general pattern .
The technical mathematical problems are amplified by the more conceptual problem of what it might mean to say that one could create a situation which forces the creation of closed timelike curves .
( See e.g . Yurtsever 1990 , Friedman et al .
1990 , Novikov 1992 , Earman 1995 and Earman , Smeenk and Wüthrich 2009 ; in the Other Internet Resources , see Earman , Smeenk and Wüthrich 2003 ) .
What are we to think of all of this ?
Since it is not obvious that one can rid oneself of all constraints in realistic models , let us examine the argument that time travel is implausible , and we should think it unlikely to exist in our world , in so far as it implies such constraints .
The argument goes something like the following .
In order to satisfy such constraints one needs some pre-established divine harmony between the global ( time travel ) structure of space - time and the distribution of particles and fields on space - like surfaces in it .
But it is not plausible that the actual world , or any world even remotely like ours , is constructed with divine harmony as part of the plan .
In fact , one might argue , we have empirical evidence that conditions in any spatial region can vary quite arbitrarily .
So we have evidence that such constraints , whatever they are , do not in fact exist in our world .
So we have evidence that there are no closed time - like lines in our world or one remotely like it .
We will now examine this argument in more detail by presenting four possible responses , with counterresponses , to this argument .
Response 1 .
There is nothing implausible or new about such constraints .
For instance , if the universe is spatially closed , there has to be enough matter to produce the needed curvature , and this puts constraints on the matter distribution on a space - like hypersurface .
Thus global space - time structure can quite unproblematically constrain matter distributions on space - like hypersurfaces in it .
Moreover we have no realistic idea what these constraints look like , so we hardly can be said to have evidence that they do not obtain .
Counterresponse 1 .
Of course there are constraining relations between the global structure of space - time and the matter in it .
The Einstein equations relate curvature of the manifold to the matter distribution in it .
But what is so strange and implausible about the constraints imposed by the existence of closed time - like curves is that these constraints in essence have nothing to do with the Einstein equations .
When investigating such constraints one typically treats the particles and / or field in question as test particles and / or fields in a given space - time , i.e. , they are assumed not to affect the metric of space - time in any way .
In typical space - times without closed time - like curves this means that one has , in essence , complete freedom of matter distribution on a space - like hypersurface .
( See response 2 for some more discussion of this issue ) .
The constraints imposed by the possibility of time travel have a quite different origin and are implausible .
In the ordinary case there is a causal interaction between matter and space - time that results in relations between global structure of space - time and the matter distribution in it .
In the time travel case there is no such causal story to be told : there simply has to be some pre-established harmony between the global space - time structure and the matter distribution on some space - like surfaces .
This is implausible .
Response 2 . Constraints upon matter distributions are nothing new .
For instance , Maxwell 's equations constrain electric fields E on an initial surface to be related to the ( simultaneous ) charge density distribution ρ by the equation ρ = div( E ) .
( If we assume that the E field is generated solely by the charge distribution , this conditions amounts to requiring that the E field at any point in space simply be the one generated by the charge distribution according to Coulomb 's inverse square law of electrostatics . )
This is not implausible divine harmony .
Such constraints can hold as a matter of physical law .
Moreover , if we had inferred from the apparent free variation of conditions on spatial regions that there could be no such constraints we would have mistakenly inferred that ρ = div( E ) could not be a law of nature .
Counterresponse 2 .
The constraints imposed by the existence of closed time - like lines are of quite a different character from the constraint imposed by ρ = div( E ) .
The constraints imposed by ρ = div( E ) on the state on a space - like hypersurface are : ( i ) local constraints ( i.e. , to check whether the constraint holds in a region you just need to see whether it holds at each point in the region ) , ( ii ) quite independent of the global space - time structure , ( iii ) quite independent of how the space - like surface in question is embedded in a given space - time , and ( iv ) very simply and generally stateable .
On the other hand , the consistency constraints imposed by the existence of closed time - like curves ( i ) are not local , ( ii ) are dependent on the global structure of space - time , ( iii ) depend on the location of the space - like surface in question in a given space - time , and ( iv ) appear not to be simply stateable other than as the demand that the state on that space - like surface embedded in such and such a way in a given space - time , do not lead to inconsistency .
On some views of laws ( e.g. , David Lewis ' view ) this plausibly implies that such constraints , even if they hold , could not possibly be laws .
But even if one does not accept such a view of laws , one could claim that the bizarre features of such constraints imply that it is implausible that such constraints hold in our world or in any world remotely like ours .
Response 3 .
It would be strange if there are constraints in the non -time travel region .
It is not strange if there are constraints in the time travel region .
They should be explained in terms of the strange , self - interactive , character of time travel regions .
In this region there are time - like trajectories from points to themselves .
Thus the state at such a point , in such a region , will , in a sense , interact with itself .
It is a well - known fact that systems that interact with themselves will develop into an equilibrium state , if there is such an equilibrium state , or else will develop towards some singularity .
Normally , of course , self - interaction is n't true instantaneous self - interaction , but consists of a feed - back mechanism that takes time .
But in time travel regions something like true instantaneous self - interaction occurs .
This explains why constraints on states occur in such time travel regions : the states ‘ ab initio ’ have to be ‘ equilibrium states ’ .
Indeed in a way this also provides some picture of why indeterminism occurs in time travel regions : at the onset of self - interaction states can fork into different equi-possible equilibrium states .
Counterresponse 3 . This is explanation by woolly analogy .
It all goes to show that time travel leads to such bizarre consequences that it is unlikely that it occurs in a world remotely like ours .
Response 4 .
All of the previous discussion completely misses the point .
So far we have been taking the space - time structure as given , and asked the question whether a given time travel space - time structure imposes constraints on states on ( parts of ) space - like surfaces .
However , space - time and matter interact .
Suppose that one is in a space - time with closed time - like lines , such that certain counterfactual distributions of matter on some neighborhood of a point p are ruled out if one holds that space - time structure fixed .
One might then ask “ Why does the actual state near p in fact satisfy these constraints ?
By what divine luck or plan is this local state compatible with the global space - time structure ?
What if conditions near p had been slightly different ? ”
And one might take it that the lack of normal answers to these questions indicates that it is very implausible that our world , or any remotely like it , is such a time travel universe .
However the proper response to these question is the following .
There are no constraints in any significant sense .
If they hold they hold as a matter of accidental fact , not of law .
There is no more explanation of them possible than there is of any contingent fact .
Had conditions in a neighborhood of p been otherwise , the global structure of space - time would have been different .
So what ?
The only question relevant to the issue of constraints is whether an arbitrary state on an arbitrary spatial surface S can always be embedded into a space - time such that that state on S consistently extends to a solution on the entire space - time .
But we know the answer to that question .
A well - known theorem in general relativity says the following : any initial data set on a three dimensional manifold S with positive definite metric has a unique embedding into a maximal space - time in which S is a Cauchy surface ( see e.g. , Geroch and Horowitz 1979 , p. 284 for more detail ) , i.e. , there is a unique largest space - time which has S as a Cauchy surface and contains a consistent evolution of the initial value data on S .
Now since S is a Cauchy surface this space - time does not have closed time like curves .
But it may have extensions ( in which S is not a Cauchy surface ) which include closed timelike curves , indeed it may be that any maximal extension of it would include closed timelike curves .
( This appears to be the case for extensions of states on certain surfaces of Taub - NUT space - times .
See Earman , Smeenk , and Wüthrich 2003 in the Other Internet Resources ) .
But these extensions , of course , will be consistent .
So properly speaking , there are no constraints on states on space - like surfaces .
Nonetheless the space - time in which these are embedded may or may not include closed time - like curves .
Counterresponse 4 . This , in essence , is the stonewalling answer which we indicated at the beginning of section 2 .
However , whether or not you call the constraints imposed by a given space - time on distributions of matter on certain space - like surfaces ‘ genuine constraints ’ , whether or not they can be considered lawlike , and whether or not they need to be explained , the existence of such constraints can still be used to argue that time travel worlds are so bizarre that it is implausible that our world or any world remotely like ours is a time travel world .
Suppose that one is in a time travel world .
Suppose that given the global space - time structure of this world , there are constraints imposed upon , say , the state of motion of a ball on some space - like surface when it is treated as a test particle , i.e. , when it is assumed that the ball does not affect the metric properties of the space - time it is in .
( There is lots of other matter that , via the Einstein equation , corresponds exactly to the curvature that there is everywhere in this time travel worlds . )
Now a real ball of course does have some effect on the metric of the space - time it is in .
But let us consider a ball that is so small that its effect on the metric is negligible .
Presumably it will still be the case that certain states of this ball on that space - like surface are not compatible with the global time travel structure of this universe .
This means that the actual distribution of matter on such a space - like surface can be extended into a space - time with closed time - like lines , but that certain counterfactual distributions of matter on this space - like surface can not be extended into the same space - time .
But note that the changes made in the matter distribution ( when going from the actual to the counterfactual distribution ) do not in any non-negligible way affect the metric properties of the space - time .
Thus the reason why the global time travel properties of the counterfactual space - time have to be significantly different from the actual space - time is not that there are problems with metric singularities or alterations in the metric that force significant global changes when we go to the counterfactual matter distribution .
The reason that the counterfactual space - time has to be different is that in the counterfactual world the ball 's initial state of motion starting on the space - like surface , could not ‘ meet up ’ in a consistent way with its earlier self ( could not be consistently extended ) if we were to let the global structure of the counterfactual space - time be the same as that of the actual space - time .
Now , it is not bizarre or implausible that there is a counterfactual dependence of manifold structure , even of its topology , on matter distributions on spacelike surfaces .
For instance , certain matter distributions may lead to singularities , others may not .
We may indeed in some sense have causal power over the topology of the space - time we live in .
But this power normally comes via the Einstein equations .
But it is bizarre to think that there could be a counterfactual dependence of global space - time structure on the arrangement of certain tiny bits of matter on some space - like surface , where changes in that arrangement by assumption do not affect the metric anywhere in space - time in any significant way .
It is implausible that we live in such a world , or that a world even remotely like ours is like that .
Let us illustrate this argument in a different way by assuming that wormhole time travel imposes constraints upon the states of people prior to such time travel , where the people have so little mass / energy that they have negligible effect , via the Einstein equation , on the local metric properties of space - time .
Do you think it more plausible that we live in a world where wormhole time travel occurs but it only occurs when people 's states are such that these local states happen to combine with time travel in such a way that nobody ever succeeds in killing their younger self , or do you think it more plausible that we are not in a wormhole time travel world ? [ 4 ]
There has been a particularly clear treatment of time travel in the context of quantum mechanics by David Deutsch ( see Deutsch 1991 , and Deutsch and Lockwood 1994 ) in which it is claimed that quantum mechanical considerations show that time travel never imposes any constraints on the pre-time travel state of systems .
The essence of this account is as follows .
A quantum system starts in state S1 , interacts with its older self , after the interaction is in state S 2 , time travels while developing into state S 3 , then interacts with its younger self , and ends in state S 4 ( see figure 13 ) .
Figure 13
Deutsch assumes that the set of possible states of this system are the mixed states , i.e. , are represented by the density matrices over the Hilbert space of that system .
Deutsch then shows that for any initial state S 1 , any unitary interaction between the older and younger self , and any unitary development during time travel , there is a consistent solution , i.e. , there is at least one pair of states S 2 and S 3 such that when S 1 interacts with S 3 it will change to state S 2 and S 2 will then develop into S 3 .
The states S 2 , S 3 and S 4 will typically be not be pure states , i.e. , will be non-trivial mixed states , even if S 1 is pure .
In order to understand how this leads to interpretational problems let us give an example .
Consider a system that has a two dimensional Hilbert space with as a basis the states and .
Let us suppose that when state of the young system encounters state of the older system , they interact and the young system develops into state and the old system remains in state .
In obvious notation :
1 3 develops into 2 4 .
Similarly , suppose that :
1 3 develops into 2 4 , 1 3 develops into 2 4 , and 1 3 develops into 2 4 .
Let us furthermore assume that there is no development of the state of the system during time travel , i.e. , that 2 develops into 3 , and that 2 develops into 3 .
Now , if the only possible states of the system were and ( i.e. , if there were no superpositions or mixtures of these states ) , then there is a constraint on initial states : initial state 1 is impossible .
For if 1 interacts with 3 then it will develop into 2 , which , during time travel , will develop into 3 , which inconsistent with the assumed state 3 .
Similarly if 1 interacts with 3 it will develop into 2 , which will then develop into 3 which is also inconsistent .
Thus the system can not start in state 1 .
But , says Deutsch , in quantum mechanics such a system can also be in any mixture of the states and .
Suppose that the older system , prior to the interaction , is in a state S 3 which is an equal mixture of 50 % 3 and 50 % 3 .
Then the younger system during the interaction will develop into a mixture of 50 % 2 and 50 % 2 , which will then develop into a mixture of 50 % 3 and 50 % 3 , which is consistent !
More generally Deutsch uses a fixed point theorem to show that no matter what the unitary development during interaction is , and no matter what the unitary development during time travel is , for any state S 1 there is always a state S 3 ( which typically is not a pure state ) which causes S 1 to develop into a state S 2 which develops into that state S 3 .
Thus quantum mechanics comes to the rescue : it shows in all generality that no constraints on initial states are needed !
One might wonder why Deutsch appeals to mixed states : will superpositions of states and not suffice ?
Unfortunately such an idea does not work .
Suppose again that the initial state is 1 .
One might suggest that that if state S 3 is 1/√2 3 + 1/√2 3 one will obtain a consistent development .
For one might think that when initial state 1 encounters the superposition 1/√2 3 + 1/√2 3 , it will develop into superposition 1/√2 2 + 1/√2 2 , and that this in turn will develop into 1/√2 3 + 1/√2 3 , as desired .
However this is not correct .
For initial state 1 when it encounters 1/√2 3 + 1/√2 3 , will develop into the entangled state 1/√2 2 4 + 1/√2 2 4 .
In so far as one can speak of the state of the young system after this interaction , it is in the mixture of 50 % 2 and 50 % 2 , not in the superposition 1/√2 2 + 1/√2 2 .
So Deutsch does need his recourse to mixed states .
This clarification of why Deutsch needs his mixtures does however indicate a serious worry about the simplifications that are part of Deutsch 's account .
After the interaction the old and young system will ( typically ) be in an entangled state .
Although for purposes of a measurement on one of the two systems one can say that this system is in a mixed state , one can not represent the full state of the two systems by specifying the mixed state of each separate part , as there are correlations between observables of the two systems that are not represented by these two mixed states , but are represented in the joint entangled state .
But if there really is an entangled state of the old and young systems directly after the interaction , how is one to represent the subsequent development of this entangled state ?
Will the state of the younger system remain entangled with the state of the older system as the younger system time travels and the older system moves on into the future ?
On what space - like surfaces are we to imagine this total entangled state to be ?
At this point it becomes clear that there is no obvious and simple way to extend elementary non-relativistic quantum mechanics to space - times with closed time - like curves .
There have been more sophisticated approaches than Deutsch's to time travel , using technical machinery from quantum field theory and differentiable manifolds ( see e.g. , Friedman et al 1991 , Earman , Smeenk , and Wüthrich 2003 in the Other Internet Resources , and references therein ) .
But out of such approaches no results anywhere near as clear and interesting as Deutsch 's have been forthcoming .
How does Deutsch avoid these complications ?
Deutsch assumes a mixed state S 3 of the older system prior to the interaction with the younger system .
He lets it interact with an arbitrary pure state S 1 younger system .
After this interaction there is an entangled state S′ of the two systems .
Deutsch computes the mixed state S 2 of the younger system which is implied by this entangled state S′ .
His demand for consistency then is just that this mixed state S 2 develops into the mixed state S 3 .
Now it is not at all clear that this is a legitimate way to simplify the problem of time travel in quantum mechanics .
But even if we grant him this simplification there is a problem : how are we to understand these mixtures ?
If we take an ignorance interpretation of mixtures we run into trouble .
For suppose that we assume that in each individual case each older system is either in state 3 or in state 3 prior to the interaction .
Then we regain our paradox .
Deutsch instead recommends the following , many worlds , picture of mixtures .
Suppose we start with state 1 in all worlds .
In some of the many worlds the older system will be in the 3 state , let us call them A - worlds , and in some worlds , B - worlds , it will be in the 3 state .
Thus in A - worlds after interaction we will have state 2 , and in B - worlds we will have state 2 .
During time travel the 2 state will remain the same , i.e. , turn into state 3 , but the systems in question will travel from A - worlds to B - worlds .
Similarly the 2 states will travel from the B - worlds to the A - worlds , thus preserving consistency .
Now whatever one thinks of the merits of many worlds interpretations , and of this understanding of it applied to mixtures , in the end one does not obtain genuine time travel in Deutsch 's account .
The systems in question travel from one time in one world to another time in another world , but no system travels to an earlier time in the same world .
( This is so at least in the normal sense of the word ‘ world , ’ the sense that one means when , for instance , one says “ there was , and will be , only one Elvis Presley in this world . ” )
Thus , even if it were a reasonable view , it is not quite as interesting as it may have initially seemed .
What remains of the killing - your - earlier - self paradox in general relativistic time travel worlds is the fact that in some cases the states on edgeless spacelike surfaces are ‘ overconstrained ’ , so that one has less than the usual freedom in specifying conditions on such a surface , given the time - travel structure , and in some cases such states are ‘ underconstrained ’ , so that states on edgeless space - like surfaces do not determine what happens elsewhere in the way that they usually do , given the time travel structure .
There can also be mixtures of those two types of cases .
The extent to which states are overconstrained and / or underconstrained in realistic models is as yet unclear , though it would be very surprising if neither obtained .
The extant literature has primarily focused on the problem of overconstraint , since that , often , either is regarded as a metaphysical obstacle to the possibility time travel , or as an epistemological obstacle to the plausibility of time travel in our world .
While it is true that our world would be quite different from the way we normally think it is if states were overconstrained , underconstraint seems at least as bizarre as overconstraint .
Nonetheless , neither directly rules out the possibility of time travel .
If time travel entailed contradictions then the issue would be settled .
And indeed , most of the stories employing time travel in popular culture are logically incoherent : one cannot change the past to be different from what it was , since the past ( like the present and the future ) only occurs once .
But if the only requirement demanded is logical coherence , then it seems all too easy .
A clever author can devise a coherent time - travel scenario in which everything happens just once and in a consistent way .
This is just too cheap : logical coherence is a very weak condition , and many things we take to be metaphysically impossible are logically coherent .
For example , it involves no logical contradiction to suppose that water is not molecular , but if both chemistry and Kripke are right it is a metaphysical impossibility .
We have been interested not in logical possibility but in physical possibility .
But even so , our conditions have been relatively weak : we have asked only whether time - travel is consistent with the universal validity of certain fundamental physical laws and with the notion that the physical state on a surface prior to the time travel region be unconstrained .
It is perfectly possible that the physical laws obey this condition , but still that time travel is not metaphysically possible because of the nature of time itself .
Consider an analogy .
Aristotle believed that water is homoiomerous and infinitely divisible : any bit of water could be subdivided , in principle , into smaller bits of water .
Aristotle 's view contains no logical contradiction .
It was certainly consistent with Aristotle 's conception of water that it be homoiomerous , so this was , for him , a conceptual possibility .
But if chemistry is right , Aristotle was wrong both about what water is like and what is possible for it .
It can't be infinitely divided , even though no logical or conceptual analysis would reveal that .
Similarly , even if all of our consistency conditions can be met , it does not follow that time travel is physically possible , only that some specific physical considerations cannot rule it out .
The only serious proof of the possibility of time travel would be a demonstration of its actuality .
For if we agree that there is no actual time travel in our universe , the supposition that there might have been involves postulating a substantial difference from actuality , a difference unlike in kind from anything we could know if firsthand .
It is unclear to us exactly what the content of possible would be if one were to either maintain or deny the possibility of time travel in these circumstances , unless one merely meant that the possibility is not ruled out by some delineated set of constraints .
As the example of Aristotle 's theory of water shows , conceptual and logical “ possibility ” do not entail possibility in a full - blooded sense .
What exactly such a full - blooded sense would be in case of time travel , and whether one could have reason to believe it to obtain , remain to us obscure .
1=2 : A Proof using Complex Numbers
The Fallacious Proof :
See how many tries it takes you to correctly identify the fallacious step !
Complex Numbers
The complex numbers are a set of objects that includes not only the familiar real numbers but also an additional object called " i " .
Addition and multiplication are defined on this larger set in such a way that i^2 = - 1 .
So , although - 1 does not have any square root within the context of real numbers , but it does have a square root within the larger context of complex numbers .
One thing that often confuses people is the question " what is this strange object i " ?
There are different ways to define it , all essentially equivalent .
One convenient way is to define complex numbers to be pairs ( a , b ) of real numbers .
Addition is defined by the rule ( a , b ) + ( c , d ) = ( a+c , b+d ) , and multiplication is defined by the strange - looking rule ( a , b ) ( c , d ) = ( ac - bd , ad+bc ) .
With this definition , a complex number of the form ( a,0 ) is identical in all its arithmetic properties to the real number a , and is therefore just a different way of representing the same abstract concept that the real number a does .
So it is legitimate to think of the complex number ( a,0 ) and the real number a as being " the same thing " , and with this understanding , the complex numbers are a set of objects that contains the real numbers along with other things .
( This is exactly the same thing that one does when one first learns about rational numbers ( fractions ) .
A fraction is a pair of integers ( a , b ) , commonly written as a /b .
There are rules for addition : a /b + c/d = ( ad+bc ) / ( bd ) and for multiplication : ( a / b ) ( c/d ) = ( ac ) / ( bd ) .
With these rules , a fraction of the form a /1 behaves identically to the integer a , so we consider the rational number a / 1 and the integer a to be " the same thing " , and with this understanding , the rational numbers are a set of objects that contains the integers along with other things ) .
Having defined complex numbers as pairs of real numbers , we define i to be the pair ( 0,1 ) .
If you apply the above rule of multiplication , you find that ( 0,1 ) ( 0,1 ) = ( - 1,0 ) ( which , remember , is really the same thing as the real number - 1 ) .
In other words , i^2 = - 1 .
Finally , where did the above rule for multiplication come from ?
It came from the following reasoning :
We want to have in our set an object called i whose square is - 1 .
We also want to have the usual real numbers in our set .
We want a way to add and multiply elements in our set , so as well as i and the usual real numbers we also need to have all sums and products involving i and real numbers ; in other words , for each pair ( a , b ) of real numbers , there needs to be a corresponding element a + bi in our set .
So , since to every pair of real numbers ( a , b ) there needs to correspond an element in our set , why do n't we just let our set be the set of all pairs of real numbers .
Now , what should our rule for multiplication be ?
We want addition and multiplication to satisfy the familiar properties of commutativity , distributivity , and associativity .
That means ( a + bi ) + ( c + di ) should equal ( a+c ) + ( b+d ) i , and ( a+bi ) ( c+di ) should equal ac + bci + adi + bdi^2 = ( ac - bd ) + ( bc+ad ) i .
This reasoning says that there is only one possible way to define addition and multiplication and still have any hope at all of them satisfying the properties we want .
That 's why one makes the definition above .
Then , having made that definition , one proves that this definition does in fact have all the properties we want .
That 's a separate exercise .

Seemingly arcane historical disputes can often cast a powerful light on the state of our collective soul .
It is for that reason that I like to read books on obscure subjects : they are often more illuminating than books that at first sight are more immediately relevant to our current situation .
For , as Emily Dickinson put it , success in indirection lies .
In 2002 , the Australian free - lance historian and journalist , Keith Windschuttle , published a book that created a controversy that has still not died down .
Entitled ‘ The Fabrication of Aboriginal History , ’ it sets out to destroy the idea that there had been a genocide of Tasmanian aborigines carried out by the early European settlers of the island .
For about the previous quarter century , it was more or less an historical orthodoxy that there had been such a genocide .
Robert Hughes accepted the idea in his best - selling history of early Australia , The Fatal Shore .
I accepted it myself , because when I first visited Australia in 1982 I read several books on the subject by professors of history at reputable universities , and rather naively supposed that their work must have been founded on painstaking and honest research , and that they had not misrepresented their original sources .
Windschuttle argued in his book that they had fabricated much of their evidence , and that , contrary to what they claimed , there had been no deliberate policy on the part of the colonial authorities or the local population either to extirpate or kill very large numbers of aborigines .
He showed that the historians ’ reading of the obscure source materials was either misleading or mendacious .
He sifted the material very carefully and found that there was evidence for the killing of 120 Tasmanian aborigines , either by settlers or by the military and police .
Although this does not sound many , in relation to the population of Tasmanian aborigines it was a lot .
It is the equivalent in the United States of upwards of 7,000,000 , for there were only about 4,000 aborigines ( or so it is thought ) at any one time in Tasmania .
However , a similar number of settlers were killed by aborigines , and perhaps it is not so very surprising that there was conflict between people of such widely different conceptions of life as the aborigines and the early British settlers .
But conflict is not genocide , which entails a plan deliberately to rid the world of a certain population .
There was no genocide in Tasmania .
The Tasmanian aborigines did indeed die out in the nineteenth century , but largely of disease and as a result of the loss of fertility caused by the venereal disease introduced by the settlers .
After the book was published , there were furious challenges to Windschuttle .
Slurs were cast upon him : he was , for example , the Australian equivalent of the holocaust deniers .
A book of essays in refutation of his point of view was published ; a refutation of the refutation was also published .
He appeared all round the country in debates with some of his detractors .
As far as I understand it , the massed ranks of the professional historians were unable seriously to dent his argument .
A few small errors ( which he acknowledged ) were found in his book , but not such as to undermine his thesis ; in any case , they were very minor by comparison with the wholesale errors of his opponents .
He had been much more scrupulous than they .
What struck me at the time about the controversy was the evident fact that a large and influential part of the Australian academy and intelligentsia actually wanted there to have been a genocide .
They reacted to Windschuttle ’s book like a child who has had a toy snatched from its hand by its elder sibling .
You would have thought that a man who discovered that his country had not been founded , as had previously been thought and taught , on genocide would be treated as a national hero .
On the contrary , he was held up to execration .
Why should this be ?
Here I confess that I am entering the world of the ad hominem .
I will not be able to prove my assertions beyond reasonable doubt , and other interpretations are possible .
However , when it comes to questions of human motivation , it is difficult altogether to avoid the ad hominem .
It is , of course , possible , that the professors and the intelligentsia were so convinced that there had been a genocide , and believed that the evidence that it had taken place so overwhelming , that any person who denied it must have been an extremely bad man .
On the other hand , if the evidence was so overwhelming , they should have been able easily to produce sufficient of it in public to convince someone like me ( and many others ) .
This they have not done , and so one must conclude that , at the very least , the historical question is an open one .
And if the question is still an open one , the fury directed at Windschuttle was quite disproportionate .
I think the explanation lies elsewhere .
Australia is known , not without reason , as the Lucky Country .
It has virtually every resource known to man .
It is a liberal democracy and has been for most of its existence .
No one in Australia has ever feared the midnight knock on the door .
To live well there requires a good deal less effort than in most places , perhaps anywhere else .
The climate in much of the country ( the current drought notwithstanding ) is very pleasant .
Overall , it is probably the best place , certainly among the best places , on earth to live .
The fact that it is lucky is not , of course , a consequence of its natural endowments alone , but of what human beings have made of those endowments .
Australia is a triumphant success .
This is not to say that everyone in Australia is deliciously happy , or that Australia is a prelapsarian Garden of Eden .
People who live there , like people everywhere , have their problems .
They go bankrupt , divorce , neglect their children , have accidents , die prematurely , kill themselves , overeat , drink too much , get bored , suffer illnesses , and so forth , just like people everywhere else .
The fact is , however , that political reforms in Australia , whatever they might be , are very unlikely to add much to the sum of human welfare there .
Australia confronts human beings with their existential responsibility to make happiness for themselves , and this is sometimes a hard responsibility to face up to .
For if you are unhappy in a country like Australia , you have to consider the possibility that the problem lies with you rather than with the conditions that surround you .
This is a disagreeable thing , particularly for an intelligentsia , which is deprived by it of a providential role for itself .
What does an intelligentsia do when a country is already as satisfactory in its political arrangements and social institutions as any country has ever been ?
Intelligentsias do not like the kind of small problems that day to day existence inevitably throws up , such as termites in the woodwork or conflict at work over desk - space : they like to get their intellectual teeth into weightier , meatier problems .
What could be a weightier problem than a prosperous , fortunate country that was founded upon genocide ?
Clearly , if it was so founded , an intelligentsia is urgently needed to help it emerge from the dark moral labyrinth in which it exists , hitherto blindly .
For only an intelligentsia is sufficiently used to thinking in abstractions to be qualified to act as guide to the nation .
Of course , an intelligentsia needs allies , for it is rarely strong enough by itself to dominate and control a society , and oddly enough the genocide school of Tasmanian history has created allies in people who now call themselves Tasmanian aborigines .
But – I hear you object – I thought you said that Tasmanian aborigines died out in the nineteenth century ( the last one being called Truganini ) ?
Yes , I reply , but that is full - blooded aborigines .
Because there were sexual relations between the first settlers and aborigine women , there exist people in Tasmania with aborigine blood running in the veins .
Admittedly , that blood is almost as dilute as a homeopath ’s medicine , but it is enough for some purposes .
Where there has been genocide , it is only right that there should be apology and , more importantly , reparation .
In the case of the aborigines , this can only be restoration of the land to them as a collectivity .
Indeed , it has been suggested that half the territory of the island of Tasmania be reserved to aborigines .
These aborigines live indistinguishably from their non-aboriginal neighbours .
They speak no language other than English ; they do not forage in the bush for food ; they have the same jobs and are under no social disability , perhaps because they are also physically indistinguishable from non-aborigines .
In fact they are descended to a much greater extent from the perpetrators and beneficiaries of the alleged genocide than from the victims of it .
It would therefore be difficult to think of a more obvious attempted fraud perpetrated on a political entity than the claim by Tasmanian ‘ aborigines ’ to ancestral lands .
Actually , Tasmanian historiography of the genocide school has parallels elsewhere .
I remember when I lived for a time in Guatemala reading the most currently - celebrated account of colonial Guatemala , called La patria del criollo .
In all of its eight hundred pages the role of epidemic disease in reducing the number of Indians after the arrival of the Spanish was not mentioned even once , not even in passing , though it is almost certain ( that is to say as certain as it can be ) that the overwhelming cause of the decrease was epidemic disease .
Why was it not mentioned ?
Because the author wanted to present the current , supposedly lamentable state of Guatemala to be a direct consequence of the colonial era , which was itself a time of genocide .
This being the case , there was only one thing to be done : to found the state anew , to start all over again , to build a new state from a better blueprint .
It is not very difficult to see what role the intelligentsia would have in constructing the new society : a very powerful , indeed directing one .
The same is true in Australia , of course .
If the current state was founded on genocide then , however superficially satisfactory it might appear at first sight , it is necessary to re-found it on a sounder , more ethical basis .
And the architects and subsequent owner - managers will , of course , be the intelligentsia ; for only they are qualified .
Now Australia is a country that in general , until recently at any rate , has not cherished its intellectuals .
It has not accorded them the respect to which they think they are naturally entitled .
Indeed , until a couple of decades ago it was common practice for Australian intellectuals to flee their country and live elsewhere , so strong was the anti-intellectual atmosphere of their county .
Australia was not a lucky country as far as intellectuals were concerned .
That has changed quite a lot recently , but still intellectuals in Australia are not taken as seriously by the public as they take themselves .
Besides , there are now more of them , and competition for attention is therefore greater .
And there is nothing much more attention - grabbing than the claim that your current happiness and good fortune is founded on a pile of bones .
With a bit of luck , this claim will even turn people neurotic and increase the need for therapists .
It is hardly surprising , then , that when someone came along and challenged the version of history on which their new - found importance in society was to be based , they threw their dolly out of the pram , as the prison wardens in the prison in which I worked used to put it to describe the actions of a prisoner who had lost his temper .
The dispute was not just a matter of the interpretation of the contents of old newspapers in Hobart libraries : it went to the very heart of the intelligentsia ’s self - conception as society ’s conscience and natural leaders .
A conflict over the veracity of footnotes was thus also a conflict also over the proper place of intellectuals in modern society .
And Windschuttle was vastly more often right about the footnotes than he was wrong .
This was quite unforgivable of him .

Kucinich receives pro-impeachment petitions with more than 120 K signatures Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday August 2 , 2007
Print This Email This Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - Ohio ) said his push to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney is gaining support among the American people as he collected petitions with more than 100,000 signatures supporting the effort .
" I made it very clear that I was not alone , " Kucinich said .
" Today I am proud to see that hundreds of thousands of Americans have joined this effort . "
Pro-impeachment activists circulated petitions around the country and collected signatures online , at ImpeachCheney.org .
Kucinich spoke on in the Capitol beside a two - foot stack of paper bearing more than 120,000 signatures supporting Cheney 's ouster .
" This is a further step along the way of catalyzing " the impeachment movement , Kucinich said at the sparsely attended press conference .
There did not appear to be any reporters from mainstream media outlets at the conference in the basement of the Capitol , though a dozen or so impeachment supporters were in the audience .
" This is a national movement to save our country and our way of life . "
Kucinich accused Cheney of " fabricating " intelligence and lying to the American public about Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction and the country 's ties to al Qaeda in the run-up to the 2003 US invasion .
" We know the vice president ... subverted the national security of the United States , " Kucinich said , arguing that " blowback " from the Iraq invasion would expose the country to future terror attacks .
The Democratic presidential candidate did not take any questions after delivering his brief remarks , saying he had to rush off for committee votes on legislation .
Impeachment activists said they would organize grassroots action to urge members of Congress to join onto Kucinich 's resolution .
Members will be returning to their districts at the end of this week for a month - long recess .
Kucinich introduced his Cheney impeachment resolution in April , and support for the move in Congress has been growing gradually since then , though top Democrats who control its fate seem to have no interest in advancing the legislation .
The resolution has attracted 16 co-sponsors in the House .
More than 300 activists came to Capitol Hill last month to press Judiciary Chairman John Conyers and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to begin impeachment proceedings in the House , as RAW STORY previously reported .
Conyers told the protesters , led by Cindy Sheehan , that there were not enough votes in the House to impeach Cheney or President Bush , so he refused to begin the proceedings .
An American Research Group poll last month found a majority of Americans -- 54 percent -- favored Cheney 's impeachment .
" The Vice President actively and systematically sought to deceive the citizens and Congress about an alleged threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction .
He has purposely manipulated the intelligence process to deceive us about the relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda , " Kucinich said in a statement released by his office Wednesday .
" And he openly lied to the America people and has publicly threatened aggression against Iran . "
Did the National Security Act of 1947 destroy freedom of the press ?
The red pill ...
Historical and Investigative Research - 3 Jan 2006
by Francisco Gil- White
http://www.hirhome.com/national-security.htm
___________________________________________________________
The National Security Act ( passed in 1947 ) allows US Intelligence to begin any action , at any time , without asking anybody .
In addition , US Intelligence may postpone indefinitely any report of such activity simply by claiming that making the report would harm the " national security " of the United States .
This is a recipe for absolute power .
It follows that the National Security Act of 1947 gave US Intelligence the power — if not the explicit authority — to corrupt the press in secret .
This article will argue , and document , that this is precisely what US Intelligence has done .
Naturally , this raises the sharpest possible questions about the integrity of US democracy .
___________________________________________________________

So did the National Security Act destroy freedom of the press in the United States ? █
The power of US Intelligence █ Final Remarks ___________________________________________________________
Introduction Even in democracies , the business of government is run by a tiny group of people , and the decisions are taken by an even tinier group : let us call these few decision makers the ruling or power elite .
In the United States , this tiny power elite at the top is composed disproportionately of members of the ( very ) wealthy classes , and their retainers .
It may include people who do not have an official government position .
Now , since a person ’s interests are largely determined by his or her position in the socio- economic structure , it follows that the power elite will tend to have interests quite at variance with those of the majority of the population .
In fact , their ideology may be completely different — even opposite .
Is this a problem ?
Not if the majority has sufficient oversight over what the power elite is doing , for in this case government officials who violate the wishes of the majority can be democratically replaced with others who do respect what the people want .
What can produce the sufficient level of oversight ?
A free and competitive news market .
Any free and competitive market will have certain basic properties .
For example , if you and I both have competing taco stands , but my tacos — going for a comparable price — are cleaner and tastier , then people will flock to my taco stand and will abandon yours .
Economics 101 : obvious stuff .
If we are running advertisements , I will point out how much better my tacos are than yours , the better to gain a larger market share .
This will force you and other competitors of mine to improve the quality of your tacos without increasing the price too much , or else you will have to get out of the taco market .
This is what we expect will happen in any free and competitive market , so markets for other products will behave similarly , if they are free .
When the product is news , in a free and competitive market we should see better - quality news services exposing the biases , inaccuracies , or lies in inferior news services .
Why ?
Because deviations from the truth are synonymous with a lower - quality news product ; if more reliable alternatives are known to be available , consumers will flock to those .
In a free news market , therefore , the different media services will savagely attack each other .
[ 1 ]
As a result , untruths will have poor stability .
But in order to have such a free market of information — what is called a ‘ free press ’ — the companies producing news must not be controlled by the local government or a foreign one , and they must be independent of each other , so that they indeed compete to inform news consumers .
Without a free press , democracy is impossible .
In political theory the ‘ free press ’ is often referred to as the ‘ fourth estate ’ because an ‘ estate ’ is something like a main building block of political structure .
In the United States , for example , the political structure is formally divided into : 1 ) the executive : the president and ‘ the cabinet ’ ( a term for the president ’s own employees , whom he hires and fires ) ; 2 ) the legislative : the two houses of Congress ; and 3 ) the judiciary : the courts .
Though not formally part of ‘ government , ’ a free press will act as a ‘ fourth estate ’ because , by investigating and reporting what the government does , it will effectively check that government .
So long as there is a free press , then , it will be difficult for the government to betray the people , because a treasonous government stands a good chance of being exposed .
Of course , if the same power elite that runs the government also runs the press , then there is no oversight of government , and the press instead becomes an organ of power , distributing not news but propaganda that will help the bosses employ government as a tool to advance their own interests over everybody else ’s .
Since control over the press would give the bosses such tremendous power , it is obvious that they have a motive to corrupt the press .
But do they have opportunity ?
In other words , can they , in practical terms , do this ?
That depends .
If the government is not allowed to keep secrets , and if every dollar spent by the government has to be publicly accounted for , the power elite running the government will not find it so easy to corrupt the press .
If , on the contrary , at least a few branches of government are given a relatively large budget with which to operate in complete secrecy , giving no account to the citizenry of how the monies are spent , there will be plenty of opportunity to corrupt the press .
With the power to use the taxpayer ’s money in secret , the power elite can give publishers and editors ( a small group of individuals ) a choice between lucrative corruption or secret persecution ( even death , at the limit ) .
If publishers and editors happen already to come disproportionately from the same circles as the power elite , the choice will not be especially difficult : they will tend to choose corruption .
This top layer of the press decides what ordinary people get to see in print , on the radio , or on TV .
Thus , control over this top layer in an apparently free press will result in tremendous power , because the appearance of a competitive market ( produced by the proliferation of brands ) will make the public terribly gullible .
Instead of using coercion to force people to do what the power elite wants ( which invariably produces a reaction ) , the controlled yet apparently free media can be used to manufacture realities such that ordinary people will ‘ democratically ’ demand the very things the power elite wants to do .
For example , a war of aggression which the citizenry would never approve ( since it is ordinary citizens who must die fighting ) could be falsely represented as a defensive war by using the media to create the impression of a threat that in reality did not exist .
Once scared , the citizenry would demand the very war that the power elite wanted to launch .
This sort of thing would be scary .
But that does n't mean it cannot happen .
It has happened before .
For example , in August 1939 , Adolf Hitler , who had complete control over the press in Nazi Germany , complained that the Polish government was supposedly terrorizing the German minority in Poland , as follows : " The wave of appalling terrorism against the [ minority ] inhabitants of Poland , and the atrocities that have been taking place in that country are terrible for the victims , but intolerable for a Great Power which has been expected to remain a passive onlooker .
We will not continue to tolerate the persecution of the minority , the killing of many , and their forcible removal under the most cruel conditions . " [ 1a ]
This became Adolf Hitler 's publicly given reason to attack the Polish state ( which attack , we are told , precipitated World War II ) .
But the Polish government had not been oppressing the German minority in Poland , and the trigger - excuse that the German Nazi government used to set in motion the invasion of Poland was a series of simulated attacks on Germany along the Polish - German border , carried out by the Nazis themselves , and blamed on the Poles ( the most famous is the ' Gleiwitz incident ' ) .
[ 1b ]
Given that such things are possible , concerned US citizens should ask themselves the question :
Have members of the US power elite had the opportunity to corrupt the press ?
In this piece , I will argue that , unfortunately , such opportunity was formally given by the US Congress to the executive a long time ago , when it passed the National Security Act in 1947 , creating branches of government that may do essentially anything they please in secret , and which have at their disposal a large budget .
In other words , by law , since 1947 , US taxpayers have not been told how their presidents have been spending a very big chunk of their taxes .
The secrecy provisions of the National Security Act
_____________________________________________
The full text of the National Security Act is in the footnote .
[ 2 ]
Here below is a summary of what the National Security Act achieved , written by the US Department of State : “ The National Security Act of 1947 mandated a major reorganization of the foreign policy and military establishments of the U.S. Government .
The act created many of the institutions that Presidents found useful when formulating and implementing foreign policy , including the National Security Council ( NSC ) .
The Council itself included the President , Vice President , Secretary of State , Secretary of Defense , and other members ( such as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency ) , who met at the White House to discuss both long - term problems and more immediate national security crises …
The act also established the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , which grew out of World War II era Office of Strategic Services and small post - war intelligence organizations . ” [ 3 ]
A lot that is of vital interest to the average US citizen is left out by the State Department ’s summary .
For example , most US citizens will be interested to know that Title V of the National Security Act , which is concerned with “ Accountability For Intelligence Activities , ” gave US Intelligence the power to do basically anything it wants in secret .
I will now demonstrate this by quoting the relevant sections of Title V. Instead of presenting them in order , I will choose an order of presentation that I find more pedagogic .
SEC .
501 . [ 50 U.S.C. 413 ] ( a ) ( 2 ) : “ Nothing in this title shall be construed as requiring the approval of the congressional intelligence committees as a condition precedent to the initiation of any significant anticipated intelligence activity . ”
Translation : Nothing that is said in Title V concerning the accountability of US Intelligence may be interpreted as a requirement that US Intelligence ask anybody for permission to do anything .
US Intelligence may simply initiate any action it wants , in secret , at any time .
It is true that SEC .
501 . [ 50 U.S.C. 413 ] ( a ) ( 2 ) , above , is preceded by : SEC .
501 . [ 50 U.S.C. 413 ] ( a ) ( 1 ) : “ The President shall ensure that the congressional intelligence committees are kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the United States , including any significant anticipated intelligence activity as required by this title . ”
You can probably see now why the section immediately above was placed first : “ Fully and currently informed ” sounds good , and if you read this first you will get a good feeling , which may linger .
But the truth is that Title V itself renders meaningless the words “ fully and currently . ”
As you can see immediately above , the responsibility for informing Congress about what US Intelligence is doing falls to the president .
Further clarifying this point , Title V states : SEC .
501 . [ 50 U.S.C. 413 ] ( b ) : “ The President shall ensure that any illegal intelligence activity is reported promptly to the congressional intelligence committees , as well as any corrective action that has been taken or is planned in connection with such illegal activity . ”
I shall translate .
US
Intelligence is part of the executive branch , and therefore run by people whom the president hires and fires , and who must act with the president ’s authority .
What if they do illegal things ?
Who will be responsible for informing Congress about the president ’s own “ illegal intelligence activity ” ?
The president .
Do you perceive a conflict of interest ?
It is true that a bit further down , Title V states : SEC .
501 . [ 50 U.S.C. 413 ] ( e ) : “ Nothing in this Act shall be construed as authority to withhold information from the congressional intelligence committees on the grounds that providing the information to the congressional intelligence committees would constitute the unauthorized disclosure of classified information or information relating to intelligence sources and methods . ”
And I agree that an ordinary mortal in a rush could be forgiven for reading the above and thinking this was a requirement of full disclosure .
But that ’s not what it is .
Here is the translation : US Intelligence may not say to the congressional intelligence committees , “ You know what ?
We wo n’t share this information with you because that would be , you know , ‘ unauthorized disclosure , ’ as we call it . ”
Once translated , it is easy to see that the above does not forbid US intelligence from saying to the congressional intelligence committees , “ You know what ?
We wo n’t share this information with you because that would be , you know , ‘ harmful to national security , ’ as we call it . ”
And , in fact , a different section of Title V explicitly allows US Intelligence to indefinitely postpone reports to the congressional intelligence committees so long as making the report is deemed “ detrimental to the national security of the United States . ” [ 4 ]
And who will be doing the deeming ?
The president , or someone under his authority .
Once again , perhaps you perceive the conflict of interest .
It is also worth pointing out that even should any US Intelligence activity ever make its way into a report presented to the congressional intelligence committees , this will hardly amount to much public oversight of US Intelligence .
Why ?
Because these committees are themselves highly secret and mostly do not inform the public .
[ 5 ]
Let us then summarize the effective powers of the president .
The president of the United States may , at any time , wield US Intelligence to initiate any action whatever , legal or illegal , without asking or notifying Congress , and he may legally postpone , indefinitely and at his own discretion , the report of any such activity to the congressional intelligence committees , which for the most part do not reveal much to the general public anyway .
What is this a recipe for ?
Absolute power , provided US Intelligence is given a sufficiently large budget .
The US Intelligence budget appears to be very large .
CIA director George Tenet said in the year 1998 that the budget on that year had been a little under 27 billion .
Recently , a US Intelligence official said in a press conference that the yearly budget was now 44 billion . [ 6 ]
This is real money .
But the most important point is this : the true size of the US Intelligence budget is a state secret ( when George Tenet ' disclosed ' the size of the US Intelligence budget he was doing us a favor ) .
Given that the size of the US Intelligence budget is a state secret , it is , for all practical purposes , unlimited .
Covert Action
____________
What could you do if you had this much power to act in secret ?
You could , for example , secretly corrupt the publishers and editors who run the press in other countries .
You could also secretly corrupt political parties and military institutions in other countries .
Or you could distort their markets with financial interventions .
Such ‘ covert actions ’ are explicitly permitted in Title V of the National Security Act : SEC .
501 . [ 50 U.S.C. 413 ] ( f ) “ As used in this section , the term ‘ intelligence activities ’ includes covert actions as defined in section 503(e ) , and includes financial intelligence activities . ” SEC . 503 ( e ) : “ As used in this title [ Title V ] , the term ‘ covert action ’ means an activity or activities of the United States Government to influence political , economic , or military conditions abroad , where it is intended that the role of the United States Government will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly … ” Translation :
By law , the president of the United States need show zero respect for the internal political processes in other countries , and may use the might of the world ’s greatest power to distort and disrupt them in secret .
Once explicitly given this power in US law , what president could resist it ?
The rational expectation is therefore that the US has been hard at work corrupting the press and the political processes of foreign countries ever since the National Security Act was passed .
But is the president of the United States also allowed to treat democracy in the United States with such astonishing contempt ?
He is not .
The immediately following paragraph states : SEC . 503 ( f ) : “ No covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence United States political processes , public opinion , policies , or media . ”
If you are a US citizen , and you find SEC .
503 ( f ) of the National Security Act in the least reassuring , allow me to remind you that , if the president chooses to secretly corrupt US political or media processes , which SEC .
503 ( f ) forbids , the responsibility to inform Congress of such illegal activity will fall ... to the president .
And the president has the power to postpone indefinitely the report of this illegal intelligence activity to Congress — all he has to do is invoke a supposed danger to ‘ national security . ’
Question :
What do you have when you give the president the power to corrupt the US media and make it so that , in order to be discovered , the president must tell on himself ?
Answer :
The opposite of a mechanism to prevent the corruption of the US media .
This is an invitation to do it .
As economists are fond of saying , people respond to incentives .
Thus , if you set things up so that there are great rewards and zero punishments to do something , people will be very likely to do it .
It will behoove us , then , to ask the next question .
Question :
What kind of a president will refrain from breaking the law in order to corrupt the US media if he knows : 1 ) that he wo n’t get caught ; and 2 ) that breaking the law in this manner will vastly increase his own power ?
Answer : A president who is scrupulously ethical .
Is it likely that the most powerful man in the world , allowed by the National Security Act to corrupt the press in foreign countries , will be scrupulously ethical when it comes to keeping his hands off the US media ?
Anyway , but let us take a look at the ethics of US Intelligence , the better to form an opinion about the likelihood that the US press has been corrupted .
The ethics of US Intelligence :
The CIA was created by absorbing in secret lots of Nazi war criminals
_______________________________________
In 1988 , The Washington Post wrote : “ It is no longer necessary — or possible — to deny the fact : the U.S. government systematically and deliberately recruited active Nazis by the thousands , rescued them , hired them and relied upon them to serve American interests and purposes in postwar Europe . ” [ 7 ]
The Washington Post was reviewing “ the archival sleuthing of [ historian ] Christopher Simpson , ” which involved poring over many “ documents ... declassified under the Freedom of Information Act . ” But The Washington Post misrepresented the truth above , so it denied the facts .
What the Post should have written is that the US government deliberately and systematically recruited not “ thousands ” but tens of thousands of Nazi war criminals .
And since what Simpson demonstrated was that the CIA itself was created by absorbing in secret this Nazi multitude , and since the CIA has engaged in covert actions all over the globe , the Post should n't have written that covert actions took place only in “ postwar Europe . ”
And neither should the Post have written that these Nazis were used to serve “ American interests and purposes . ”
This is false .
The recruited Nazis were used to serve the interests and purposes of the US power elite . [ 7a ]
Finally , the Post should have explained , as the Toronto Star did in its own review of Simpson ’s book , that , “ Many East European Nazi collaborators , leaders of fascist groups and governments in Eastern Europe , and leaders of pro-fascist East European émigré organizations soon became politically active in the States [ because they were brought to the US in secret by the CIA and given new identities ] ... and gained remarkable access to the most powerful intelligence chiefs , politicians , business associations and media moguls in America . ” [ 8 ]
Coming back to The Washington Post , this paper also explained to its readers that the US government lied to the US citizen : “ the American public was told that U.S. policy was to round up and punish ( not entice and reward ) those who had been instrumental in Hitler ’s crimes against humanity . ”
What the Post fails to mention is that the US government had permission to lie , because this permission was granted by the same National Security Act of 1947 that also created the CIA out of these Nazi thugs .
The Washington Post ’s reviewer ends by defending the mass recruitment of Nazis as “ well intentioned . ”
The New York Times went further ; this paper ’s reviewer closed by expressing offense at Simpson ’s outrage ( though he magnanimously forgave Simpson ... ) , and he explained to NYT readers that the ends justified the means .
[ 9 ]
All discussion of Simpson ’s book seems to have died almost immediately .
Academics never touch it .
And the last mention I could find of it in the Western media was in 1993 , only 5 years after the book was published , and then only in passing .
This can easily explain why you never heard anything about this , if you never did .
But you may find Simpson ’s book in libraries and it is available in bookstores : Simpson , Christopher .
1988 .
Blowback : America 's recruitment of Nazis and its effects on the Cold War. New York : Weidenfeld & Nicholson .
[ Read a summary with links to articles on this [ 9a ] ]
Since it was US President Harry Truman who signed the National Security Act into law in 1947 , and who created the CIA out of multitudes of Nazi war criminals , it pays to review some aspects of his foreign policy .
In 1947 - 48 US foreign policy was designed to destroy the fledgling state of Israel by assisting the genocidal Arab armies that , in launching their attack , openly called for the extermination of the Jews .
How did Harry Truman assist the Arabs ?
1 ) After the attack began , the US government announced that it no longer recognized Israel ; 2 ) The US government slapped an arms embargo on the Israeli Jews , making it harder for them to defend themselves ; and 3 ) The US government supported British policy , which was to use British troops to assist the Arab armies in various ways , and also to send captured Nazi officers to lead them .
In stark contrast , the Marshall Plan , another major component of Truman 's foreign policy , had for purpose restoring to health the very fascist countries that had plunged the entire world into a genocidal , antisemitic war : Germany and Japan .
[ Read more about all this [ 9 b ] ]
Over the years , the behavior of the CIA has agreed with the values that attended its creation .
The CIA is notorious for having destroyed democratic and progressive governments in many different parts of the world , installing in their stead repressive right - wing dictatorships that oppressed ordinary people . [ 9c ]
In other words , the Central Intelligence Agency has behaved in a manner perfectly consistent with what you would expect from a Nazi agency , which is of course what an agency composed of Nazis would be .
Now we may return to our question :
Should we expect such an agency , with authority under the National Security
Act to corrupt the foreign press , to have exercised restraint when it comes to corrupting the US press ?
Would n’t it be irrational to expect that ?
So did the National Security Act destroy freedom of the press in the United States ?
_______________________
Historian Christopher Simpson has documented that the US press was irreversibly corrupted almost immediately after passage of the National Security Act .
One portion of Simpson ’s documentation deals with something called the National Committee for a Free Europe ( NCFE ) , which was an umbrella with which to disguise the CIA ’s pro-fascist covert actions in Europe .
To read about how NCFE promoted fascists in Europe — financing their operations with the same money that the Nazis had stolen from the victims of the Shoah ( ' Holocaust ' ) — consult the footnote . [ 18 ]
Here I am concerned with the point that the media cooperated with this CIA pro-fascist effort completely , and immediately after the National Security Act was passed .
I quote below Christopher Simpson ’s passage on the media ’s cooperation :
In 1953 , which is around the same time , the CIA staged a coup that destroyed the progressive and democratic Iranian government of Mohammed Mossadeq , replacing it with the dictatorial and repressive right - wing puppet regime of Mohammed Reza Shah .
At this time , too , the US media lied to the US public , cooperating very closely with the CIA .
How closely ?
Well , consider that the following is just one item in a longer list ( consult the footnote for a fuller picture ) : “ The Iran desk of the State Department ... was able to place a C.I.A. study in Newsweek , ‘ using the normal channel of desk officer to journalist . ’
The article was one of several planted press reports that , when reprinted in Tehran , fed the ‘ war of nerves ’ against Iran ’s prime minister , Mohammed Mossadegh . ” [ 20 ]
The US government planted a CIA ' study ' in Newsweek — only one of several propaganda attacks against Mossadeq that were planted in the press—using “ the normal channel of desk officer to journalist ... ”
In addition to the above , I will make the following observation : the hypothesis that the Western mass media has been corrupted by pro-Nazi interests , like any hypothesis , makes predictions .
For example , we know that the persecution of the Jews is central to Nazi ideology , and therefore if one hypothesizes that the CIA , created by absorbing tens of thousands of Nazis , has corrupted the press , one can make the following reasonable prediction : the press will be attacking the Jews .
The following HIR investigation contains a mountain of data supporting the view that the Western mass media is attacking the Jews in a way eerily reminiscent of the propaganda attacks against the Jews in the prelude to the WWII Final Solution , and which made that genocide possible : “ THE MODERN ‘PROTOCOLS OF ZION ’:
How the mass media now promotes the same lies that caused the death of more than 5 million Jews in WWII ” ; Historical and Investigative Research ; 25 August 2005 ; by Francisco Gil - White

The power of US Intelligence
_________________________
All of the above supports the view that US Intelligence will turn out to be the single most powerful political organ in the United States , because it has had , in over a half century , plenty of time to corrupt the entire political process .
Consider the case of Allen Dulles .
As documented by Christopher Simpson , Allen Dulles was one of the main architects of the creation of the CIA out of a multitude of Nazis .
But then the April 1961 Bay of Pigs fiasco happened : a disastrous CIA operation to invade Cuba using Cuban exiles trained by the US Special Forces , [ 10 ] which , as Simpson documents , were full of Nazis that US Intelligence had brought over and given US citizenship to .
[ 10a ]
It is not imposible that the Bay of Pigs experience forced Kennedy to reconsider the adventurous policies of the US ' national security ' establishment .
According to an article that appeared later in the New York Times , " President Kenndy , as the enormity of the Bay of Pigs disaster came home to him , said to one of the highest officials of his Administration that he wanted to ' splinter the CIA in a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds . ' " [ 10 b ]
In September of 1961 Kennedy fired Allen Dulles and his personal staff .
In November of 1963 Kennedy was assassinated in the city of Dallas , Texas , in circumstances so mysterious they continue to fascinate .
The government of Lyndon B. Johnson , the next president , created the Warren Commission to investigate the murder and produce a report , which commission consisted , at the top , of seven senior members .
These were : CHIEF JUSTICE EARL WARREN , Chairman
SENATOR RICHARD B. RUSSELL
SENATOR JOHN SHERMAN COOPER
REPRESENTATIVE HALE BOGGS
REPRESENTATIVE GERALD R. FORD
MR. ALLEN W. DULLES
MR. JOHN J. MCCLOY [ 10 c ]
Do you perceive a conflict of interest when a professional liar and veteran of political assassinations is put in charge of investigating the assassination of the President who fired him after a tremendous fiasco ?
I do .
Famously , the Warren Commission 's report , which defends a ' lone gunman ' theory stating that nobody in the entire world had anything whatsoever to do with Kennedy 's assassination but private citizen Lee Harvey Oswald , has convinced almost nobody .
Is it not possible that the CIA perceived a threat in Kennedy 's direction after Bay of Pigs and removed him ?
It is possible .
This hypothesis is quite popular among those who study the Kennedy assassination , mostly amateur buffs because professional historians avoid the topic like the plague .
It is problematic for this hypothesis that — despite what the New York Times reported about Kennedy 's reaction to the Bay of Pigs operation — he did not develop an immediate aversion to CIA clandestine operations .
On the contrary .
For example , right after the Bay of Pigs disaster Kennedy approved Operation Mongoose : " the largest operation that the CIA had ever undertaken . " [ 11 ]
And the point of Mongoose ?
Replace Castro !
But Mongoose was another disaster , for the activities surrounding its preparation , in addition to other anti-Cuban activities of the United States , worried Castro so much that he asked the Soviets to place nuclear missiles on the Island , leading to the famous Cuban Missile Crisis . [ 12 ] ( Kennedy has been much celebrated for handling that crisis in such a way that it did not become an atomic war ; perhaps it would be more reasonable to criticize him for producing the crisis in the first place ) .
But this coin has another side , too .
The hypothesis so many Kennedy assassination buffs like may not be so bad .
In March 1962 Operation Northwoods was presented for consideration .
This was a plan of sabotage and terror against the United States — which even contemplated murdering US citizens — in order to blame it on Cuba and thus justify another attempted invasion . [ 12a ]
Where did such ideas come from ?
The CIA was full of Nazis that Allen Dulles had helped absorb , and Nazi sympathizers such as Allen Dulles ; as mentioned earlier , the Nazis had staged a simulated Polish attack on Germany to justify their invasion of Poland .
What was Kennedy 's reaction to Northwoods ?
He rejected it .
It is not impossible that a president who much enjoyed clandestine warfare against other countries could have been offended by a plan to murder US citizens .
And if he was offended , US intelligence leaders may have grown uncomfortable , especially after Operation Mongoose led to the Cuban Missile Crisis , which took place in October 1962 and which probably did affect Kennedy 's opinion of US Intelligence , for it almost destroyed him — and his country .
From that point onwards US Intelligence leaders may have grown worried about what their president might do .
That feeling would have tended to gel in loyalty towards the dismissed former CIA director Allen Dulles .
It remains terribly suspicious that Dulles should have overseen the investigation into the president 's murder and that the report of this investigation should be so strange .
That investigation had been ordered by Lyndon B. Johnson , and the impression it leaves is that he had not the slightest intention of producing an honest inquiry into the possible role of US Intelligence in the murder : he would behave .
An obvious historical parallel here is to the Roman Empire .
This empire was created by the Roman aristocrat Augustus Caesar ( born Octavian ) , who at the same time created a mercenary force under his personal control called the Praetorian Guard .
“ The praetorian guard consisted of nine cohorts with 1000 or possibly 500 men in each , and was stationed in Italian towns in the vicinity of Rome …
These soldiers , though armed , did not appear in dress uniform . ” [ 13 ]
The Praetorian Guard is often called the ‘ emperor ’s bodyguard , ’ but that ’s not what it was .
The people in charge of preventing Augustus Caesar from being assassinated were the speculatores of Caesar , a small detachment from within the Praetorian Guard . [ 14 ]
This makes sense : one does not protect an emperor from assassination by stationing thousands of men under arms in several towns , distributing them all around the cities in plainclothes .
The Praetorian Guard was obviously there to protect the imperial regime .
The Praetorians were the real power in Rome .
Consider that , “ [ Gaius Caesar , also known as ] Caligula , was assassinated because he had made a mockery of the military and alienated the leaders of the Guard .
The Praetorians soon became the most powerful body in the state , and …frequently deposed and elevated emperors according to their pleasure . ” [ 15 ]
For example , Gaius ’ successor , Claudius Caesar , “ … was conveyed to the praetorian barracks where he negotiated for the crucial support of the guardsmen …
Claudius addressed the praetorians , promised a donative , and was saluted as imperator .
At a second meeting [ with Claudius ] the senate now acquiesced in a situation that it could not change …
The donative [ Claudius ] paid was enormous , probably 15,000 sesterces each . ” [ 16 ]
If you wanted to be emperor and stay emperor , you had to make the Praetorian Guard happy , because they were the real power in Rome .
This is not a ' conspiracy theory ' ; it is history .
There is certainly nothing outrageous in such historical events : they make perfect sense .
The Praetorian Guard had the power to crown and remove emperors , so it did .
The same argument applies : the CIA has the power to crown and remove presidents .
Is it outrageous to suggest that it does precisely this ?
I would submit that a US president has to keep the CIA happy , because the CIA is the real power in Washington .
I like the following hypothesis : after the CIA made an example of Kennedy , every occupant of the White House has followed Johnson 's example and behaved .
Now , if the CIA is the real power in Washington , then the apparent alternation in power between the Democratic and Republican parties should not affect the conduct of US foreign policy in the least , and we should find , upon examination , that this policy is always identical , regardless of which party is in office .
Much of the work on this website has documented precisely this .
For example , HIR ’s series to understand Bush Jr. ’s war on Iraq has documented that US foreign policy towards Iran and Iraq has been the same for many years : pro-Islamist .
It matters not who sits in the White House .
“ BUSH JR .
’S WAR ON IRAQ : A general introduction ” ; Historical and Investigative Research ; 1 December 2005 ; by Francisco Gil - White
http://www.hirhome.com/iraniraq/iraq-general-intro.htm
This sort of thing agrees nicely with the manner in which the CIA was created because fanatical Islamist terrorism is in many ways structurally and functionally quite similar to Nazi ideology , though the Nazis did not invoke the authority of Allah . [ 17 ]
US foreign policy towards the Jewish state has also been perfectly consistent : it has been consistently and radically anti-Israel regardless of who is president , as another HIR investigation has demonstrated : “ IS THE US AN ALLY OF ISRAEL ? : A chronological look at the evidence ” ; Historical and Investigative Research ; by Francisco Gil - White
http://www.hirhome.com/israel/ihrally.htm
This again agrees nicely with the fact that the CIA was created out of tens of thousands of Nazis .
Final Remarks
_____________
There has been a lot of noise in the media concerning the powers granted to the executive branch in the Patriot Act , which was signed into law in the wake of 9 - 11 .
I would submit that the entire debate is a propagandistic distraction .
The executive branch of the United States was already given something very close to absolute power in the National Security Act of 1947 .
It has been able to do anything it wants since then .
Once that sinks in , the noise around the Patriot Act begins to look like a decoy : its purpose is merely to generate a debate around it , there to create a theater of democracy .
But democracy , I would submit , died some time ago , when the free press was abolished by US Intelligence .

Cassini images of Saturn 's G ring captures its single , bright arc
The behaviour of one ring in particular - the G ring - has baffled experts .
The thought its dust particles should have ebbed away because there were no nearby moons to hold them in place or replenish them .
But the Cassini probe has shed new light on the faint , narrow ring ; showing that it interacts with a much more distant Saturnian satellite .
The work , published in Science , also unveiled the ring 's odd structure .
The G ring is one of Saturn 's outermost rings : it is more than 168,000 km from the centre of the planet and more than 15,000 km from the nearest moon .
" It 's a dusty ring , " explained Matthew Hedman , a research associate at Cornell University and lead author of the study .
" Like the E ring and F ring , it is primarily composed of tiny grains of ice just a few microns across . "
However , these minute specks can be easily dispersed or eroded as they whizz around the planet .
For the rings to remain in place , they either need something to serve them with a constant supply of new dust and ice , or for a large object such as a moon to confine the particles in the band through its gravitational interactions .
The moon Enceladus directly supplies new material to the nearby E ring .
While for the F ring , satellites Prometheus and Pandora may help to keep the particles within this narrow region .
" But the G ring is not near a moon , and that 's the thing that makes it odd , " explained Dr Hedman .
Arc of debris
Data from the Cassini - Huygens mission to Saturn , a collaboration between the US space agency ( Nasa ) , the European Space Agency ( Esa ) and the Italian Space Agency ( ASI ) , has enabled scientists to examine the G ring in more detail than ever before .
Instruments from the Cassini probe revealed that the G ring 's structure was unusual .
In addition to the tiny grains of dust spread evenly around the ring , there was also a bright arc across one sixth of the band , that contained larger icy solids .
These ranged in size from a few centimetres to a few metres .
Dr Hedman explained : " You would expect this material to shear out , but it was clumped together .
So the question was ' how did that work ? ' "
The team discovered that the ring 's orbit was linked to that of the major moon Mimas .
For every seven times the arc orbited Saturn , Mimas , which is about 15,000 km away , completed six orbits .
" When you get this kind of whole number ratio , there can be some strange things called resonances that occur .
These can have interesting influences and can actually confine material within the ring , " said Dr Hedman .
The scientists believe the bright arc of material is being held in place through an interaction with Mimas .
Micrometeorites , which litter space , are constantly colliding into the bodies within the arc , generating dust that subsequently spreads out to populate the rest of the G ring .
" The entire G ring could be derived from an arc of debris held in resonance with Mimas , " the scientists write in the journal Science .

NEW YORK – About a dozen anti-war protesters were arrested Tuesday during a demonstration against U.S. President George W. Bush 's speech to the United Nations General Assembly .
" I want Bush and Cheney arrested , " said Ben Maurer of Brooklyn , one of the protesters who knelt on the sidewalk in a planned act of civil disobedience before being handcuffed by police and put in a van .
The arrestees were among about 400 people opposing the Bush administration 's war in Iraq , and its incarceration in Guantanamo Bay of more than 300 men on suspicion of terrorism or links to Al Qaeda or the Taliban .
Many in the crowd wore orange jumpsuits in solidarity with the Guantanamo detainees .
The protesters demonstrated near the UN and then marched downtown , accompanied by a heavy police escort , for another rally at Washington Square Park .
" I 'm sick to my stomach about the war in Iraq , " said Anastasia Gomes , 22 , of Queens .
" We as the youth are standing up and saying this president does not represent us . ''
The crowd was a mix of college students and veterans of anti-Vietnam War protests .
" I 've been doing this for 40 years , " said Gail Lindenberg , 58 , of Manhattan .
" I 'm very troubled that for many years the United States as an international power continues with very little resistance . ''
Members of the anti-war group Code Pink symbolically arrested a person wearing a Bush mask and chanted , " What do we say ?
Arrest the criminal !''
In his speech , Bush announced new sanctions against the military dictatorship in Myanmar , accusing it of imposing " a 19 - year reign of fear " that denies basic freedoms of speech , assembly and worship .
A White House spokesman , asked to comment on the protest , issued a statement that said : " One of the most basic and precious rights our Constitution guarantees its citizens is the right to peacefully protest and express one 's views .
It is something that certain leaders annul in their own countries but willingly take advantage of here . ''
The protesters shouted " End the war ! " and " Defend the Constitution ! " as they marched to Washington Square Park .
Office workers and tourists watched as the demonstrators paraded past Grand Central Terminal and the New York Public Library .

About Vypr VPN from Golden Frog
The face of the VPN industry is ever - changing , but one constant that has remained over this considerable period of evolution is that of the Golden Frog - owned Vypr VPN .
This veritable behemoth of the world of private internet is powered by veteran minds that have been involved in the field since the first breakthrough of public internet back in 1994 , and boasts over 700 servers and an IP address count that numbers in the hundreds of thousands .
Those statistics alone should be capable of properly conveying the true scale of the Vypr VPN operation , and the fact that it has endured twenty years of service in its various iterations speaks volumes about the quality of service on offer here .
Vypr VPN operates its own servers in Europe , North America , and Asia , but the company itself is based in Switzerland – the benefits of which will become more apparent later on .
Goldenfrog runs its own large server network across the globe .
The well known Usenet Provider Giganews also belongs to the company – which is often referred to as the No1 service in its sector .
Pricing
The arsenal of features that Vypr VPN offers to its sizeable base of loyal customers is certainly deserving of envy from their multitude of competitors .
Broadly speaking , their plans can be divided into two distinct “ flavours ” – there is the personal account ( the one used by the majority of their client base ) and the business account ( targeted more at commercial organisations who place a significant value on data privacy , and beginning at a very competitive price ) .
As one might expect from these relatively straightforward names , they are geared towards two totally different user types .
The personal account boasts just about as comprehensive a set of key features that will be of appeal to both regular and power users alike .
Perhaps the most important of these is that there is absolutely zero third - party involvement .
Unlike many of their direct competitors , Vypr VPN owns and manages its own servers and your data is transmitted directly to them .
This guarantees a secure and high - speed connection ; in fact the outfit is able to assuredly state that theirs is the fastest VPN connection currently available on the market .
Privacy and Security
Their secure high - speed connections are not , however , limited to desktops and laptop computers .
The folks at Golden Frog have been kind enough to produce a selection of apps to allow mobile users to get in on the act too .
Android and iOS devices – both cellphones and tablets – can utilise the service to obtain some browsing peace of mind , and there is a fully - featured Mac OS version as well .
With Vypr VPN , nobody has to miss out .
It is a great thing that the vyprVPN - Service also includes a DNS - Service ( vyprVPN ) .
DNS translates host names ( such as http://anywhere.fm) into a IP address , which is computer readable .
Here , most Internet users rely on the DNS server of their Internet provider .
This allows the provider to collect information about the activities of its customers , even if they use VPN .
The use of vyprDNS can circumvent this vulnerability : vyprDNS is included in vyprVPN so that all DNS - requests are conducted over the secure Vypr-servers .
Almost as admirable as their decision to cater for the widest possible audience ( and did we mention it ’s the world ’s fastest VPN !? ) is their commitment to staying one step ahead of the curve .
If a scenario were to present itself that could potentially lessen the effectiveness of the browsing experience provided by Vypr , you need not worry – they ’ve almost certainly thought of a workaround already .
Recent innovations include the enhancement of their Chameleon technology , capable of scrambling metadata do sidestep pesky VPN blocking .
Their slogan – “ do n’t let the internet browse you ” – has never seemed so apt .
How it Works
As if that were n’t enough , their seemingly insatiable desire to go above and beyond the call of duty is evidenced even further when you consider that they offer additional NAT firewall capabilities , adding an extra layer of protection and ensuring that your data is safe from those who you ’d perhaps rather did not have access to it .
And on that note , it is here where we return to our earlier point regarding the effectiveness of Vypr VPN ’s location in Switzerland .
Given that this is where their central offices are located , it stands to reason that this is where all of their customer information is kept , correct ?
Correct .
And what , pray tell , is so special about Switzerland ?
Well , as a nation they are outside of the reach of the seemingly omnipresent NSA as well as the frankly outdated European Union laws on data retention .
They do n’t have to divulge your information to anyone , and nor will they ever .
How ’s that for peace of mind ?

Conclusion
To summarise , then , if you are a particularly privacy - conscious internet browser ( and , let ’s face it , given the state of contemporary society and its love affair with monitoring anything and everything that they possibly can , you most likely are ) , you really should look no further than Vypr VPN for all of your private browsing needs .
Their feature list is so completely and utterly comprehensive that it could fill this page a dozen times and we still would n’t be able to do it justice .
For the fastest , safest , most ahead of the curve VPN service , Vypr should be your first and last thought .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The portion of Baghdad in which Iraqi security forces are in control with minimal help from the American military has grown only slightly in recent months , to just over 8 % , despite an overall decline in insurgent violence in the capital , a senior U.S. commander said Friday .
Maj . Gen. Joseph Fil , speaking to reporters at the Pentagon from his Multinational Division - Baghdad headquarters , painted a generally positive picture but acknowledged that the fighting remains hard .
" The level of violence is way , way down , " Fil said .
" And perhaps more significantly , the ability of the Iraqi security forces to control their own neighborhoods , their own areas , as they stand side by side with American forces — and , in fact , as they take the lead — is growing . "
But it is not growing quickly .
Fil said 8.2 % of the 474 neighborhoods in Baghdad are now in what the U.S. military calls a " retain " phase , meaning security is being maintained by Iraqi forces with U.S. troops in a reserve role .
That is up only slightly from late June when Fil told reporters that it stood at 7 % .
He said 46 % of the neighborhoods are in the " control " phase , meaning security is maintained with U.S. troops in the lead , partnering with Iraqis .
In late June that figure was 42 % .
In April it stood at 19 % .
The goal , which U.S. commanders hoped would be accelerated by the U.S. troop buildup that began in February and will be phased out by next July , is to get all Baghdad neighborhoods cleared of insurgent activity , placed under control by U.S. troops and then retained by Iraqi security forces .
Of the five additional Army brigades that President Bush ordered to the Baghdad area in January , the equivalent of 2 1/2 are inside Baghdad , Fil said .
The rest are north and south of the capital .
Despite the slow pace of progress toward having Iraqi forces maintain control of Baghdad neighborhoods with minimal U.S. troop presence , Fil said he was hopeful that it would accelerate in coming months .
" We 're in a very tough fight down in East Rashid in the southern portion of Baghdad , that has been very successful recently , although it 's been a long tough fight , " he said , adding that he expects large portions of southern Baghdad to transition from the clearance phase to the control phase , and then to the stage where Iraqi security forces are in the lead .
He noted , however , that even after the extra U.S. forces in Baghdad are sent home next year there probably will still be some neighborhoods where security forces have not yet cleared out insurgent activity , much less progressed to the point where Iraqi security forces are in the lead .

PESSIMISTS think they have seen something like this before .
Iran has a nuclear programme that outsiders say is designed to produce a bomb , but which the Iranians insist is not .
America is making threatening noises .
Some outsiders — such as a group of British think - tanks which released a report on the matter on Monday February 5th — worry that a military confrontation could provoke a yet nastier situation in which civilians are the main victims once again .
There are as many differences as similarities this time around , when compared with Iraq .
Whereas Saddam Hussein 's supposed chemical and biological weapons were among the stated reasons for America 's invasion of Iraq , Iran raises the scarier prospect of getting a nuclear bomb within a few years .
Such a weapon in the hands of a leadership that rejects Israel 's right to exist concerns Westerners , just as an overly powerful Iran troubles many neighbours in the region .
But nobody thinks America would invade Iran ; far more likely , any strike would come only from the sky , and perhaps then conducted by America 's ally , Israel .
America 's new secretary of defence , Robert Gates , was recently at pains to state that “ we are not planning for a war with Iran . ”
But some are worrying that increasing tension makes an unplanned war more likely .
America has certainly piled on the pressure .
The American government has made increasingly assertive remarks , notably about the influence of Iran inside Iraq .
On Friday an American intelligence report cited “ Iranian lethal support for select groups of Shia militants ” there .
Such remarks have been backed by the display of more military muscle in the region , including anti-missile batteries and a naval battle - group which are more suited for use against a conventional enemy than against Iraqi insurgents .
In this tense atmosphere small incidents , such as the recent detention of Iranians by American soldiers in a diplomatic compound in northern Iraq , risk becoming an excuse for wider confrontation .
Iran is not shy of raising the temperature itself .
On February 11th , the anniversary of 1979's Islamic Revolution , it is believed that Iran will claim to have made a big step forward in its enrichment of uranium at a centrifuge facility in Natanz .
Iran has already enriched small amounts of uranium ; it may say ( though many will yet doubt it ) that production on an industrial scale is soon possible .
This may encourage Americans and Israelis who think some sort of military intervention is needed to act sooner rather than later .
Many in America are certainly worried about blundering into Iran .
In recent days two Democrats running for president in 2008 , Hillary Clinton and John Edwards , made it clear that they are opposed to strikes ( though nearly all American leaders , of both parties , say no option should be permanently taken off the table ) .
Mrs Clinton wants more dialogue ; Mr Edwards wants to work with European and other allies to isolate Iran .
But neoconservatives and some traditional conservatives who have Mr Bush 's ear say that Iran is irredeemably unreliable , and will use any diplomacy to play for time .
They also warn that although Russia and China signed onto mild UN sanctions for Iran in December , diplomatic action will be blocked by the two powers ( especially Russia ) which remain loth to do much more .
An Iranian announcement of further nuclear progress could yet stiffen spines .
Saudi Arabia said recently that it would try to keep oil prices stable at their current , lower levels .
Besides worrying about the effects that the high prices have on the world economy , the Sunni kingdom may also be trying to put pressure on Iran , whose shaky economy depends on exports of hydrocarbons .
Others see reason for optimism in recent criticism from within Iran of the president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
He was elected promising to improve the lot of the poor , but he may be losing support among both the masses , who have seen little gain in recent years , and in the clerical elite , who worry that he is too provocative of outside powers .
But there is no sign that Iran 's regime is tottering .
Nor is Mr Bush 's administration wavering in its preference for confronting Iran .
Any conflict could , at the least , further inflame troubles inside Iraq , Israel and the Palestinian territories , while driving up oil prices .
It would also worsen relations between Muslims and the rest of the world .
And though it may not be imminent , it is becoming easier to imagine .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
The U.S. military early Tuesday launched a " large - scale " operation against al Qaeda in Iraq militants in the Baquba area , north of Baghdad , killing at least 22 enemy fighters , the Army said in a statement .
" The end state is to destroy the al Qaeda influences in this province and eliminate their threat against the people , " said Brig .
Gen. Mick Bednarek of the 25th Infantry Division .
" That is the number one , bottom - line , up - front , in - your - face , task and purpose . "
Operation Arrowhead Ripper will ultimately involve about 10,000 soldiers and " a full complement of attack helicopters , close air support , Strykers and Bradley Fighting Vehicles . "
The operation is in its opening stages , according to the military .
Coalition raids target Iranian aid
Coalition raids aimed at disrupting the flow of weapons and fighters between Iraq and Iran resulted in the deaths of at least 20 militants early Monday in eastern Iraq , according to a statement from the U.S. military .
Coalition aircraft were called in to strafe fighters who attacked coalition troops in Amara and Majjar al - Kabir , two Shiite cities in the Maysan province bordering Iran , the military said .
" During the close air support , at least 20 terrorists were killed and six suspected terrorists were assessed to be wounded by the strafing , " the military said .
" A vehicle being used by the terrorists as a fighting position was also destroyed by the close air support . "
Coalition forces captured militants who are " believed to be members of the secret cell terrorist network known for facilitating the transport of weapons and explosively formed penetrators , or EFPs , from Iran to Iraq , as well as bringing militants from Iraq to Iran for terrorist training , " the military said .
The military said it has intelligence reports indicating that Amara and Majjar al - Kabir are safe havens and smuggling routes for terrorists to import Iranian weapons into Iraq for the insurgency .
" Reports further indicate that Iranian surrogates , or Iraqis that are liaisons for Iranian intelligence operatives into Iraq , use both Amara and Majjar al - Kabir as safe haven locations , " the military said .
The raids apparently involved Iraqi and British troops in a multinational force .
British troops recently handed over security responsibility for the Maysan province to Iraqi security forces .
A British military spokesman said Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki personally authorized the raids .

Deadly clashes , car bombs
Two car bombs exploded close to each other Monday near a fuel station in southwest Baghdad , killing nine people and wounding 25 others , an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said .
The explosions , which happened on a road between the Saydiya and Dora districts , also damaged several cars , the official said .
Also Monday , gunmen opened fire on garbage collectors in western Baghdad 's Mansour district , killing one and wounding four others , a Baghdad police official said .
Insurgents often target garbage collectors because they discover hidden roadside bombs , the official said .
In the southern Iraqi city of Nasiriya , two people were killed -- including an Iraqi police officer -- and 52 people were wounded in clashes between Iraqi security forces and the Mehdi militia loyal to radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr , according to an Iraqi Interior Ministry official .
Nasiriya is a Shiite city about 230 miles ( 370 kilometers ) south of Baghdad .
West of Baghdad , a car bomb detonated Monday near an outdoor market in the Sunni town of Falluja , killing three people and wounding 10 others , a police official said .
Suspects in mosque bombing arrested
Iraqi security forces arrested four suspects linked to last week 's bombing of a Shiite mosque in Samarra , the U.S. military said Monday .
" Previous intelligence " led troops to a building where they detained the suspects without incident , the military said in a news release .
" Iraqi forces also seized several documents of propaganda , a CD showing attacks against coalition forces , several cell phones , 10 feet of detonation cord , 81 blasting caps , identification cards for [ Al - Askariya Mosque ] access and multiple photos depicting terrorist training , " according to the news release .
Wednesday 's bombing triggered fears that a wave of sectarian violence could begin anew .
When the same mosque was bombed last year , it set off a wave of Sunni - Shiite clashes and reprisal killings .
Security was beefed up after last year 's attack , but Wednesday 's bombing indicated " some breaches " in protecting the mosque , Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said Sunday .
Shiite leaders appealed for calm after Wednesday 's bombing , and Zebari said the Iraqi government 's rapid response helped stem any potential violence .
" We did n't see the backlash and the killing we saw " after the February 2006 blast , he said .
" This time , in fact , a curfew was imposed and the religious , political leaders were united to prevent the kind of sectarian killing we saw last time . "
U.S. soldier killed
A U.S. soldier was killed when a roadside bomb exploded near a foot patrol in southern Baghdad , the military said Monday .
The Multi-National Division - Baghdad soldier 's name was not immediately released because the soldier 's family had not been notified .
" Elements of this unit have conducted numerous patrols and raids in Baghdad this past month , " the U.S. military said in a news release .
" These operations have netted 12 weapons caches and several arrests in an effort to provide a more secure environment for Iraqi citizens . "
The U.S. military death toll in the Iraq war now stands at 3,520 .
Seven civilian contractors also have been killed .
CNN 's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report .
The EU has just released its latest figures about counterfeit products seized at European borders in 2006 , and the music industry 's international trade group ( IFPI ) has jumped on those numbers to call for increased action against Chinese pirates .
Of the 23 million counterfeit CDs and DVDs seized by police last year , 93 percent of them originated in China .
The EU is worried enough about the numbers that it is contributing to a US - led WTO case against China over the matter .
But does purchasing one of these discs mean that you could be supporting terrorism ?
According to the IFPI , it does .
The group yesterday released a list of 10 " inconvenient truths " about music , and it makes for interesting reading .
Here they are :
Pirate Bay , one of the flagships of the anti-copyright movement , makes thousands of euros from advertising on its site , while maintaining its anti-establishment " free music " rhetoric .
AllOfMP3.com , the well - known Russian web site , has not been licensed by a single IFPI member , has been disowned by right holder groups worldwide and is facing criminal proceedings in Russia .
Organized criminal gangs and even terrorist groups use the sale of counterfeit CDs to raise revenue and launder money .
Illegal file - sharers do n’t care whether the copyright - infringing work they distribute is from a major or independent label .
Reduced revenues for record companies mean less money available to take a risk on " underground " artists and more inclination to invest in " bankers " like American Idol stars .
ISPs often advertise music as a benefit of signing up to their service , but facilitate the illegal swapping on copyright infringing music on a grand scale .
The anti-copyright movement does not create jobs , exports , tax revenues and economic growth–it largely consists of people pontificating on a commercial world about which they know little .
Piracy is not caused by poverty .
Professor Zhang of Nanjing University found the Chinese citizens who bought pirate products were mainly middle - or higher - income earners .
Most people know it is wrong to file - share copyright infringing material but wo n't stop till the law makes them , according to a recent study by the Australian anti-piracy group MIPI .
P2P networks are not hotbeds for discovering new music .
It is popular music that is illegally file - shared most frequently .
It 's a strange mix of the obvious and the bizarre .
Point four , for instance , is probably true , and it wo n't come as a surprise to anyone who reads point eight that impoverished Chinese farmers are not the ones doing most of that country 's illegal downloading .
Point three is an odd one ; certainly , somewhere in the world , someone with terrorist intentions has made a few bucks from the sale of counterfeit discs .
But every other point on the list concerns digital file - swapping , not the purchasing of counterfeit CDs on Parisian street corners .
It looks like a subtle attempt to elide the distinctions between the two .
Point five is an attempt to turn the " innovation " argument on its head .
For years , pundits outside the music industry have accused labels of pandering to teens through boy bands and " manufactured " celebrities instead of being concerned with finding , producing , and releasing art .
The IFPI suggests that the labels could ( and would ) be doing exactly that if file - swapping went away .
And then there 's point seven , which is n't an " inconvenient truth " at all but more of a rant against those who prefer giving copyright holders less than absolute control over reproduction rights .
An " anti-copyright movement " does exist , but most of the critical voices in the debate recognize the value of copyright — and actually produce copyrighted works themselves ( Lawrence Lessig , etc . ) .
The second part of the accusation ( " pontificating on a commercial world about which they know little " ) is hardly a statement of fact ; it comes across as angry retort to those outside the music business who would dare to criticize its methods and goals .
It 's too bad that groups like the IFPI resort to such dubious statements to make their point .
Unauthorized file - swapping of copyrighted works is already illegal in most countries ; if people are continuing to engage in it , they are unlikely to be swayed by broadsides against " anti-copyright " crusaders or accusations of funding terrorists .
When it comes to stopping commercial piracy , we applaud the IFPI for its work .
When it comes to disparaging those who favor a softer copyright policy , Ars has an inconvenient truth of our own to share with the music industry : these are the sort of tactics that only entrench consumer opposition .
The rain still pours down like Noah 's flood .
If it 's still raining on July 15 , St Swithin 's day , legend says there 'll be another 40 days of it afterwards .
Meteorologists say there 's not a word of statistical truth in that , but St Swithin was a 10th century bishop who knew no better .
What of the Bishop of Carlisle ?
He said this weekend that the Yorkshire floods are a judgment on society 's moral degradation .
" This is a strong and definite judgment " , says the antedeluvian Rt Rev Graham Dow .
It 's a judgment on pro-gay laws that undermine marriage .
" The sexual orientation regulations are part of a general scene of permissiveness .
We are in a situation where we are liable for God 's judgment which is intended to call us to repentance . "
So there you have it : hang the gays and save the planet .
The Muslim terrorists who want to blow up nightclubs are on the same wavelength .
It 's only a small step from calling down God 's wrath on those you hate to becoming an implement of His will .
Draw what lessons you choose from the current floods , but one thing strikes me forcibly .
Seven people are dead and 27,000 homes have been flooded , along with 5000 businesses .
Maybe 100,000 people in all will return to stinking , filthy homes where the electricity and water does n't work , the drains have backed up , the stink has seeped into the plaster which needs ripping out and floors buckle .
Some people are only just returning home now in Carlisle from the 2005 floods .
Last week 's victims will live with the dank stench indefinitely and at least £ 1bn of damage has been done .
Newspapers and television bulletins enjoy pictures of boats in streets and old ladies carried to safety by gallant firemen , with a frisson of schadenfreude in the sight of someone 's kitchen waist - high in water .
But essentially this disaster has had low key coverage , though it is far worse than foot and mouth in its human effects .
The farming lobby is good at making a noise , but this calamity happened in urban areas of Hull , Sheffield and places up north where national journalists rarely venture .
Imagine if the Thames had burst its banks at Westminster , Chelsea and Fulham .
It would n't have been a weather story but a full - scale national emergency .
The north - south wealth and influence divide is deep on every measurement , despite the revival of northern cities and inner London containing the poorest boroughs of all .
Psychologically , Londoncentricity is getting worse as media fascination with billionaire celebrity , City mega - wealth and the extravagance of Knightsbridge and Mayfair distorts the image of the whole country .
London is the only really well - defended part of Britain , where the Thames barrier is built to withstand everything below a once in 2000 - year freak flood .
London 's value to the nation was always the prime priority .
But it will take disasters happening in rich cities before the reality of climate change forces opinion - makers to put it at the top of the world 's agenda .
Hollywood films about New York under water are scary entertainment : when the real thing happens in black New Orleans , nothing changes .
Floods cause real hardship .
At least a quarter of homes have no contents insurance .
Those who do n't have the £ 150 for basic protection are usually the least able to afford repairs and replacements .
The Association of British Insurers reckons that replacing a low income household 's furnishings and goods would cost at least £ 5000 .
The uninsured are also least likely to have friends with space to put them up or families with money to spare .
The Environment Agency says it is mainly the most deprived postcodes that are the most flood - prone .
Historic social topography shows that in towns the poor live by the river near industrial areas , while the rich are up on the hill .
Guess who is destined for the Thames Gateway flood plain .
Many homes were caught not by rivers but by flash floods from torrential downpours that rose up through overflowing drains .
Extreme weather means drains need redesigning for events that used to only happen every 250 years .
Sheffield has one of the oldest weather records , starting in 1820 .
There has been no rainfall like it since .
This episode may or may not be a climate change symptom - only patterns tell the story , not single events .
The expectation is for more ferocious winter rain and parched summers .
The Environment Agency says there is still a risk of drought as this torrential rain pours off into the sea , not into the water table .
Barbara
Young , chief executive of the agency , says this is a warning of the huge defences needed to cope with climate change .
It is too late now to stop extreme weather worsening , even if - and that 's a big if - urgent international action is taken in time to stop planet meltdown .
Consider , she says , the electricity substations and generators , the police and fire stations , telephone exchanges , the roads and railways lines and all vital services that need to be moved or climate - proofed .
The country 's economic success will depend on adapting , and that now unavoidable cost suddenly looks stupendous .
But as ever , one important question is who will pay the heaviest price , and who will be best placed to avoid the consequences ?
The same question arises over every policy in a nation as profoundly as unequal as ours .
If everything needs to be climate change - proofed then everything needs to be class - proofed too .
Internationally , climate change will hit the poorest hardest , from Bangladesh and the Pacific atolls to the Sahara , while the west has the money to protect itself .
But New Orleans showed how within the rich countries , the way it strikes will emphasise all the existing social inequalities .
Next weekend at Wembley stadium Live Earth links up with seven other mega-concerts around the world , and millions will sign Al Gore 's seven - point climate change pledge .
They will promise to demand their country joins international agreements to cut carbon emissions , to reduce their personal emissions , offset the rest , plant trees and buy from sustainable businesses .
Rock concerts are easy politics that risk suggesting everything can be fixed with no hard choices .
But they do raise awareness .
There is a sense now that everyone knows they should take action , but why do it if no one else is ?
People are waiting for governments to tell them they must : it requires a guarantee of collective action .
Maybe this week 's smoking ban will remind nervous politicians that people will do what they should , but only when everyone else does too .
