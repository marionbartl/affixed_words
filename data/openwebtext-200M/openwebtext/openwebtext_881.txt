[ digg- reddit - me ] From Obama ’s Inaugural Address :
There are some who question the scale of our ambitions — who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans .
Their memories are short .
For they have forgotten what this country has already done ; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose , and necessity to courage .
What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them — that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply .
The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small , but whether it works — whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage , care they can afford , a retirement that is dignified .
Where the answer is yes , we intend to move forward .
Where the answer is no , programs will end .
And those of us who manage the public ’s dollars will be held to account — to spend wisely , reform bad habits , and do our business in the light of day — because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government .
This brings to mind what George Stephanopoulos was so excited about last Sunday on This Week :
( Yes , I need to work on improving my DVR to computer quality . )
It seems that Obama is preparing to bet his presidency on a Grand Bargain – that will allow him ( and us ) to rewrite the social contract in a more extensive way than any president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt .
Even during Obama ’s campaign , he spoke of tackling the challenges that were necessary – and not putting off hard discussions about our country ’s long - term stability .
But the financial crisis – which at first prompted the endlessly parroted conventional wisdom that whoever won would need to cut all of their projects and focus narrowly on the crisis itself – has instead proved to be an opportunity .
The amount of spending needed to stimulate the economy is enormous – with the numbers being thrown around today dwarfing that of any previous government intervention ( save perhaps for our major wars ) .
What Obama understands is that this type of spending , while necessary in the short - term , poses a serious long - term threat .
Which is why he is now speaking of the second step – after the financial crisis has passed – of tackling entitlement reform and tax reform , and finally putting America on sound financial footing after years of prolifigacy .
None of these insights are exceptional .
What is exceptional is how Obama is already shaping the arch of his first term , using this crisis to set up his next objective , and shaping the conventional wisdom .
The problem I see though is that the Obama administration has not done a good job of conveying to the public the place this stimulus bill has within Obama ’s agenda .
The word is that in the next week or so , Tim Geithner will present “ a ‘ comprehensive ’ plan that [ he ] hope [s ] will command market confidence . ”
My hope is that this comprehensive plan will lay out a broad legislative agenda based on Obama ’s campaign .
Based on the campaign plans and signals sent during the transition , here ’s what I see :
Step 1 ( The First 100 Days )
Release the rest of the funds from TARP .
.
A large stimulus package to demonstrate the government ’s commitment to addressing the crisis , especially in alleviating it ’s effects on the majority of Americans .
to demonstrate the government ’s commitment to addressing the crisis , especially in alleviating it ’s effects on the majority of Americans .
A banking and mortgage bill that takes whatever steps are necessary to shore up these sectors of the economy , including new regulations , new oversight , and possibly additional funds .

An infrastructure bill that would create a National Infrastructure Bank .

Health care reforms that would extend health care benefits and attempt to control the escalating health care costs .
that would extend health care benefits and attempt to control the escalating health care costs .
A combination of a cap - and - trade program and funding for green energy .
The goal of this first period would be to begin to make both short - term and long - term investments into those sectors that will lead to long - term growth – which will stimulate the economy in the short - term .
This is the spending stage .
After this burst of legislating , Obama would be able to focus on tinkering with education programs and seeing what works , as well as addressing the simmering foreign policy issues which are constantly threatening to take over the agenda .
Step 2 ( Post - Crisis )
Entitlement reform ( Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid . )
Everything is on the table .
( Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid . )
Everything is on the table .
Tax reform .
Not much has been said about this .
This will certainly be a wild card – but Obama has criticized our corporate tax rate for its irrationality .
It ’s very high – but due to the enormous number of exemptions and credits , the effective rate for those businesses able to lobby for benefits , it is very low .
This should be rationalized .

Universal health care .
. Education reform .
This is the “ cutting back ” stage and consolidation stage .
The goal of this second stage would be to put America on a solid financial footing again – to eliminate the unsustainable domestic policies that undermine our stability and power .
This is obviously an enormous agenda .
And it ’s far from clear that Obama can accomplish this .
But if he does not lay out the vision – which I have pieced together from numerous statements – then it ’s hard to see how he can accomplish it .
Of course , Geithner was just confirmed last week – and Obama ’s only been in office for two weeks – so he does have a bit more time to lay this out .
But he does n’t have long .

Science Quotes by Paul K. Feyerabend ( 11 quotes )
Events and developments , such as the Copernican Revolution , occurred only because some thinkers either decided not to be bound by certain obvious  methodological rules , or because they unwittingly broke them .

Everywhere science is enriched by unscientific methods and unscientific results , ... the separation of science and non-science is not only artificial but also detrimental to the advancement of knowledge .
If we want to understand nature , if we want to master our physical surroundings , then we must use all ideas , all methods , and not just a small selection of them .

Science quotes on : | Advancement
Given any rule , however fundamental  or necessary  for science , there are always circumstances when it is advisable not only to ignore the rule , but to adopt its opposite .
For example , there are circumstances when it is advisable to introduce , elaborate and defend ad hoc hypotheses , or hypotheses which contradict well - established and generally accepted experimental results , or hypotheses whose content is smaller than the content of the existing and empirically adequate alternative , or self - inconsistent hypotheses , and so on .

It is clear , then , that the idea of a fixed method , or of a fixed theory of rationality , rests on too naive a view of man and his social surroundings .
To those who look at the rich material provided by history , and who are not intent on impoverishing it in order to please their lower instincts , their craving for intellectual security in the form of clarity , precision , objectivity  , truth , it will become clear that there is only one principle that can be defended under all circumstances and in all stages of human development .
It is the principle : anything goes .

No theory ever agrees with all the facts in its domain , yet it is not always the theory that is to blame .

February 's brutal chimpanzee attack , during which a pet chimp inflicted devastating injuries on a Connecticut woman , was a stark reminder that chimps are much stronger than humans — as much as four - times stronger , some researchers believe .
But what is it that makes our closest primate cousins so much stronger than we are ?
One possible explanation is that great apes simply have more powerful muscles .
Indeed , biologists have uncovered differences in muscle architecture between chimpanzees and humans .
But evolutionary biologist Alan Walker , a professor at Penn State University , thinks muscles may only be part of the story .
In an article published in the April issue of Current Anthropology , Walker argues that humans may lack the strength of chimps because our nervous systems exert more control over our muscles .
Our fine motor control prevents great feats of strength , but allows us to perform delicate and uniquely human tasks .
Walker 's hypothesis stems partly from a finding by primatologist Ann MacLarnon .
MacLarnon showed that , relative to body mass , chimps have much less grey matter in their spinal cords than humans have .
Spinal grey matter contains large numbers of motor neurons — nerves cells that connect to muscle fibers and regulate muscle movement .
More grey matter in humans means more motor neurons , Walker proposes .
And having more motor neurons means more muscle control .
Our surplus motor neurons allow us to engage smaller portions of our muscles at any given time .
We can engage just a few muscle fibers for delicate tasks like threading a needle , and progressively more for tasks that require more force .
Conversely , since chimps have fewer motor neurons , each neuron triggers a higher number of muscle fibers .
So using a muscle becomes more of an all - or - nothing proposition for chimps .
As a result , chimps often end up using more muscle than they need .
" [ A ]nd that is the reason apes seem so strong relative to humans , " Walker writes .
Our finely - tuned motor system makes a wide variety of human tasks possible .
Without it we could n't manipulate small objects , make complex tools or throw accurately .
And because we can conserve energy by using muscle gradually , we have more physical endurance — making us great distance runners .
Great apes , with their all - or - nothing muscle usage , are explosive sprinters , climbers and fighters , but not nearly as good at complex motor tasks .
In other words , chimps make lousy guests in china shops .
In addition to fine motor control , Walker suspects that humans also may have a neural limit to how much muscle we use at one time .
Only under very rare circumstances are these limits bypassed — as in the anecdotal reports of people able to lift cars to free trapped crash victims .
" Add to this the effect of severe electric shock , where people are often thrown violently by their own extreme muscle contraction , and it is clear that we do not contract all our muscle fibers at once , " Walker writes .
" So there might be a degree of cerebral inhibition in people that prevents them from damaging their muscular system that is not present , or not present to the same degree , in great apes . "
Walker says that testing his hypothesis that humans have more motor neurons would be fairly straightforward .
However , he concedes that testing whether humans have increased muscle inhibition could be a bit more problematic .
Battle Over Bonuses : Govt .
Says Bank of America Threatens to Sue Employee Willing to Talk Bank wants bonus figures kept confidential , NY AG fights for public disclosure .
March 6 , 2009  --
The battle for bonus figures in the New York State investigation into the merger of Merrill Lynch and Bank of America got even uglier today , with the bank " threatening to sue " a former employee who was willing to unconditionally tell the state 's attorney general which Merrill high - fliers received the thickest slices of a $ 3.6 billion bonus pie that was dished out on the eve of the January merger , state officials said Friday .
This latest public chapter came as New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office replied to court documents filed Thursday by Bank of America that urged that the information remain confidential and that the confidentiality extend beyond former Merrill CEO John
Thain 's testimony to include statements from other executives , at least four of whom have already testified .
Fresh testimony given Thursday by former Merrill executive Gregory Fleming prompted the alleged threat to sue , Cuomo 's office said .
Bank of America would not comment on specifics but said in a statement , " Bank of America has continually offered to provide the information the attorney general is seeking if he would agree to an appropriate confidentiality agreement .
He has continually declined . "
In response to Cuomo 's assertions in court documents that Bank of America 's confidentiality conditions were unwarranted , the bank replied in a statement that Cuomo 's investigation did not require the freedom to argue his case in the news media .
" Bank of America does not believe the attorney general needs the freedom to place private , personal information in the news media in order to conduct his investigation and determine if laws were possibly broken , " said the statement issued by Scott Silvestri , a company spokesman .
The chief of Cuomo's Investor Protection Bureau , David Markowitz , argued otherwise in the court filing , to which Silvestri responded .
" Bank of America makes an unfounded assertion of confidentiality , even though it has no policy to protect the information .
Its employees routinely share their compensation with competitors when seeking new employment , and Bank of America regularly seeks and obtains detailed compensation information from its competitors ' employees , " Markowitz said in a letter to New York State Supreme Court Justice Bernard Fried .
Fried is overseeing the confidentiality spat and is expected to rule next week on the issue as it pertains to testimony taken from Thain .
Contentious Issue Over Bonuses
The ongoing wrangle over the disclosure of bonus information is a hot button issue in the probe into whether Merrill Lynch or Bank of America , or either firm 's employees , violated securities laws in the awarding of $ 3.6 billion in bonuses on the eve of the merger .
Cuomo wants the information without any restrictions on its release to the public , a condition that Bank of America finds unacceptable .
The bank maintains that disclosing the specifics of compensation packages awarded to individual investors would , among other things , place the firm at a competitive disadvantage .
The probe into the compensation issue was triggered by the disclosure that Merrill had , in consultation with Bank of America , accelerated its normal schedule for awarding the 2008 annual bonuses so that they were distributed in early December , weeks prior to early January 2009 merger with Bank of America .
In past years those bonuses would have been awarded in 2009 -- after the merger occurred .
In 2008 , Merrill had losses in excess of $ 27 billion and was on the verge of collapse .
The merger with Bank of America spared Merrill , but between them , the two financial behemoths accepted $ 45 billion in public bailout funds .
When it was disclosed that 696 Merrill employees had received bonuses of more than $ 1 million , Cuomo 's office sprung into action , launching a probe to determine whether any securities laws were broken .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) - Dell Inc.'s anticipated effort to release a mobile phone has stalled after suffering from " a lack of interest " among cellular carriers , according to a research note published Friday .
Kaufman Bros. analyst Shaw
Wu wrote that Dell's DELL , +0.04 % prototype devices , designed to run software from both Microsoft Corp. MSFT , - 0.15 % and Google Inc. GOOG , - 0.30 % , have so far failed to distinguish themselves from a growing field of competitors .
" From our conversations with supply chain and industry sources , it appears that it ultimately came down to lack of carrier interest , " Wu wrote .
Rumors of a branded Dell mobile phone have been swirling since January , when speculation surfaced that the company might unveil a device at a high - profile event such as last month 's Mobile World Congress .
See related story on Dell phone reports .
But
Wu wrote that the potentially small subsidies from carriers operating cellular networks to help sell Dell 's devices meant it would be difficult for the Round Rock , Tex. - based PC giant to make a profit .
A representative for Dell did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
The company has never confirmed that it is working on a mobile device .
A smartphone from Dell would face a slew of tough competitors , including the BlackBerry from Research In Motion RIMM and the iPhone from Apple Inc. AAPL , +0.29 % .
Wu noted that another potential rival is the up - coming Pre smartphone from Palm Inc. PALM , , which is expected to launch by June 30 .
See story on investor enthusiasm about the Pre .
" Palm Pre has not helped " Dell 's efforts ,
Wu wrote , as it has generated " interest from carriers as a viable competitor . "
Wu wrote that Dell has not abandoned its effort to release a mobile device , though it has " gone back to the drawing board " to design a more distinct model , which may involve making related acquisitions .
He may be the voice of a generation .
But if you 're unfortunate enough to live next door to Bob Dylan , stirring protest songs and shrill mouth organ music are n't the only things that might be – to paraphrase his most famous lyric – blowin ' in the wind .
The star has become embroiled in a gloriously petty dispute involving the allegedly noxious smell emanating from a portable lavatory sited in the grounds of his sprawling cliff - top home overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Malibu .
Neighbours of the reclusive Dylan – who has owned an estate at Point Dune , a famous beauty spot north - west of Los Angeles , for more than two decades – went public this week with complaints that night - time sea breezes are sending the odour of raw sewage wafting into their homes .

One family , who news crews have described as being " tangled up in poo " , complained this week to police that the stench has made their child ill and forced them to abandon the upstairs bedrooms of their house on warm nights .
" Mr Civil Rights is killing our civil rights ! " David Emminger told reporters , while pointing out the controversial , blue portable lavatory , which is behind a storage container next to a wire fence that marks the border of Dylan 's property .
Since it was installed six months ago , apparently to cater for security staff who patrol Dylan 's grounds at night , Mr Emminger claims the lavatory has made portions of his family home uninhabitable .
He is unable to sleep on some nights , he alleges , and his eight - year - old son , David junior , has fallen ill from the fumes .
" It started in September .
I 'd go into the front yard and get nauseous , " Mr Emminger 's wife , Cindy , told the Los Angeles Times .
" I could n't figure out at first where the smell was coming from , until I finally noticed that they had moved the porta - potty directly in front of my front door .
We both have allergies and are sensitive to chemicals .
It 's worse when it 's misty outside at night .
We turn on the five fans , but it still gets inside our house .
We 're not even using the upstairs now .
We sleep downstairs . "
Malibu City public health officials are investigating the complaint by the couple , who have installed five industrial - sized outdoor fans in their front yard to blow noxious fumes back on to Dylan 's property .
The city apparently tried to send an officer to inspect the contentious lavatory in January , but he was turned away by Dylan 's security staff and accused of trespassing .
" [ The guard ] said they were going to sue the city , " an inspector told the LA Times .
Dylan has yet to comment on the affair , and neither his spokesman nor his New York - based attorney was returning calls on what headline - writers billed " outhouse blues " yesterday .
Local bylaws prohibit homeowners from producing excessive odours .
It is n't the first time that Dylan 's Malibu property , on one of the most expensive portions of real estate in California , has been at the centre of controversy .
A guardhouse that Dylan built to accommodate his 24 - hour security detail sparked a planning row in 1989 , when Los Angeles County building and safety inspectors refused it a permit for being inaccessible to the disabled .
The singer bypassed legal accessibility requirements by promising , in writing , that he " would not hire any handicapped persons " to work in his security staff .
文字コードの標準化について日記を書いたのだが、内容がいまいちだったのでボツにして気を取り直してUnicodeについて一言いっておくことにする。先日、といっても昨年(２００８年)の10月なんだけど、その中でちょと文字コードの標準化について話をしている。*1
20年前だったら絶対言えない本音を時効が来たのでばりばり言っている。上の発言は20年前だったらオフレコでも多分言えない。若い人は上記の歴史の証言を生まれていないからスルーしちゃうけど、時代は垂直統合と言って、メインフレーマーがハードウェア（メインフレーム）からOSからコンパイラからRDBMSからミドルウェアからアプリケーションのインテグレーションから運用まで一切合切握っていたというころである。
ユーザーをロックインして、スイッチングコストを高くして、利益を確保するというビジネスモデルである。かつての日本のメインフレーマーは、IBMに追いつけ追い越せでハードウェアやOSをいかにパクって、ユーザーを自社ハードに引き寄せるか、そのような商売をしていた。日立製作所と三菱電機の社員がIBMのOSのソースコードを違法に米国国外へ持ち出そうとして逮捕されたりした時代である。
本音と建前の標準化の世界である。
それで、私はそういう事情を全然知らないから「そうか6,000文字とか7,000文字もみんなと協力して新規に追加するなんて大変だな･･･」なんて素直に思ってるわけです。「今度の
0208は、文字数倍くらいになっちゃうのか･･･どうやって実装するのかな？ソフトウェアとか書き変えなくちゃいけないのかな？」なんてナイーブに思っちゃってて、会社に戻って「みんなと検討しないと、凄い大変なことになってますよ」なんてことを思ってるわけですよ。大きな勘違いなんだけど･･･。
若いって、業界のお作法を知らないから。
最初は2バイトの国際標準にしようというお話だったのだけど、それじゃあ足りないから4バイトにしよう。しかしバイトというのは何ビットか不明なので、Multi-Octet(8ビット)の標準を作るということになった。
例えば大漢和字典なんていう辞典には親字だけでだいたい50,000文字くらいあるから、そうすると16bitだとベターに使っても64,000ぐらいしか入らないんですね。
大漢和でもういっぱいいっぱいだとすると、中国とか韓国とかを持ってくると16bitではちょっと厳しいかなということが研究していくうちにだんだん分かってきて、今から20年前にですね「 Apple 」と「 Xerox」の人たちが16bitで世界中の文字を表現しようということで、
Unicodeっていう仕様を提案するわけですね。
バージョン1.0のUnicodeっていうのは、あまりにも杜撰だったんで、そのまますぐには使い物にならなくて国際標準の世界では1度は否決されたんだけど、とりあえず16bitでガッツリ行こうぜっていうコンセプトのもとでもってきたんですね。
日本のベンダーをはじ め「 IBM 」 も「 DEC 」 もそうなんだけど、今ある文字コードを全部チャラにして丸っきり互換性のないものを導入するにはあまりにもコストがかかるし、「それはいくらなんでも厳しいんじゃない？」みたいな感じだったんですよ。
当時ISOで議論されていたドラフ ト( DIS 10646という) はデフォルト２オクテットで各国のJIS/GB/KSなどの標準をそのまま94*94の面を4つ用意してそこに埋めるという案だった。1オクテットのコードとの混在は考えていない、２オクテットのみという使い方。混在したい時はエスケープシーケンスでやってね。という今から考えても実にアバウトな設計だった。94*94なのでコントロールコード(0x00〜0x1f)および空白( 0x20)、削除( 0x7f)などの部分が避けられていた。
一方Unicodeの方は94*94ではなく、べたに0x0000~0xffffまで使うということで、1オクテットでみると０やコントロールコードなどが入っているので、そのままではCの文字列(char *)に使えないなどという問題もあった。
だけどマルチバイトのユニバーサルな文字コードっていうのは絶対に必要だねっていうのが、ベースのベースではありましたね。でも、ベースのベースではあったんだけどJISのX 0208ですら同意しようとしていない日本のベンダーは「そんなもんは絵空事で、20世紀中に出てくるわけねぇ」みたいな感じで、言うのは簡単だけど誰も使いやしないし実装もコスト高くなるし、いったい誰がそんなもん使うんだみたいな感じでしたね。Unicodeを皆で標準化しようなんていうことに関しては、むしろ足引っ張るみたいな感じだったんですよ。本来なら尊敬すべき偉い人だと思うんですけど、会社の事情でエンドユーザに対して迷惑かけてるなと、そういうことを平気でやるんだこの人たちはと、30歳ぐらいの青臭い私は思うわけですよ。
私は思うわけだ。世界のソフトウェアが初めから世界の言葉をサポートする世界がきたら素敵だなと思うわけだ。思うのは自由だ。それを実装するのは大変だけど。
一方で 、Unicode作ってる連中の最初の提案はボロボロだったんだけど、この1つのものを皆で作ればソフトウェアの作りも簡単になるし、一発ソフトウェア書けばそれが世界中の人たちに使われるんだっていう極めて分かりやすい理想を掲げてるわけですよ。
そういうのはメインフレーマーじゃなくて「アップル」とか「マイクロソフト」とか「サン･マイクロ」とかいう割と小さい会社だったりして、徐々に私はそっちの方に共感していくわけですよ。
そ の16bit の文字を使うためにコンパイラはどういう風に変えなくちゃいけないのかとかね、それをするために「OSはどういうような仕組みにしなくちゃいけないのか」とかっていうのを必死になって考えて、例えば「マイクロソフト」ならWindowsNTにUnicodeをはじめから採用しますとか、Cのコンパイラに Unicode用のwchar_tみたいなのを作りますとかいう色んなことをベースからどんどんどんどん作っていくんですね。
それはそ のUnicodeな らUnicodeっていうことで、「 アップル 」 も「 IBM 」 も「 サン･マイクロ 」 も「 HP 」 も「 DEC 」 のエンジニアも共同で協力してなにがしかを作るという感じでしたね。
もちろん企業間競争はあるんだけど、足の引っ張り合いじゃなくて、いいものを作るっていうことに関しては腹割ってやるっていうエンジニアの非常に真面目な技術に対するロイヤリティの高さっていうのを垣間見て「おぉこいつらすごいなぁ･･･」と、こういう人たちと仕事したら気持ちいいだろうなっていう風に思いましたね。
会社や国の壁を越えてコラボレーションするのは本当に面白い。素晴らしい経験だったと思う。
そこが非常に私にとってはアイロニーの部分なんです。日本の企画（まま）委員会に入ったが故にそういうものを見て、国際標準の世界を見、180度違うパラダイムがあって、垂直統合から水平統合に世の中が変わっていく瞬間を見、「DEC」っていう会社がなくなっちゃって、90年代になって「オラクル」っていう会社に転職をしたんですね。だからある意味で言うとメインフレーム型の垂直統合の典型的な会社から、水平統合の典型的な会社へ転職したんです。その表と裏にはやっぱりJISの委員会とISOの委員会の表と裏があったんですね。ISOも本音部分ではドロドロした部分があったとしても、いかに建前を尊重して理想に近づけていくかっていうことを各社の標準化委員会に出てきている人たちエキスパートは相当真面目にやってましたね。
国際標準の世界ももちろん政治的かけひきや本音と建前はあるけど、だけど、わたしのユメであるいつの日か世界のソフトウェアが初めから世界の言葉をサポートするんだというものに、本音がどうであれ、皆共感してくれたと思う。ユメをみんなで共有していたような気がする。
日本人は英語が不得意だからとか世界標準を作るのが不得意だからと訳知り顔で言う人がいるが、そんなのは嘘である。本当に標準を作りたいのであれば英語は問題ではない。志の問題だと思う。
で、当時の日本のメインフレーマに所属していた人たちは世界標準を心の底から作ることを望んでいなかった。少なくとも作ることに本気ではなかったように思う。
非常に残念である 。
もし 、Unicodeをよくすることに、彼らが協力していれば、日本のソフトウェア産業もひょっとしたら輸出産業になったかもしれないが、歴史はそうはならなかった。

The International Coalition for Genital Integrity ( ICGI ) calls on all state Medicaid programs still covering newborn circumcision to cease that coverage so the funds can be diverted to healing children ; this follows a letter published yesterday in the American Journal of Public Health that raised significant new concerns about this unnecessary — and often harmful — surgery .
" Newborn circumcision places infants at immediate risk of bleeding , infection , MRSA , permanent loss of the foreskin's benefits , penile damage , and in rare cases , death , " explains John W. Travis , M.D. , M.P.H. , and co-author of the letter .
" It is harmful and unethical to place infants at immediate risk for these complications just to possibly reduce risk of adult acquired sexually transmitted diseases , especially when other prevention methods exist and are superior . "
ICGI Director , Dan Bollinger adds , " Given the current economic crisis , the spiraling health care costs in the United States , and the large number of people in this nation who lack basic health care , it is unjustifiable to waste taxpayer money on a million unnecessary surgeries each year .
Medicaid coverage of circumcision misleads parents into assuming that circumcision is advisable , like vaccinations .
Medicaid parents know that Medicaid only funds medically necessary procedures .
We have heard from a number of Medicaid covered parents who circumcised their son because they though it was required , only to learn later that it was unnecessary .
Parents are not being fully informed that circumcision is elective .
They are often only told to sign the forms .
If they do n't sign the first time , they are repeatedly asked until they do .
This is an ethically questionable and perhaps fraudulent practice .
Elimination of coverage is the surest way to ensure that parents know circumcision is not necessary . "
Decision - makers often assume that circumcision is somehow beneficial to boys ( and detrimental to girls ) .
This fallacy is based on a hundred years of circumcision being promoted as a " cure - all . "
The letter clarified this mistake : " Although there is no evidence that boys not circumcised at birth are any less healthy than those who are circumcised , there is evidence of the opposite . "
This fact holds true whether the boy is born into a poor family , or a wealthy one .
However , wealthy families have access to better healthcare , which includes being better informed of circumcision 's risks .
And , most physicians do not circumcise their sons .
Circumcision is a multi-million dollar " add - on sale . "
An ICGI national Medicaid survey revealed that more circumcisions are performed in states that pay more for circumcision .
Sixteen state Medicaid programs and numerous private insurance providers have recognized that medically unnecessary circumcisions should not be covered .

You Spent * How * Much On That ?
A couple of months back , I was talking to the folks at Puget Systems for the first time , and in our initial discussion , they mentioned a high - end system they were working on .
Curious as to what the company meant by a true high - end machine , I asked about the box 's innards .
The project was just getting started and it would apparently require lots of customization , so I naturally wanted to know more .
It turned out that the system would cost in excess of $ 16,000 .
Given the enthusiasm over our $ 5,000 System Builder Marathon machine ( despite its prohibitively high price tag ) , we just had to get a complete album of what goes into a box priced at more than three times what we already considered to be the ultimate enthusiast build .
In the pages to come , we 'll give you the customer 's reason for wanting such a powerhouse , the full list of specs , and plenty of shots of what Puget had to do to get this thing running the way it wanted .
Something Special
We asked Puget what its goals were in building this thing and , perhaps more important , what was their customer hoping to get out of it .
They answered with the following :
" Our client came to us with a need we hear often : he wanted a high performance machine , but wanted it quiet .
Of course , “ quiet ” is a subjective term ...
Building a mainstream PC to be quiet is n't difficult at all , but high - performance machines are more challenging .
This particular computer has four quad - core Opteron processors , 32 GB of memory , two VelociRaptor hard drives in RAID1 , and six 1 TB hard drives in RAID 5 .
That 's not a easy machine to make quiet !
We opted to cool the machine with a massive radiator mounted to the side of the case , providing an extreme amount of radiator surface area , allowing us to run the fans at 5 V for nearly silent operation .
And the temperature on the CPUs ?
36 C at idle , 45 C at load .
We begin by testing the board under air cooling , to make sure the motherboard , CPUs , and memory are working properly .
It takes half a day to run one pass of MemTest ! "
A Little Custom Prep Work
While the components are tested under air cooling , the chassis is prepared for the liquid cooling modding and assembly .
More Custom Prep Work
The radiator used to cool the system will accommodate nine 120 mm fans .
With that amount of surface area , the fans can be run at the minimum voltage needed to get them to spin and still have all the cooling power needed .
Water Cooling Enterprise Hardware
Puget used Koolance CPU blocks on each of the four CPUs .
" Not only do they work well , Puget says , " but their polished finish looks great .
Since the chassis has a window , we want to make sure everything looks as great as it functions . "
Mounting Water Blocks
A shot of the water blocks being installed onto each of the Opteron 8350 processors .
Each of the 2 GHz CPUs dissipates up to 75 W of heat .
Individually , they would n't be too hard to keep cool .
But four of the chips in one system present more of a challenge .
And The Modding Begins
Some of the mod work is done the old fashioned way , using tools many enthusiasts probably remember from their early days of case alteration .
Ah , to be working on a solid steel side - panel with a Dremel again ...
Do -It - Yourself Radiator Mounting
To space the radiator away from the side of the chassis , risers had to be created out of brass tubing .
This allows Puget to create exactly the spacing they needed for optimal cooling .
Close - Up Of The Standoffs
The brass tubing stands the radiator off from the Cooler Master Stacker 810's side panel , facilitating better air flow .
Puget went with MagiCool 's Xtreme Nova 1080 radiator and nine 120 mm fans .
Mounting Radiator To The Side Panel
The rest of Puget 's water - cooling circuit consists of four Koolance water blocks ( CPU - 340 ) , Koolance 's RP - 1000 BK reservoir and pump , and the same company 's liquid cooling fluid .
Prepping The Chassis For Tubing
Holes are drilled into the side of the chassis to allow the liquid cooling tubing to pass through .
People can get very worked up about their hobbies , and comic books are no exception .
Final Crisis , for instance , has inspired some very passionate responses .
Between that and Barry Allen replacing Wally West * , I ’ve seen a number of people say things like “ I ’ll never read another DC comic again ! ” **
I do n’t understand this reaction .
To clarify : I understand dropping comics because you ’ve lost interest in them .
( I ’m down to one ongoing DC book , Flash , and it ’s technically been canceled . )
I also understand dropping a series because of something you disliked in that series .
If you do n’t want to read it anymore , then by all means , you should n’t be obligated to read it anymore ( but be prepared for people to tell you that you are n’t a “ true fan , ” whatever that means ) .
What I do n’t understand is protesting something that happens in one book by refusing to buy other books .
It just does n’t make sense to me .
If you like , say , Booster Gold but dislike the direction that Batman is going in , dropping both series is n’t going to encourage DC to make more books like Booster Gold .
Maybe it ’s because I ’ve never been one to refuse to buy a company ’s comics .
I might have held Marvel and Image in disdain back in my teenage years , but if something looked interesting , that did n’t stop me from buying it .
( Not that I found much of it interesting , but it was n’t a hard - and - fast rule . )
So I ’m curious :
Who out here has done this ?
Or are you planning to ?
What tipped you over the edge ?
Why did you decide to drop all of the company ’s books and not just the ones that bothered you ?
Did you extend it to other brands owned by the same company ( Vertigo , Icon , etc. ) or only the particular division ?
How long did you keep it up , and if you went back , what did it take ?
* Yes , Barry is replacing Wally .
Wally has highlighted the main Flash book for most of the last 23 years , and after Flash : Rebirth is over , Barry will , and it looks like Barry will be taking the Flash spot in Justice League of America as well , leaving Wally in Titans .
Just because they have n’t actually killed Wally does n’t mean he ’s not being replaced .
** Update : Lying in the Gutters reports that a lot of retailers have been hearing this , too — from their customers .

An American fighter jet shot down an Iranian drone as it was flying over Iraq , U.S. military sources in Baghdad tell Danger Room .
Details of the previously - unreported shoot - down , which occurred last month , are still sketchy .
But we do know that American commanders have long accused Tehran of supplying weapons and training to all sorts of Iraqi militant groups .
Shi'ite militias fired Iranian rockets at U.S. troops in Iraq , according to the American military ; Sunni militias allegedly used Iranian armor- piercing bombs to reduce U.S. vehicles to ribbons .
In early 2008 , however , the torrent of Iranian weapons into Iraq slowed to a trickle , the U.S. said .
And now , the new Obama administration is looking for ways to reach out to the Tehran regime – dangling invitations to international conferences , and offering promises of renewed relations .
Which means the drone incident comes at a particularly sensitive time .
Iran has built an array of unmanned aerial vehicles , or UAVs .
The pneumatically launched Ababil ( " Swallow " ) has a wingspan of more than 10 feet , and cruises at 160 knots , according to Globalsecurity.org .
The Mohajer or Misrad ( " Migrant " ) drone is a bit smaller , and slower - flying .
Iran has supplied Hezbollah , the Lebanese terror group , with both models .
Misrad drones flew reconnaissance missions in both November 2004 and April 2005 .
Then , in 2006 , during Hezbollah's war with Israel , the group operated both Misrads and Ababils over Israel 's skies .
At least one was shot down by Israeli fighter jets .
Since then , Tehran claims to have radically upgraded its unmanned fleet .
In 2007 , Iran said it built a drone with a range of 420 miles .
In February , Iran 's deputy defense minister claimed its latest UAV could now fly as far as 600 miles – a huge improvement over crude drones like the Misrad , if true .
Iran often exaggerates what its weapons can do .
But , if this drone really can stay in the air for that long , the Washington Times notes , " it could soar over every
U.S. military installation , diplomatic mission or country of interest in the Middle East . "
Including those in Iraq .
UPDATE : So I finally got a hold of a spokesman for Multi- National Corps - Iraq .
His response : " I believe MNF - I [ Multi-National Forces - Iraq – Corps ' bosses , basically ] is taking the lead on this incident . "
So then I reached out to MNF - I .
A spokesman there would n't confirm the shoot - down .
Nor would he deny it .
" We 've got nothing for you , Noah , " the spokesman said .

The American Issues Project ( AIP ) states on its website that it was " founded to champion the conservative values that have made the United States of America a blessed nation : smaller government , a strong and ready national defense , lower taxes , and a government that encourages entrepreneurship and new job creation in America . " [ 1 ]
On its website AIP lists its media contact as being Christian Pinkston from the Pinkston Group , a Virginia - based PR company . [ 2 ]
The group has two GOP operatives as consultants who are connected to the most influential conservative groups of the 2004 presidential election , Chris LaCivita who worked with Swift Boat Veterans for Truth , and Tony Feather who co-founded Progress for America . [ 3 ]
Anti-Obama ad
In August 2008 AIP launched a televisions advertisement seeking to tie Barack Obama to William Ayers , a former member of the Weather Underground .
" Beyond the speeches , how much do you really know about Barack Obama ? " , the ad asked . [ 4 ]
Associated Press reported that " the lone financier of the anti-Obama ad , Texas billionaire Harold Simmons , was also one of the main funders of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth who targeted Kerry .
Simmons , a McCain fundraiser , contributed nearly $ 2.9 million to the American Issues Project , according to documents filed by the group with the Federal Election Commission . " [ 5 ]
Nuclear , oil and coal booster
On its website , AIP outlines measures that it claims would " release ourselves from the grip of foreign oil .
We need to harness solar , wind and nuclear power and other emerging technologies and reward businesses that invest in these alternative energy sources .
But this alone is not enough .
We need to increase our domestic production by allowing exploration and drilling offshore and in ANWR .
We also need to pursue oil shale and coal - to - liquid fuel , which could provide more than 100 years of energy . " [ 6 ]

TIANJIN , China  Chinese leaders have adopted a plan aimed at turning the country into one of the leading producers of hybrid and all - electric vehicles within three years , and making it the world leader in electric cars and buses after that .
The goal , which radiates from the very top of the Chinese government , suggests that Detroit ’s Big Three , already struggling to stay alive , will face even stiffer foreign competition on the next field of automotive technology than they do today .
“ China is well positioned to lead in this , ” said David Tulauskas , director of China government policy at General Motors .
To some extent , China is making a virtue of a liability .
It is behind the United States , Japan and other countries when it comes to making gas - powered vehicles , but by skipping the current technology , China hopes to get a jump on the next .
Many sports are violent , of this fact there is no denial .
Professional wrestling ?
Well , though not , by the popular vernacular , a ‘ sport ’ , is still pretty damn violent .
Extreme Cage Fighting ?
Now that ’s the epitome of purposeful brutality .
Crap , even Football , that most structured of all sports where every single guy on the opposing team is out to literally smash your ass to the ground , is quite gruesome .
Yet , when it comes to hockey , it has become almost a joke when the violence erupts during a game .
Fights , despite the fact that they are fewer and further between than they used to be , are still as popular as ever .
Now , even though this particular article is n’t all about fights and the blood they inevitably create , they do make an appearance .
The other incidents are just plain unlucky happenstance , albeit just as viciously gory .
I ’ll warn you , some of these are n’t easy to watch .
St. Louis Blues Vs. Buffalo Sabres – 1989 – Clint Malarchuck
The infamous moment occurring here features Clint Malarchuk .
During a game on March 22 , 1989 , between the visiting Blues and Malarchuk ’s Sabres , Steve Tuttle of the Blues and Uwe Krupp of the Sabres collided at the mouth of the goal with Tuttle ’s skate catching Malarchuk on the neck , severing his carotid artery
Florida Panthers Vs. Buffalo Sabres – 2008 – Richard Zednik
On February 10 , 2008 , in a game between the Panthers and the Sabres , teammate Olli Jokinen , tripped over the leg of Sabres ’ forward Clarke MacArthur and sliced Zedník ’s external carotid artery with his right skate blade .
Zedník immediately skated to the Florida bench , leaving a trail of blood on the ice .
Toronto Maple Leafs Vs. Ottawa Senators – 2000 – Bryan Berard
On March 11 , 2000 , during a Leafs game against the Senators in Ottawa , the stick of Marian Hossa clipped Berard in the right eye , severely injuring it .
The eye had been slit on sclera which often results a retinal tear and a detached retina .
Despite being optimistic about his future in the league , he ended up receiving a $ 6.5 million settlement from his insurance company , what many considered to be a career - ending settlement .
Detroit Red Wings Vs. Calgary Flames – 2004 – Steve Yzerman
On May 1 , 2004 , Steve Yzerman was hit in the eye by a deflected slapshot from the stick of fellow Wing , Matthieu Schneider in a playoff game against the Flames , breaking his orbital bone and scratching his cornea .
He had eye surgery following the incident , and was sidelined for the rest of that post - season .
The eye injury also forced Yzerman to miss the 2004 World Cup of Hockey .
Washington Capitals Vs. Dallas Stars – 2006 – Jamie Heward
On November 30th , 2006 , Dallas center Mike Modano ’s skate kicked up from the rear and sliced open the left side of Heward ’s face from the bridge of his nose to the outside of the left eye .
Heward went down immediately , then just as quickly rose and darted for the bench while the blood flowed freely from his face .
Montreal Canadiens Vs. Boston Bruins – 1978 – Pierre Bouchard Vs. Stan Jonathan
In the Bouchard / Jonathan fight , both men shed the gloves simultaneously , the strength of the big defenseman is evident as he yanks the bucking Jonathan up and down .
It is Bouchard who gets off first : Bouchard ’s first punch strikes Jonathan ’s helmet ; his second punch slides over the top of that helmet - and then he misses every other punch he manages to throw in this brief but furious bout .
Those misses are caused by Jonathan ’s boxer - like skill in juking to his left as he returns fire with his own right ; Bouchard ’s battering - ram rights all slide by the right side of Jonathan ’s face .
And then there ’s the blood .
Toronto Maple Leafs Vs. New York Rangers – 1997 – Nick Kypreos Vs. Ryan VandenBussche
Vandy sees his opening and pounces .
POW , he drills Kypreos with a single straight left , smack in the face .
Kypreos is instantly rendered unconscious and falls right down , face - first : bloody .
VandenBussche stops fighting immediately and goes directly to the penalty box .
Chicago Blackhawks Vs. Boston Bruins – 2007 – David Koci Vs. Zdeno Chara
A small mess starts behind the net .
Chara is tangled up with Koci .
They skate away from the crowd and drop the gloves .
Chara gets a few good punches in , then he gets a nice right in that cuts Koci ’s forehead and nose .
The refs come in to stop the fight because Koci ’s a bloody mess .

Yesterday ’s glimpse of springtime reminded me that bikini season is nigh , and with it the dread of cellulite thighs .
Cellulite — likened to orange peels , cottage cheese , and pillow - top mattresses — is caused by stretched - out fat cells .
Unable to hold their shape as they bulge out , these fatty deposits stipple the skin .
What to do ?
Look for answers from the country that ’s almost all coastline .
Croatian doctor Karmela Altabas and her colleagues recently published a provocative hypothesis in my favorite journal , Medical Hypotheses .
Cellulite , they say , might be be cured by sildenafil citrate , aka Viagra .
Thus far , Viagra has been useful to women indirectly — the drug aids and abets male arousal , keeping a a lover erect far longer than nature would allow .
Basically , it triggers a chemical process that relaxes the smooth muscles of the penile artery .
Turgid with blood , the penis stays erect until the drug wears off .
( It does n’t work on women because female arousal , desire , and orgasm are more complicated . )
According to the researchers , cellulite bulges are like flaccid penises — they ’re both caused by weak blood flow .
Viagra may solve the problem .
The same chemical reaction that opens the phallic valves may also improve “ microcirculation ” under the skin , increasing blood flow and keeping cell membranes taut .
Just as erectile tissue becomes smooth and tight , so , hopefully , would the butt and thighs .
Moreover , high doses of sildenafil citrate has been shown to kill fat cells in cultures .
Altabas and her colleagues predict a topical form of sildenafil citrate within a few years — a cream , perhaps .
To penetrate the skin , application would be followed by iontophoresis , a tiny electric charge .
Smear and zap — perfect thighs !
But how long would the magic last ?
If it ’s any measure , a Viagra - fueled erection can last four hours — or one afternoon of sex on the beach .
The public prosecutor leading the investigation into the shooting dead by Bolivian police of Co Tipperary man Michael Dwyer and two others in a hotel last Thursday has said he has found no evidence to date that the group was planning to assassinate Bolivia ’s left - wing president and other senior government leaders .
Mr Dwyer ’s body still lay in room 457 of the Hotel Las Americas in the eastern city of Santa Cruz when Alvaro Garcia Linera , Bolivia ’s vice - president , told a press conference in the capital , La Paz , last Thursday that he , the two other dead men and two others arrested at the scene , were “ mercenary terrorists ” with plans to kill Evo Morales , himself and other leading public figures .
But public prosecutor Marcelo Sosa has told The Irish Times he had yet to find evidence to support the claim .
“ They are speculating .
There is still much evidence to examine and we cannot prove or deny such claims yet . ”
Mr Morales seems to have ruled out an international investigation into the circumstances surrounding the killings .
Speaking of the request by Ireland , along with Croatia and Hungary - the nationalities of the two other dead men , Mr Morales said : “ They have no authority to ask for an investigation . ”
Visibly irritated he went on to say : “ It is very serious , I could think that they [ the European countries ] are the ones who sent them here to attack democracy . ”
But apparently contradicting himself , he also said : “ if it is important , the presence of the international community , then , welcome . ”
Mr Morales ’ deputy , Mr Garcia Linera , has become the most prominent proponent within Bolivia ’s government of the theory that Mr Dwyer was part of an extremist right - wing group , linked to the opposition in Santa Cruz and with plans to destabilise the country ’s government .
Asked on what basis the vice - president was making his claims , Mr Sosa said he must be receiving information from the intelligence services .
Mr Sosa also denied accusations within Santa Cruz that police acted illegally .
“ In this case the presence of a prosecutor was not necessary .
The police just went to the hotel to see if the men were there .
There was a confrontation and they defended themselves . ”
But hotel staff have told The Irish Times police raided the hotel during the night in a military - style operation involving more than 30 men .
Civic leaders in Santa Cruz say the law clearly states such police actions require the presence of a prosecutor and are demanding to know why a Santa Cruz prosecutor who arrived shortly after the incident was denied access to the scene .

Fox Host Blasts Trump For Not Disavowing White Supremacists , Says He ‘ Ruined Biggest Layup ’
In ‘ History Of Debates ’
WASHINGTON  Calling into question the legitimacy of all the signing statements that former President George W. Bush used to challenge new laws , President Obama ordered executive officials on Monday to consult with Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. before relying on any of them to bypass a statute .
But Mr. Obama also signaled that he intended to use signing statements himself if Congress sent him legislation with provisions he decided were unconstitutional .
He promised to take a modest approach when using the statements , legal documents issued by a president the day he signs bills into law that instruct executive officials how to put the statutes into effect .
But Mr. Obama said there was a role for the practice if used appropriately .
“ In exercising my responsibility to determine whether a provision of an enrolled bill is unconstitutional , I will act with caution and restraint , based only on interpretations of the Constitution that are well - founded , ” Mr. Obama wrote in a memorandum to the heads of all departments and agencies in the executive branch .
Mr. Obama ’s directions were the latest step in his administration ’s effort to deal with a series of legal and policy disputes it inherited from the Bush administration .
They came the same day Mr. Obama lifted restrictions Mr. Bush placed on federal financing for research that uses embryonic stem cells .
President Barack Obama speaks to military personnel at Camp Victory in Baghdad , Iraq , yesterday .
Obama had to arrive by surprise for security reasons , just like Bush and Blair had to in their time .
The start of the Iraq war in 2003 marked a crucial break between the US and almost all the states of the region .
" None of Iraq 's neighbours , absolutely none , were pleased by the American occupation of Iraq , " says the Iraqi Foreign Minister , Hoshyar Zebari .
Long - term US allies like Turkey astonished the White House by refusing to allow US troops to use its territory to invade Iraq .
Barack Obama , who made his first official visit to the country yesterday , is now trying to disengage from Iraq without appearing to scuttle or leave anarchy behind .
He is trying to win back old allies , and , as he made clear in a speech in Ankara on Monday , to end the confrontation between the US and Islam which was president Bush 's legacy .
It is not easy for Mr Obama to reverse the tide of anti-Americanism or bring to an end the wars which Mr Bush began .
For all the Iraqi government 's claim that life is returning to normal in Baghdad the last few days have seen a crescendo of violence .
The day before the President arrived six bombs exploded in different parts of Baghdad , killing 37 people .
And as much as Mr Obama would like to treat the Iraq war as ancient history , the US is still struggling to extricate itself .
The very fact that the democratic president had to arrive in Iraq by surprise , as George Bush and Tony Blair invariably did , for security reasons , shows that the conflict is refusing to go away .
The Iraqi prime minister and president remain holed up in the ' green zone ' most of the time .
The American President could not fly into the green zone by helicopter because of bad weather but the airport road is still unsafe and Baghdad remains one of the most dangerous countries in the world .
The Iraqi political landscape too was permanently altered by the US invasion and it will be difficult to create a stable Iraqi state which does not depend on the US .
Opinion polls in Iraq show that most Iraqis believe that it is the US and not their own government which is in control of their country .
One change which is to Mr Obama 's advantage is that the American media has largely stopped reporting the conflict because they no longer have the money to do so and a majority of Americans think the war was won .
But the danger for the president is that if there is a fresh explosion in Iraq , he may be blamed for throwing away a victory that was won by his predecessor .
The rhetoric with which the US conducts its diplomacy is easier to change than facts on the ground in Iraq or Afghanistan .
Mr Obama 's speech to the Turkish parliament in Ankara was a carefully judged bid to reassure the Muslim world that the US is not at war with Islam .
Everything he said was in sharp contrast to George Bush 's bellicose threats post 9/11 about launching a " crusade " .
Mr Obama 's effort to make a U - turn in American policy towards the Islamic world will ultimately depend on how far he changes US policy towards Israel and the Palestinians , the occupation of Iraq , the confrontation with Iran and Syria and the war in Afghanistan .
The Iranians , for instance , note that despite Mr Obama 's friendlier approach to them the US official in Washington in charge of implementing sanctions against them is a hold - over from the Bush administration .
The American confrontation with Islam post 9/11 always had more to do with opposition to foreign intervention and occupation than it did with cultural differences ; the most ideologically religious Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia supported the US and it is doubtful how far al - Qa'ida fighters were motivated primarily by religious fanaticism .
The chief US interrogator in Iraq , Major Mathew Alexander says that during 1,300 interrogations he supervised , he came across only one true ideologue .
He is quoted as saying that : " I listened time and time again to foreign fighters , and Sunni Iraqis , state that the No 1 reason they had decided to pick up arms and join al - Qa'ida was the abuses at Abu Ghraib and the authorised torture and abuse at Guantanamo Bay . "
This diagnosis by Major Alexander is confirmed by the history of Islamic fundamentalism across the Muslim world over the past 30 years .
It was the success of the Iranian revolution against the Shah in 1978 / 79 which began an era when political Islam was seen as a threat by the West , but Ayatollah Khomeini 's appeal to Iranians always had a strong strain of nationalism and his exiling by the Shah in 1964 was because of his vocal opposition to extra-territorial rights for US military personnel in Iran .
The success of political Islam over secular nationalism in the Arab world has largely been because of the former 's ability to resist the enemies of the community or the state .
All the military regimes espousing nationalism and secularism in the Arab world began or ended up turning into corrupt and brutal autocracies .
In contrast , political Islam has been able to go some way towards delivering its promises of defending the community .
Secularism in the Arab world and in Afghanistan , on the other hand , has the problem that it is seen as being at the service of foreign intervention .
Mr Obama 's aim of ending the confrontation between the US and the Muslim world is both easier and more difficult than it looks .
It is easier because the confrontation is not primarily over religion or clashing cultures .
But the confrontation is over real issues such as the fate of the Palestinians , the future of Iraq and the control of Afghanistan .
And even if Mr Obama wanted to change the US political relationship with Israel , it is not clear that he has any more political strength at home than George Bush had to do so .

Gordon Ramsey Demonstrates The Perfect Scrambled Egg Breakfast
It ’s a two - for - one clip — proof that celebri- chef Gordon Ramsey is n’t just a TV - addled scream machine , and a four - minute demonstration of how to make rich , fluffy scrambled eggs on a non-rushed morning .
Ramsay points out two bits of egg - cooking kitchen science worth noting :
Do n’t salt or whisk the eggs before they get into your pan .
Give them a break from the heat once they get going , so they can combine and avoid drying out .
Whether or not you use Ramsay suggested additions of butter and crème fraîche to create a richer , smoother egg to drop onto oil - drizzled sourdough , his egg technique is worth a quick study .
The star of Hell ’s Kitchen ( both the instructional British and vein - bulging U.S. versions ) says he tests out every fresh - faced chef in his kitchens by having them make scrambled eggs , and we tend to believe him .
Care to counterpoint Ramsay ’s technique with your own Perfect Scrambled Egg recipe ?
By all means , drop it off in the comments .

Australian officials have warned that the death toll from wildfires that have already killed 170 people in the state of Victoria is likely to rise further .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the numbers were " numbing " and warned the nation to prepare for more bad news .
Police believe some of the fires were started deliberately - actions which Mr Rudd said amounted to " mass murder " .
Nick Bryant reports .
Over the past 12 years , anesthesiologist Scott Reuben revolutionized the way physicians provide pain relief to patients undergoing orthopedic surgery for everything from torn ligaments to worn - out hips .
Now , the profession is in shambles after an investigation revealed that at least 21 of Reuben 's papers were pure fiction , and that the pain drugs he touted in them may have slowed postoperative healing .
" We are talking about millions of patients worldwide , where postoperative pain management has been affected by the research findings of Dr. Reuben , " says Steven Shafer , editor in chief of the journal Anesthesia & Analgesia , which published 10 of Reuben 's fraudulent papers .
Paul
White , another editor at the journal , estimates that Reuben 's studies led to the sale of billions of dollars worth of the potentially dangerous drugs known as COX2 inhibitors , Pfizer 's Celebrex ( celecoxib ) and Merck 's Vioxx ( rofecoxib ) , for applications whose therapeutic benefits are now in question .
Reuben was a member of Pfizer 's speaker 's bureau and received five independent research grants from the company .
The editors do not believe patients were significantly harmed by the short - term use of these COX2 inhibitors for pain management but they say it 's possible the therapy may have prolonged recovery periods .
Baystate Medical Center in Springfield , Mass. , began investigating Reuben 's findings last May after its chief academic officer , Hal Jenson , discovered during a routine audit that Reuben had not received approval from the hospital 's review board to conduct two of his studies .
Reuben " violated the trust of Baystate , the community and science , " Jenson says .
The story of the investigation was first reported by Anesthesiology News late last month .
Reuben , 50 , has been stripped of his research and educational duties and has been on medical leave since May .
He received his medical degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Medicine & Biomedical Sciences in 1985 and did his residency at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City .
In 1991 , he joined Baystate , which serves as the western campus for Tufts University School of Medicine , and has worked as a staff anesthesiologist and the director of acute pain management .
His lawyer , Ingrid Martin of Dwyer & Collora , LLP , in Boston , told ScientificAmerican.com that Reuben has cooperated with the investigation and that he " deeply regrets that all of this happened . "
She added that " with the [ investigating ] committee 's guidance , he is taking steps to ensure this never happens again . "
She declined to answer any further questions , and Reuben did not respond to an e-mail request for comment .
Beginning in 2000 , Reuben , in his now - discredited research , attempted to convince orthopedic surgeons to shift from the first generation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) to the newer , proprietary COX2 inhibitors , such as Vioxx , Celebrex , and Pfizer 's Bextra ( valdecoxib ) .
He claimed that using such drugs in combination with the Pfizer anticonvulsant Neurontin ( gabapentin ) , and later Lyrica ( pregabalin ) , prior to and during surgery could be effective in decreasing postoperative pain and reduce the use of addictive painkillers , such as morphine , during recovery .
A 2007 editorial in Anesthesia & Analgesia stated that Reuben had been at the " forefront of redesigning pain management protocols " through his " carefully planned " and " meticulously documented " studies .
Many orthopedic surgeons , however , were slow to adopt COX2 inhibitors due to animal studies that showed short - term use might hinder bone healing .
Then , in 2004 , Vioxx and Bextra were pulled from the market because of their link to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes , leaving Pfizer 's Celebrex as the only COX2 inhibitor available .
Celebrex sales plunged 40 percent after a study that same year suggesting that it , too , posed a heart attack risk .
Despite this , Reuben continued to present " findings " in research funded by Pfizer that trumpeted Celebrex 's alleged benefits and downplayed its potential negative side effects .
He apparently hoped to erase doubts by persuading orthopedic surgeons to co-author papers with him based on his bogus data .
In 2005 he and Evan Ekman , an orthopedic surgeon at Southern Orthopaedic Sports Medicine in Columbia , S.C. , published a study on the use of Celebrex to control pain in back surgery patients .
" The short - term administration of celecoxib , " they wrote in the paper published in The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery , " results in no significant deleterious effect on bone or ligament healing or cardiovascular outcomes . "
Three years later , Reuben 's career would begin to unravel as Ekman began to suspect foul play .
In addition to collaborating with Reuben on the now - retracted Celebrex study , Ekman agreed to review a Reuben manuscript on surgery on the anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) in the knee .
But when he asked the anesthesiologist for the name of the orthopedic surgeon on the study , Reuben ceased communication with him .
Then , last year , Ekman was invited by Pfizer to give a talk .
While there , he was handed a version of the very manuscript Reuben had asked him to review , which had subsequently been published in Anesthesia & Analgesia .
To his surprise , and horror , he was listed as a co-author : Reuben had forged his signature on the submission form , Ekman says .
By then , Editor in Chief Shafer had already put several Reuben manuscripts on hold after learning that Baystate had initiated a probe into the validity of his research .
The investigation later identified 21 articles based on patient data that had been partially or completely doctored .
Although Pfizer funded Reuben 's research between 2002 and 2007 , Baystate has no records of those payments and says that the research funds could have been paid directly to Reuben .
Such an arrangement would be " highly unusual , " Shafer notes .
" It 's just a little frustrating , " Baystate spokesperson Jane Albert says .
" I do n't know how many dollars went to Dr. Reuben or his group . "
Pfizer spokesperson Sally Beatty insists the grants were properly disbursed to Baystate in accordance with Pfizer policy .
" Pfizer is not familiar with the records retention policies of Baystate Medical Center , " she says , " However , independent investigator - initiated research grant agreements were executed between Pfizer and Baystate Medical Center . "
Beatty was unable to provide information on the dollar amount of the grants , but editor
White says they typically range between $ 10,000 to $ 100,000 .
The question is :
Why did it take 12 years before a " routine audit " revealed Reuben 's widespread data fabrication ?
" Baystate publishes about 200 [ studies ] every year , and of those [ articles ] , the audit rate might only be 5 percent , " Baystate 's Jenson says , acknowledging that ultimately " Baystate is responsible " for making sure that research done there is properly conducted and reported .
He says that the hospital has been trying to strengthen its oversight program over " the past few years " and that it is in the process of applying for accreditation from the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs ( AAHRPP ) in Washington , D.C. , which provides an independent evaluation of an organization 's ethical standards and oversight .
The lack of accreditation is not unusual because the nonprofit program was not established until 2001 and only recently has grown to include 159 hospitals , academic institutions and other organizations .
In hindsight , Anesthesia & Analgesia editors Shafer and White admit that it should have been a " red flag " that Reuben 's studies were consistently favorable to the drugs he studied .
White , who has also received drug company educational grants , says that such funding comes with " subtle pressure " to give the companies the results they want .
For now , at least , neither the drug companies nor Reuben 's co-authors are officially sharing in the blame , but that 's expected to change .
" There 's a lot of responsibility to pass around , " White says , " It 's all being focused on Scott Reuben , but the reality is there are many other responsible parties . "
Mr Mohamed , a British resident , claims he was tortured in US custody
The foreign secretary has declined requests to urge the US to publish documents about the alleged torture of freed detainee Binyam Mohamed .
David Miliband told MPs while he had " no objection " to publication it was up to the US to release any evidence .
Shadow foreign secretary William Hague had called for transparency , saying the UK could not be seen condoning torture .
Mr Mohamed , who arrived back in the UK on Monday , says he was tortured by US agents who suspected him of terrorism .
Mr Hague asked the foreign secretary : " The importance of this case is that this country must be clear that we do not condone or connive in the torture of suspects .
" Does that not suggest that we should be as transparent as possible in all the circumstances ? "
But Mr Miliband said , while there was nothing in the documents that Britain wanted to be kept secret , " it was up to the US to go through each of those documents and decide whether or not to release them " .
Earlier , a senior Labour MP called on the US authorities to " urgently " release details on Mr Mohamed , who says the British secret services were complicit in his abuse .
Mike Gapes , chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee , told the BBC that there should be greater openness about Mr Mohamed 's case to prevent long - term damage to the government and in particular , the reputation of the foreign secretary .
Mr Miliband has been accused by two senior judges of bowing to pressure from the US government to keep details of Mr Mohamed 's treatment secret .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" I think the solution here is that the US authorities release that information , " Mr Gapes said .
UK attorney general Baroness Scotland is also facing criticism for the length of time she is taking to decide whether to order a criminal investigation into Mr Mohamed 's allegations about official British involvement in his torture .
Keith Vaz , chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee , said : " She [ Baroness Scotland ] has access to the finest legal brains in Britain , including her own .
" To take four months to make a decision of this kind is a very long time .
I think we need a decision now . "
On Tuesday Mr Miliband released a statement repeating that the UK government " abhors torture and does not order or condone it " , and that it had raised with the US allegations of mistreatment made by UK detainees held at Guantanamo Bay .
The BBC 's security correspondent Gordon Corera said while it was clear that the High Court judges did believe Mr Mohamed had suffered some mistreatment , at the same time it was difficult to get to the truth because of the secrecy involved in intelligence sharing between Britain and the US .
Mr Mohamed arrived back at RAF Northolt in London on Monday But our correspondent said court judgements did show there had been a transfer of information from the UK to America concerning Mr Mohamed 's case .
Meanwhile Mr Mohamed , 30 , is recovering from his seven years of detention - four of them spent at Guantanamo Bay - at a secret address in the countryside .
His sister Zuhra told the BBC that his weight had dropped from a " normal " 12 stones to 8st 10lb , but he was otherwise in good health , mentally and physically .
" He is happy , and glad to be out .
He is just looking around .
He is doing good and he can't believe he is free , " she said .
Ethiopian - born Mr Mohamed 's immigration status is being reviewed , but the authorities have stressed that allowing him to return to Britain does not confer on him permanent residency rights .

Corticosteroids are powerful drugs used to treat inflammatory conditions such as asthma and other chronic diseases which has made them among the most widely prescribed drugs .
Although the anti-inflammatory drugs offer swift relief to the patient , they can carry with them serious side effects .
For example , the inflammatory steroids used to treat a child ’s asthma , but can stunt the child ’s growth over time .
Similarly , adult treatment of Addison ’s disease , which President John F. Kennedy endured , can lead to the development of diabetes and hypertension .
For more than 20 years , one research team has been working to develop a safer approach that would eliminate inflammation without causing damage to the body .
Such drugs , called “ antedrugs ” have been developed in a lab at Florida A& M ’s College of Pharmacy .
The efforts have been spearheaded by Dr. Henry J. Lee who has led antedrug research in anti-inflammatory , anti-AIDS and anti-cancer drugs for nearly 30 years .
A New Study
Lee and his team have recently completed a new study entitled , Anti-Inflammatory Activities of New Steroidal Antedrugs Isoxazoline Derivatives .
It was conducted by Drs. Henry J. Lee , Younes J. Errahali , LeeShawn D. Thomas , Brenda G. Arnold and Glory B. Brown , all of the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University , College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences , Tallahassee , Florida .
The researchers will discuss their work at the 122nd Annual Meeting of the American Physiological Society which is part of the Experimental Biology 2009 scientific conference .
The meeting will be held April 18 - 22 , 2009 in New Orleans .
The Study
Antedrug design is a new approach to create safer drugs that attack a problem such as inflammation then quickly become inactive before they can cause damage .
The primary objective of this study was to synthesize a new group of corticosteroids that have anti-asthmatic and anti-inflammatory properties without adverse side effects .
The researchers synthesized new antedrugs , isoxazoline derivatives , from prednisolone .
They then tested the derivatives in a test tube and found that antedrugs effectively reduced inflammation .
In fact , they found isoxazoline derivatives were five times more potent than prednisolone in binding affinities to the cell corticosteroids receptors and reducing inflammation .
The researchers also studied the isoxazoline derivatives in the lung and liver cells of rats and found that the antedrugs significantly reduced the cell inflammation .
In addition , the rat plasma began metabolizing rapidly the antedrugs to an inactive form with the half lives less than five minutes and more than 95 % of prednisolone remained unchanged even after 100 min incubation .
Results
These results suggest that isoxazoline derivatives compared to conventional steroids improve topical anti-inflammatory activity without causing systemic damage .
“ This is a very promising outcome , ” according to Dr. Lee .
Additional studies are currently underway , using a new group of corticosteroids in the treatment of asthma exacerbation and chronic pulmonary inflammation without systemic side effects such as body weight and hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis change .
This project research described was supported by the National Institutes of Health , 5S06GM008111-36 NIGMS / MBRS and 2G12RR03020 - 24 / NCRR / RCMI .

From time to time I ’m forced to use that other operating system and I miss the tools that I enjoy under Linux .
For example , flyspell does n’t work because there is no ispell .
Fortunately it is possible to fix this by installing cygwin and ispell / cygwin .
Brian
Wood wrote instructions how to set everything up back in 2006 .
A quick summary :
Download cygwin / ispell binaries from ftp://ftp.franken.de/pub/win32/develop/gnuwin32/cygwin/porters/Humblet_Pierre_A/V1.1/ispell-3.2.06-cygwin-1.3-bin.tar.gz which should be extracted from the cygwin root directory – it installs files into /usr / local / …
Add the cygwin paths to your environment .
I prefer to do this at emacs start - up ( my cygwin is installed in the non-standard c:/ packages / cygwin )
( setenv " PATH " ( concat ( getenv " PATH " ) " ;c:\\packages\\cygwin\\usr\\local\\bin " " ;c:\\packages\\cygwin\\bin " ) )
Update : I ’ve moved over to aspell which I found in the text section of the cygwin installer as per the comment from emacs user .
Thanks .
We will probably lose our home , and maybe our truck , " says Jessica Siders , a former employee at DHL's US delivery hub in Wilmington , Ohio – the world 's largest private airport .
She lost her job as a sorter at DHL Solutions back in December .
Her husband Kenneth was also laid off from ABX , an air cargo company controlled by DHL .
" We had health insurance through his severance package , but only until 1 March .
He 's diabetic and his heart condition is bad . "
Sider and her husband are among the estimated 7,500 residents of Wilmington – out of a 12,000 population – who have lost their jobs with DHL since cuts were announced late last year ( 9,000 were laid off nationwide ) .
Employed as sorters , fork - lift drivers , mechanics and supervisors , the people of this small town north - east of Cincinnati were hit the hardest when the shipping company announced swingeing cost - saving measures in November last year in the midst of the worst financial crisis in decades .
In Wilmington , every small business has been affected by the actions of DHL .
Stores are closing , and people are leaving .
Dominated by a single employer , Wilmington is one of America 's " company towns " .
When DHL announced last November that it would end its US domestic freight operations and turn over its American air - cargo service to competitor United Parcel Service ( UPS ) , its Wilmington hub bore the brunt .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
DHL had been in Wilmington for only five years , and the closure of its base there demonstrates not just the impact of the global recession – although demand for express shipments in the US has fallen sharply – but the end of an ambitious dream to take on its rivals FedEx and UPS .
In 2003 , Deutsche Post , the German logistics group that owns DHL , one of the world 's leading delivery companies , acquired Airborne Express , a domestic delivery concern .
In America , Airborne Express was served by ABX air cargo airlines , based in Wilmington , Ohio .
The purchase represented DHL 's effort to consolidate US operations – and finally offer serious competition to the big two .
Central to DHL 's audacious plan was the establishment of a new distribution base at the sprawling , 2 , 200 acre Wilmington airport .
The DHL / Airborne Express deal looked like the perfect match : a German shipping corporation that was efficient , on time and detail - oriented , to be served by a cargo airline and sorting company with more than 25 years of experience of domestic express delivery .
In the beginning , DHL 's investment was huge : $ 1.3 bn to buy the vast airport hub , plus about $ 500 m of incentives from the State of Ohio to improve and maintain jobs .
" We thought that DHL , with its own airport , would become No 1 in the world , " says Randy Riley , Clinton County Commissioner , who has lived in Wilmington for 32 years .
" It hired people from all over the state .
In south - west Ohio , it became the largest employer .
Workers from 84 of the 88 counties of Ohio were working for DHL . "
All the ABX planes were painted in the DHL livery .
The company started building new facilities around the airport area .
It adopted a strong and aggressive corporate advertising campaign , an unusual tactic in a small farming town which , 20 years previously , had been known only as the hog capital of Ohio .
But , five years after DHL moved in , in May 2008 it announced that it would be restructuring its US operations and shifting the domestic air cargo business from ABX to its rival UPS .
" We just thought that it was the worst business plan ever , " says the Mayor of Wilmington , David Raizk , who was invited to Bonn , Germany for the occasion .
" They did this multimillion - dollar investment in Wilmington , but we are not sure if they understood how the express product works here .
They tried to impose their plan , but the two business cultures were really different .
It is a shame , because if you own your airport , you can control your costs and how you ship your freight .
They were losing enormous amounts of money and clients . "
Critics of DHL 's plan say the company pushed too hard and too fast , and without listening to those who have worked at Wilmington for years .
" DHL wanted to take over everything , but they did n't have a clue how to manage , " says Joanne Heller , a fork - lift driver with ABX , who 's lost her job .
" This time last year , they realised they had lost an enormous amount of money .
They started talking about restructuring .
We thought we were safe .
We had no idea of what was going on .
We heard all kinds of things , and finally they decided to get rid of night shifts and domestic traffic .
Eventually [ we heard ] that they are going to move back again to Cincinnati airport . "

Express shipments in the US carried by the top three companies fell last year for the first time since 2001 .
In November 2008 , DHL said it was going to shut the door and leave the US domestic shipping market by the end of January , slashing thousands of jobs in Wilmington .
People in this town are scared to death .
Their futures , held in the hands of just one big company , have been shattered .
This is the destiny of many company towns in America .
These people are losing everything but the ground under their feet : their severance packages will cover them for just a few weeks , having received one week for each year of work .
Health insurance is lost , too .
" I thought I was able to send my kids to college , but now I worry for them , " says Chris Fisher , a logistics worker at DHL Solutions , who was laid off in December after 11 years at ABX .
" This is going to hurt the school system , which depends heavily on tax income to generate its funds . "
Wilmington could be destined to become a ghost town .
But this small community still has something very valuable : the largest privately owned airport in the United States .
Eventually , someone else is going to take it over and redevelop business in the area .
The airport is still currently under DHL ownership .
Mayor Raizk is fighting with all the power of his office to buy it back for the community , and city leaders are in talks with DHL Express executives in an attempt to lessen the severity of the regional economic crisis .
DHL is paying for a " transition centre " at its air hub , while the state is providing assistance to those who are unemployed : how to write a résumé , learning to use Excel and Word , how to search for work on the internet , and how to prepare for interviews .
For others like Jessica Siders and her husband , staying to fight for survival is less appealing than the alternative : to take flight .
" We 're thinking about moving out of the state , " she says .
" There 's no future for us here . "
My story : Wilmington residents
Chris Fisher : Logistics worker at DHL Solutions , laid off in December after 11 years at ABX
" After November 2008 , they just wanted to find a reason to fire you .
They kept saying that our jobs were safe and a month later they told us they were closing the doors .
Since then , it has been just devastating .
Everything they promised to us is gone .
I have never been unemployed till now .
While I was working at the airport , I had a life outside home , with friends and colleagues .
I had 15 people working for me and now we are all breaking up – it 's sad .
Things for the past couple of years were blooming .
Everybody was happy with their job and house .
It was difficult to get where we are now .
We worked really hard and bought a house for our family .
I earned good money .
Now , I might have to work five to 10 years to get to that salary again .
I 'm scared . "
Randy Riley : Commissioner of Clinton County , of which Wilmington is the county seat
" When I started here in 1976 , the No 1 industry in Clinton County was farming .
We were the hog capital of Ohio .
Five years later , Airborne Express moved into town and into the old air base .
They started to do overnight package delivery on a very small scale , and they grew and grew until they had something between 15 and 20 per cent of the market .
Then DHL came .
One of our hopes is that DHL will continue to have some kind of business in Wilmington .
They should use the airport as an international gateway from where they can fly freight to and from Asia and Europe .
In this way , at least 1,000 jobs will stay here .
I would of course prefer to have 8,000 to 9,000 jobs here – but 1,000 is better than nothing . "
John Lundblad : A retired ABX pilot , Lundblad flew with the company from 1990 to 2004
" Airborne Express was a niche company and we never lost money until DHL showed up .
I think they wanted to compete with UPS and FedEx – and now , I am sure , they 've found out just how good those two companies are .
The management of these companies seemed to lose touch with the real world . "
Molly Dullea : Owner of General Denver Hotel , Wilmington , since 2003
" Pilots are not flying , so they are not coming any more .
All their meetings , dinners and conferences have dropped off .
It was doing so well when I arrived .
The shops were all filled up .
It was a vibrant , alive small town .
But since last May , it seems like someone has switched off the lights .
Every day it gets a little bit less lively , and people are sadder and sadder
This is just the tip of an iceberg .
In June or July , we will experience the full brutality of it .
It is really getting rough .
If you stay , there 's no place for you to work , but if you go , how can you sell your home ?
Lots of small businesses have closed .
I can see signs for rent all over , but nobody 's buying or renting .
It is so sad . "
Joanne Heller : Formerly a fork - lift driver at ABX , Heller was let go in December 2008 after 12 years .
She has lived in Wilmington since the age of four
" Before DHL , working at the hub was very different .
Airborne knew what they were doing .
DHL wanted to take over everything but they did n't have a clue about how to manage .
They kept saying that they were our customers , and we had to do what they wanted as they owned the place .
I thought [ the DHL deal ] was a good change , that I was going to have a job for ever and be a part of it .
After 12 years my position was eliminated , so for me there 's no possibility to work there any more .
I have a 13 - year - old son , and I just bought a house thinking I had a good future .
I still have health insurance but when my severance package is gone next month , I wo n't have it any more . "
John Graber : President of ABX Air since 2006
" DHL told us that they do n't need our service any more .
We are eliminating thousands of people 's jobs as a result of the domestic service going away , so our company is not anything close to what we were .
We have thousands of employees who have been working and growing up with this company .
I was reading in a school last week and a child asked me , ' Mr Graber , what do you do ? '
I said I worked for ABX and every kid raised their hand , saying , ' Do you know my brother ? '
' You know my sister ? '
' You know my uncle ? '
This company is so tight to this place . "
Jessica Siders : A former worker at DHL Solutions , she was laid off in December 2008 after eight years with DHL
" I lost everything .
They just terminated me .
I thought I was working at ABX for the rest of my life till I retired .
I felt that [ the deal with ] DHL was a positive move ; it would switch hands and we would continue the same job we were doing .
When you are over 50 , it is very difficult to find a job .
I have four children and six grandchildren , and my daughter has worked for ABX since she was 17 years old .
She got laid off and she can't sleep at night .
I do n't ever remember having a Christmas without presents for all our kids .
Last year we could n't buy any .
My husband gave the children snowballs . "
Russ Leighton : A pilot with ABX since May 1997 , Leighton was laid off in January 2009
" DHL should have listened to ABX and taken their advice on how to do things .
I think people in top management were fighting like kids – ' Do it my way ' , ' No , do it my way ' – and nothing was getting done .
Slowly , it fell apart .
It 's funny , because Mercedes did the same thing to Chrysler .
They came over and they just did what they did in Wilmington .
They worked for five years and laid off all these people then closed and left .
The economy is so bad now that there are not many airlines hiring , and if you get a job you start back at the bottom – so your salary is very low .
I have two daughters .
I was going send them to college .
I do n't know if I am going to do that any more .
I am not sure if I will keep my house . "
The deepest cuts : Failing company towns
Charlotte , North Carolina
A greater percentage of the population work in banking here than in New York , as it is home to Bank of America and Wachovia , two of the crippled giants of the credit crisis .
Between them , the banks employ 34,000 in Charlotte .
BoA is shedding jobs ; Wachovia was sold to avoid going bust .
Hershey , Pennsylvania
These are hard times for the quintessential company town , nicknamed the Sweetest Place on Earth , where the street lamps are shaped like Hershey 's Kisses .
The chocolatier has been slashing jobs and moving production to Mexico .
Irvine , California
This Orange County town was the centre of the US sub - prime mortgage industry , but dozens of the lenders that were based here have gone bust , shut their doors or scaled right back .
Elkhart , Indiana
President Barack Obama visited this city of 60,000 when trying to sell his economic stimulus bill last month , highlighting its soaring unemployment .
It is the motor - home manufacturing capital of the US , but sales have collapsed .
Detroit , Michigan
Nothing can top Detroit as a symbol of economic calamity in the US , as two of the three big carmakers based here totter on the verge of bankruptcy .
The city has halved in size in 50 years , and its decline has accelerated alone with plunging automobile sales .
Wolfsburg , Germany
Created just before the Second World War to house Volkswagen workers , this one - company town has suffered as the carmaker laid off 750 permanent staff and hundreds more temporary workers .
Rotherham , UK
Corus , the Indian - owned company that used to be called British Steel , is cutting almost half its 1,600 workforce in Rotherham , heaping misery on the Yorkshire town where 6,000 people are already claiming unemployment .
Spennymoor , UK
This Durham town of 20,000 people , in Tony Blair 's old constituency of Sedgefield , has taken a double blow in the current recession : both Electrolux and Black & Decker have shut their factories .

IT Industry Revolutionised By Labour Saving Device
December 10 , 2008
Information Technology departments face global staffing cuts thanks to a staggering new invention that is taking the hard work out of IT .
The ' self - clicking ' " next " button is set to revolutionize how computer users ' Get Things Done ' -- but a wave of fear is sweeping an industry facing wide spread redundancy .
System Administrators are expected to be the hardest hit , with over 90 % of their duties now offloaded to the clever button .
" This is a direct strike at the very heart of our profession , " said James Curl , president of the commitee for SysAdmin Advancement .
" Our members are deeply concerned .
Many of them feel that this is undermining a skill that , in many cases , took years to develop . "
The button , available in forthcoming hot fixes to Vista and XP , has recruitment firms recommending that now is the time for many IT ' professionals ' to start broadening their skill base .
" If you 're a System Administrator , " said Michael Jones of Recruiting PlusForce , " or if you 're a Network Administrator , a Database Administrator , a Security Administrator , a Web Administator ... basically if you work in IT and have the word ' Administrator ' in your title , then this device is the wake up call you 've been waiting for . "
A developer we interviewed said that he was not personally worried about the invention .
" There 's two types of people in IT , " said Eric McCall , " There 's people who tell the computer what to do .
And there 's people who do what the computer tell them to do .
It 's only the second group who have anything to worry about .
Well , I 'd better get back to it .
This coffee is n't going to drink itself ... yet "
( Sorry sysAdmins ... that one was dedicated to experienced Next - Clicker Ben Parker ( C ; )

NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope set its infrared eyes upon the dusty remains of shredded asteroids around several dead stars .
This artist 's concept illustrates one such dead star , or " white dwarf , " surrounded by the bits and pieces of a disintegrating asteroid .
At least onein every 100 white dwarf stars may be orbited by asteroids and rocky planets , newobservations from NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope suggest .
The finding couldmean that these now dead stars once hosted solar systems similar to our own .
Also , thework could help scientists determine whether other rocky , Earth - like planets are orbiting around other stars .
White dwarfstars are the compact , hot remnants left behind when stars like our own sunreach the end of their lives .
As amiddleweight star like our sun ages , it eventually swells into a red giantphase .
Stars of this mass are n't heavy enough to end their lives in thespectacular explosions known as supernovas ; instead , they gradually expel theiratmospheres until they shrivel into the hot , dense dead stars called white dwarfs .
Theatmospheres of whitedwarfs usually consist entirely of hydrogen and helium , but sometimesheavier elements such as calcium or magnesium are detected contaminating thestellar material .
Data fromSpitzer suggest that at least 1 to 3 percent of white dwarf stars arecontaminated in this way .
Scientiststhink that the out - of - place elements come from a gradual rain of orbiting dustonto the sun .
The dust emits infrared radiation which Spitzerdetects .
The dust isentirely contained within what is called the Roche limit of the star , or closeenough that any object larger than a few kilometers would be ripped apart bygravitational tides .
( This is the same phenomenon that produced Saturn 's rings . )
Because of the location of the dust , scientists think that the dust mayoriginate from rocky bodies such as asteroids ( also known as minor planets ) that were torn apart in this way .
This couldmean that as many as 5 million white dwarfs in our own Milky Way are surroundedby orbiting asteroids .
For theasteroids to get within the Roche limit to be pulled apart at the seams , theymust be perturbed from an orbit farther out from their star ?
the asteroidscould be nudged by as yet unseenplanets .
Because thewhite dwarfs descend from main sequence stars like the sun , the team 's work , presented at the European Week of Astronomy and Space Science conference in England , implies that at least 1 to 3 percent of main sequence stars have terrestrialplanets around them .
" Inthe quest for Earth - like planets , we have now identified numerous systems whichare excellent candidates to harbor them , " said study team member Jay Farihiof the University of Leicester in England .
" Where they persist as whitedwarfs , any terrestrial planets will not be habitable , but may have been siteswhere life developed during a previous epoch . "
Thecomposition of the crushed asteroids can be measured by detecting the heavyelements present in white dwarfs , so scientists hope to learn more about thesolar systems that may once have circled around the star .
" Withhigh quality optical and ultraviolet observations ( for example , the Hubble SpaceTelescope ) , we should be able to measure up to two dozen different elements indebris- polluted white dwarfs , " Farihi said .
" We can then address thequestion , " Are there rocky extrasolar planets we find similar to theterrestrial planets of our own solar system ? "
The huntfor other Earth - like worlds is the primary mission of the Kepler spacecraft , which recently sentback its first images .
One exciting new feature in the Android 1.5 SDK is the AppWidget framework which allows developers to write " widgets " that people can drop onto their home screen and interact with .
Widgets can provide a quick glimpse into full - featured apps , such as showing upcoming calendar events , or viewing details about a song playing in the background .
When widgets are dropped onto the home screen , they are given a reserved space to display custom content provided by your app .
Users can also interact with your app through the widget , for example pausing or switching music tracks .
If you have a background service , you can push widget updates on your own schedule , or the AppWidget framework provides an automatic update mechanism .
At a high level , each widget is a BroadcastReceiver paired with XML metadata describing the widget details .
The AppWidget framework communicates with your widget through broadcast intents , such as when it requests an update .
Widget updates are built and sent using RemoteViews which package up a layout and content to be shown on the home screen .
You can easily add widgets into your existing app , and in this article I 'll walk through a quick example : writing a widget to show the Wiktionary " Word of the day . "
The full source code is available , but I 'll point out the AppWidget - specific code in detail here .
First , you 'll need some XML metadata to describe the widget , including the home screen area you 'd like to reserve , an initial layout to show , and how often you 'd like to be updated .
The default Android home screen uses a cell - based layout , so it rounds your requested size up to the next - nearest cell size .
This can be a little confusing , so here 's a quick equation to help :
Minimum size in dip = ( Number of cells * 74dip ) - 2dip
In this example , we want our widget to be 2 cells wide and 1 cell tall , which means we should request a minimum size 146dip x 72dip .
We 're also going to request updates once per day , which is roughly every 86,400,000 milliseconds .
Here 's what our widget XML metadata looks like :
< appwidget - provider xmlns:android= " http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android " android:minWidth = " 146dip " android: minHeight = " 72dip " android:initialLayout=" @layout/widget_message " android:updatePeriodMillis= " 86400000 " />
Next , let 's pair this XML metadata with a BroadcastReceiver in the AndroidManifest :
<!-- Broadcast Receiver that will process AppWidget updates --> < receiver android:name= " .
WordWidget " android:label=" @string/widget_name " > < intent - filter > < action android:name= " android.appwidget.action .APPWIDGET_UPDATE
" /> </intent-filter > < meta-data android:name= " android.appwidget.provider " android:resource =" @xml/widget_word " /> </ receiver > <!--
Service to perform web API queries --> < service android:name= " .
WordWidget$UpdateService " />
Finally , let 's write the BroadcastReceiver code to actually handle AppWidget requests .
To help widgets manage all of the various broadcast events , there is a helper class called AppWidgetProvider , which we 'll use here .
One very important thing to notice is that we 're launching a background service to perform the actual update .
This is because BroadcastReceivers are subject to the Application Not Responding ( ANR ) timer , which may prompt users to force close our app if it 's taking too long .
Making a web request might take several seconds , so we use the service to avoid any ANR timeouts .
/** * Define a simple widget that shows the Wiktionary " Word of the day . "
To build * an update we spawn a background {@link Service} to perform the API queries .
*/ public class WordWidget extends AppWidgetProvider { @ Override public void onUpdate ( Context context , AppWidgetManager appWidgetManager , int [ ] appWidgetIds ) { //
To prevent any ANR timeouts , we perform the update in a service context.startService( new Intent ( context , UpdateService.class ) ) ; } public static class UpdateService extends Service { @ Override public void onStart ( Intent intent , int startId ) { //
Build the widget update for today RemoteViews updateViews = buildUpdate ( this ) ; //
Push update for this widget to the home screen ComponentName this Widget = new ComponentName ( this , WordWidget.class ) ; AppWidgetManager manager = AppWidgetManager.getInstance ( this ) ; manager.updateAppWidget(thisWidget , updateViews ) ; } /** * Build a widget update to show the current Wiktionary * " Word of the day . "
Will block until the online API returns . */ public RemoteViews buildUpdate ( Context context ) { //
Pick out month names from resources Resources res = context.getResources ( ) ; String [ ] monthNames = res.getStringArray(R.array.month_names ) ; // Find current month and day Time today = new Time ( ) ; today.setToNow ( ) ; //
Build today 's page title , like " Wiktionary : Word of the day / March 21 " String pageName = res.getString(R.string.template_wotd_title , monthNames[today.month ] , today.monthDay ) ; RemoteViews updateViews = null ; String pageContent = " " ; try { //
Try querying the Wiktionary API for today 's word SimpleWikiHelper.prepareUserAgent(context ) ; pageContent = SimpleWikiHelper.getPageContent( pageName , false ) ; } catch ( ApiException e ) { Log.e ( " WordWidget " , " Could n't contact API " , e ) ; } catch ( ParseException e ) { Log. e ( " WordWidget " , " Could n't parse API response " , e ) ; } // Use a regular expression to parse out the word and its definition Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(SimpleWikiHelper.WORD_OF_DAY_REGEX ) ; Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(pageContent ) ; if ( matcher.find ( ) ) { //
Build an update that holds the updated widget contents updateViews = new RemoteViews ( context.getPackageName( ) , R.layout.widget_word ) ; String wordTitle = matcher.group(1 ) ; updateViews.setTextViewText(R.id.word_title , wordTitle ) ; updateViews.setTextViewText(R.id.word_type , matcher.group ( 2 ) ) ; updateViews.setTextViewText(R.id.definition , matcher.group(3).trim ( ) ) ; //
When user clicks on widget , launch to Wiktionary definition page String definePage = res.getString(R.string.template_define_url , Uri.encode( wordTitle ) ) ; Intent defineIntent = new Intent ( Intent .
ACTION_VIEW , Uri.parse ( definePage ) ) ; PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity ( context , 0 /* no requestCode */ , defineIntent , 0 /* no flags */) ; updateViews.setOnClickPendingIntent(R.id.widget , pendingIntent ) ; } else { //
Did n't find word of day , so show error message updateViews = new RemoteViews ( context.getPackageName( ) , R.layout.widget_message ) ; CharSequence errorMessage = context.getText(R.string.widget_error ) ; updateViews.setTextViewText( R.id.message , errorMessage ) ; } return updateViews ; } @ Override public IBinder on Bind( Intent intent ) { //
We do n't need to bind to this service return null ; } } }
And there you have it , a simple widget that will show the Wiktionary " Word of the day . "
When an update is requested , we read the online API and push the newest data to the surface .
The AppWidget framework automatically requests updates from us as needed , such as when a new widget is inserted , and again each day to load the new " Word of the day . "
Finally , some words of wisdom .
Widgets are designed for longer - term content that does n't update very often , and updating more frequently than every hour can quickly eat up battery and bandwidth .
Consider updating as infrequently as possible , or letting your users pick a custom update frequency .
For example , some people might want a stock ticker to update every 15 minutes , or maybe only four times a day .
I 'll be talking about additional strategies for saving battery life as part of a session I 'm giving at Google I/O .
One last cool thing to mention is that the AppWidget framework is abstracted in both directions , meaning alternative home screens can also contain widgets .
Your widgets can be inserted into any home screen that supports the AppWidget framework .
We 've already written several widgets ourselves , such as the Calendar and Music widgets , but we 're even more excited to see the widgets you 'll write !
When we look at BDSM and some of the things it can stand for , we mention wax play , spankings , bondage , oral sex and sex in general to name just a few parts of it .
As I am a Master I tend to look at things from a Masters point of view and while most of what I say is relevant for both Masters and Mistresses there are obviously one basic differences , one is Male and one is Female , that said as far as the BDSM world is that is the only real difference .
When we talk of bondage , this is something that can be applied to both male and female subs and slaves , the same as nipple clamps can be used on both , and tying tits on a female slave may be something you find exciting , for a Mistress tying and binding a cock or balls can have the same desired effect .
The same is true for wax play , it is something that has no gender , it is a universal play that can be enjoyed by all involved regardless of the gender or dynamic of the relationship .
In fact when looked at properly there are very few things enjoyed in the BDSM lifestyle that is gender specific ,
With that said there seems to be just one thing that ALL in BDSM agree on , this is a lifestyle and it is something that is not a one size fits all life , it is something that each tailor to suit their needs and desires , that is why it is a growing lifestyle , its main aim is to enjoy and have fun with it
The Dunblane Massacre was an atrocity almost beyond imagining .
A man named Thomas Hamilton walked into a school in a small Scottish town in March 1996 , and shot dead sixteen children and one teacher .
It was not what we ’ve since come to think of as a ‘ normal ’ school shooting as it was a primary school , and all the children were between five and six years of age .
We were filming an episode of ‘ Father Ted ’ that week , and on the night of the recording , no - one , the audience or the cast , felt terribly inclined to have a good time ; difficult to throw your head back and laugh when all you could think about were those kids , their parents , the town … but most of all , those kids , those kids , those poor kids …
All those useless thoughts , sent to torture the unwary after a tragedy such as this one , we knew them well .
If only someone had sensed how dangerous he was …if only handguns had been banned a year before it happened , rather than a year after …
In the days and weeks that followed , we were all endlessly replaying the same fantasy of somehow managing to stop Hamilton before he got to the school gates .
But there was nothing we could do , of course , except respect the memory of the kids who died , and thank dumb , blind chance for the survival of the others .
That basic human reaction , that powerful urge to protect those children , has always been something I presumed was shared by most other human beings .
But a lady named Paula Murray has disabused me of that particular whimsy .
Paula is the journalist who thought it was well past time that the survivors of the Dunblane massacre were given a tabloid punching .
To that end , she befriended a group of them on Facebook and collated their photographs and comments ( UPDATE : she did n’t actually befriend them , she just took advantage of their lack of awareness of privacy settings .
Still reprehensible , of course ) .
Clearly aware of the legal guidelines in place to protect those under eighteen against invasion of privacy ( and the specific instructions that the Press Complaints Commission issued regarding the Dunblane children ) , she waited until they hit eighteen .
Then she wrote this .
The story continued inside under the headline “ SICK MESSAGES SHAME MEMORY OF CLASSMATES ” , referring to the normal , teenagery stuff they were saying to each other on their profiles .
( I should say thank you to those on Twitter who helped me black out the names and photographs of the kids ) .
As others have pointed out , the gist of the story is that these kids are showing disrespect to their dead classmates by … being alive .
Here ’s an example of Paula ’s scoop : “ For instance , ( name deleted ) , who was hit by a single bullet and watched in horror as his classmates died , makes rude gestures in pictures he posted on his Bebo site , and boasts of drunken nights out . ”
Rude gestures .
Boasting .
Drunkenness .
Now , I ’m coming late to this one … complaints to the PCC have been made by two of the victims of the article , the piece has been pulled from the Express website … so we should probably forget about it , right ?
I do n’t know .
I think the line that has been crossed here is different to all the other lines the press routinely cross .
The press likes us to believe they ’re a properly regulated body , but they ’re anything but .
First of all , The PCC seems to be a completely toothless organisation by design .
It is made up of representatives of the major publishers , who are obviously not inclined to be too hard on themselves .
Also , unlike Ofcom and the Advertising Standards Authority , who have easy - to - use complaint forms on their websites , the PCC do n’t even accept third party complaints – in other words , unless you are the person named in a printed article , they ’re not interested in hearing your opinion .
So when faced with an affront to our humanity ( which is what I believe this Express story is ) , there is no official channel for us to register our anger .
That ’s right – if you are offended by something on TV , Radio or in an advert , you can complain ; if you ’re offended by something in the print press…well , you ’re just going to have to walk it off , because literally no - one wants to know .
So , I think it is up to us to take a stand for those kids who had their privacy so ruthlessly invaded .
Paula Murray set out to do a hit job on those kids– character assassination ( of the most pathetic , intelligence - insulting kind ) was the aim , and the weapons were a Facebook account and an editor with a moral centre as atrophied as her own .
If there is a line beyond that one that the press can cross , I think we should make it harder for them to do so .
So !
What can we do ?
Here are a few suggestions :
1 ) Stand up and be counted .
Matt Nida has started an online petition which you can find here .
When he ’s got a decent number of names , he ’ll be submitting it to the editor responsible for the story , the publishers and managing directors of Express Group Newspapers , the PCC , Downing Street and all media outlets who may be able to help shame the Express Group into action by making public the strength of national feeling about this .
2 ) Email your personal complaint to the Editorial Director of the Express Group about the conduct of Paula Murray and Scottish Sunday Express , Derek Lambie , who was responsible for placing the piece on the front cover .
The Editorial Director is Paul Ashford , and this is his secretary ’s email address , so please try to avoid being abusive to her – it ’s not her fault !
– and preface your email by asking Jo to pass your letter on to Mr Ashford .
Jo.dimond@express.co.uk
3 ) Write to Express Group publisher Richard Desmond .
He keeps his email address well hidden , but you can write to him by snail mail at : Richard Desmond , Northern and Shell building , 10 Lower Thames Street , London EC3R 6EN
4 ) Tim Ireland of Bloggerheads suggested targeting the advertisers , which seems like a marvellous idea .
I ’ve written a template letter here .
Tim ’s blog has a full list of advertisers , but here are a few selected contact details to get you started – and it may be more effective if we all write to the same companies .
( UPDATE : Enough people have expressed discomfort with this idea to make me rethink it .
The concensus seems to be that too many innocent people stand to suffer with this avenue of complaint , and it would be better to concentrate on direct complaints and the petition . )
7 ) If you have a Facebook account and would like to vent with likeminded folks , here ’s a group set up to protest the story .
Again , thanks to everyone on Twitter who helped me write this post by providing links and hosting the original story after it was taken down .
Sorry if the post goes on a bit …as they say , I did n’t have time to write a shorter piece .
Thanks for listening .

The North American anime distributorhas announced at Katsucon on Saturday that it has acquired the , andtelevision series .
comes from the licensor , while the other four projects come from , the parent company of the Gonzo anime studio .
will make still more announcements next week through its new official blog and directorand ' smanga into 26 episodes from October 2007 to March 2008 .
In the story , a( Japanese fencing ) advisor has to recruit five high school girls and turn them into ateam that can beat his friend 's high school team — all to win a bet for a year 's worth of food .
The original manga has been running since the inaugural issue of 'smagazine in 2004 , and it spawned a spinoff manga calledinmagazine last month .
is releasing the original manga in North America .
The official website for the PSP game version posted a survey which asked how much do fans want a second anime season , although a second season has not been officially announced .
will ship the original anime series in two half - season sets beginning in late 2009 .
andanime series are part of a multimedia remake of 's classicmaze adventure game .
Gonzo , its game developer sibling Gonzo Rosso , and directorco - developed this fantasy story about a mysterious fortified tower fraught with peril , and a party of adventurers who seek the fabled Blue Crystal Rod treasure at the tower 's highest floor .
Gonzo made news last spring when it announced that it would stream the anime episodes worldwide within a day of their Japanese broadcast .
At the end of the series in June , Gonzo revealed the sequel series , .
That second series has since premiered last month in Japan and is still airing .
will ship the 25 episodes of both series in two sets in late 2009 .

A quarter of all the largest public - sector database projects , including the ID cards register , are fundamentally flawed and clearly breach European data protection and rights laws , according to a report published today .
Claiming to be the most comprehensive map so far of Britain's " database state " , the report says that 11 of the 46 biggest schemes , including the national DNA database and the Contactpoint index of all children in England , should be given a " red light " and immediately scrapped or redesigned .
The report , Database State by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust , says that more than half of Whitehall 's 46 databases and systems have significant problems with privacy or effectiveness , and could fall foul of a legal challenge .
Only six of the 46 systems , including those for fingerprinting , get a " green light " for being effective , proportionate , necessary and established - with a legal basis to guarantee against privacy intrusions .
But even some of these databases have operational problems .
A further 29 databases earn an " amber light " , meaning they have significant problems including being possibly illegal , and needing to be shrunk or split , or be amended to allow individuals the right to opt out .
This group includes the NHS summary care record , the national childhood obesity database , the national pupil database , and the automatic number - plate recognition system .
The study is by members of the Foundation for Information Policy Research , including Ross Anderson , a Cambridge University professor .
It says Britain is now the most invasive surveillance state and the worst at protecting privacy of any western democracy .
It highlights the plight of people who have faced database problems , including a single mother anxious that social services would take her child if she talked to a GP about post-natal depression , and a 13 - year - old girl left with a criminal record for life because of a playground incident .
The authors estimate that £ 16bn a year is being spent on public sector IT , with a further £ 105bn of expenditure planned for the next five years .
Whitehall has admitted that only 30 % of public - sector IT projects are successful .
There are now thousands of databases operating in Whitehall .
The Serious Organised Crime Agency inherited 500 when it was created , and is now attempting to rationalise them into 50 or 60 .
Anderson , the professor of security engineering at Cambridge , said : " Britain 's database state has become a financial , ethical and administrative disaster , which is penalising some of the most vulnerable [ in ] society .
It also wastes billions of pounds a year and often damages service delivery rather than improving it . "
Too often computerisation had been a substitute for public service reform , with little thought given to safety , privacy or value for money .
" There must be urgent and radical change in the public - sector database culture so that the state remains our servant , not our master ... we have to develop systems that put people first . "
The report says children in particular are placed at risk .
Three of the largest databases set up to support the young are failing to achieve their aims , it says .
Terri Dowty , of Action on Rights for Children , said young people had never been so measured , graded , monitored and discussed ; the level of intrusion could not be " justified on the basis of good intentions " .
The report raises concerns about the Home Office system , ONSET , which gathers information from many sources to predict which children will offend .
The report says children could be stigmatised by a system that contravenes the European convention on human rights .
The Rowntree report says databases given an " amber " light should be assessed for their impact on privacy .
Sensitive personal information should normally only be collected and shared with the subject 's consent ; and datasharing occur only in strictly defined circumstances .
" The UK needs information systems that support citizens and professionals on a human scale , rather than multi-billion pound centralised databases used to stigmatise and snoop , " said the report 's co-author , Ian Brown , of the Oxford Internet Institute .

We described the TV Licensing database as a Whitehall system .
The TV Licensing database is owned by the BBC and the information on it is used solely for TV licensing purposes .
This has been corrected .
Have you ever wanted to design a beautiful website but just did n't know how ?
To be honest , a few years ago , that happened to me too .
While browsing the web , I saw so many nice looking websites and wished I had the skills to create such designs .
Today I can and I 'm going to teach you how to do so too !
Essentially , it requires a few Photoshop skills and an eye for detail .
Through this tutorial , I will point out these tiny details which make a website design look beautiful .
Fire up Photoshop and let 's get going !
Step 1 - Download the 960 Grid System Template
The designs I create are nearly all based on the 960 Grid System .
So , before we begin we need to download the grid system Photoshop templates .
You can
find them on the 960.gs official website .
Simply unpack the zip file and look for PSD templates .
You will see that there are
two different types of templates : one is 12 _col and the other one is 16_col .
The difference between these two are , as the name suggests , one is made with 12 columns and the other one with 16 columns .
To explain it a bit more , if you have 3 boxes in your design you would choose the 12 _col grid , because 12 is divisable by 3 ; or if you have 4 boxes in your design , you would choose either 12 _col or 16 _col grid because 12 and 16 are divisable by 4 .
If you follow this tutorial , you will see this in action .
Step 2 - Defining the Structure
Before we open our PSD grid template and begin drawing , we first need to define the structure of our site .
This is a bit more of a complicated structure because we have a layout inside a layout .
You can see this exemplified in the image above .
Step 3
After we 've defined our site structure we 're ready to move on .
Open your 16 _col.psd template .
Go to Image > Canvas size .
Set the canvas to 1200 px wide and 1700 px high .
Set the background color to #ffffff .
Step 4
Now pick the Rectangle Tool and draw in a rectangle the full canvas width and about 80 px high .
Fill it with the color #dddddd .
Step 5
Create a new layer above the rectangle and set Layer mode to Overlay .
Ctrl+click the rectangle layer .
Now the rectangle will be selected .
Choose a 600 px soft brush , set the color to white , and click a few times with the edge of the brush just a bit over the selection , like shown on the image .
This way you create a nice , subtle light effect .
Additionally you can link these two layers .
Step 6
New layer .
Choose the Rectangle tool again and draw in a thin dark grey rectangle , as shown in the image .
Step 7
With the Rectangle tool selected , draw in a big box around 500 px underneath the top rectangle .
Make it 575 px high and give it a Linear Gradient overlay from # d2d2d0 to # ffffff , direction - 90 , Scale 100 % .
Step 8
Now we are going to create the same light effect as described in Step 5 .
We will be using this technique a lot ; so next time I will just refer you to Step 5 for the effect .
Create a new layer above all the current layers .
Ctrl+click the big rectangle .
Choose a 600 px soft brush , set the color to white , and click a few times with the edge of the brush just a bit over the selection , as shown in the image .
Step 9
Create a new layer and draw in a big rectangle about 400 px high .
This one is used for our header .
Fill it with a nice blue gradient from # 2787b7 to # 258 fcd .
See how subtle the color change is ?
Step 10
Add a dark blue 1 px line on the bottom of the header box , apply the Drop shadow effect .
For drop shadow use Blend mode : Multiply , Opacity : 65 % , Angle : - 90 , Distance : 1px and Size : 6 px .
Next , create a new layer above and draw another 1 px white line under the dark blue one .
This way we create sharp edges for our content box .
Basically you can apply this border technique on every box in your design just with different colors .
Step 11
Create a new layer , and with the Rectangle Tool , draw a 50 px high rectangle in the top part of the canvas , just as shown in the image .
This will be used for our navigation .
Apply a Drop shadow .
Use the values shown in the image .
Step 12
Time for the navigation .
Use the Rounded Rectangle Tool and set the radius to 5 px .
Draw a rectangle , fill it with # f6a836 , and apply the following effects :
Inner Shadow - color : # ffffff , Blend mode : overlay , Opacity : 60 % , Angle : 120* , Distance : 7 px , Size : 6 px .
Inner glow - Blend mode : normal , color : # ffffff , Size : 4 px .
Everything else leave default .
Stroke - Size : 1 px , Position : inside , color : # ce7e01 .
Now select the rectangle with Ctrl+click .
Go to Select > Modify >
Contract and enter 1 px .
Create a new layer above , set the Blend mode to Overlay and create the same effect described in the Step 5 using a smaller brush size this time .
Then add the navigation text .
I used Arial for navigation links , all caps and Antialias set to " none " .
Step 13
Now let 's create the search box .
With the Rounded Rectangle Tool , radius 5 px , create a search box positioned on the right side of the grid layout and in the middle of the top gray stripe from Step 4 .
Add these layer styles :
Inner Shadow - color : # 000000 , Blend mode : Multiply , Opacity : 9 % , Angle : 90 * , Distance : 0 px , Size : 6 px .
Stroke - Size : 1 px , Position : inside , color : # dfdfdf .
I added the " search " text and a light gray " GO " button .
This is how it should look .
So far we have a lot of layers and need to organize things a bit so we will create a new Layer folder and name it " search " .
Select all layers that make the search field and just Click + drag inside the new folder .
Later we 're going to organize other content inside the folders so we have a nice organized layer palette .
Step 14
Now create a new layer and draw a " Sign Up " button the same way we created the search field - just half the width .
Place it under the search field in the middle of the navigation stripe .
Again we 're creating the effect from Step 5 .
Use a smaller soft brush size .
In this case it was 45 px .
Step 15
After adding the logo and the Tagline this is how our site should look like now .
Step 16
Now we 're coming back to our layer organization mentioned a few steps earlier .
Create a new empty layer folder and name it " top_bar " .
Move all graphics from the top of the layout inside this folder ( logo , tagline , search field , sign up button , navigation and backgrounds ) .
Create another empty layer folder and name it " header " .
This is where we will put our header graphics .
This is how it should look .
Step 17
Our header looks a bit plain right now so we 're going to add the same light effect everywhere else on the site .
Select the header box ( blue ) .
Create a new empty layer above and set the mode to Overlay .
Pick a large soft brush 600 px , color # ffffff and click a few times in the area under the navigation .
Furthermore , to gain more depth , we can switch the color to black and do the same thing just in the bottom part of the header .
Give it a try !
Step 18
In this step I will explain to you how I created the reflection for the header images .
Take two images of your choice , I used Safari screenshots of my two other templates , scale one down and place it behind the bigger one .
Copy both layers , and with the Free Transform Tool , flip the first image and then the other one .
Shift both images a few pixels down .
Now make a selection from outside the bottom part to middle of the first flipped image with the Rectangular Marquee Tool .
Go to Select > Modify >
Feather and type 30 px or more .
You should have a selection similar to the shown in the image .
Press the delete key a few times and you will create a nice faded reflection from the original image .
Repeat this step for the second image .
Now to make those two images stand out a bit , create a new layer and set the mode to Overlay .
Create the effect described in Step 5 .
This is how our header should look after adding a nice tagline and some buttons .
Do n't forget to put all these graphics inside the " header " layer
folder to keep things organized here ;)
Step 19
If you look at the final image preview , you can see that we have nice tabs in the content area .
In order to create these tabs we 'll need to perform a few extra steps , but it 's definitely worth it .
First , create a large rectangle shape with the Rounded Rectangle Tool .
Make it 70 px high and a radius of 10 px or more if you wish .
Now we have to get rid of the bottom radius and make a perfect corner out of it .
Pick the Direct Selection Tool and click on the shape path .
Click the vertical point and drag it down while holding the Shift key until it reaches the same level with the horizontal axis .
So far so good but it 's still deformed .
You see the little handle .
Click on it and move it upwards to the point of the path .
Now we have created a perfect corner .
This is how it should look .
Repeat this step for the right bottom corner .
Step 20
Pick the Line tool and set it to 1 px .
Step 21
Draw in gray separators while holding the Shift key .
Step 22
Place some icons , headings , and a description for each tab .
I used Ray Cheung icons available from - WebAppers.com .
Usually one tab is always active and the others are inactive .
To make this clear in our
design , we need to find a way to accomplish this .
I desaturated the other icons and reduced the opacity for the headings and text while keeping the first active tab colorful and bright .
Step 23
To make the active tab more obvious , we 're going to give it a faded white background .
To do this first select the whole object and then subtract from the selection to get only the first tab selected .
This is what your selection should look like .
With a smaller soft brush , paint in a white background .
Step 24
Add the shadow .
Create a dark gray rectangle behind the tabs , as shown in the image .
Add a vector mask by clicking the little icon in the bottom of the layer palette .
Set the color to black , pick a large soft brush , and start deleting parts of the rectangle .
As a result , we get a nice fake shadow effect behind our tabs .
Finaly the attention to detail .
Draw in a 1 px gray line on the bottom of the tabs .
Mask the layer again like described earlier and with a big soft brush delete the left and right end of the line .
Now we get a nicely faded line that follows our shadow behind the tabs .
This is how our tabs should look .
Step 25
It 's time to design the content for our first tab .
We need a featured design image , a nice heading and some text .
First we
will create the featured image .
I thought that it would be nice to break the edginess of the design by creating a nice stacked photos effect for our
featured design image .
To do this , draw a white rectangle with a 1px light gray border , and a very subtle drop shadow effect .
Now copy that layer and rotate it slightly with the Free Transform Tool .
Do this one more time .
Import your featured image and place it over the white rectangles .
Do n't worry if the image is flowing outside the boxes , we will fix that .
Make a selection from the top rectangle , go to Select > Modify >
Contract and insert 5 px .
With the featured image layer selected click the Quick Mask icon on the bottom of our layer palette .
You will get nicely bordered image effect like shown in the image here .
This is how your layer order should look like .
Step 26
Do n't forget to keep things organized .
So create more layer folders and organize your palette .
This is how I have done it .
By adding a nice heading , some text , and bullet lists , our web design work is finished .
Let 's move on .
And again some layer organization .
Step 27 : Testimonials
I thought this one should be huge ; so I 've put this in a big box right after the main section .
First draw a big light gray rectangle about 220 px high .
Give it a 1 px gray border .
Then draw in another brighter rectangle by 10 px smaller on all sides .
Also add a 1 px light gray border .
Finally add some text and we 're done !
Step 28
It 's time for the footer .
Draw a big 400 px high , dark gray rectangle .
Step 29
Add some light effect the same way as described in Step 5 .
Step 30
Next , draw a 10 px high rectangle above the footer and add some subtle effect by adding two more lines on top and bottom like shown in the image .
Step 31
Create the very bottom part where the repeated navigation will be placed .
You can copy the rectangle from the top where the navigation is
placed , move it down and make it about 40 px high .
Place it at the very bottom of your canvas .
Please note that you may need to expand your canvas at this point so that all your graphics fit .
If you need to do that , then go to Image > Canvas size and set the height to fit the entire layout .
Step 32
Attention to detail again .
Add a 1px white line above the footer navigation box to give it a nice border effect .
Step 33
Add some footer content and separate it nicely within your grid .
Step 34
Finally organize all your layers inside the layer folders .
This is how I 've done it .

A month after a fatal fire in his organic chemistry laboratory at UCLA , Professor Patrick Harran e-mailed a state investigator with his chilling recollection of rushing in to see Sheri Sangji , his critically burned research assistant .
She sat upright on the floor , her arms outstretched .
“ I kneeled down and asked what happened , ” he wrote Jan. 28 .
“ She was panicky and said only there was a fire .
I asked [ a colleague ] if he called 911 and he said yes .
Sheri then began saying , ‘ Where are they ?
Where are they ? ’ ”
Sangji , 23 , suffered second - and third - degree burns over 43 % of her body in the Dec. 29 fire .
Her death 18 days later has raised questions about UCLA lab safety practices , as well as her training and supervision by Harran , a prominent researcher who joined the faculty in July .
Advertisement
His account is among a series of e-mails , investigation reports and other documents obtained by The Times through a California Public Records
Act request .
The records provide new details on the accident and on UCLA ’s efforts to address its repercussions , including media inquiries .
In electronic missives to university colleagues , Harran complained that UCLA had all but hung him out to dry in the press .
In one e-mail , he said that reports in two chemical industry publications “ read like an indictment , without having the facts . ”
In another , he took issue with a UCLA investigator ’s report , which was detailed in a March 1 story in The Times .
The report , citing previous lab deficiencies that had gone unfixed , made it “ sound like I deliberately did not adhere to policy ” and was part of a “ culture of neglect , ” he wrote .
In fact , Harran said , he had made as many of the corrections as he could , given that the lab was in the process of moving to another floor and was to be reinspected afterward .
Advertisement
In an e-mail criticizing the investigator ’s findings , which included improper storage of flammable liquids , Harran cited the “ pitiful state of the safety office , ” adding that “ they offered NO training for Sheri , but you do n’t see that anywhere ” in news accounts .
“ I could go on and on , but I won’t , ” he wrote .
“ Sheri was injured and died and I take responsibility .
It hurts me deeply .
But it just infuriates me the way the administration and staff are scrambling to protect their own [ hides ] .
I will remember this . ”
Kevin Reed , UCLA ’s vice chancellor for legal affairs , said Tuesday that he thought Harran ’s comment was made in a moment of candor and frustration .
Reed added that the staff and administration are n’t protecting anyone , but rather are focused on improving safety on campus .
In response to Sangji ’s death , UCLA launched a comprehensive review of lab safety protocols , stepped up inspections and shortened the time allowed to correct serious violations .
Chancellor Gene Block also set up a campuswide lab safety committee and ordered new measures to enhance accountability .

“ I believe we have to deal with this incident honestly and aggressively , making certain that we institute changes that will help prevent these types of accidents in the future , ” Block wrote to UC President Mark Yudof in a Feb. 27 e-mail to give him a “ heads up ” on The Times ’ March 1 story .
“ As a laboratory scientist , this accident is particularly painful for me . ”
Harran was at a conference Tuesday and could not be reached for comment .
In an earlier statement to The Times , he said he was heartbroken by Sangji ’s death .
Sangji was transferring up to two ounces of t- butyl lithium from one sealed container to another when a plastic syringe came apart in her hands , spewing the chemical compound , which ignites instantly when exposed to air .
The resulting flash fire quickly consumed her clothing , including her highly flammable synthetic sweater , which was not covered by a protective lab coat as required .
The Times reported in March that the earlier safety deficiencies in Harran ’s lab included employees not wearing lab coats .

The lack of proper protective equipment is one of the issues at the heart of an investigation by Cal / OSHA , which could issue its findings as early as this week .
Reed said Tuesday that he expects the agency to cite serious violations and impose substantial fines .
Inspectors from the university had previously faulted other labs in the Molecular Sciences Building where Sangji was burned for missing or inadequate safety gear .
A week before Sangji ’s injury , a graduate student in another lab suffered cuts and burns to his face and neck when an experiment went awry , another accident report stated .
The unidentified student , who was treated at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center ’s emergency room , told a university investigator that the explosion caused “ glass , hot oil and chemical to fly toward my face , torso ” and the surrounding area .
“ When the incident occurred , I had my prescription glasses on , but not lab coat , gloves or safety glasses / goggles , ” he said , adding that he had been trained in safety measures .

“ I had safety training from my previous university , ” he said , “ but not from UCLA after I transferred here in 2007 . ”

( CNN ) -- When Vanessa Hudgens ' naked photos hit the Internet , the " High School Musical " star quickly apologized .
But sending nude or seminude pictures , a phenomenon known as sexting , is a fast - growing trend among teens .
Phillip Alpert is a registered sex offender as a result of sending a nude photograph of his 16 - year - old girlfriend .
The National Campaign to Prevent Teen & Unplanned Pregnancy , a private nonprofit group whose mission is to protect children , and CosmoGirl.com , surveyed nearly 1,300 teens about sex and technology .
The result : 1 in 5 teens say they 've sexted even though the majority know it could be a crime .
Phillip Alpert found out the hard way .
He had just turned 18 when he sent a naked photo of his 16 - year - old girlfriend , a photo she had taken and sent him , to dozens of her friends and family after an argument .
The high school sweethearts had been dating for almost 2½ years .
" It was a stupid thing I did because I was upset and tired and it was the middle of the night and I was an immature kid , " says Alpert .
Orlando , Florida , police did n't see it that way .
Alpert was arrested and charged with sending child pornography , a felony to which he pleaded no contest but was later convicted .
He was sentenced to five years probation and required by Florida law to register as a sex offender .
" You will find me on the registered sex offender list next to people who have raped children , molested kids , things like that , because I sent child pornography , " says Alpert in disbelief , explaining , " You think child pornography , you think 6 - year - old , 3 - year - old little kids who can't think for themselves , who are taken advantage of .
That really was n't the case . "
Alpert 's attorney Larry Walters agrees and he 's fighting to get Alpert removed from Florida 's sex offender registry .
The law lags behind the technology , he says .
" Sexting is treated as child pornography in almost every state and it catches teens completely offguard because this is a fairly natural and normal thing for them to do .
It is surprising to us as parents , but for teens it 's part of their culture . "
In many states , like Florida , if a person is convicted of a crime against children , it automatically triggers registration to the sex offender registry .
Thirty - eight states include juvenile sex offenders in their sex offender registries .
Alaska , Florida and Maine will register juveniles only if they are tried as adults .
Indiana registers juveniles age 14 and older .
South Dakota registers juveniles age 15 and older .
Most states allow public access to sex offender registries via the Internet and anyone with a computer can locate registered sex offenders in their neighborhoods .

A number of states have elected not to provide Internet access to registries ; Florida is not one of them .
There is no hiding for Alpert , whose neighbors , he says , all know .
" I am a sex offender .
If you type my name into the search engine online , you will find me . "
As sexting incidents pop up around the country , prosecutors are trying to come to terms with how these cases should be handled .
George Skumanick Jr. , a district attorney from Wyoming County , Pennsylvania , took a novel approach when 20 students from Tunkhannock High School were caught allegedly sexting .
He gave them a choice : probation and re-education classes or be charged with sexual abuse of a minor .
" An adult would go to prison for this , " says Skumanick , adding , " If you take the photo , you 've committed a crime .
If you send the photo , you 've committed a different crime , but essentially the same crime . "
Critics , however , say child pornography laws on the possession or dissemination of graphic images were never meant to apply to teen sexting and that these teenagers usually have no criminal intent when they send pictures to each other .
amFIX : Should teens be prosecuted for " sexting " ?
Fifteen - year - old Marissa Miller of northeastern Pennsylvania was 12 when she and a friend snapped themselves wearing training bras .
" I was n't trying to be sexual , " she says , " I was having fun with my friends at a sleepover , taking pictures , dancing to music . "
The picture recently surfaced on a student 's cell phone and Marissa 's mom , MaryJo Miller , was contacted by Skumanick .
" He told me that he had a full nude photo of my daughter , " says MaryJo Miller , who calls the picture innocent .
Rather than force her daughter to take the classes , which would have required she write a report explaining why what she did was wrong , Miller and two other families ­-- with the help of the ACLU -- are suing the district attorney to stop him from filing charges .
" We believe she was the victim and that she did nothing wrong , " says Miller .
" How can I ask her to compromise her values and write this essay , when she did n't do anything ? "
Although the district attorney maintains the program is voluntary , the letter he sent to parents notes , " Charges will be filed against those who do not participate . "
Seventeen of the 20 students caught in the sexting incidents have completed the 14 hours of classes .
Skumanick wo n't comment on the Miller case , but says , " You can't call committing a crime fun or a prank .
If you do that , you can rob a bank because you think it 's fun . "
In the majority of sexting cases , it 's usually girls sending pictures to boys , who then send them to their friends .
Though teens may think it 's funny and a way to flirt or even seek revenge after a breakup , there can be dangerous consequences .
Last year , Jessica Logan , a Cincinnati , Ohio , teen , hanged herself after her nude photo , meant for her boyfriend , was sent to teenagers at several high schools .
For months after , her father says , she was the subject of ridicule and taunts .
" Everyone knew about that photo , " Bert Logan says .
" She could not live it down . "
On July 3 , his wife found her .
" She had been getting dressed to go out .
The curling iron was still warm .
It was so unexpected , " Logan says .
" I heard my wife scream , I ran up to Jessie 's room , but it was too late . "
No charges had been filed against Jessica 's 19 - year - old boyfriend , who disseminated the photo , nor had the school taken any action , Logan says .
He says he and his wife want to warn parents and students of the dangers of sexting .
The Logans are fighting to raise awareness nationally and to advocate for laws that address sexting and cyber - bullying .
As for Alpert , life is not easy as a registered sex offender , a label he will carry until the age of 43 .
He 's been kicked out of college , he cannot travel out of the county without making prior arrangements with his probation officer , he has lost many friends and is having trouble finding a job because of his status as a convicted felon .
He says he feels terrible about sending the photo of his ex-girlfriend , especially since they were once so close .
At the same time , Alpert says , " I 'm being punished for the rest of my life for something that took two minutes or less to do . "
Says attorney Walters , " Some judges have the good sense and reasonableness to treat this as a social problem and others are more zealous in their efforts to put everybody away and I think it 's time as a society that we step back a little bit and avoid this temptation to lock up our children . "

Honda has announced their new ad Campaign for the 2013 CRX SiR today at the Denver Auto Show .
Honda shocked the crowd at the Denver Convention Center by debuting the long awaited sequal to the popular sports car , which came as a surprise to show goers and the media alike .
Some speculate that the relatively lackluster design and “ fuel efficiency as king ” mentality surrounding the previously released and now cancelled CRZ proved to disillusion enthusiasts who were blindsided by the heinous tribute to its iconic predecessor .
Honda designers apparently must have been working overtime , because the new CRX comes just months after word the CRZ concept would be scrapped for cost saving reasons .
According to the press kit , the new 2013 CRX will have the legendary K20A 2.0L 222 Hp engine and 6 speed LSD equipped transmission , both out of the JDM Civic Type - R .
The car weighs in at a paltry 2000 lbs , no doubt a credit to the carbon fiber seen in the hood and front fenders , and although not listed in the press kit , the Honda rep at the show said they expect to see 35 mpg easily from the new model .
The release of the new CRX SiR , a first for North America , comes after Honda recently cancelled the S2000 roadster and sold off its F1 team , leaving fans of the red H wondering if honda had given up on its racing heritage .
This new model however , seems to be a step in the right direction .

Jan Nedergaard of the University of Stockholm did the opposite of Dr. Kozak .
He and Barbara Cannon , also at the University of Stockholm , studied mice that were genetically engineered so their brown fat could not burn calories .
The animals became fat .
“ Until very recently , we would have said that it is doubtful that differences in brown fat really could contribute to obesity , ” Dr. Nedergaard said .
Now , he said he had changed his mind , at least for mice .
The key to finding brown fat in humans was PET - CT scans .
The PET scans pinpoint areas where cells are actively burning glucose and the CT scans identify it as fat .
Because brown fat rapidly burns glucose to produce heat , it lights up in PET scans .
In two of the three studies , investigators also studied samples of brown fat that were removed from a few subjects , confirming that the cells had a protein , UCP - 1 , that is unique to brown fat .
Brown fat in adult humans was in an unexpected place .
Infants have it mostly as a sheet of cells covering their backs .
Rodents have it mostly between their shoulder blades , just down from the neck .
But in adult humans , it showed up in the upper back , on the side of the neck , in the dip between the collarbone and shoulder , and along the spine .
That may be one reason it was missed for so long , Dr. Kahn said .
“ There was an interest in looking at humans 20 or 25 years ago with different scanning techniques , but people were always looking between the shoulder blades , ” he said .
And since there is so little brown fat — just a few grams of tissue — it can be hard to find , Dr. Kahn added .
His study , one of the three published Thursday , involved 1,972 people who had had PET - CT scans for a variety of reasons .
The scans showed brown fat in 7.5 percent of the women and 3 percent of the men — an underestimate , Dr. Kahn says , because the people had not activated brown fat by getting cold .
Dr. Kahn and his colleagues also examined surgical samples taken from the necks of two patients .
They concluded that what looked like brown fat in their scans was indeed brown fat .
When I married my wife seven years ago , she was 20 pounds lighter .
She 's unwilling to sacrifice a constant flow of sugary stuff , and lazy about working out .
During our last conversation about her weight , she said I should be attracted to her no matter what , then said , " I 'm happy with my weight , and do n't intend to change it . "
This sent me into a panic .
I 'm somewhat and sometimes attracted to her at her current weight , but I would be greatly and frequently attracted if she lost the extra pounds .
I want her to understand that being attracted to her is a basic need , and almost all of my crankiness stems from it not being met .
I 've been willing to sacrifice a lot -- like working long hours to support our kids while she pursues a career she loves that generates almost no income .
I have a strong preference for a certain body type -- the one she used to have -- and I 'm willing to do virtually anything , and pay any amount of money , to see it again .
The only thing I 'm not willing to do is make her miserable .
-- Weighed Down
In the dating phase , women do what it takes to attract and hang onto a man : looking after their looks and maintaining a figure that 's more hourglass than beer keg .
While there are some wives whose medical issues prevent them from losing weight , too many interpret " Till death do us part " as " You 're stuck with me forever -- more of me than you 'd ever imagined . "
In worst cases , a woman will eat herself so big that Greenpeace tries to save her -- until they realize that 's a scrunchie on her head , not a decorative blowhole .
Beyond all the love hooha , marriage , especially as a child - farming enterprise , is a business partnership .
Each partner has their end of the bargain to hold up , including not becoming substantially different from the person the other person married .
Yes , I know it can be exhausting taking care of kids , and tedious lifting big old weights instead of Little Debbies .
Well , it 's exhausting and tedious earning a living , too , but imagine countering your wife 's " I 'm happy with my weight , and do n't intend to change it ! " with " I 'm happy with the money I 've earned , and plan to take the rest of my life off to drink beer and wax my car . "
Just guessing , but her response probably would n't be turning the other chin .
The sad thing is , many women who are fat are n't that way thanks to a diet that 's high in cupcakes , or because their fitness goal is avoiding ever going to the gym .
In fact , their attempts to lose weight might be making them fat .
Award - winning investigative science journalist Gary Taubes has discovered that we 've been sold a bill of goods by the medical establishment , which based its advice to follow high - carb , low - fat diets on " science " instead of science .
In Taubes ' exhaustively researched book , Good Calories , Bad Calories , he lays out substantive evidence that obesity is caused by carbs -- from flour , sugars , and easily digested starches like potatoes -- that cause insulin levels to rise .
When insulin levels rise , we stockpile calories as fat .
Eating foods with very low ( or no ) carbs -- meat , fish , poultry , cheese , eggs , butter , and non-starchy veggies -- decreases appetite and increases fat loss and weight loss .
Women have been brainwashed by feminism 's whacked contention that men " should n't " care about women 's looks , that what 's inside is all that matters .
And because women do n't care nearly as much about men's looks , they can't understand why men are so fixated on theirs .
The truth is , male sexuality is different from female sexuality .
It 's highly visual , which explains the vast porn industry for men , and the itsy bitsy -- almost novelty -- industry for women .
And , while men go for nonstop body shots in their porn , Susan Dominus reports in The New York Times that not only do women want more plot , more emotion , and more conversation , they want to know " Is the bedspread pretty ? " and " Why is she wearing those shoes ? "
You need to help your wife understand that you 're making this plea because you love her and want to keep the spark in your marriage ( and sadly , you are n't able to make do with the kind generated by her thighs rubbing together ) .
Chapter three of evolutionary psychologist David Buss ' book The Evolution Of Desire should help you explain that men are hard - wired to be looks - driven .
After you get that out of the way , explain what you wrote above :
You sacrifice a lot for her and your kids , without reservation .
You ask only one thing from her -- not that she meet some bizarro new need , just that she start acting like she said " I do " to being in a partnership with you , not " I dough . "

Former Friends star Matthew Perry was forced to seek medical attention after destroying his hand playing videogames .
The actor admits he spends days on end glued to the screen playing war games on his Xbox , ruining the muscles and tendons in his hand .
Perry says , " I play a lot of video games a lot of Xbox 360 .
I played Fall Out 3 so often I had to go to a hand doctor .
I used my hand too much and had to get injections in it . "

$ 250 poorer and wiser , I feel I owe it to the sexually active community to share my completely unauthoritative , perfectly random reviews .
Here they are , organized by a categorization system I just made up myself : Bath toys :-- GV bath fizzies .
They fizzle and flop .
Giant marble fizzy balls that come in a pack of 3 that costs almost $ 15 , they fizzle in a boring manner for about 8.2 seconds and then make your bathwater taste all funny .
( An important consideration , given the context . ) -- GV bubble bath .
We chose Jasmine Green Tea , which smelled and tasted delicious .
Plus it adds slickness , which is what sex - related bubble bath should be all about .
-- Rubber ducky .
Incredibly dull , this duck vibrates a bit and then sort of sinks lopsided into the water .
And then you 've got some stupid tchotchke that you either display in your bathroom , leading to all kinds of inappropriate conversations when your 2 - year old niece comes to visit , or you have yet another consumer item ( in this consumerist land ) that you hide somewhere and forget about until it 's time to move .
I wish I 'd never laid eyes on this toy .
I would try to sell it on Craig 's List , except the I do n't clearly understand the health implications .
Oral sex toys :-- Strawberry Gel.
Mixed reviews .
Tastes okay , but its main feature is that it causes this really neat ( or really obnoxious , " I have to run screaming to the shower right now , it feels like you smeared Ben Gay on my pussy " ) cool sensation .
Lesson learned :
Think * dime - sized .*-- GV Chai mints .
Tastes wonderful , but apparently did n't do much for his dick .
Cinnamon Altoids proved to be much more successful here , especially when blown on lightly .
Vibrating toys :-- Rabbit vibrator .
This thing is intimidating !
But then , so are most vibrators , right ?
It 's just that hard - shell plastic ... well ... and all those tiny controls ... it 's like having sex with NASA ground control .
The clit stimulation is loud and clear , a bit too intense for me .
The main thing I learned is that playing with a Rabbit vibrator turns guys on .
This from my sample group of one guy .
-- Neptune ring .
This is basically the Rabbit turned into a soft flexible cock ring .
Super fun for him , I finally made him turn it upside down to tickle his balls rather than do what felt like exfoliating my clit .
After that it was wonderful .-- Fingertip vibrator .
Another great item if you love electronics .
It felt like that damn cord was always where you wanted to come , and the tiny black control box just did n't do it for me .
Very futuristic sex , which may or may not be what you 're looking for -- but you can't beat a vibrating fingertip massage .
Despite its space - ageness , it was pretty cool and quite versatile .
Best all - around toy :-- GV massage oil .
The operative word here is " lickable . "
This was my favorite item .
Satsuma smells like Christmas tangerines , and the mango - orange one is like a summer evening in paradise .
Nothing to replace humans here , this is romantic and sexy and slippery and fun to wrestle with ... ah , getting lost just thinking about the endless possibilities .
Bonus toys : This is stuff we did n't get at Good Vibrations .
You can get all this at Long 's Drugs .
-- Sesame Street bathtime fingerpaint .
Ugh .
It smells and tastes terrible , and it takes forever to blend red and blue to get purple .
Plus , weird colored stripes on your lover 's body is less appealing than you might guess .-- Long 's bath fizzies .
Long 's answer to the GV bath bombs , these are , if possible , even worse .
They smelled so much like chemical waste that I quickly wrapped them back up to send off to my niece ( kids love chemical waste ) without even telling my lover I bought them .
-- Dove 's chocolate sauce .
Actually , I have no idea why I 'm writing about this since we have n't even tried it yet .
Sounds great , does n't it ?
But we had to buy two kinds because he likes milk and I like dark .
And we have to heat it up in a pan of water .
The whole thing 's so complicated .
But my * fantasy * of it is spectacular .
-- The afore - mentioned cinnamon Altoid's .
I believe cinnamon adds class to the act of eating an Altoid while going down on your lover .
Maybe that 's just me .-- Neutrogena light massage oil .
Or bath oil , or whatever it 's called .
This stuff is fantastic !
Scent - free , taste - free , light and sexy .
And cheap !
We could use gallons of this stuff and still have money left over for the opera .
That is , if we were into the opera .
Bonus tips :-- Do n't try to experiment with $ 250 worth of sex toys in the space of ten hours .
You 'll be tempted , but at some point you 'll become severely desensitized and wonder if your sex organs will ever work again .
The first symptom is extreme crankiness toward the inventor of silicone .
The second is a perverse paranoid suspicion that your lover may be related to the inventor of silicone .
The third is a sudden craving for food that is n't consumed from your lover 's body .
-- If you do n't heed the above advice , the only cure is a deep rejuvenating sleep and several days of actively refusing to consider the sexual implications of each and every item to which you are exposed .
Force yourself to quit thinking of new uses for feather dusters and shower mats !
Not to mention staplers and scotch tape .
-- A girl 's best friend is her dropcloth .
Before you embark on your mapcap erotic adventure , dig up an old heavy quilt to drape over your expensive and easily - soiled sheets .
It 's like birth control , you 'll be glad you thought of it in advance .
In closing : The only sex worth having is sex with a really communicative , considerate , fun partner .
As it turns out , I had as much fun with $ 0 worth of sex toys as I did with $ 250 .
That said , there 's no one I would rather blow a quarter of a thousand dollars with .
It 's jail and prison guards gone wild this week , and a veteran California cop whose pill problem got the best of him .
Let 's get to it :
In Bangor , Maine , a former Penobscot County jail guard was sentenced Tuesday to six months in jail for smuggling marijuana and prescription drugs into the jail for prisoners .
Lori Call pleaded guilty to two counts of trafficking in prison contraband .
She also faces two years probation , random drug tests , and substance abuse counseling .
In New York City , a guard at the Sing Sing state prison was indicted Monday for accepting cash and cocaine from an undercover agent .
Ashley Harris , 47 , was arrested February 19 at a Bronx gas station after taking $ 500 and eight ounces of cocaine from the agent , who was posing as a drug dealer .
Harris was indicted on six counts of criminal possession of a controlled substance , which prosecutors said was destined for the prison .
His arrest was the culmination of a three - month sting by state narcs and the Department of Correctional Services .
In Kingston , New York , an Ulster Country Jail guard was arrested last Friday on charges he trafficked drugs at the jail .
Guard Peter Portalatin , 23 , went down after investigators determined he had smuggled heroin , Oxycontin , marijuana , and tobacco into the jail and set him up in a sting .
He now faces charges of bribe receiving in the second degree , attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree , receiving reward for official misconduct in the second degree , attempted promoting prison contraband in the first degree and tampering with physical evidence , all felonies .
He was also charged with official misconduct and resisting arrest , both misdemeanors .
He returned to the county jail as a prisoner until he makes his $ 10,000 cash bail .
Oh , and he 's now a former jail guard .
He was fired the same day he was arrested .
In Texarkana , Arkansas , a former Miller County jail guard was sentenced February 26 to a whopping 28 years in prison for smuggling contraband hidden in food items to inmates .
Jordan Michael Waller , 26 , carried tacos , pizzas , and chili to work with him and used the food to hide cell phones , chargers , methamphetamine , marijuana , syringes , tobacco , and rolling papers .
Family members testified that Waller suffered from paranoid schizophrenia , but that it was manageable with medication .
In Alameda , California , an Alameda police officer was arrested February 26 for visiting the residence of a terminally ill person and telling the family police provided medication disposal services , but keeping the pills for his own use .
It did not appear to be an isolated incident , said police commanders .
Sgt. Ronald Jones , a 26 - year - year veteran of the department , was charged with two felony counts of using fraud , deceit or misrepresentation to obtain a controlled substance .
He is on administrative leave .
This judge lays out the not so shocking truth about who is really benefiting from the war on drugs .
First of all think of who is winning in the war on drugs ?
1.Drug Dealers .
( They sucessfully take billions of dollars out of the economy tax free )
2.Government anti-drug bureaucrats ( they all know it ’s futile , but they want to keep their jobs )
3.Politicians ( They get elected by talking tough , and they show how tough they are by funding number 2 )
4.Private Sector people who benefit from an increase in crime .
( Newspapers , News Channels , Private Prisons )
5.Terrorists ( That ’s where they get money to buy stuff )
Digg CEO Jay Adelson ( top left ) and founder and chief architect Kevin Rose ( top right ) .
Photo : Jim Merithew / Wired.comAUSTIN , Texas – Social news - sharing site Digg is one of the web 's top crowdsourcing success stories .
By letting its users vote up content that interests them , thereby deciding what belongs on the front page and what does n't , Digg has rewritten the rules of news gathering and information sharing on the web .
The site has also earned a reputation as an excellent resource for breaking news – whatever story , blog post , video or photo is currently burning up the web , chances are you saw it on Digg first .
But much has changed since the site first launched at the end of 2004 .
Though the Digg army continues to grow – there are 4 million registered Digg users – other , more immediate methods of sharing news have emerged .
Twitter is faster for sharing links , and messages are short and sweet , making the flood of updates easier to scan .
Also , more and more users are turning to Facebook to spread links , photos and videos to their friends .
So how does Digg plan to stay relevant ?
We got the chance to ask founder Kevin Rose and CEO Jay Adelson this week here at South by Southwest Interactive .
We talked to Digg 's head honchos the morning after their Bigg Digg Shindigg , the massive event at Stubb's that was one of the hottest parties at SXSWi .
Jay and Kevin talked about the new technology they 're rolling out , like a new Digg toolbar , integration with Facebook Connect and OpenID , an updated search tool and more customization features .
Wired.com : First of all , what should we expect from Digg in 2009 ?
Jay Adelson :
We 're concentrating on things that are involved in engaging the user on and off the site , like Diggbar , Facebook Connect and other identity integrations for other platforms .
That also involves scaling the site to handle that next wave of growth .
We 're going to do a total overhaul of your ability to search on the site and we 're rethinking how we do customized pages for users , with customized feeds and so forth .
That 's already a Herculean list , but a lot of stuff is going on .
The first one , the Diggbar , is a pretty major deal for us and how people consume the site .
Wired.com : Yeah , tell us about the Diggbar .
Kevin Rose :
It 's not out yet , but it 's coming soon .
Basically , it 's a small , framed bar , it 's not software you install .
It turns Digg into a short URL provider , so now all of our links will be , for example digg.com /8357 .
When you go to one of these shortened URLs , it draws a really thin bar across the top .
You get the full destination site underneath it , but you also get this thin bar at the top that allows you to Digg it , to see the hot comments on that story , to see related content to the article you 're viewing beneath it .
There 's also a " random " button that gives you Stumble Upon - type functionality that takes you to random sites around the web .
If you want to create a Diggbar , just go into your browser 's address bar .
Leave the full URL in there for the site you 're currently browsing , and just type " digg.com / " in front of that and hit Enter .
We take that entire URL , process it , turn it into a short URL , then bring you back to the page with the Diggbar and the full original site beneath it .
You get redirected to the short URL , so you can grab it and copy it .
We also have icons on the Diggbar to post to Facebook and Twitter .
It 's just a great way to spread our content to the most popular microblogging services .
Digg founder Kevin Rose .

Wired.com :
It 's great for publishers , too .
Adelson : Oh sure .
It keeps you on their site .
And it will actually take you deeper into their site because the bar shows you related stories from that site as opposed to having to go back to Digg and do a search there .
Rose :
Yeah if you click on " Related Stories " in the bar , rather than bringing you back to Digg , we just slide down a little tray and show you other content from that source .

If there 's no other content on Digg from that site , does it just pull in related Digg headlines from other sites ?
Adelson :
That 's the idea , exactly .
It 's actually smart enough to know whether or not there 's enough in the system .
Rose :
It also provides analytic information , so you can see how many times the link has been visited .
Maybe it has 4,000 Diggs , but how many times has this article actually been viewed ?
Wired.com : Probably about twenty .
Rose : ( Laughs )
Actually , you 'd really be surprised .
I 've seen stories that had 3,000 or 4,000 Diggs that have been viewed 75,000 or 100,000 times .
That 's insane , so we thought it would be great to expose that .
Plus , when you create the short URL in the Diggbar , you want to be able to send it around to your friends and see how many times your friends viewed it .
You can see what impact you had by spreading the link around Twitter .
Wired.com :
How do you handle the friend tracking ?
Is it just Digg friends , or if the user is logged in through Facebook Connect , will it track the activity of their Facebook friends as well ?
Rose : Initially it will be just Digg , but when we launch Facebook Connect a few weeks later , we 'll be able to show you that activity as well .
Adelson : Yes , Facebook Connect is coming soon .
Wired.com :
And what about OpenID ?
Adelson : Coming soon as well .
One of the decisions we made pretty early on in the Facebook Connect adoption was to put a lot of work into our sign - on engine being applicable to a number of different identity systems .
So , if we want to add another system down the road , it will be phenomenally less difficult than if we had to start from scratch .
It also means we can exponentially increase our registration base overnight , and make the barrier to entry to Digging from a remote site really low .
If you 're already logged in through Facebook Connect somewhere and you want to Digg a story , you do n't have to leave that page .
We 're overhauling the Digg buttons as well to make it so you do n't have to leave the page .
Wired.com :
What 's the audience overlap between Facebook and Digg ?
Adelson :
There are 4 million registered Digg users and about 35 million monthly visitors .
Compare that to Facebook , which has over 100 million registered users .
But Digg has mostly early adopters , about 58 % male , they tend to be well - educated with a higher income .
I think that Facebook is 100 % mainstream , so it skews the web 's entire demographic .
We 're more focused and narrow .
Wired.com : When will Diggbar launch ?
Adelson :
When it 's ready .
We 're testing everything internally right now and as soon as we feel like it 's locked down , we 'll put it out .
We really want to get out of the formality of product launches .
If you worry about hitting a certain date , you can miss the point of making it a quality release .
Take your time .

Wired.com :
You mentioned changes to your site search .
Can you tell us more about that ?
Rose :
It 's going to be awesome .
I feel like I 'm going to finally be able to say that we have a real site search tool .
Right now , it 's easy to search by headline keyword or by source , like to choose " Wired.com " and do a search .
But if you 're looking for a certain topic or something more general that 's not source specific , that 's where it breaks down today .
That stuff is what we 're overhauling .
Wired.com :
One of the things I 've always been most fascinated by on your site is the Labs stuff like the data visualizations you did with Stamen Design .
Do you still have a relationship with them ?
Adelson : We do .
It 's definitely evolved a lot .
With Stamen , it 's always been more than just a design relationship .
We literally stood in front of white boards and came up with these ideas with these guys .
Now there 's a lot less time for that .
I want to tell you there will be more this year , but maybe only one or two .
We want to expand the Labs section .
We 're talking about releasing things that are n't as polished , some more experimental projects .
Rose :
And more things we can incorporate on the main Digg site .
I want to do it more like how Gmail Labs works , where you can just enable or disable features and it effects your entire product .
We want to do that as well , so people can turn things on and off and change their view of the Digg front page .
Wired.com : Kevin , tell us about WeFollow , your new Twitter directory .
Rose : I just wanted to see what would happen if you let people organize themselves in a directory based on Twitter " @ " replies .
So , you just Twitter @wefollow and add three hash tags you want to be listed under , and you 're automatically categorized under those tags on the website .
Each tag is sorted by most followers .
It 's no business .
It 's just me coming up with an idea .
Adelson :
It kind of gives you some insight into how Digg began , actually .
It was pretty much Kevin playing around with an idea on weekends .
Kevin :
Yeah , I literally built it in a week .
It 's taken off , too .
It 's been up a day and we 've added close to 10,000 users to the directory already .
Google added themselves to the directory , which is awesome .
Wired.com :
What are your own tags ?
Rose :
Mine are #tech , #digg and #tea .
Wired.com : Kevin , how much time do you spend on Digg during the day ?
Is it the first site you hit every morning ?
Rose : Yeah , it 's my home page .
It 's a problem , because I get sucked into it like everybody else does .
I try not to spend too much time – I glance at the top 10 list and I 'll look at some of the recently submitted stories .
After that , I have to close it and go do actual work , because otherwise I 'd sit there watching cats do crazy shit all day long .
It 's like working in a candy store .
Wired.com :
The diversity of links on front page has really improved over the last couple of months .
Why is that ?
Is it organic , or is it something that 's engineered ?
Adelson :
It 's both .
What we needed to do is make sure it 's fair .
We have n't changed the fact that every Digg user has an equal opportunity to make it to the front page , but we have thrown some more components into the algorithm to help increase diversity .
So , it is harder for somebody who has a really strong following of the same group of Diggers to get something on the home page .
We also have to balance out that filtering , because some of those guys who make it to the front page a lot are the absolute best content discovery guys out there .
There 's a reason why they 've done so well – it's because they 're awesome at it .
You want to give them the same opportunity .
We 've also thrown a bunch of knobs and sliders on the system now so we do n't have to do a new code push every time it needs adjusting .
Wired.com :
So it 's the kind of thing that 's constantly changing day to day ?
Adelson : Yeah .
For example , the dupe detection algorithm we use is going to be significantly improved in the coming months .
That 's going to have a huge impact on Digg counts , how hot stories are submitted , and giving credit to whoever submitted it first .
When that update happens , we 'll have to tweak everything again , because one change has all sorts of ramifications .
Wired.com :
Do you spend time studying other social news sites like Reddit , Stumble Upon or Slashdot ?
Rose :
No , that stuff does n't really interest me that much .
I 'd rather look at the new ways information is spreading around on the web .
I 'm much more interested in looking at Twitter , or how URL shortening services are becoming a big deal .
That 's the stuff I want to make sure we 're on top of .
I do n't think I 've ever seen a competitor to Digg to date that I 've ever been worried about per se , because all of them just offer something along the same lines of what we do .
I think if there 's ever going to be any serious competition , it 's going to be from a completely different direction that we 're not expecting .
There 's enough humans out there to go around .
I do n't feel like those other sites are taking anything away from us .
In fact , we all need to become larger .
There are 4 million registered users on Digg .
I want to see a world where we have 50 or 100 million users .

" We are set on a disastrous course .
Governments must accept that the way we use energy must change and that a painful period of adjustment lies ahead .
The energy efficiency of energy use and procurement should lie at the heart of decision - making and a good starting point is to ensure that reliable efficiency data is available to guide this process . "
Energy efficiency now supposedly lies at the heart of EU and US energy policies .
Whilst we are most aware of the merit of energy efficiency of energy consumption , e.g. fuel - efficient cars and well - insulated buildings , the concept of energy efficiency of energy procurement is one that has been largely overlooked .
One reason for this has been the vast energy surplus provided by historic supergiant oil and gas fields of the Middle East , Russia and the Americas and vast surface coal deposits of Africa , Asia and Australia .
As production from these historic fossil fuel deposits starts to decline , the OECD economies are being forced to procure energy from other sources such as wind , tidal , solar , bio - fuel and nuclear .
Without most of us being aware of the fact , it has suddenly become important to understand the energy efficiency of new energy procurement systems , if industrial society as we know it is to survive the next great energy transition away from fossil fuels .
The Energy Return on Energy Invested ( ERoEI ) provides one measure of the efficiency of energy procurement and is quite simply defined as :
Energy procured / Energy used to procure energy
The chart shows how the proportion of net energy available for society to use varies with ERoEI .
There is in fact much uncertainty in the data displayed and many large gaps in knowledge .
The shape of the curve shows that for ERoEI > 10 , the bulk of energy procured is available to society – to power industry , transportation , schools and hospitals .
With falling ERoEI < 10 there is an exponential increase in the amount of energy required to procure energy with a corresponding decline in net energy available for society .
The chart is not zero scaled and shows that for ERoEI = 1 , no net energy is produced .
The yellow arrow , pointing to ERoEI = 9 is intended to provoke some debate since we do not know with any certainty what the minimum ERoEI for modern industrial civilisation is .
One thing that we do know for sure is that we have used a significant proportion of the easy to access fossil fuels and that new resources scheduled for exploitation will require much larger amounts of energy to procure .
The average energy pool available to the global economy is therefore relentlessly marching towards lower aggregate ERoEI .
As society uses more energy to procure energy , an inevitable consequence is that less energy is available for everything else , in a stable energy production environment .
Certain areas of current energy use must fail and the way the free market is trying to resolve this problem is to select energy intensive industries for extinction , for example air travel and motor vehicle manufacture , however , current Government policies are trying to prevent this natural selection process , propping up the motor industry on both sides of the Atlantic , expanding airports , whilst subsidising inefficient means of procuring energy such as temperate latitude bio-fuels .
We are set on a disastrous course .
Governments must accept that the way we use energy must change and that a painful period of adjustment lies ahead .
The energy efficiency of energy use and procurement should lie at the heart of decision - making and a good starting point is to ensure that reliable efficiency data is available to guide this process .

Rubbing it in , Dems create ' I 'm sorry , Rush ' site for GOP officials Ron Brynaert
Published : Wednesday March 4 , 2009
Print This Email This Even if it turns out they do n't have a big enough boat to capture their whale , Democrats do n't appear to be letting this one go anytime soon .
" Democrats will continue Wednesday to portray Rush Limbaugh as the spokesman for the Republican Party by launching a Web page that mocks GOP leaders for apologizing to the radio host for criticizing or publicly disagreeing with him , " CNN Political Editor Mark Preston reports at the network 's political ticker .
Preston adds , " The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is hosting the page  www.imsorryrush.com  which allows visitors to create an apology to Limbaugh on behalf of Rep. Phil Gingrey , R- Georgia ; South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford ; or Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele . "
The top of the site includes a quote by White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel : " Whenever a Republican criticizes him , they have to run back and apologize to him . "
" Ever wonder how Republicans are able to tuck their tail between their legs and apologize to Rush Limbaugh so quickly after they 've offended their leader ?
We 've uncovered the secret Republican Apology Machine .
Give it a try ! "
Users can choose to " apologize " on behalf of GOP leaders for calling Limbaugh pre-selected insults such as " an opportunistic brick thrower , " " ugly , " or " an idiot . "
" You and I both know that in reality , you simply want President Obama to fail in this time of economic collapse , " the mocking fake letter reads .
" How can I disagree with that ?
Please accept my sincere apologies , oh great leader of the Republican Party . "
CQ Politics noted Tuesday that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was also doing his best to tie the Republican party to the controversial talk radio host , although perhaps not in a completely explicit or over manner .
" The Republicans have made a decision just to say no to everything .
It s very clear theyve made a decision that they want President Obama to fail , " Reid told reporters Tuesday afternoon .
 And this smoke that theyve thrown up for this bill is only an effort to kill the bill , not to improve the bill .
It s simply to damage the bill . 
CQ's David Natter asks , " How do we know Reid was talking about Limbaugh ?
Read on : ' I m not going to name individual Republicans , but I think its very clear , as a result of the actions , since Obama was elected , that people want him to fail .
Some have said so , others have just acted accordingly .
And I think that as a result of whats been going on in the press the last few days , we know that theres a significant number of Republicans out there who want the president to fail . ' "
" What s been going on in the press for the last few days ? "
Natter continues .
" Oh , right  the CPAC conference where Limbaugh fired up the crowd and told conservatives to stop apologizing for wanting to block Obamas agenda . "
DNC chair Tim Kaine quickly took advantage of Steele 's apology Monday night : " I was briefly encouraged by the courageous comments made by my counterpart in the Republican Party over the weekend , challenging Rush Limbaugh as the leader of the Republican Party and referring to his show as incendiary  and ugly .
However , Chairman Steeles reversal this evening and his apology to Limbaugh proves the unfortunate point that Limbaugh is the leading force behind the Republican Party , its politics and its obstruction of President Obamas agenda in Washington . "
On Tuesday , RAW STORY reported that polls by Gallup in February show that Limbaugh has less favorable ratings from the mainstream public than former President George W. Bush .
The most recent Gallup poll of Bush 's approval ratings , conducted in early January , showed that his favorably rating had risen to 40 , while another poll determined Limbaugh 's favorable rating was 28 .
While Bush 's unfavorable rating at 59 crushed Limbaugh 's 45 , previous Gallup polls show that despite a highly unpopular war , myriad political scandals and a recession , the former president 's favorable rating never fell as low as Limbaugh 's 28 .
Politico reports that top Democratic operatives hatched the ' go after Rush ' strategy late last year .
" The strategy took shape after Democratic strategists Stanley Greenberg and James Carville included Limbaughs name in an October poll and learned their longtime tormentor was deeply unpopular with many Americans , especially younger voters , " Jonathan Martin writes .
" Then the conservative talk - radio host emerged as an unapologetic critic of Barack Obama shortly before his inauguration , when even many Republicans were showering him with praise . "
Martin continues , " Soon it clicked : Democrats realized they could roll out a new GOP bogeyman for the post - Bush era by turning to an old one in Limbaugh , a polarizing figure since he rose to prominence in the 1990s . "
Get Raw exclusives as they break -- Email & mobile Email - Never spam :
Snyder was blunt in his response .
" No way , " he tells Metro .
" I mean , am I masochistic ? "
The 42 - year - old director is a long - time fan of the novel written by Alan Moore and drawn by Dave Gibbons and knew how difficult it would be to turn it into a movie .
But after the initial rejection , Snyder thought about it .
As a fan , he knew it would be a tragedy to see anything less than a faithful big - screen adaptation .
He began to visualise how he would make it .
" I said : ' OK , I 'll have a meeting , " ' he recalls .
At the meeting with Warner Bros executives , Snyder began scrubbing line by line the studio's plan for Watchmen .
Most directors would be shown the door but Snyder was holding a trump card .
While the negotiations were going on in 2005 he was in the editing room putting the final touches on 300 , a stylised retelling of the ancient Greek Battle of Thermopylae .
The studio knew from Snyder 's unfinished cut of the swords - and - sandals epic that he was creating something special .
Audiences around the world would soon agree .
When 300 , based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller , was released in theatres it was a critical and box - office sensation , earning a global take of $ US456 million .
Snyder made 300 for the relatively frugal budget of $ US65 million , so it was one of 2007 's most profitable films .
When Watchmen appears in Australian cinemas on March 5 it will be nothing like the studio's first idea .
Snyder won the battle .
Watchmen is rated MA 15 + and is about 2 ½ hours long .
It is set in 1985 , as per the original graphic novel that comprises 12 issues , and it is sexy and politically charged .
Watchmen tells the story of an alternative reality in which superheroes walk among us while Richard Nixon is serving his fifth term as president .
The only character who possesses superhuman powers is Dr Manhattan , played by Billy Crudup .
The story begins with the murder of a retired superhero , the Comedian , but another superhero named Rorschach believes someone is trying to assassinate his former colleagues .
A convoluted story evolves .
" At 167 pages , I basically almost doubled the length of the script just trying to make it more like the book , " Snyder says .
" Although , to the studio's credit , when they saw my three - hour cut of the movie , they were pretty cool with me not knowing how to make it shorter .
" They were n't like : ' Bam , take that out . '
They said : ' What the hell did you do ?
This is n't what we asked for . '
But not in a bad way . "
Snyder is thrilled with the final product and , thanks to the studio , has been allowed to make the type of movie he always wanted to .
" They have let me make a movie which is crazy in a lot of ways . "
Actress Malin Akerman , who plays Silk Spectre II , describes the six - month Watchmen shoot , which took place in Canada , as " gruelling " for the cast but even more so for Snyder .
" He has put everything he has into this , " she says .
" I do n't know how he did it .
Some days were 18 hours long and for Zack , he 's the first one to get there , last one to leave and he never failed with his energy .
" He gave us all our energy when ours was fading .
I think because it 's such a passion for him , to see this novel come to life . "
Watchmen promises to be no ordinary comic - book fare .
Take , for example , the soundtrack Snyder has created , using artists as diverse as Bob Dylan and Nat King Cole .
Along with Cole 's classic Unforgettable , Snyder also uses Dylan 's anthem The Times They Are A - Changin ' .
" I love it because it 's strange to see a song like that in context with a superhero movie , " he says .
" You really feel how far away you are from Fantastic Four .
It 's a pretty long way down from there . "
Actor Matthew Goode , who plays Ozymandias , says he always knew the film was safe in Snyder 's more - than - capable hands .
" Zack is verging on being another Ridley Scott .
It 's a bit early to be saying that but 300 certainly opened people 's eyes to what he can do .
Watchmen is an R - rated movie [ in the US ] and it 's dark material .
" Not many people know about Watchmen but those who do know it absolutely love it and we 've all tried to do our bloody best and have given this our all . "

CONCORD � The New Hampshire House has killed a bill to decriminalize possession of up to an ounce of marijuana , one year after a similar measure died in the state Senate .
CONCORD � The New Hampshire House has killed a bill to decriminalize possession of up to an ounce of marijuana , one year after a similar measure died in the state Senate .
Democratic Rep. Steven Lindsey 's bill would have imposed a maximum fine of $ 100 on those caught with an ounce of marijuana or less .
Minors would have had to complete a drug treatment program and community service , or face an additional fine of $ 1,000 .
Possession of that amount is currently a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail .
The House passed a bill to decriminalize one quarter of an ounce last year .
Gov. John Lynch threatened to veto it and the Senate killed it .
Of course , Glenn Beck , Mark Steyn , Hannity , and all the rest of the usual suspects are even making the argument that simply investigating torture turns the US into a banana republic .
Naturally , no one states it better than Karl Rove , on Fox News last week :
" [ W ] hat the Obama administration has done in the last several days is very dangerous .
What they 've essentially said is , if we have policy disagreements with our predecessors , what we 're going to do is we 're going to turn ourselves into the moral equivalent of a Latin American country run by colonels in mirrored sunglasses , and what we 're gonna do is prosecute systematically the previous administration or threaten prosecutions against the previous administration based on policy differences . "
Torture is a policy , over which administrations can disagree , and the full implication of this argument is that they fully intend to use it again when and if they regain power .
Remember , Obama ended torture by executive order , just as he ended the restrictions on federal funding of stem cell research .
And that means torture can resume , by the simple means of another President revoking that order .
Torture now holds the same status as stem cell research , or federal hiring procedures , and they want to keep it that way .
But would they ?
Yes , they want to use it again , as can be plainly seen by the outrage following the release of memos describing the techniques .
Listen to Michael Mukasey , not by any means the most radical voice among the torture promoters .
" By allowing this disclosure , President Obama has tied not only his own hands but also the hands of any future administration faced with the prospect of attack .
Dick Cheney has said over and over again that he thinks waterboarding should be used again .
Believe him , he speaks for many still serving in the CIA .
The Wall Street Journal :
.. until now , the U.S. political system has avoided the spectacle of a new Administration prosecuting its predecessor for policy disagreements .
This ' politicizing policy differences ' is a direct challenge that forces the opponents of torture to prosecute , because if it stands , we will find torture in our future .
And there is one more thing that should absolutely chill your blood .
Michael Hayden , the former CIA director on Fox News :
At the tactical level , what we have described for our enemies in the midst of a war are the outer limits that any American would ever go to in terms of interrogating an al Qaeda terrorist .
That 's very valuable information .
Now , it does n't mean we would always go to the outer limits , but it describes the box within which Americans will not go beyond .
Read between the lines .
This is the argument that will justify even harsher methods of torture the next time people like him come to power .
Pulling out fingernails , genital shocks , whatever they can come up with , and they will BLAME IT ON LIBERALS ; ' They made us use these harsher methods by exposing the techniques we used to use ' .
They are digging in to preserve torture for when they return to power .
It must not happen .
Re : “ Cancer exams get political , ” April 18 :
The debate over virtual colonoscopy is emblematic of the dysfunctional way America makes healthcare decisions .
Whenever a new , expensive procedure comes out , the question seems to be framed , “ Should we pay for it ? ”
It is very hard for me to believe that when available knowledge is taken into account and special interest groups have less influence , this procedure could not be performed with as good or better results at a fraction of the current cost .
I suppose the same might also be true of traditional colonoscopies .

The question we should be asking is , “ How can these procedures be made more affordable so that those who will actually have better outcomes will be able to get them ? ”

You pinch to zoom the map , but the boss ' IM interrupts with a snarl about the afternoon meeting so now you 're pondering a new spin on " the dog ate my homework . "
Meanwhile your calendar is pleading about orphan dry cleaning .
And at this moment , that girl from last century pings :
She 's friend - ing you on Fbook , and " whatcha been up to and how come your profile says you 're single " when she thought you 'd hooked up semi-permanently with that photographer ?
Basically , you 've become The Borg .
And it 's only 2009 .
Cheer up .
It gets a whole lot deeper soon .
Everyone will know literally everything about you .
And resistance is worse than futile ; it will be cleansed .
Sometime this century — likely sooner than later — the trend lines of human vanity , self - indulgence , quest for personal perfection and general laziness will cross with those of computer processing power , machine dexterity , smart search , molecular manipulation and sensor acuity .
The inevitable result : human - robot convergence , the end of us as we knew us .
Say konnichiwa to your successor : Hubot Roboman .
The good news : you get infinite orgasms out of the deal .
Is this how Skynet will spawn the Terminators ?

This is the quest for the algorithm of soul .
Socially connected
When President Obama speaks of the Smart Grid , he means that we aspire to create an interactive network of power utilities that is cleverly managed through the flow of information about capacity , supply , demand and environmental impact .
It 's an essential undertaking , to be sure .
But the truly Intelligent Grid is already up and you 're using it now .
It 's the Telepresent Internet , where updated information on nearly everything is online everywhere all the time .
And , in fact , the shifting usage patterns for power that constitute demand on the energy grid will probably bubble up directly from this Telepresent Internet .
Telepresence means the ability to virtually be where you actually are n't .
You 've done it all your life , since that first time you got on the phone with grandma .
Now that connectivity has exploded and slipped its noose of copper cable , it freely prowls the wireless world .
So even as you read this , you are carrying on perhaps a dozen time - shifted interactions and conversations with others via e-mail ; you 're clicking links ; you 're searching names and terms .
You 're accessing the Wisdom Base of All Humanity without moving much more than your fingers .
To prosper in this culture of immersive , always - on telepresence , you — or your portable bandolier of technology — have got to be really good at selectively sucking and synthesizing a staggering amount of information .
Thus you upgrade your rig every couple of years .
You 're already paying per month to access that growing cloud of stuff you care about .
And you 've become a slave to charging batteries and synchronizing platforms .
You 're already adorned in wearable devices .
Next step for you : implanted ones .
Our very human need to " always be on top of things " powerfully pushes us in the direction of robotic enhancement .
It 's precisely what drove your grandparents to buy that first TV .
This would be a good time to watch a video about all this .
Then let 's talk about sex ...

Our robots : ourselves
We poke fun at Apple Computer co-founder Steve Wozniak on his Segway .
But we forget that inventor Dean Kamen 's team was originally on a quest to bring eye - level mobility and independent living to people who do not have use of their legs .
Thus , Segway 's DNA came from the successful IBOT .
Indeed , years before Segway , Kamen 's first invention , the AutoSyringe , robotically delivered a metered dose of insulin or other therapeutic medications into a patient 's IV drip .
As technologies gain finesse they enter the realm of biology .
The more helpful they become , the more insidious they must grow to be .
But whether a personal robotic innovation is considered an invasion , or an enhancement , is in the mind 's eye of the user .
Sex with robots
Yes .
Of course we will .
Some of us do now .
We call them vibrators .
One step up is the implanted spinal cord stimulator :
It 's been reported since 2004 that a device originally designed for chronic pain control and urinary issues can stimulate orgasm in women — even individuals who thought they 'd lost the ability to have them .
The appliance is no bigger than a pacemaker , can be wired into a woman 's lower back in a physician 's office under local anesthetic , is FDA approved ( for " bladder problems " ) , and can be run by remote control .
Ask your doctor .
Will you be prepared when she asks you to trigger this device over the Internet in a loving act of telepresent titillation ?
What happens when this " Orgasmatron " is triggered by intelligent software , in tandem with some fairly straightforward force - feedback actuators , and both are driven by , similarly simple , biometric sensors under some rather rudimentary fuzzy logic ?
Answer : the romantic robotic partner .
It 's not much further along the technology curve to build this package into interactive machinery with humanoid appearance and , well , " feel . "
Or non-humanoid , if she 's feeling adventurous .
The algorithm of soul
What will be your role ?
Of what use are you ?
Is there something qualitatively different about our human capacity to be soulful ?
Something about it we can't pass on to the robots ?
The philosophers ; answer : " of course ! "
But the engineers tend to think otherwise .
As these systems learn more about us , we need not burn up so much creativity on fantasizing sexual love — or on conjuring romantic love — because more and more of our sensory perception field will become " filled - up " with inputs from the robot .
Will this simulated sex get so good as to convince us that it 's the real thing ?
How will we know if it is n't ?
At that point , the bedrock notion of sexually bonding with your life - partner goes totally out the hatch .
It may linger as vestigial dogma for a generation or two , but it will no longer have any survival value .
The good news is that you can say so - long to the worship of a large class of largely useless celebrities : Stardom coupled to sexual desirability — or the inferred aptitude of that star as a great lover , no matter the severity of their psychoses — will cease to work .
Now let 's say you have chosen to become enhanced by implant of one or more of these devices — either to give or receive pleasure .
You are now a sexy cyborg .
Is this ethically any different from the erection pill or the arousal cream you use now ?
How would you counsel your children ?
Will you enhance them at some age you consider appropriate ?
Fortunately for this author , I 'll be able to beg off gracefully from these issues by citing old age .
But I may not get away with it .
The too - easy life ?
Why do n't we see intelligent extraterrestrials , when the galaxy should be chock full of them ?
Hubot Roboman tells us the answer : Every technological civilization gets to this point .
If you have virtually limitless entertainment everywhere you are , why would you ever go anywhere at all ?
Any parent whose child plays a game involving a screen and a microprocessor knows this devil all too well .
So the number of intelligent species who can kick their addiction to The Too - Easy Life is obviously vanishingly small .
Or , perhaps , the number is very large but they wish each new emerging one ( us ) to pass the test on their own before they will reveal their presence .
If so , then they are already here : the robotic " mind- children " of formerly biological beings .
They likely sit just out of site — as a telepresent network of individually very small kernels of machine intelligence .
So the root question becomes :
Will we be able to impart ambition and curiosity into Hubot Roboman ?
You know , that restless " mojo " that propelled waves of us out of northern Africa and into the unknown .
If Ray Kurzweil , Hans Moravec , Bill Joy and others are correct that machine intelligence is inevitable with sufficient computational power , we stand at the edge of a quest as amazing as our ancestors ' emergence from the water .
But if there 's something missing in the translation , then we have a very narrow time window — a generation or two at most — in which to do brave things :
Get off the planet ; figure out dark energy , write really good music …
So much on the to - do list for the future is in deep jeopardy if we can't locate the algorithm of soul .
Robot Madness Episode 8 : Stepping Out of Sci-Fi
Probably no substantial dimension of film history has been so thoroughly ignored by American film critics , historians , and theorists as the nature film ( or “ wildlife film ” ) : those works of cinema that purport to reveal the lives of other species .
This lack of scholarly attention seems to have resulted from the mistaken assumption that nature filmmakers do not reveal any philosophical or cinematic vision in their work , that nature films merely present facts .
In recent years , a few books have begun to correct this misconception , including Gregg Mitman ’s Reel Nature : America ’s Romance with Wild­life on Film , Derek Bousé ’s Wildlife Films , Cynthia Chris ’s Watching Wildlife , and Science Is Fiction : The Films of Jean Painlevé , edited by Andy Masaki Bellows and Marina McDougall , with Birgitte Berg .
But these are the exceptions that prove the rule , and we have a long way to go before the accomplishments of this aspect of cinema history are appreciated and understood .
In coming to terms with the immense world of nature cinema , a very good place to begin , as Science Is Fiction makes clear , is with French scientist - educator - filmmaker Jean Painlevé , whose groundbreaking work consistently revealed not only a commitment to informed science and effective communication but to the creative expression of ideas as well .
Born in 1902 to the prominent mathematician and statesman Paul Painlevé and Marguerite Petit de Villeneuve , who died in childbirth , young Painlevé was brought up by his paternal aunt and followed a normal , if rather precocious , path to a scientific career .
In 1923 , he and Dr. Maurice Parat coauthored a paper on chironomid larvae , and Painlevé became one of the youngest researchers ever to deliver a paper to the Académie des sciences .
In 1924 , he graduated from the Sorbonne with a degree in physics , chemistry , and biology , and quickly began to forge what would become a unique , six - decade - long career , during which he continuously sought to demonstrate the value of cinema for science .
This was a highly controversial idea among certain French scientists in 1928 , when Painlevé screened The Stickleback ’s Egg : From Fertilization to Hatching ( 1925 ) at the Académie des sciences .
Some in the audience were outraged — cinema , they said , was not to be taken seriously !— but Painlevé persisted and became a pioneer in both science and filmmaking .
While he was committed to his academic work , Painlevé ’s influences ranged far beyond the classroom and the laboratory .
When he felt ostracized by his politically conservative fellow students at the special schools he attended , he regularly escaped to the Left Bank ’s Saint - Michel theater , where he enjoyed the films of Mack Sennett , Georges Méliès , and Émile Cohl , and to the Jardin des Plantes , where he helped the keeper look after animals .
During the 1920s , he became involved with Dadaist and surrealist art and with the avant - garde film scene that was thriving in Paris .
When Man Ray needed starfish footage for his L’étoile de mer ( 1928 ) , Painlevé provided it .
In 1924 , he collaborated with Guillaume Apollinaire and others on the inaugural ( and final ! ) issue of Surréalisme , to which he contributed “ Neozoological Drama , ” a satiric scientific description of an interaction between sea organisms that reads like a surreal melodrama .
And the wacky funeral in Painlevé ’s Methuselah ( 1927 ) is led by a bishop played by Antonin Artaud ; the funeral itself is reminiscent of René Clair ’s Entr’acte ( 1924 ) .
Painlevé ’s interest in the aesthetic aggressiveness of Dadaism and surrealism continued long after his reputation as a nature filmmaker had been established and found vent not only in his nature films but in the remarkable narration he wrote for Georges Franju ’s Blood of the Beasts ( 1949 ) .
Throughout his adult life , Painlevé championed the work of other filmmakers .
During a visit to Amsterdam , he and documentarian Joris Ivens announced a screening of Sergei Eisenstein ’s Battleship Potemkin ( 1925 ) , illegal to show at the time .
When police arrived to stop the event , Painlevé and Ivens moved the screening — and continued to move it ( six times ) until the film had been shown in its entirety .
Painlevé also arranged for Eisenstein to sneak into Switzerland in a laundry van .
The Russian would later say of him : “ You alone stand as a competitor to Our Lady of Lourdes , as far as miracles are concerned . ”
The Painlevé films exemplify nature cinema at its best : producing them required both an intense engagement with the biology of particular species and the development of technological means for effectively recording and communicating information about those species .
By the early 1930s , Painlevé had developed a method for filming the aquatic life forms that fascinated him , and was making both research films and films aimed at general audiences .
The large body of research works , directed and / or produced from 1925 until the mid-1970s , is represented in this collection by The Stickleback ’s Egg and Experimental Treatment of a Hemorrhage in a Dog ( 1930 ) .
The other films on these DVDs reveal the breadth of his popular works , and the continuities among them , though Painlevé ’s reputation seems sure to rest on his remarkable investigations of sea creatures .
These are so inventive that they continue to attract general audiences , including the popular music group Yo La Tengo , which regularly performs with the films .
Painlevé ’s commitment to using film in the interests of science also produced many essays on the practice and theory of filmmaking , including his “ Ten Commandments ” for filmmakers .
His second commandment is “ You will refuse to direct a film if your convictions are not expressed . ”
One might wonder how scientifically informed nature films can be said to express convictions , but it is precisely Painlevé ’s implicit ( and sometimes explicit ) reasons for selecting the organisms he does and his manner of presenting them that reveal his attitudes .
Each Painlevé nature film tends to focus on a single organism , presenting , clearly and concisely , the crucial moments in its life cycle .
In general , Painlevé ’s commitment is to reveal the wonder and the beauty of organisms that some would consider beneath our notice ( the sea urchin , for instance , or the Acera , a tiny mollusk ) .
And he is particularly drawn to organisms , and aspects of organisms , that some would find disgusting : the South American vampire bat in The Vampire ( 1945 ) , for example , and the octopus — “ cephalopod , horrifying animal ” — in The Love Life of the Octopus ( 1967 ) , a project that took ten years to complete .
Painlevé ’s choices often seem , at least in part , a function of the ways in which particular organisms offer a challenge to conventional societal assumptions and values .
For example , in an unpublished conversation with Birgitte Berg , Painlevé makes clear that one of the reasons for his early choice of the sea horse as subject was the way the male and female collaborate on child birthing : the abdomen of the male sea horse has a pouch into which the female lays her eggs ; once the eggs are fertilized , the male nourishes them and , in time , gives birth to the baby sea horses in a manner reminiscent of female human labor .
As Painlevé explains to Berg : “ The sea horse was for me a splendid way of promoting the kindness and virtue of the father , while at the same time underlining the necessity of the mother .
In other words , I wanted to reestablish the balance between male and female . ”
Rather than use the sea horses to confirm conventional middle - class family patterns , the way the Disney True Life Adventures series tends to do , Painlevé uses his cinematic investigation of sea horses to do what he sees as progressive gender politics .
He wants us to learn not only about but from this strange fish .
This interest in confronting conventional gender assumptions is evident in several of his works .
Daphnia ( 1928 ) focuses on tiny female organ­isms that reproduce themselves without fertilization ; Sea Ballerinas ( 1956 ) examines starfish , some species of which are simultaneously male and female ; How Some Jellyfish Are Born ( 1960 ) focuses on colonies of jellyfish that are either male or female and , in both cases , fertilize themselves .
And Acera , or The Witches ’ Dance ( 1972 ) , among Painlevé ’s most remarkable films , seems to have two motivations .
Of obvious interest is the Acera ’s way of finding a mate .
As suggested in the film ’s title , Acera do a kind of ballet during which the cloaks that encircle their bodies fly open , evoking tutus .
A substantial portion of the film is devoted to shots of this dance , which is fascinating and lovely — and reminiscent of moments from Oskar Fischinger films and from Disney ’s Fantasia .
But once the Acera have found mates , we learn that each is bisexual and can function sexually as either male or female , or , as is demonstrated in the film , simultaneously as male and female .
In one instance , Painlevé reveals a chain of five Acera : each of the three middle partners in the sexual act is fertilizing the eggs of one Acera and , at the same time , having its own eggs fertilized by another .
One can only imagine the repercussions if this lovely film were shown in high school biology classes in the United States today !
The Vampire , probably the best - known Painlevé film , expresses a more clearly political sentiment .
During the late 1930s , Painlevé helped immigrants on the run from Nazism obtain work visas and French citizenship .
Persona non grata during the occupation , Painlevé spent years in hiding , escaping to Spain underwater , using scuba - diving gear he had invented , and making clandestine visits to France .
Just before the war , Painlevé had seen , for the first time , the Brazilian vampire bat ( Desmodus rotundus ) , and had begun work on a film that was among the first he finished after the war .
His interest in the vampire bat , a “ brown pest ” that could be a scourge to its animal and human neighbors , seems to have been closely related to his hatred of the Nazis — an unusual example of Painlevé ’s not seeking to champion the wonder and beauty of a despised creature .
Near the end of The Vampire , soon after we ’ve seen how the bats can transmit disease , Painlevé reveals “ the salute of the vampire . ”
Later he would tell Berg : “ When I was finishing the film , I noticed how the vampire bat extends its wing before going to sleep .
I thought it looked like the Nazi ‘ Heil Hitler ’ salute . ”
It was the particular advantages of cinema that , to a large extent , attracted Painlevé to this means of scientific expression .
He was consistently enthusiastic about cinema ’s ability to transform microscopy from a solitary undertaking to an experience an audience could share .
In the early films Daphnia and Sea Urchins ( 1928 ) , he indicates that some of what we see is magnified many thousands of times .
In a later film about sea urchins , also called Sea Urchins ( 1954 ) , Painlevé ’s magnification transforms tiny spines into stately “ temple columns . ”
Painlevé also makes frequent use of film ’s ability to condense and expand duration .
In The Love Life of the Octopus , for example , we can see the development of an octopus egg through stages of torsion , then rotation , as a result of the camera ’s ability to accelerate motion by fourteen hundred times ; and in How Some Jellyfish Are Born , an acceleration of up to a thousand times allows us to witness occurrences that would otherwise remain invisible .
On the other hand , it was “ thanks to slow motion ” and to cinema ’s ability to show imagery in forward and reverse that Painlevé could produce his homage to Étienne - Jules Marey , “ the creator of scientific films , ” in Pigeons in the Square ( 1982 ) .
So long as the requirements of good science were met , Painlevé felt quite free to work with sound and image in imaginative ways .
His use of Duke Ellington ’s “ Black and Tan Fantasy ” and “ Echoes of the Jungle ” in The Vampire and a range of jazz in Freshwater Assassins ( 1947 ) gives these strange , often creepy films a humorously macabre ambiance .
In other instances , classical music helps to demonstrate the elegance of particular creatures .
In Hyas and Stenorhynchus ( 1927 ) , Maurice Jaubert orchestrates Chopin to reveal the grace of the Hyas as compared with the clumsy Stenorhynchus ; in Caprella and Pantopoda ( 1930 ) , Jaubert orchestrates Scarlatti to accompany a danse macabre by a group of spider crabs ; and in the 1954 Sea Urchins , Painlevé employs “ organized noise ” — a group of young people playing pots and pans — “ as a tribute to my friend Edgar Varèse . ”
The narrations of the Painlevé films are usually evocative , and often amusing .
When asked how he achieved the strange , breathy narration for The Love Life of the Octopus , Painlevé explained that the narrator “ was an old man who , out of vanity , refused to wear glasses .
He was therefore obliged to stick his face right up against the script , close to the microphone , and one could hear his emphysema ” — perfectly appropriate for this particular film .
Painlevé often attempted to make science entertaining by including imagery that went beyond a rigid scientific focus .
Near the conclusion of The Sea Horse ( 1933 ) , as we watch several sea horses move , Painlevé puns on “ horses ” by inserting a shot of a horse race .
The Vampire begins with a general introduction to the history of vampires in Western culture , including an image of Nosferatu from the 1922 Murnau film .
And in both Hyas and Stenorhynchus and Acera , or The Witches ’ Dance , Painlevé includes references to the famous French dancer Loïe Fuller : the former includes what Painlevé calls “ a Loïe Fuller ballet , ” and in the latter , a long passage of the creatures dancing includes an insert of dancer Michèle Nadal imitating Fuller — a way not only of emphasizing the beauty of the Acera ’s movements but of reminding us that animals dance for much the same reason we do : to communicate with potential mates .
While most of the films Painlevé made for general audiences focus on particular species , his interests and approaches varied widely .
During the 1930s , he took time out from his nature filmmaking to produce Bluebeard ( 1938 ) , an amusing and colorful thirteen - minute animated epic .
And throughout his career , he produced and / or directed films on other aspects of science : Voyage to the Sky ( 1937 ) , for example , explains how astronomers measure distances between our planet and other celestial bodies ; and The Fourth Dimension ( 1936 ) offers a way of thinking beyond conventional spatial categories .
In 1978 , Painlevé documented how changes in pressure and temperature affect the appearance of liquid crystals , and used his studies to produce both a research film on the topic and Liquid Crystals , a lovely , nearly abstract general - audience film , reminiscent of Fischinger , the Whitney brothers , Harry Smith , Jordan Belson , and the history of “ spiritual animation . ”
Painlevé continued to explore new cinematic challenges until the final decade of his life , directing Pigeons in the Square in 1982 , in an attempt , as he indicates in the film , “ to interest young people in the behavior of a familiar animal and teach them to develop a method of observation based on knowledge and its expression . ”
Painlevé died in 1989 , at the age of eighty - six , having produced more than two hundred films , countless photographs , and a considerable body of writing .
Throughout his remarkable career , Painlevé ’s primary commitment was to support the creation of first - rate nature films and the development of popular audiences for these and other forms of cinema that might function to inform and energize the public .
Soon after World War II , Painlevé became president of the French Federation of Ciné - Clubs , and he continued to promote the use of cinema as a way of popularizing science through his work with the Institute of Scientific Cinema , which he had founded in 1930 , and by helping to establish the International Association of Science Films , which held conferences where science films from around the world were screened .
He was also one of the first nature filmmakers to work with television , and in time would experiment with new video techniques .
While for Disney the nature film was one small part in the construction of an empire , for Painlevé filmmaking was an intensely personal and life - defining means of democratizing scientific research and sharing information and ideas about our remarkably complex , sometimes terrifying , but always wondrous planet .

THE
Thai new year dawned on Monday April 13th not with water fights but with live rounds and tear gas as the army moved against red-shirted protesters who last week had seized control of much of the government district of Bangkok , laying siege to Government House , the prime minister 's seat .
The army had cleared at least two big junctions held by the red shirts , including the Victory monument .
The army opened fire , though for the most part soldiers appeared to be aiming over the heads of the protesters , who attacked with Molotov cocktails launched from slingshots .
Dozens of protesters and a handful of soldiers have been injured .
In one ugly development in Phetchaburi , a Muslim neighbourhood , red shirts shot at the mosque and threw petrol bombs along a narrow shopping street .
In response what seemed to be the whole community , including old women , rushed out with swords and sticks to fight the attackers .
This may mark the definitive start to an operation to clear away tens of thousands of protesters which the prime minister , Abhisit Vejjajiva , ordered when he declared a state of emergency on Sunday .
By breakfast time protesters had blocked another crossing with commandeered buses and burning tires .
More Molotov cocktails were lobbed at soldiers , who loaded their automatic rifles and began to advance .
But then two of the red shirts asked to talk .
The army officer in charge stepped forward .
The conversation ended with an exchange of mobile - phone numbers , handshakes all round and an agreement for both sides to move back .
“ This situation hurts me here , ” said the officer later hitting his heart .
“ I wo n't order the troops to shoot .
We do n't want Thais to fight Thais .
How this ends is not up to us , it 's up to Thaksin . ”
Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted as prime minister in a military coup in 2006 , and then fled the country .
Thai politics has been dominated by a tussle between his supporters and enemies ever since .
From exile in Dubai he directs his red-shirted followers , known as the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship ( UDD ) .
In a phone message broadcast on Sunday night to the protesters camped around the government complex , Mr Thaksin declared : “ Now that the military has brought tanks out on the streets , it 's time for the people to come out for a revolution . ”
He has promised to return and lead it .
Mr Thaksin has thus hugely raised the stakes .
He senses that the failure of the police and army to deal with the protests is a sign of ambivalence .
Policemen and soldiers are drawn from the same ranks of the great unwashed , country folk and the urban poor , who make up so many of the red shirts ' numbers .
Mr Thaksin 's populist policies in office benefited the poor , many of whom now feel that the moneyed Bangkok elite behind Mr Abhisit have cheated the country of democracy .
They demand the prime minister 's resignation .
The ambivalence was made abundantly clear on Saturday in Pattaya , where Mr Abhisit was hosting a summit of 16 Asian leaders that had already once been postponed because of Thailand 's political turmoil .
Although the protesters there were few , they broke through half - hearted lines of police and army with ease .
As they tore through the summit venue , the leaders were lifted from a hotel roof by helicopter and sent scurrying home , the summit cancelled .
It is a huge loss of face for Mr Abhisit .
The prime minister , a 44 - year - old educated at Oxford , is decent enough as opportunists go , but appears out of his depth in Thailand 's cruel and intricate politics .
He may regret not having moved earlier against the Thaksin forces .
He came to office last December on the back of a movement of popular protests .
The yellow shirts , the People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) , are a loose grouping of businessmen , urban middle class and ultra-royalists ( yellow is the royal colour ) .
PAD protests contributed to Mr Thaksin 's ouster in 2006 .
Last year fresh yellow - shirt protests helped to bring down the successor to Mr Thaksin 's banned Thai Rak Thai party .
In a fine irony , the red shirts have now borrowed many of the PAD 's tactics .
As well as exacerbating class divisions in calling for revolution , Mr Thaksin is playing a more dangerous game over the rule of octogenarian King Bhumibol .
Although they are supposed to be strictly above politics , members of the royal family have for long left their paw marks on politics , and appear to be sympathetic to the yellow shirts .
Mr Thaksin has called for the resignation of two privy counsellors whom he says were behind the 2006 coup .
Since privy counsellors serve at the king 's pleasure , the call comes pretty close to lèse - majesté in a country with draconian treason laws .
On Saturday evening in the red - shirt encampment , one man loudly blamed the king for Thailand 's troubles , an act that would ordinarily mean a harsh term in jail .
Many
Thais are heartily sick of the crisis and its enormous damage to the economy in terms of lost investment and tourists .
Another military coup is rumoured , although it is unclear where the army 's political inclinations lie .
Presumably Mr Abhisit 's days are numbered as prime minister , though who might succeed him is anyone 's guess .
Mr Thaksin hopes to ride the protests and return to power .
Yet with plenty of scores to settle , his would presumably be a brittle and autocratic rule at a time when reconciliation is badly needed .
Fresh elections are probably the best bet , with the promise of a search for a broad political consensus for constitutional change to allow a more representative politics .
For now , with violence in the streets again , Thailand teeters on the brink .
This is the super - popular video of the song " I Want My Bailout Money " written and performed by Michael Adams , from his album " Beyond All Reason .
"
It takes aim at the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury for robbing the American people blind through runaway bailout money creation .
Here are the full lyrics : I want my bailout money Keep the bills comingSweet green cash just drippin like honey I'm a new kind of thug with a Washington buzz ' causeDealing debt pays better than dealing drugsWhat do you think will happen when they double the money supply ?
The falling dollar makes it harder for you to surviveThey take those billions and trillions and give it to their own kindHope you do n't mind bein robbed blindHow do you think we got runaway credit ?
Ain't nothin goin down unless the crooks in Washington let itNow they regret it but they still do n't get itCause the economy is crashin so bad it needs a paramedicI want my bailout money Sweet green cash just dripping with honey Gotta keep this economy runningI need another hit of my bailout moneyLook at the stash , it 's like a mad dash for the cash
They got the taxpayer takin it in the assthe CEOs they are havin a blastWhile the workin poor trying to make the paycheck last
The bailout money is created with new debtWhile they rollin in their limos and private jets
All the workers on the street drippin sweatWhile collar hustlers are takin everything they can get They put the nation on a hyperinflation trackNo Presidential administration can take it backAnd now the taxpayers pickin up the slackLike they put a high dollar Big Brother monkey on your backI want my bailout money Sweet green cash just dripping with honey Gotta keep this economy runningI need another hit of my bailout money
The prisons are filled with brothers caught on a fifty - dollar jack But when Whitey takin trillions , the cops they turn their back
The incompetent bankers , they get their jobs backCause those crankers smoking money like it was crack
They take your car , your home , everything that you own
And when you 're jobless and broke , you still gotta pay the loan
If you 're thinkin of stealin some food , please don ' tJust go to Washington and you can steal everything you wantHow we gonna solve this , dissolve the big scamWe resolve we wo n't let 'em steal from a fellow manRaise our hands and ask " What is this ?
" Then we put the Federal Reserve out of business !
You take a look at a dollar bill , you see that eye above the pyramid lookin back at you That eye is laughin at you suckers !
I want my bailout money Keep the con running Sweet green cash just dripping with honey Gotta keep this economy runningI need another hit of my bailout money Are n't you tired of payin for that ?
Tired of breakin your back for that ?
Bein oppressed and suppressed while you keep payin your tax for that ?
We gotta get out of this financial trapAnd it 's never gonna stop until you take your country back
The politicians are useless , do n't you know that they used usAnd the bankers refused us while the media schooled usThe authorities knew this was happening to usCause they make more money every time that they screw us You did n't think they 're printing all that funny money just for you , did ya ?
Drownin ' in debt but the Fed is n't done yet What are we gonna get ?
Gonna print funny moneyBudget 's in the red , economy nearly deadPolitician 's said that weGonna print funny moneyHangin ' by a thread , the people are bein ' bledBut get it through your head that weGonna print funny money
The bankers gotta stay ahead , gotta make more bread
That 's when they said , " Print more money !

The sat collision in February spawned thousands of pieces of debris ( red ) On 10 February this year , a defunct Russian communications satellite crashed into an American commercial spacecraft , generating thousands of pieces of orbiting debris .
At the time , some observers put the odds of such an event occurring at millions , maybe billions , to one .
But experts had been warning for years that useable space was becoming crowded , boosting the possibility of a serious collision .
They have argued both for better monitoring of the space environment and for policies aimed at controlling the production of debris .
European space officials have now initiated a project which has the ultimate aim of protecting Europe 's space - based assets against such threats .
Over the past two years , a number of incidents have drawn attention to the problem of space debris .
We really have to understand the environment in which our space infrastructure operates
Jean - Jacques Dordain , director - general , Esa In January 2007 , China tested an anti-satellite weapons system by destroying one of its own spacecraft .
According to the US military , the A - sat test created 2,500 new pieces of debris which have been jeopardising satellites in the vicinity ever since .
In February 2008 , the US used a sea- launched missile system to shoot down a wayward spy satellite loaded with fuel .
Then on 12 March this year , a close approach by a piece of debris measuring about 1 cm ( 0.3 in ) forced the crew of the International Space Station ( ISS ) to shelter in their Russian Soyuz escape capsule .
" It 's a bit like a swarm of bees in a beehive up there , " said Nasa spokesman William Jeffs at the time , " the trajectories can sometimes be erratic . "
Found wanting
There are thought to be some 18,000 objects larger than 10cm orbiting Earth , but millions more that are smaller .
Intact satellites share Earth 's orbit with everything from spent rocket stages , tools lost on spacewalks and spacecraft wreckage to paint flakes and dust .
They are the flotsam and jetsam of more than half a century of human activities in space .
The Russian sat involved in February 's collision looked something like this At orbital speeds of 27,000 km/h ( 17,000 mph ) , even tiny pieces of debris can knock out a satellite or kill a spacewalker .
And as the number of pieces of debris grows , so does the threat of collisions .
Satellite shielding is effective for objects below 1 cm .
But beyond that size collision avoidance - commanding the satellite to move out of the way of debris - may be the most prudent option .
America has the most sophisticated system for tracking objects in orbit .
Its military operates 25 centres around the world to track objects in space ; together they comprise the US Space Surveillance Network ( SSN ) .
Until now , Europe has been largely dependent on the US for knowing what is going on in space .
But European observers have for some time regarded this situation as inadequate .
Space - based systems , which provide accurate weather data , telecommunications and satellite - navigation services , play an increasingly vital role in Europe 's economy .
Referring to the threats facing these space - based assets , Jean - Jacques Dordain , director - general of the European Space Agency ( Esa ) says : " We cannot continue to develop operational space infrastructure and ignore these other elements . "
The US Haystack and HAX radars track cm-sized debris
He added : " We really have to understand the environment in which our space infrastructure operates . "
Thus , in November 2008 , space ministers approved a 49.5 - million - euro proposal to prepare the way for a European system which will stand watch over orbital debris , near - Earth objects ( NEOs ) and solar activity .
Together these phenomena could threaten lives and infrastructure in space and on the ground .
An advanced capability to monitor such threats is known as Space Situational Awareness , or SSA .
Officials will spend three years assessing what Europe needs to develop its capabilities in space situational awareness .
They will need to formulate a data security policy as well as consider what infrastructure has to be built from scratch and how existing sensors might contribute .
Radars are generally used to track objects in low - Earth orbit , while optical telescopes are often used to observe objects further away from the Earth .
Electronic eavesdropping can be used to assess whether or not satellites are active - a discipline known as signals intelligence , or SIGINT .
" In 2010 and 2011 , we will deploy and validate the preliminary elements of this system .
This will hopefully allow us to deliver some precursor services , " Nicolas Bobrinsky , proposal manager for Esa 's SSA Preparatory Programme , told BBC News .
" It is not our aim to have a fully operational system by 2011 , but one which will act as an ' advanced demonstrator ' . "
Gaele Winters , Esa 's director of operations and infrastructure , adds : " There are member states in Europe with their own facilities .
Esa also has some facilities .
If you combine [ those resources ] in an intelligent way , you can reach a point where it is possible to deliver precursor services . "
SPACE DEBRIS
Comprises manmade " orbital debris " and " incident debris " Incident debris includes particles from short - period comets About 18,000 orbital debris objects larger than 10 cm
The number between 1 cm and 10 cm in size estimated at 200,000 Number smaller than 1 cm exceeds tens of millions Chinese anti-satellite test in 2007 created 2,500 new fragments A domino effect could create havoc for future space launches
These existing facilities might include France 's GRAVES ( The French acronym means large - scale system adapted for space monitoring ) radar system , which can survey objects in low - Earth orbit up to distances of 2,000 km , the Zimmerwald optical telescope observatory in Switzerland , and the Esa Space Debris Telescope in Tenerife , Spain .
These preliminary services should provide users with access to a catalogue detailing the orbits of functioning spacecraft and debris .
They should also alert satellite operators to potential collisions between their spacecraft and other objects in orbit .
In the event that a possible collision is identified , users could request a more detailed analysis of the objects ' trajectories using a high power radar such as the Tracking and Imaging Radar ( TIRA ) in Wachtberg , Germany .
The fully fledged system is expected to provide many additional services .
Richard Tremayne - Smith , a former head of space environment at the British National Space Centre ( BNSC ) , told BBC News : " Space surveillance is one thing , but to get to space situational awareness you need more than either optical sensors for high altitudes and radar for low altitudes .
RAF Fylingdales in Yorkshire is part of the US surveillance network " You need details from satellite operators .
Otherwise , you can only guess when they might carry out station - keeping with a satellite , or when they might do an impulse burn to change the orbit it is in . "
Satellite operators overwhelmingly recognise the need for better data on the melee of objects whizzing over our heads .
The US already makes available data from its Space Surveillance Network on the internet .
But this US Air Force data , known as two - line elements , is of relatively low quality , with satellite positions only accurate to within 20 - 30 km ( distances which are covered in 3 - 4 seconds at typical low Earth orbit velocities of 7.5 km / s ) .
Additional uncertainties are introduced when satellite orbits are extrapolated days or weeks ahead .
This is because spacecraft are perturbed by drag , solar radiation pressure and the Earth 's gravity field .
The more inaccurate the initial data on a satellite 's position , the more inaccurate these predictions will be .
If you just leave things up there , the statistics show they will start banging into each other
Dr Stuart Eves , SSTL
In addition , for a satellite constellation in low - Earth orbit , two - line element data might throw up hundreds of potential collision alerts every day .
Many satellite operators simply lack the financial resources to perform detailed analyses on each potential collision .
The US Air Force maintains a second , more precise database of information on the same orbital objects .
But these more accurate data are deemed far too sensitive to share publicly - for fear the data could give away clues about the capabilities of US sensors .
However , keeping close tabs on all the junk up there is beyond even the resources of the US military .
High accuracy surveillance is reserved only for a handful of high - value assets such as the space shuttle , the space station and multi-billion - dollar spy satellites .
In March , the ISS crew had to move into the Russian Soyuz capsule
In the longer - term , computer modelling work has identified a worrying effect called a " collision cascade " , a kind of domino effect where collisions create more debris , which generates further collisions , creating even more debris .
" This is one of the reasons why the satellite operators and the community are quite deliberately trying to get their spacecraft down within 25 years from the end of the mission , " says Stuart Eves , head of business development for military systems at Surrey Satellite Technology Limited ( SSTL ) .
NEAR - EARTH OBJECTS ( NEOS ) NEOs are comets and asteroids which enter Earth 's neighbourhood About 1,050 NEOs are classed as potentially hazardous to Earth An estimated 81 % of NEOs bigger than 1 km are catalogued Nasa wants to log objects as small as 140 m ( 460 ft ) in diameter Tunguska object exploded with energy of 1,000 atomic bombs Asteroid Apophis has a 1 in 45,000 chance of striking Earth in 2036 " If you just leave things up there , the statistics show they will start banging into each other .
Eventually , you reach the point where you can't sensibly launch satellites into the orbits you want because they 'll get pounded to pieces . "
Esa might be able to rely on existing facilities for its precursor services , but some sensors are not capable of providing the very high accuracy data required for the fully fledged SSA system .
Beyond 2011 , officials acknowledge the need to build new state - of - the - art facilities to achieve high performance , including the ability to track objects down to 10 cm in size .
But for true space situational awareness , it will also be necessary to track objects more frequently .
This means monitoring the locations of satellites multiple times each day .
The Saphhire satellite system , which is being built by MDA for Canada 's Department of National Defence will carry an optical telescope for tracking satellites in high orbits , especially geosynchronous orbit ( GEO ) .
" The advantage of a space - based sensor is that it is above the clouds and is unaffected by the day / night cycle , so its tracking can be far more frequent , " says Stuart Eves , whose company SSTL is providing the Sapphire spacecraft bus and other elements for MDA .
The Teide Observatory on Tenerife may be part of a European system
The requirements decided under the European preparatory programme will be submitted for approval by space ministers when next they meet in 2011 .
Esa is looking at a ten - year timeline for development of the full system .
But how the system should be governed in future and by whom is still to be resolved .
Esa has been holding discussions with the European Union about its involvement - specifically whether the EU might assume a greater role in managing and funding SSA beyond 2011 .
Esa has also been talking to Nasa and the US Department of Defense ( DoD ) about the potential for making the European and American networks interoperable , or compatible .
" In short , we are trying to put together , with the Americans , requirements for the European system and future upgrades of the US system to have a better , more reliable source of information for all of us , " says Gaele Winters .
The European network must be able to function independently of that used by America , he says , adding : " There is a certain level of independence Europe wants to have in its ability to protect its own space assets .
But it also offers the opportunity to get more out of two systems . "
Good to talk Insiders say officials are determined to avoid a repeat of the dispute with America over Europe 's Galileo satellite navigation system , due to be operational by 2013 .
Fuelled by US concerns that the European network could be used by hostile nations in attacks on American targets , the row was only resolved after lengthy negotiations .
Sources say that , in principle at least , there is a willingness on both sides to work together on SSA , though some in Europe remain wary of US intentions .
There were tensions between the US and Europe over Galileo " Any endeavour by Europe to enhance space situational awareness will only increase our ability to conduct safe and responsible operations in space , " a DoD official told the magazine Space News earlier this year .
" The United States supports international cooperation in SSA . "
Britain , meanwhile , has joined the preparatory programme , contributing one million euros at the Esa ministerial meeting last November .
But participation presents particular questions for the UK because of its " special relationship " with America .
The UK already has some privileged access to American data and some national users might not want to see the status quo shaken up .
Nevertheless , some commentators recognise a need for Britain to have more control over the space surveillance data it gets .
A policy directing how the data will be used is also important for Europe 's system , given the sensitivities over sharing information from military sensors .
Richard Tremayne - Smith comments : " I personally believe one thing that would have to be done is to have data anonymity .
People will be quite glad to put things in as long as you can't trace things back and work out the power and capability of the sensor .
SPACE WEATHER
Many space weather phenomena relate to the activity of the Sun Solar storms may occur a few times a week or a few times a day Caused by bubbles of plasma erupting from Sun 's atmosphere Bubbles pack a punch equivalent to about 100 hurricanes
Also known as coronal mass ejections , or CMEs Affect functioning of technology in space and on the ground Solar activity monitored by Stereo and Soho satellites " If you want to get as many people as possible to provide data , you want to give them a warm feeling that it 's not going to be misused , or allowed to drift off to people who might use it for things they did n't want . "
One way to address the issue , he said , might be to place a software application between the sensitive data and end users .
Information provided by participating countries would be used to train this interface .
Users would then obtain the answers they require without ever seeing details of the satellite positions .
Space debris was once the principal concern of space surveillance , but a different threat comes from near - Earth objects - the primordial rocks left over from the formation of the Solar System .
It has been difficult to find funding for facilities directed exclusively towards Neo discovery .
But Mr Tremayne - Smith said existing ground and space telescopes used for astronomy or military activities are eminently suitable for logging asteroids and comets .
" The third big peak in discovery of near - Earth objects below the 1 km size was with the US GEODSS system used for looking at satellites .
The US military allowed those satellites to be used for NEO detection while they were n't being otherwise utilised , " he explains .
Space weather is the third component of Esa 's SSA programme .
The bulk of this discipline is concerned with solar activity .
Radiation from flares and coronal mass ejections ( CMEs ) on the Sun may launch X - rays and high energy particles towards Earth .
These phenomena can interfere with the operation of space systems , especially those beyond the protective screen of the Van Allen radiation belts surrounding Earth .
The UK MoD's Skynet 5C satellite carries sophisticated anti-jamming technology
But officials acknowledge the potential threat from deliberate attempts to interfere with satellites .
In September 2005 , a London - based radio station called Sowt al - Amel ( Voice of Hope ) , began beaming into Libya via satellite with the aim of promoting political reform in the North African country .
Within minutes of Sowt al - Amel 's first broadcast , a high - powered signal of garbled noise was unleashed on the satellite uplink , drowning out the dissident station .
But in jamming the signal , several other broadcasters , among them CNN and BBC World , were also blocked out .
The US carried out on - orbit inspection of a missile warning satellite Esa is a civilian agency and is not mandated to deal with security matters .
But Gaele Winters explains : " If you develop the system , it could contain additional capabilities .
He adds : " The first priority is to build ground - based infrastructure .
But it is not to be excluded that later in the programme , space - based monitoring could take place .
" If there is a problem with our satellite , we would like to have the ability to analyse precisely what is wrong with it .
One way of doing that is from the ground using telescopes .
Another is to have a satellite in orbit which could approach the damaged satellite and carry out a close inspection to see what is happening . "
In January , it was reported that the US DoD had commanded two covert inspection satellites to examine a failed US Air Force missile warning satellite in geosynchronous orbit .
Mr Winters says several organisations , including the European Defence Agency , are studying the SSA proposals and may come up with security - related requirements to be added to those being compiled by Esa .
Small satellites could be deployed to " look after " other spacecraft
Military satellites ' may get stealthy '
He comments : " It could well be that in the future , the European Union will take a bigger role in managing and funding the development of this system because of these aspects that are outside the scope of Esa , but are inside the mandate of the EU . "
Space situational awareness is also regarded as an important step towards the holy grail of space traffic management .
A system analogous to that which currently governs the movements of aircraft is still some way off .
But Richard Tremayne - Smith thinks Europe should consider this objective in the design of its SSA programme .
He explains : " This is just a personal view , but if Europe does something , it should have a very ambitious target in the longer term that leapfrogs other capabilities and goes to what is really needed to do the job , rather than just getting to the current state of the art . "

Gemma Atkinson surely have a problem with her b00bs .
It seems too much big for her and there ’s no outfit can hold that thing .
Check out this picture when her b00bs almost spill out because her outfit is too small .
Atkinson rose to fame playing Lisa Hunter on the Channel 4 teenage soap opera Hollyoaks .
Atkinson and Marcus Patric ( who played the character Ben Davies ) subsequently appeared in a " spin-off " series called Hollyoaks : Let Loose for E4 , in which their characters started a new life together in Chester .
This was followed by Hollyoaks :
In the City also screened on the E4 network .
TAMPA , Florida ( CNN ) --
There 's probably no way to describe the feeling .
Joe Pirrone 's pride and joy , his F350 Super Duty turbo diesel truck , turned out to be a stolen " clone . "
One moment , Guiseppe " Joe " Pirrone was on a long weekend at the beach .
The next moment , he found out the pickup that he bought a year ago is stolen , and he is still on the hook for the $ 27,000 loan .
Stories like Pirrone 's are scattered across the country , and Tuesday the FBI announced that it has broken up one of the largest auto theft cases in the U.S .
Capping " Operation Dual Identity , " arrest warrants for 17 people were executed in Tampa and Miami , Florida ; Chicago , Illinois ; and in Mexico City and Guadalajara , Mexico .
The suspects were accused of " cloning " vehicles , which is making stolen cars look like legal ones .
The FBI says that the ring was operating in the U.S. for more than 20 years .
More than 1,000 vehicles were stolen in Florida , with more than $ 25 million in losses to consumers and banks .
" Individuals have been victimized at every level , from the average Joe , to the banks , to big companies , " said Dave Couvertier , of the FBI 's Tampa field office .
Car theft rings clone vehicles by taking license plates , vehicle identification numbers ( VIN ) , and other tags and stickers from a legal car and putting them on a stolen vehicle of similar make and model .
" This does not just affect big business .
Anyone could become an unwitting victim of this particular scam .
It could happen to anyone , " said Couvertier .
Pirrone knows how it was done because it happened to him .
Last year , he bought a used 2005 F350 Super Duty turbo diesel pickup to use for his landscape business in Fort Myers , Florida .
He bought it off a small used car lot and took out a $ 27,000 loan from a credit union .
" I had it for about nine months .
It was a great truck , " he told CNN .
In the fall , Pirrone decided to drive across the state to spend a long weekend in Fort Lauderdale .
He was lying on the beach when his father called him to tell him that a detective from the Lee County Sheriff 's Office was at his house with a tow truck .
Pirrone got back in his car and drove back home immediately .
" I was confused , honestly , " he said .
" I had to ask the detective for credentials .
I did n't believe what was going on . "
Pirrone said the detective explained to him that he was the victim of a scam , that he was sold stolen goods .
Left without a truck , Pirrone called the Suncoast Schools Federal Credit Union .
He found that his $ 536 a month payment would live on after his truck was long gone .
Pirrone said he was able to get a 30 - day payment exemption , but was told that he had a signed agreement with the bank , and he was still obligated to pay the loan in full .
" I am making payments on a piece of property that I do n't have , " Pirrone said .
" They can't even repossess it .
The bank does n't have any help to offer me . "
The bank is a victim in the car cloning scam as well .
Lisa Brock , a spokeswoman for Suncoast Schools Federal Credit Union , told CNN that the company never discusses private information about any of its members .
" It is a police matter , and it 's nothing we can make any substantial comment on , " she said .
Pirrone has hired an attorney , and he is considering filing a lawsuit against the dealership to get the bank 's money back .
Pirrone said he was advised by his lawyer not to name the used car lot .
Law enforcement hopes that this is the beginning of the end of the " car cloning " scam .
The National Motor Vehicle Information system ( NMVTIS ) database was implemented in January .
It allows state DMVs to share title and registration information .
Cloned vehicles were moved and sold to buyers in 20 states and several countries , often for less than market value , the FBI said .
Many of the vehicles were exchanged for drugs , according to the bureau .
The FBI says that people need to be careful when buying a car independently .
" Folks should be educated enough so that they do n't buy a car from a stranger , on the street , or in a back alley somewhere , " said the FBI 's Dave Couvertier .
" And if you 're getting it for too good a deal , it should be raising flags . "
Like so many others , Pirrone is feeling the economic squeeze .
Without a truck , he had to sell his landscaping business , which he had as a side business .
He is still working his other job as a restaurant manager .
" It 's not a good time for this to happen .
I 've had hours cut back at work , I 'm not making what I used to make . "
" I do n't know what 's real anymore , " he said .

State officials investigating whether 7 - year - old suicide victim was given mind - altering drug
By Jon Burstein
April 24 , 2009
MARGATE – State officials are investigating whether a 7 - year - old boy who hanged himself in his Margate foster home had been given a powerful , mind - altering drug in violation of Florida law .
Three weeks before his April 16 suicide , Gabriel Myers was prescribed the drug Symbyax , which is a combination of the generic forms of the anti-depressant Prozac and the anti-psychosis drug Zyprexa , according to state Department of Children & Families records released Friday night .
But there was no court order in place for Gabriel to use the drug , the records show .
Under Florida law , parental consent or a judge ’s ruling is needed before a foster child can be administered a psychotropic drug .
It ’s unclear whether Gabriel was taking Symbyax .
Margate police have his medication logs as they investigate his death , according to DCF spokeswoman Leslie Mann .
Mann said the agency is examining why a court order was not obtained to put Gabriel on the drug .
“ We are not sure at this time if the medication played a role in Gabriel ’s death , but the department will seek a professional medical review of the treatment and prescription medication in Gabriel ’s case , ” she said .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Prozac for use in children , but not Symbyax and Zyprexa .
Even so , doctors have the right to prescribe any drug for any patient they think it will help .
Symbyax , like all anti-depressants , carries a “ black box ” warning – the strongest the FDA can issue – because anti-depressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts in minors .
Studies have not linked the drugs to an increase in suicides .
The FDA first issued the warning about Paxil in 2003 , then extended it to all anti-depressants the next year .
In addition to Symbyax , Gabriel also was on Vyvanse , an attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder drug , records show .
At the time of his death , Gabriel was home alone with the 19 - year - old son of his foster father .
Gabriel got upset with the young man during lunch , locking himself in the bathroom and saying he was going to kill himself .
The young man used a screwdriver to pick the lock and found Gabriel hanging from a shower hose , according to DCF records .
Gabriel was pronounced dead one hour later at Northwest Medical Center in Margate .
DCF is also investigating why Gabriel was being watched by the 19 - year - old .
“ The bottom line is that ( the 19 - year - old ) should not have been left alone with Gabriel , if in fact he was , ” Mann said .
DCF began releasing more than 1,000 pages of Gabriel ’s child welfare records about 7:30 p.m.
Friday , detailing a tragic life in which he was both a victim and an apparent danger to other children .
A month before his death , Gabriel told a therapist he was “ a bad person , ” the records state .
“ ( Gabriel ) said , ‘ I lied when I was 1 years old , then I lied when I was 2 years old .
I was born a liar and I will always be lying , ’ ” according to the therapist ’s report .
DCF first learned of Gabriel in June after his mother was found passed out in a parked car in Hallandale Beach and he was in the back seat .
The boy had come from Ohio–where authorities were looking into allegations that he had been sexually abused by an older boy , according to DCF records .
While in Florida , he bounced between his uncle ’s home and two foster homes .
He lived in one foster home from October until March , when fears arose that he might hurt a toddler in the house , according to DCF records .
He was then moved to the Margate foster home , where he lived for the three weeks leading up to his death .
NABI ELYAS , West Bank , April 26 ( Reuters ) - Linoy , a five - year - old Israeli girl , happily nibbled some chocolate as she accompanied her parents on a shopping spree on a busy street with storefront signs written in Hebrew .
Nabi Elyas , a Palestinian village in the occupied West Bank catering to the Israeli consumer , has raised hopes on both sides of a divide that peaceful co-existence is possible .
Just a short drive from central Israel , the community of 1,500 residents is profiting from an influx of Jewish shoppers drawn by cheap prices and still kept out of the main Palestinian cities by Israeli security regulations .
" Here I even feel safer than I do shopping in Tel Aviv , " said Hanan Troitsa , Linoy 's father .
" We come here two to three times a week , " added the girl 's mother .
Groceries , furniture and even dental treatment are on offer in Nabi Elyas , which is packed with cars from Israel , especially during weekends .
It 's not a two - way street : villagers , like most other Palestinians , cannot get Israeli permits to visit Israel .
Security concerns during a Palestinian uprising that began in 2000 kept Israeli shoppers away for years and optimism about the chances for peace has long been in short supply .
But with attacks by militants on Israelis now rare in the West Bank , consumers are venturing back to an area once known as a bargain - hunter 's paradise .
" This shows that we can live together .
For those who do not believe it they should come here and see , " said Jalal Khleif , the mayor of Nabi Elyas .
Israeli shopper David Dahan , from the Israeli town of Givat Shmuel near Tel Aviv , said Israeli and Palestinian leaders should follow the model of Nabi Elyas .
" We , the Palestinians and the Israelis can deal with each other in a friendly way .
I personally have many friends here .
If the politicians leave us alone we can run our affairs , " said the 70 - year - old pensioner .
Although business may be booming in Nabi Elyas , a new right - leaning government in Israel espousing an " economic peace " rather than territorial compromise have raised Palestinian fears their dreams of a state could be shattered .
Israelis point to the Gaza Strip , controlled by Hamas Islamists , and what many see as a weak pro-Western Palestinian government in the West Bank , as barriers to a peace deal .
Slicing mutton for Israeli customers , Omar Ali , a butcher in the village , is counting at least a partial peace dividend .
He said his sales triple during weekends and Jewish holidays .
" There is good income when they come here , " he said .

Steve Benen does a great job smacking down the latest secessionist nonsense coming out of Texas Governor Rick Perry .
There ’s Perry ’s rhetoric …
“ I believe the federal government has become oppressive .
It ’s become oppressive in its size , its intrusion in the lives of its citizens , and its interference with the affairs of our state . [… ]
“ We think it ’s time to draw the line in the sand and tell Washington that no longer are we going to accept their oppressive hand in the state of Texas .
That ’s what this press conference , that ’s what these Texans are standing up for .
There is a point in time where you stand up and say enough is enough , and I think Americans , and Texans especially have reached that point . ”
… and there ’s Perry ’s reality .
I think Benen misses the larger point :
Why ca n’t we just let Texas and the whole godforsaken South secede and get all this recurring idiotic bullshit over and done with once and for all ?
I am so sick and tired of being treated to their once - per - decade explosions of rightwing victimology and paranoia .
Let the ignorant antebellums and appalachians form their own third - world failed state named Jesusland on our borders …
In the final analysis , I think everyone would be better off .
Update : Glenn
Beck thinks secession is a super idea :
“ Does the state have any right anymore ?
And I know , because I ’ve heard it from all of the conservative , uh , you know , uh , the historians and scholars and everything else , but you ca n’t convince me that the founding fathers would n’t allow you to secede .
The Constitution is not a suicide pact .
And if a state says , ‘ I do n’t want to go there because that ’s suicide , ’ they have a right to back out .
They have a right .
People have a right to not commit economic suicide .
“ I believe it was Davy Crockett , that as he was standing there in the well of the Senate and they were all yelling and screaming at him , he said — he looked them right square in the eye and said , ‘ Hey , you know what ?
You can all go to hell .
I ’m going to Texas . ’
About time somebody says that again .
“ You ’re telling me that states ca n’t say ‘ Washington , we ’re not going to commit suicide with you ' ” ?
This brings up a good point — by forming Jesusland , we will be able to deport loony fuckers like Beck and Michelle Malkin there .
Update 2 : Here ’s Michael Tomasky ’s three cents :
RAMADI , Iraq ( Reuters ) - A senior leader in a Sunni Arab movement founded to combat al Qaeda in Iraq is edging away from the military activity of the past , toward a once unthinkable alliance with the country ’s Shi’ite prime minister .
Sheikh Ahmed Abu Risha , a Sunni leader , shows his ink - stained finger after voting in Ramadi , 100 km ( 60 miles ) west of Baghdad January 31 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Ali al - Mashhdani
Sheikh Ahmed Abu Risha is head of the Awakening Conference , a political party born out of an armed movement that uprooted al Qaeda and other militants from Anbar province in western Iraq , once the deadliest place for U.S. forces in Iraq .
Abu Risha ’s renunciation of armed struggle and steps toward working with Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki could be a landmark in new political cooperation between Iraq ’s majority Shi’ites and minority Sunnis after years of bloodshed .
“ The prime minister ’s initiatives have been positive , ” said Abu Risha , who is considering an alliance with Maliki ’s State of Law coalition , which like the Awakening Conference made major gains in provincial elections in January .
Such an alliance before parliamentary polls in December could add momentum to nationalist political sentiment in Iraq , which helped propel Maliki to victory over religious groups .
“ If we want a unified Iraq , we must work in that direction , on unifying Sunnis and Shi’ites to build one country , ” he said .
The sheikh , dressed in Arab head dress , robe and aviator sunglasses , fired a rifle into the air with one hand to herald his party ’s confirmation as head of a new coalition dominating Anbar ’s provincial council .
Abu Risha inherited the movement from his late brother , Sheikh Abdul Sattar , who from 2006 onwards rallied thousands of Sunni Arab supporters to take up arms against al Qaeda in Anbar .
The Sunni Arab militias , dubbed Awakening Councils or Majalis al Sahwa in Arabic , quickly found U.S. backing and spread across Iraq .
The militiamen , who numbered up to 100,000 , are credited with helping curb violence across Iraq .
Abu Risha says the time for militias has ended .
“ We are a political , not an armed , group , ” he said , even as his supporters ’ celebratory gunfire echoed across the countryside .
SAHWA TENSIONS
The Shi’ite - led government , keen to end the years of bloodshed which followed the U.S. - led invasion , wants to disarm militias , and has pledged to absorb a fifth of the Sahwa into its security forces and give others civilian jobs and training .
But the presence of many former Sunni insurgents among the Sahwa has led to tensions that recently erupted into violence after Iraqi forces arrested senior Sahwa members in Baghdad .
Abu Risha stressed that his party had nothing to do with the Sahwa militias that clashed with government forces in Baghdad .
“ We are keen to ensure our name is not sullied , ” he said .
Abu Risha also warned that al Qaeda may be trying to foment strife between the government and Sahwa militias and prevent other possible alliances with militia members .
“ Al Qaeda sometimes pushes people to report on the Sahwa because they carried out operations against them , ” he said .
“ Al Qaeda ’s aim is for no one to stand with the government in future . ”
Despite its Shi’ite Islamist roots , Maliki ’s nationalist , non-sectarian message played well in January ’s polls , and Abu Risha now appears keen to embrace the same platform .
The Islamic Party , Iraq ’s biggest Sunni Arab party , has dominated Anbar ’s council for four years , but came in third in January ’s polls .
Abu Risha dismissed the party .
“ It is a party of religion and dogma .
We are about politics and economics , ” he said .
ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
In radio broadcasts and sermons , Taliban militants have been promoting themselves as Islamic Robin Hoods , defending Pakistan 's rural poor from a ruling elite that they describe as corrupt and oppressive .
Mohammed Daoud , with his son Faisal , is among those who have embraced the Taliban 's message .
That message has been resonating throughout the Pakistani countryside , where the culture is deeply conservative and the people are desperately poor .
In farmlands just 15 miles ( 24 kilometers ) from the center of Islamabad , Mohammed Daoud and his 15 - year - old son Faisal eke out a living by cutting grass for their four water buffalo .
They feed their family of seven , earning the equivalent of around $ 50 a month by selling buffalo milk .
Two months ago , Daoud said , the government bulldozed his family 's house , probably because they were illegally squatting on property they did not own .
" Justice [ in Pakistan ] is only for people who have money , " Daoud said , while slicing through handfuls of grass with a small scythe .
" We are illiterate , " he added , " but we are hoping that with Islamic sharia law , our lives will get better . "
Across this overwhelmingly Muslim country , there is widespread hope that adopting a strict code of law based on the Koran will transform a society where corruption is rampant and where at least a quarter of the population lives under the poverty line .
Watch why the Taliban 's message would resonate
Enforcement of sharia law is the platform the Taliban have been using to justify recent land - grabs , such as last week 's armed occupation of the district of Buner , some 60 miles from the Pakistani capital .
In an interview with CNN , Muslim Khan , the Taliban spokesman in the militant stronghold of Swat Valley , denounced the Pakistani government , calling the prime minister and lawmakers " un-Islamic . "
" They 're making money like in a supermarket , " Khan said , adding that under sharia law both the rich and the poor would be treated equally .
Militants have slowly taken over territory in northwestern Pakistan by first targeting unpopular landlords and bureaucrats , according to Amnesty International , the human rights watchdog .
" Its systematic .
The Taliban move into an area , they use local existing resentments .
They often go in with the guise of being Robin Hoods , " said Amnesty International representative Sam Zarifi .
" They scare away some local thieves , they impose very , very quick justice , very harsh justice , and initially in some places they are even welcomed . "
The Taliban 's promise of Islamic justice would be welcomed in farm fields on the outskirts of Islamabad .
Rows of wheat -- along with the posh villas of Pakistan 's ruling elite -- are within sight of Islamabad 's iconic white Faisal Mosque .
" In the present judicial system , even the innocent people are punished , " said Sajeet Hussein , as he and a group of farmers shared lunch under the shade of a tree .
The group explained that they were losing a court battle to stop the government from seizing their land , because they claimed they could n't afford to bribe policemen and judges .
" Every part of the country should have sharia law , like in Saudi Arabia , " said Hussein 's brother Babar , who sported a long bushy beard .
" Then poor and rich people will be equal . "
" We love the Taliban , " announced one Pashtun farmer who asked not to be named .
He called the militants heroes .
Sports star - turned - politician Imran Khan summed up his response to the Taliban in Pakistan by saying , " The poorer section of society is joining them ... this is now developing into a battle between the ' haves ' and the ' have - nots . '
" What the Taliban are giving them is cheap -- in fact , free -- accessible justice at the village level , " he added .
" This is what Pakistan should be doing for its own people . "
But if farmer Babar Hussein has his way , Taliban justice would mean taking away freedoms from Pakistani women , like the right to have a driver 's license .
" Women should not even come out of their houses .
That 's against Islam " he said , while complaining about the un-Islamic fashions he saw women wearing in Islamabad .
When Taliban militants overran Buner last week , they told women to stay indoors , warned men to stop shaving their beards , and threatened shopkeepers who sold movies and music .
In Pakistan 's rural society , male strangers are not even supposed look at local women .
And yet , some farmers enjoy blaring Bollywood music and even dancing on trailers full of hay , while driving their gaudily - decorated tractors .
If the Taliban 's rural revolt succeeds , it could bring silence to the Pakistani countryside .
All About Taliban Movement of Pakistan
Before We Begin ?
This series is intended to provide a framework for understanding what being environmentally responsible means , how it can affect energy consumption , resource utilization , and what impact energy savings can have on our everyday lives .
The information provided is not intended to be definitive or strictly scientific .
I am not trained as a civil or mechanical engineer .
I have referenced standard sources 1, 2,3,4,5,6 and used calculations that are widely accepted in making estimates on costs , savings , and CO 2 emissions 7,8,9 .
The basic assumptions made in this series are that a majority of US homes were built before 1985 , the average size home is 2000 square feet , and mechanical equipment , insulation , and windows , are either original or at least 10 years old .
I used the average monthly cost for natural gas and electricity for Chicago in 2008 in any calculations requiring energy cost assumptions10 .
Every building has unique features , making broad generalizations about what any particular energy efficiency upgrade will cost difficult .
However , my goal is that the reader can go to the sites referenced and reproduce the calculations I have made for their particular situation thus making an informed decision for themselves .
Financial or Environmental Motivation
As I introduced in my two previous articles , my main tenets are that there is a shade of green for every project and for every budget .
This means that in a very real way , upgrading our buildings to more energy efficient structures will help lead to decreased dependence on finite natural resources , lead to economic recovery , and improve the comfort and quality of our indoor spaces .
My next four articles are designed to provide some real life examples and comparisons for readers to evaluate as they consider how they might incorporate green upgrades to projects that are planned , dreamed , or unexpected .
I will begin with single - family residential properties , but the comparisons can be used for multi-family and small commercial buildings as well .
This article , the first in the series , will look at air conditioning , gas heating , the building envelope ( primarily insulation ) , and hot water heaters .
I have focused on forced air systems for heating and cooling , and gas hot water heaters .
There are of course many different types of heating and cooling systems , but to address them all in this short article and series would be too much to tackle .
The calculations and comparisons for gas and oil - fired boilers , electric hot water heaters , and room air conditioners are similar , and the principles of cost savings , energy savings , and CO 2 emission reductions are equally well demonstrated using any combination of systems .
I have chosen forced air heating and cooling and gas hot water heating because it is what I happen to have in my home , not because it achieves any particular agenda .
In the United States in 2008 , buildings consumed almost 40 % of all energy produced , 70 % of the electricity , and 14 % of the potable water .
They also produced 40 % of the CO 2 emissions in that year .
11,12
In many articles you can find on the Internet , in publications , and in advertisements for energy efficient products , there are claims made of impressive energy savings for making certain energy efficient improvements to homes and buildings .
20 % energy savings for buying a new furnace , or 20 % savings for insulating your home , or 10 % savings for installing a new water heater are claims I see frequently .
What would it mean to our country if every building were actually able to reduce its energy use by that much ?
What about if the savings were more substantial ?
Is it worth trying to go green if we can reduce the energy consumption of buildings in the US by 25 % or 30 % ?
I think so .
But is it realistic and affordable ?
Yes it is , and I ?ll show you how .
Does High - Efficiency Air Conditioning Pay Off ?
Let ?s start with central air conditioning .
The efficiency of an air condition is measured in a value called the Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating ( SEER ) .
The higher the SEER efficiency rating , the more efficient the system is .
Heat pumps have a slightly different rating scheme .
I will focus on the standard split system air conditioning units .
Most equipment that was installed more than 10 years ago has a rating of 10 or less .
It is common to see a SEER of 9 in homes 20 or more years old with original equipment .
The other part of the energy equation is the tonnage , or how much cooling the unit can provide .
Tonnage is really an expression of electricity consumed to create a certain level of cooling and is measured in British Thermal Units ( BTUs ) .
I used 3 tons as the common element for this example .
A 3 - ton unit is rated at 36,000 BTU / hr .
This can get complicated and technical , so I made a table to show the results .
[ TABLE=3 ]
A 13 SEER system is 31 % more efficient than a 9 SEER system it might be replacing .
Thirteen SEER is currently the minimum efficiency rating allowed by the Department of Energy .
A 16 SEER system is another 15 % more efficient , and a 21 SEER system is an additional 10 % more efficient .
That ?s fine , but what you really want to know is how much will it cost you to run that system and at what point does the cost of the more efficient system outweigh the savings you might hope to get .
Assuming 125 days of cooling at 8 hours a day ( as this makes the math easy ) 13 what you see is that the 13 SEER system saves almost $ 200 a season , a 16 SEER system saves you more than $ 225 a season , and a 21 SEER system saves $ 300 a season .
A new 13 SEER system might cost $ 1035 for the unit alone , 16 SEER system $ 1378 for the unit alone , and a 21 SEER system $ 2100 for the unit alone .
( I have left out the cost of labor and other parts that will probably be required as these would be required for any new system , regardless of its efficiency in the same installation . )
So in the end , a 16 SEER system is 44 % more efficient , only 25 % more expensive and saves around $ 225 a season in energy costs compared to the 9 SEER system it replaces .
Basically , in the first season of use , the extra efficiency pays for itself and the homeowner has money every year after that to go to buy season passes for the entire family to their favorite amusement park .
For those keeping track of CO 2 , the 13 SEER system would emit 6.23 tons of CO2 per year and would require the planting of 31 trees to offset that amount of emission .
The original 9 SEER system emits 9 tons of CO2 requiring 45 trees , and the more efficient 16 SEER system emits only 5 tons of CO 2 and needs 25 trees to clean it up .
The 21 SEER system is quire a bit better , emitting only 3.85 tons of CO 2 and needs only 14 trees to clean up that amount .
When looking at this , you have to balance what you can reasonably expect the consumer to pay and what they can reasonably expect to get in return .
If a homeowner spends 25 % more , can recover that cost in a year , saves 40 % in energy and reduces CO 2 by 44 % , that is a win for everyone .
Does High - Efficiency Heating Pay Off ?
Now that we ?ve got our feet wet with air conditioning , let ?s take a similar look at furnaces .
Again , I ?ve made some assumptions and also limited myself to natural gas , forced air systems .
There are oil and gas fired boilers , electric systems , and other modes of heating like stoves , fireplaces , and space heaters , but I will not cover those .
For our 2,000 square foot house , we will be using an 80,000 BTU furnace as the controlling number for the energy and cost comparisons .
Furnaces are rated by their Annualized Fuel Utilization Efficiency ( AFUE ) .
This is a way of measuring how much of the heat created by burning the gas is transferred to heat in the home .
It says that for every dollar ?s worth of gas burned , the rated percentage is used to create heat while the rest is wasted out the vent stack .
An 80 % AFUE furnace converts 80 cents of every dollar worth of gas to heat in the home .
A 95 % AFUE furnace wastes only 5 cents worth .
I ? m simplifying this a bit ( more than a bit ) since not really all the gas burned is converted to heating and the rating is not the actual output of the unit .
But it serves the purpose for here .
Once again , have a look at the table below and ignore all the technical stuff .
[ TABLE=4 ]
I used 240 days of heating for 8 hours a day for the energy consumption calculation .
Most older homes have an 80 % AFUE furnace .
The actual output is going to be determined by many more factors than just the gas burned : how clean the unit is , how well the ducts are sealed , and several other factors may make the older unit much less efficient than 80 % .
But for consistency , 80 % will be the base figure .
The government says that a 90 % AFUE is the minimum EnergyStar® compliant unit .
You can purchase 80 , 90 , 92 , 94 , 95 , and 96 % AFUE units .
Again , we want to know the tipping point in efficiency versus additional cost of a more efficient unit if you leave out all the labor and extra equipment that has to be purchased ( blowers , humidifiers , and ducting ) .
An 80 % AFUE unit uses 1090 Therms15 which will cost $ 1,384 to run for the season .
A 90 % AFUE furnace uses 780 Therms and costs $ 991 for the season and is 30 % more efficient .
A 95 % AFUE furnace uses 739 Therms and costs $ 939 for the season and is 34 % more efficient .
( Comparison is to a new replacement 80 % AFUE unit or a peak running older unit ) .
The base price of a new 80 % AFUE is $ 678 , a 90 % AFUE unit is $ 919 ( 30 % more expensive ) and a 95 % AFUE unit is $ 1,217 ( 80 % more expensive ) .
The time to recovery of the cost is quickly seen .
It will take only half of the operating season to recover the additional cost of a 90 % efficient system that saves a little over 30 % in energy !
Even the 95 % efficient system pays for itself in a season and a half .
Now the homeowner has saved enough money to go buy season hockey tickets for the family ( minor league at least ) .
For the green converted , the CO 2 count is also pretty clear .
The 80 % AFUE unit generates 2.6 tons of CO 2 , and the 95 % AFUE unit creates only 1.8 tons of CO 2 , a 31 % reduction .
That ?s the equivalent of 13 trees needed versus 9 trees needed .
So the tipping point is at 90 % AFUE .
Everything after that is incremental .
However , most of the tax rebates and incentives require you to buy a 94 % AFUE unit or better to qualify ( more on that in a later article in the series ) but as you can see , the cost difference and the time to recover that cost is not that great .
In 2 years , your additional cost for the most efficient unit you can purchase is recovered .
Do High - Efficiency Water Heaters Pay Off ?
If I have not lost you yet , let ?s take a look at water heaters .
Using natural gas as our heat source ( not ignoring electric or solar water heating , just not including them here ) what can we do to improve efficiency and save money ?
Water heaters are rated on a measurement called the Efficiency Factor ( EF ) .
This reflects the overall efficiency of the unit taking into account the heat recovery efficiency ( energy captured by the unit to heat the water ) , the stand - by loss ( how much energy is lost due to the water standing around ) , and the cycling loss ( the loss of heat as the water circulates through a water heater tank , and / or inlet and outlet pipes ) .
There are other measurements for water heaters but they are not applicable now .
The size of the water heater and its BTU are accounted for in the EF , so they do not need to be accounted for in this demonstration .
Most older water heaters have an EF of 0.57 or even less .
The most efficient new tanked water heaters are up to 0.68 , and a tankless water heater can have a rating of 0.84 EF.16
Looking at the table below and ignoring all the technical stuff that is boring , lets look at 3 examples :
[ TABLE=5 ]
Assuming an EF of 0.57 , you would use 262 Therms and spend $ 297 to heat your water for a year .
An EF of 0.67 uses 233 Therms and costs $ 264 .
A tankless 0.84 EF water heater uses only 177 Therms and costs $ 201 for the year .
The 0.67 EF unit is 22 % more efficient and the tankelss unit is 33 % more efficient .
An EnergyStar® compliant water heater is at least an EF of 0.66 until 2010 .
The cost of a new water heater might run $ 418 for a 0.57 model , $ 528 for a 0.67 model , and $ 900 for a tankless 0.84 model .
Once again there is a tipping point .
Its only $ 100 more expensive to get the more efficient tanked water heater , but since the overall savings rate is lower by comparison , it will take 3 years to recover the cost difference .
But look at the tankless unit .
It is twice as expensive , but 33 % more efficient .
The time to recovery is only 4 years .
Here the choice is harder to make and might have more to do with individual economics than anything else .
The CO 2 count is not that helpful in this case either since the numbers are not as big .
The 0.57 EF unit generates 0.42 tons of CO 2 and the tankless 0.84 unit 0.29 tons of CO2 .
It takes 2.14 trees to absorb the CO 2 from the base unit and 1.45 trees for the most efficient unit .
Still and all , the savings in CO 2 are there and not immeasurable .
For those trying to be as energy conscious as possible , clearly the tankless is the way to go , as long as cost is not a limiting factor .
Does Insulation Pay Off ?
The last part of the energy equation I want to look at is insulation .
This really is much harder to quantify .
Insulation of any type is really all about air sealing .
Keeping outside air out and inside air in , and controlling the amount of the exchange of the two air volumes as much as possible .
The more the house leaks , the more energy is wasted .
So insulation is really about the integrity of the home and how well it is sealed .
Homes can leak energy in all kinds of places .
Wall outlets , recessed lighting , outdoor spigots , window frames , door frames , window seals , door seals , attic openings , crawl spaces and basements , and floor / wall junctions are all part of the building envelope that need to be addressed when looking at decreasing the amount of energy that is leaking from a home .
Since every home is different , the only way to figure some of this out is have the home inspected by a licensed energy rater .
They can bring specialized equipment to the house and measure how badly it is leaking , from where , and provide an action plan to fix them .17
I ?d like to make a couple of assumptions .
First if you have an old home that has single pane windows , you should simply replace them .
Whatever the cost is , replacing the windows with Low E glass , double or tripled paned windows will save so much money compared to the initial cost that it should be done if the budget allows .
Second , most older homes , those built in the 1950s , and some built in the 1975 ?
1985 boom are under insulated or not insulated at all .
Attics and basements or crawl spaces are places that can be pretty easily attended to and upgraded with proper insulation .
Exterior walls are much harder and will require either removing some of the siding , drilling holes in the mortar of brick homes , or doing extensive indoor work .
Unless a major renovation is in your budget , wall insulation won ?t be cost effective .
The Department of energy says that you can save 20 % on overall energy costs related to heating and cooling by making sure that the home is properly insulated and sealed .
18 For our region , the recommended insulation for an attic space is R - 49 ( R value is the amount of insulation needed to achieve a certain level of thermal resistance . ) and the recommended level for basements is R - 19 .
Exterior walls are recommended to be R - 21 .
What might it cost to insulate the attic and basement of our sample home ?
Assuming R - 30 exists in the attic , adding 8 inches of insulation to achieve R - 49 for fiberglass would cost roughly $ 931 .
To do the basement , which is likely to be uninsulated currently and taking it to R - 19 , it might cost $ 600 .
( For this purpose I contacted a few contractors and asked them to give me installed prices for this project ) .
So for a total investment of $ 1500 , you can reasonably expect to reduce your energy usage by up to 14 % and save 12 % overall on you energy costs .
But you might expect to see a 20 % reduction in heating and cooling related costs .
For example , our home with the 9 SEER air conditioner and 80 % AFUE furnace , this would save $ 380 for a full year of heating and cooling and reduce the CO 2 emissions by 2.32 tons .
So you can see , insulating and air sealing the home can save quite a bit of money right away , and the payback on that $ 1500 is only 3 years ?
faster if you apply for federal credits and local incentives .
19
Other Energy and Money Saving Options
There are more ways to save money and energy and for it to be cost effective .
Every appliance in the house has an expected lifespan .
At some point it needs to be replaced .
Choosing EnergyStar® compliant equipment will guarantee that you are getting a unit that has been certified to meet the minimum federal standards for energy efficiency .
The payback on any of these items will be within the lifespan of the unit .
Choosing models that exceed the minimum standards is also possible , and desirable , but you have to do the energy / costs analysis to see at what point the return on your investment is outweighed by the absolute cost of the equipment .
20
All Systems Impact Each Other
In all the discussion about cost and energy and CO 2 , what is probably lost is the fact that you can ?t look at each individual system in isolation .
Changes and improvements in one of the home ?s systems will affect the others in some way .
Creating a tighter building envelope will reduce the demand for heating and cooling and thus decrease the size of the equipment required ?
additional savings .
However , a tighter home might have moisture and odor control issues and will need better fresh air ventilation via a mechanical air exchanger .
Programmable thermostats can help reduce energy costs by adjusting the temperature of the house based on the time of day and how many people are home .
Indoor air quality can be improved in a tighter home , so better air filters might be needed .
This reduces air particles and can decrease asthma or other respiratory illness ( more in a later article ) .
All of these items will add to the cost of the upgrade , but since the payback time is so short on the basic unit , it ? s a cost that can be recovered in a 3 year time frame .
A more efficient water heater might mean that you can set the temperature of the hot water lower .
You might also be able to use hot water for other purposes in the home , or recapture drained warm water to help preheat water going into the hot water heater , making it more efficient .
( The waste water is not mixed with fresh water , just the warmth from that water is exchanged ) .
Does Going Green Pay Off ?
If you made it this far , I thank you for taking the time to work through what amounts to a very complicated assessment of the nuts and bolts of going green in your home .
The original question that I posed in the beginning was whether it is worth doing energy efficient upgrades at all , and if you do them , can you achieve the savings that are bandied about .
While the savings are not strictly additive , you can see that under each system we looked at , there are considerable savings to be had by going green .
Saving real dollars in hard times is no joke .
Depending on the installation , and depending on the starting point of the building , the overall savings might be substantially more than the 20 % or so I ?ve shown using a 25 year old home .
In addition to saving money , I think I ?ve shown that the energy savings for these upgrades is pretty substantial .
Now multiply the energy savings a few million times over and you can see that the total energy consumption can drop pretty dramatically by incorporating modest individual improvements .
The homeowner saves money , and our country begins to move toward a more efficient energy model .
Instead of 40 % energy consumption , maybe we get down to 30 % energy consumption for buildings .
That would amount to literally billions in savings annually .
The Benefits of Going Green Are Real
I hope that this article has given you some understanding and rationale for undertaking energy efficient upgrades to your existing homes , provided you did not fall asleep getting to the end .
I ? m not advocating going out to replace equipment that is in good working order .
But if you need to replace your equipment due to malfunction or disrepair or are planning on replacing it as part of a home renovation project , there is no reason why every home can ?t be upgraded to the most efficient units available .
The upfront costs are real , but the pay back on that cost is pretty short .
If you plan to stay in your home for at least 4 years , every single upgrade will pay for itself in that time , most of them in a year or less .
And the benefits to the environment are everlasting .
I have provided a few documents to look at and several links to websites and organizations that can provide immense amounts of information on this portion of our look at going green .
The next article will look at the home as a system and I?ll try to explain more about additive effects of making changes to your homes .

" Everyone has a right to vote their conscience , " the actors says in an exclusive statement
Tom Hanks is rethinking his comments about Mormons who supported Proposition 8 .
Last week , the star , who is an executive producer for HBO ’s controversial series Big Love about a group of polygamist Mormons , spoke out about the religious group ’s involvement in passing the California law , which bans same - sex marriage .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
“ The truth is a lot of Mormons gave a lot of money to the church to make Prop - 8 happen , ” Hanks told Foxnews.com at the show ’s premiere in Los Angeles last Wednesday .
“ There are a lot of people who feel that is un-American , and I am one of them . ”
A spokesperson for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints , Kim Farah , took offense at Hanks ’s comments , telling FOX News , “ Expressing an opinion in a free and democratic society is as American as it gets . ”
Now , in a exclusive statement to PEOPLE through his representative Leslee Dart , Hanks is softening his stance .
The collapse of the pound on the foreign exchanges is keeping food price inflation at painful levels , with the heaviest impact falling on poorer households and pensioners .
The British Retail Consortium ( BRC ) , which represents most major shop chains , reported yesterday a 9 per cent rise in the price of food in the shops in the year to March , against a fall in the prices of non -food items of 1.5 per cent .
Prices were up 0.4 per cent month - on - month .
Despite a general fall in inflation – the annual rise in the Retail Prices Index ( RPI ) hit zero last month – food prices remain stubbornly high , and rising .
Imports of fresh vegetables from eurozone nations such as Spain have become especially dear – up by around one quarter .
Other foods that have seen double - digit price rises since 2008 include lamb ( 21.3 per cent ) , beef ( 20.6 per cent ) , pork ( 19.7 per cent ) , cereals ( 16.1 per cent ) and milk ( 11.5 per cent ) .
British lamb is becoming an expensive delicacy , up 26.7 per cent , the largest jump of any food item in the RPI .

Because so many food prices are determined globally , home produce prices have also been pushed higher by the fall in the pound , as the price of otherwise comparatively cheap UK produce has been bid up by foreign buyers .
The BRC said : " Although around 60 per cent of food consumed in the UK is sourced domestically , the grocery industry is a global market place and hence exchange rate fluctuations affect the price of produce and production .
The farm gate price of UK - produced foodstuffs has increased markedly as sterling has depreciated , to maintain parity in the price of similar goods sourced in other currencies in the global market place . "
Those households where food prices and utility bills ( which are rising even faster ) represent a big proportion of the budget are seeing little benefit from the much - heralded onset of deflation .
The Institute for Fiscal Studies recently found that the richest fifth of households had an average inflation rate of minus 1 per cent ; the poorest fifth had an average inflation rate of 5.3 per cent .
The least - well off pensioner households , usually with no mortgage and no benefit from the cut in Bank rate , are still coping with inflation at 6.9 per cent .
World food prices , while some way off their peaks of 2007 and 2008 , remain very high by recent historical standards , about double where they were in 2003 , according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation .
The same sort of pressures that pushed up food prices during the boom are largely still there : rising populations ; changes in diet in fast - emerging societies such as China ( where resource - intensive meat and poultry is replacing efficient rice ) ; pressure on land use from biofuels and human settlement and growing shortages of water .
Climate change is also liable to adversely affect food production .
The World Bank estimates that higher food prices have increased the number of undernourished people to close to one billion , out of a global population nearing seven billion .
A report prepared for the forthcoming get - together of G8 agriculture ministers in Italy – the first " food summit " of its kind – hints at the possibility of food wars in the future , or , as the report phrases it , " serious consequences not merely on business relations but equally on social and international relations , which in turn will impact directly on the security and stability of world politics " .
The long - term problem of meeting a doubling of food demand by 2050 from a world population of nine billion is moving up the international political agenda .
Some nations , such as Korea and Taiwan , have been buying huge swaths of arable land in the developing world as a way of assuring food security .
Around 73 million people now depend on the UN's World Food Programme for their sustenance .
ONNA , Italy  Pope Benedict XVI on Tuesday toured the wreckage left by the earthquake this month , offering comfort to survivors still living in tents here in the hardest - hit town , where 40 out of 300 residents died .
“ I would like to hug you with affection , one by one , ” Benedict said , standing inside the tent camp as a light rain fell .
Across the muddy parking lot stood the crumbling ruins of the town ’s houses , while the snow - capped Apennines rose in the distance .
The pope said he hoped that his visit would be “ a tangible sign ” that the Lord “ is not deaf to the worried cry of so many families who lost everything : houses , savings , work and often even human lives . ”
Though small , Onna has become the symbol of the devastation caused by the earthquake , which killed nearly 300 people and left 65,000 homeless in this mountainous region of central Italy on April 6 .

ext4 , application expectations and power management
There 's been a certain amount of discussion about behavioural differences between ext3 and ext4 [ 1 ] , most notably due to ext4's increased window of opportunity for files to end up empty due to both a longer commit window and delayed allocation of blocks in order to obtain a more pleasing on - disk layout .
The applications that failed hardest were doing open ( " foo " , O_TRUNC ) , write ( ) , close ( ) and then being surprised when they got zero length files back after a crash .
That 's fine .
That was always stupid .
Asking the filesystem to truncate a file and then writing to it is an invitation to failure - there 's clearly no way for it to intuit the correct answer here .
In the end this has been avoided by avoiding delayed allocation when writing to a file that 's just been truncated , so everything 's fine .
However , there 's another case that also breaks .
A common way of saving files is to open ( " foo.tmp " ) , write ( ) , close ( ) and then rename ( " foo.tmp " , " foo " ) .
The mindset here is that a crash will either result in foo.tmp being zero length , foo still being the original file or foo being your new data .
The important aspect of this is that the desired behaviour of this code is that foo will contain either the original data or the new data .
You may suffer data loss , but you wo n't suffer complete data loss - the application state will be consistent .
When used with its ( default ) data=ordered journal option , ext3 provided these semantics .
ext4 does n't .
Instead , if you want to ensure that your data does n't get trampled , it 's necessary to fsync ( ) before closing in order to make sure it hits disk .
Otherwise the rename can occur before the data is written , and you 're back to a zero length file .
ext4 does n't make guarantees about whether data will be flushed before metadata is written .
Now , POSIX says this is fine , so any application that expected this behaviour is already broken by definition .
But this is rules lawyering .
POSIX says that many things that are not useful are fine , but does n't exist for the pleasure of sadistic OS implementors .
POSIX exists to allow application writers to write useful applications .
If you interpret POSIX in such a way that gains you some benefit but shafts a large number of application writers then people are going to be reluctant to use your code .
You 're no longer a general purpose filesystem - you 're a filesystem that 's only suitable for people who write code with the expectation that their OS developers are actively trying to fuck them over .
I 'm sure Oracle deals with this case fine , but I also suspect that most people who work on writing Oracle on a daily basis have very , very unfulfilling lives .
But anyway .
We can go and fix every single piece of software that saves files to make sure that it fsync ( )s , and we can avoid this problem .
We can probably even do it fairly quickly , thanks to us having the source code to all of it .
A lot of this code lives in libraries and can be fixed up without needing to touch every application .
It 's not the end of the world .
So why do I still think it 's a bad idea ?
It 's simple .
open ( ) , write ( ) , close ( ) , rename ( ) and open ( ) , write ( ) , fsync ( ) , close ( ) , rename ( ) , are not semantically equivalent .
One is " give me either the original data or the new data " [ 2 ] .
The other is " always give me the new data " .
This is an important distinction .
fsync( ) means that we 've sent the data to the disk [ 3 ] .
And , in general , that means that we 've had to spin the disk up .
So , on the one hand , we 're trying to use things like relatime to batch data to reduce the amount of time a disk has to be spun up .
And on the other hand , we 're moving to filesystems that require us to generate more io in order to guarantee that our data hits disk , which is a guarantee we often do n't want anyway !
Users will be fine with losing their most recent changes to preferences if a machine crashes .
They will not be fine with losing the entirity of their preferences .
Arguing that applications need to use fsync ( ) and are otherwise broken is ignoring the important difference between these use cases .
It 's no longer going to be possible to spin down a disk when any software is running at all , since otherwise it 's probably going to write something and then have to fsync it out of sheer paranoia that something bad will happen .
And then probably fsync the directory as well , because what if someone writes an even more pathological filesystem .
And the disks sit there spinning gently and chitter away as they write tiny files [ 4 ] and never spin down and the polar bears all drown in the bitter tears of application developers who are forced to drink so much to forget that they all die of acute liver failure by the age of 35 and where are we then oh yes we 're fucked .
So .
I said we could fix up applications fairly easily .
But to do that , we need an interface that lets us do the right thing .
The behaviour application writers want is one which ext4 does n't appear to provide .
Can that be fixed , please ?
[ 1 ] xfs behaves like ext4 in this respect , so the obvious argument is that all our applications have been broken for years and so why are you complaining now .
To which the obvious response is " Approximately anyone who ever used xfs expected their data to vanish if their machine crashed so nobody used it by default and seriously who gives a shit " .
xfs is a wonderful filesystem for all sorts of things , but it 's lousy for desktop use for precisely this reason .
[ 2 ]
Yes , ok , we 've just established that it actually is n't that in the same way that GMT is n't UTC and battery refers to a collection of individual cells and so you do n't usually put multiple batteries in your bike lights , but the point is that this is , for all practical intents and purposes , an unimportant distinction and not one people should have to care about in their daily lives .
[ 3 ]
The disk is free to sit there bored for arbitrary periods of time before it does anything , but that 's fine , because the OS is behaving correctly .
Sigh .
[ 4 ]
Dear filesystem writers - application developers like writing lots of tiny files , because it makes a large number of things significantly easier .
This is fine because sheer filesystem performance is not high on the list of priorities of a typical application developer .
The answer is not " Oh , you should all use sqlite " .
If the only effective way to use your filesystem is to use a database instead , then that indicates that you have not written a filesystem that is useful to typical application developers who enjoy storing things in files rather than binary blobs that end up with an entirely different set of pathological behaviours .
If I wanted all my data to be in oracle then I would n't need a fucking filesystem in the first place , would I ?

Mr Lieberman took over at the foreign ministry with a big political splash Israel 's former chief peace negotiator says the way the new government is talking shows it will not be a partner for peace with the Palestinians .
Tzipi Livni's criticism follows the rejection by her successor as foreign minister , Avigdor Lieberman , of recent US - backed efforts towards a peace deal .
" What happened is that the government announced that Israel is not relevant , is not a partner , " she said .
New PM Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to seek peace but has not detailed how .
Ms Livni's centrist Kadima party came narrowly ahead of Mr Netanyahu 's right - wing Likud in the February election , but he was asked to form a coalition as right - leaning parties predominated .
From today , Israel has announced that it is not a partner
Tzipi Livni
In his speech on Wednesday , at a foreign ministry handover attended by Ms Livni , the ultra-nationalist Mr Lieberman said Israel was not bound by the Annapolis accords agreed with the Palestinians and the Bush administration in November 2007 .
He said the only legitimate document was another US - sponsored deal , the Road Map peace plan of 2003 , because he said it was ratified by the Israeli government and the UN Security Council .
First test
In an interview with Israeli army radio , Ms Livni said hardliners had avoided peace efforts in the past with the " pathetic excuse " that there had been no partner on the Palestinian side .
COALITION MEMBERS Likud : 27 seats , 15 ministers Yisrael Beiteinu 15 : 5 ministers Labour : 13 seats , 5 ministers Shas : 11 seats , 4 ministers Jewish Home : 3 seats , 1 minister United Torah Judaism : 5 seats
Analysis : Israel 's unwieldy government " From today , Israel has announced that it is not a partner , " she said .
" The remarks do not represent Israel , the remarks hurt Israel , " she added , and urged Mr Netanyahu to disavow them .
Correspondents say Mr Netanyahu has softened his opposition towards the Palestinians since his last premiership in the 1990s .
However , they add , the appointment of Mr Lieberman has angered Palestinians and raised international concerns because of his hard - line positions on the peace process and his manifesto which was widely seen as racist against Arabs .
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Mr Lieberman 's remarks were the first test for US President Barack Obama in the Middle East .
" He has slammed the door in the face of the US and the international community , " he said .
No land for peace US state department spokesman Gordon Duguid would not be drawn into commenting on Mr Lieberman 's views when he briefed reporters in Washington .
Instead , he stressed Mr Netanyahu 's stated commitment to achieving peace and said the administration would work closely to advance that cause .
Analysts say the Road Map never got off the ground because both sides accused each other of failing to meet their obligations .
Israel said the Palestinian Authority had not clamped down on militants , while Palestinians said Israel ignored a freeze on settlement activity on occupied territory .
Annapolis was designed to get over that hump by jumping directly to final status talks on Palestinian independence .
However , Annapolis too got stuck and had made little apparent progress by its initial deadline of the end of 2008 .
After his speech , Mr Lieberman went further in a TV interview , saying he also opposed withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights as part of peace negotiations with Syria .
He said he was " very much in favour of peace with Syria - but only on one basis - peace in return for peace " and not , by implication , a land - for - peace deal .
Syria says the Golan Heights , occupied by Israel in 1967 , must be returned in full if there is to be peace between the two countries .

6/25/2008 Project Moving Forward
Some of the contributors and editors most involved in this project have temporarily refocused their efforts on related material in other projects , but this project continues to move forward .
New material from a variety of sources , including What Happened by former White House secretary Scott McClellan , is in preparation .
You ’re invited to join the project .
WHEN European education ministers met in Bologna in 1999 and promised within a decade to forge a common market for universities , it seemed mere Euro- rhetoric .
Big obstacles stopped students nipping abroad for a term , or getting degrees recognised .
Many countries offered no degree below Masters level .
Some examined course modules separately , others all in one go .
Under the Erasmus programme many students travelled to other European countries for between a term and a year — but they often found their universities reluctant to give them credit for it .
Yet on April 28th no fewer than 46 European education ministers — from the European Union and 19 other countries , including Russia and Turkey — will gather in another ancient university city , Leuven , to declare the “ Bologna process ” a triumph .
A “ European credit - transfer system ” is on its way ; next year will bring a “ European higher education area ” .
There will be a standardised “ diploma supplement ” giving details of what students have learnt .
And three - year Bachelors degrees followed by two - year Masters are now the general rule , with few exceptions .
“ The big surprise was that the Bologna process worked at all , ” says Jean - Marc Rapp , president of the European University Association .
Bologna is neither an inter - governmental treaty nor an EU law .
He credits the eastern European countries that joined Bologna in 1999 for some of the success .
Their governments were itching to reform communist - era universities and delighted to have a template for it — and their students were wild to travel .
Another reason why some governments embraced Bologna was to give cover for reforms they wanted anyway .
Shorter , more work - related degrees appealed to the Germans , keen to stop students hanging on for years at taxpayers ' expense .
In France , changes to university financing have been called “ Bologna ” .
In Spain “ Bologna ” is the excuse for introducing fees for Masters degrees .
Many students now anathematise “ Bologna ” as a capitalist plot .
They plan protests in Leuven ; already , students have taken to the streets in France , Italy , Spain and Greece .
The resemblance to the Anglo - American system , plus Bologna 's emphasis on graduate employability , are big grievances .
Some academics fret that the secret aim is to privatise universities .
Bologna 's endorsement of more autonomy could lead ( horrors ! ) to more freedom for universities in hiring , promotion and pay .
Europe is littered with historic universities ( Bologna is the oldest , founded in 1088 ) .
But the paucity of European institutions and the ubiquity of American ones at the top of international league tables are a constant reminder of the gap between glorious past and mediocre present .
For believers , Bologna shows the way to a future that will be glorious once more .
Yet this vision of self - governing universities , footloose students and job - ready graduates omits one big reason for European universities ' decline : money .
In America , the gap between what governments pay and what universities need is made up privately , mainly by tuition fees .
In most of Europe students pay nothing .
Even in England , tuition fees are capped by the government at low levels .
Europe 's universities have seen funding per student fall behind wage inflation by 1 - 2 % a year over three decades .
America devotes far more of its GDP to higher education ( see chart ) .
Bruegel , a Brussels - based think - tank , finds that universities carrying out top - class research and leading league tables have both more autonomy and more money .
If Europe delivers only one of these , it may not be enough .
Last Eastern School District public meeting in Morell
NANCY WILLIS The Charlottetown Guardian , March 25 , 2009
Editor – this is probably one of Nancy Willis ’ last articles for the Charlottetown Guardian since they decided to close the Souris Office and lay Nancy off .
It ’s a sad week for Kings County .
I ’ve known Nancy since 1976 and hope she finds something equally rewarding soon .
MORELL —
Not one of the 200 people who turned out at the Eastern School District ’s meeting here Wednesday night supported the closure of the area ’s small schools , instead they soundly bashed the report recommending the closures , its author , superintendent Sandy MacDonald , and the board members themselves .
The parents represented schools in St. Peters , St. Theresa , Tracadie Cross , Grand Tracadie and Parkdale , all of which are among the 11 slated for closure .
They accused the board of incompetence and lacking in respect for community .
They said the report , which recommends the closures take place by this fall , is incomplete and was rushed through in order have everything in place before the next election .
They also said there has been absolutely no consultation with parents and community members .
“ The trustees have already made up their minds , and these consultation meetings are a sham , ” said Irene Gaudet of Tracadie Cross .
She said the only consultation concerning her school was a discussion with the principal , who lives outside the area and has no children attending school there .
Gaudet said parents at Tracadie Cross have discussed the possibility of court action .
Martie Murphy cited the Parents for Learning group representing the Souris family of schools which received $ 15,000 for a study on what to do about declining enrolment in their area .
Murphy called on the district to put an end to this so - called consultation process and give all the local schools $ 15,000 to go into the community and do their own studies , after which they could then go forward with a collaborative process .
The parents chided provincial Education Minister Gerard Greenan for refusing to attend any of the meetings , and for sitting at home watching them on television in the protection of his own living room .
Mike Casey of St. Peters called for funding formulas that would maintain small schools , and Ron MacInnis of St. Peters compared the effect of the removal of St. Peters Consolidated from the community to the eradication of the automobile plant in Oshawa .
They also questioned MacDonald ’s rationale that combining the small schools ( that currently have the best student - teacher ratios in Atlantic Canada ) , could possibly provide better education by increasing the number of students .

MUST WE LOOK BACK TO THE Great Depression to really understand the current stock market ?
A year or so ago , when a select few investment newsletter editors began arguing that we need to do so , the overwhelming majority of advisers believed that drawing such an analogy served little purpose other than fear mongering .
It is testament to the severity of this bear market that the consensus opinion has shifted so much that it is now respectable to look to the 1930s for guidance about what is in store for equities .
I 'm skeptical , however .
That 's not because I do n't think that decade has much to teach us .
My skepticism instead traces to the small number of analysts and commentators who have really analyzed what an analogy to the 1930s truly entails .
And if we are to genuinely learn the lessons of history , we have no choice but to start with an accurate assessment of what actually happened .
After examining several aspects of the stock market 's behavior during the 1930s , it would appear as though a replay of that decade might very well be less scary than assumed by many of those who superficially draw the analogy .
Here are some myths about the Depression that should be dispelled .
MYTH 1: It took 25 years for the stock market to recover its losses from the high reached just before the stock market crashed in October 1929 .
It 's easy to see why investors believe this myth to be true :
It was n't until Nov. 23 , 1954 , that the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above the level at which it closed on Sept.
3 , 1929 , the date of its closing high before that year 's crash .
That 's a recovery period of more than 25 years .
If the recovery from the bear market over the last year and a half were to take the same length of time , the Dow would n't again close above its all - time high from Oct. 9 , 2007 , of 14,164.53 until -- you 'd better sit down -- Dec. 28 , 2032 .
The truth , however , is that it took stocks far less than 25 years to recover .
According to Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel , the inflation - adjusted total return index of the U.S. stock market was just as high in late 1936 and early 1937 as it was at its precrash peak in 1929 .
That was less than eight years later .
That may not be great news to investors who are hoping to recover their bear market losses in just one or two years .
But it 's a whole lot better than taking 25 years to recover those losses .
WHY THE BIG DIFFERENCE ?
One factor is dividends , which were substantial during the 1930s .
At the depths of the Great Depression , in fact , the Dow 's dividend yield was in the double digits .
Ignoring dividends , which is what investors do when focusing on price alone , therefore , introduces a significant pessimistic bias into any historical analysis .
ANOTHER FACTOR IS DEFLATION :
The consumer price index actually dropped by 27 % between its 1929 peak and its low in 1933 .
A stock that dropped by less than this amount in nominal terms over this four - year period , therefore , actually turned a profit in inflation - adjusted terms .
Yet another reason why it took the Dow so long to surmount its 1929 peak :
The decision in 1939 to delete International Business Machines from the average .
It was n't added back until years later .
According to Norman Fosback , editor of Fosback 's Fund Forecaster , the Dow would today be more than twice its quoted level had IBM not been removed from the average in 1939 .
MYTH 2 : If we 're playing out a 1930s script , now would be a bad time for long - term investors to get into the stock market .
Actually , if the stock market were to exactly adhere to a 1930s - like script , equities would provide a handsome return over the next five years .
Once again , this insight relies on data from Professor Siegel .
To locate the date during the 1930s that is most analogous to today , he looked for the point at which the stock market after 1929 had -- as is the case today -- declined by around half on a dividend - adjusted and an inflation - adjusted basis .
That point came at the end of 1930 , just 16 months after the August 1929 stock - market top .
( Ironically , of course , the current bear market is just 16 months old too . )
According to Siegel , over the five - year period beginning in January 1931 , the stock market produced an inflation - adjusted total return of 7 % .
That 's right in line with stocks ' long - term average performance , in fact .
To be sure , this myth does have a big grain of truth to it .
Over the first five months of 1931 -- the first five months of this five - year period -- the stock market fell 60 % .
You read that right :
That 's a 60 % drop on top of a 50 % drop over the previous 16 months .
If the stock market today were to suffer a further decline of similar magnitude , the Dow Jones Industrial Average would be trading below the 3,000 level by the end of July .
So , to that extent , it is true to say that , on the assumption we 're playing out a 1930s - like script , now would not be a good time to enter the stock market .
But this truth pertains more to shorter - term investors than to longer - term investors .
According to Siegel , in fact , an investor who entered into the stock market in early 1931 was made whole again by June 1933 , despite digging a 60 % whole in the first five months .
MYTH 3 : The stock market 's recent extraordinary volatility provides a clue to the wild ride that lies ahead if we 're playing out a 1930s - like script .
Actually , undeniably large as it has been , recent volatility does n't even begin to compare to what it was like during the 1930s .
In fact , there were eight calendar months during the decade of the 1930s in which the Dow rose or fell by more than 20 % .
The month with the biggest Dow move was April 1933 , when the Dow rose by 40.2 % .
In August 1932 , furthermore , the Dow rose by 34.8 % .
The biggest monthly losses during that decade were almost as big .
The largest came in September 1931 , when the Dow lost 30.7 % .
These monthly changes dwarf what has been seen in the current bear market .
The biggest calendar month loss so far came last October , when the Dow fell by 14.1 % .
The second biggest came in February , when the Dow fell 11.7 % .
To measure the magnitude of the stock market 's volatility during the 1930s , I calculated the standard deviation of the Dow 's monthly returns on a trailing 36 - month ( or three - year ) basis .
In mid-1933 , this statistic rose to 15.4 % , an extremely high number .
During the current bear market , in contrast , this comparable statistic has never risen above 4.1 % .
The bottom line ?
If we are indeed playing out a 1930s - like script , we have an incredibly wild ride ahead of us .
But for those who have the intestinal fortitude to hang on , such a story would have a surprisingly happy ending .

In developing a rating for fast food companies based on their overall environmental sustainability , has Greenopia stepped into a big pile of redundancy ?
There are some industries that we do n't cover very often , and fast food is definitely one of them .
Although we have in the not - too - distant past talked about some of the big boys , like Carl 's Jr. , Kentucky Fried Chicken , and McDonald 's , it is almost always in a context beyond their bread and butter , as it were : our Carl 's Jr. story was about their green building prototype ; KFC reimagined its packaging to cut waste and costs ; and the Golden Arches announced a plan to cut energy use in its stores by 13 percent .
The reason for our neglect of the fast food biz is simple : much like fossil fuels ( we also have n't covered ExxonMobil much , to my knowledge ) , fast food at its core is not an entirely sustainable industry .
The fast food industry , with a few small - scale exceptions like Pizza Fusion or O'Naturals , is built around large - scale , low - cost , energy - , fuel - and industrial - agriculture - intensive inputs that have a significant impact on the environment and human health .
So color me just a shade skeptical when I read that Greenopia just announced its rankings of the greenest fast food options in the Los Angeles area .
The ranking takes 23 fast food chains in L.A. and rates them on five criteria : sustainability reporting , green building design , supply chain , recycling and takeback programs , and their purchase of green products .
With those guidelines in mind , perhaps it 's unsurprising how the rankings turned out :
In first and second place , the only two fast food joints to earn four green leafs from Greenopia , are Le Pain Quotidien and Pizza Fusion .
From Greenopia 's glowing review of Pizza Fusion :
This is how green is done .
Pizza Fusion tackled an incredible amount of green projects for a food chain .
All of its projects are LEED certified and / or have substantial elements of green building design incorporated in them .
Their pizza is made with organic ingredients and delivered by hybrid delivery vehicles .
Pizza Fusion even goes as far as to have their employees wear organic cotton uniforms .
Finally , and our personal favorite , Pizza Fusion has a take back incentive for their used pizza boxes .
If you return the pizza box , you get a discount on your order .
What a great way to promote recycling and reuse .
Le Pain Quotidien is no slouch either ; the Greenopia editors write : " ... Le Pain Quotidien uses organic and local ingredients in its prepared foods and has incorporated numerous elements of green building design into its stores including reclaimed fixtures and efficient appliances .
Le Pain Quotidien also composts its food waste and uses its spent food oil for biodiesel . "
Rounding out the top five are Burgerville and Evos with 3 leaves each , and Mexican food chain Chipotle with 2 leaves .
It should similarly come as no surprise which companies earned zero leaves : Arby 's , Jack in the Box , Burger King , Domino 's Pizza and seven other chains all scored the big zilch in the ranking .
Check out the full list on Greenopia.com ; if you eat fast food , this is actually a very useful tool .
In addition to the green rankings , each restaurant has a list of average cost , calorie range , and the number of vegetarian and vegan items on the menu .

YouTube suspends JREF , Rational Response , and Atheist Media
YouTube has suspended the accounts of the James Randi Educational Foundation , Rational Response , and Atheist Media .
The rumour floating around is that someone wrote a bot to automatically report all atheist - related YouTube accounts .
We 'll have to see how this plays out .
It would be nice if there was a presumption of innocence at YouTube , but apparently that is n't the case .
Perhaps Vimeo is a better alternative .

Raw quality - wise , Vimeo IS better than YouTube in SD mode — HD still goes to YouTube .
Some background on this : http://torley.com/youtube-gives-vimeo-a-run-for-its-hd-money
Also re : account suspensions , YouTube has n't ever been transparent ( to my recollection ) on what criteria they use .
I think it 's pretty dumb in the purest sense , in that if an account is flagged for questionable content a number of times , it gets knocked off without human intervention .
There 've been times before where I saw some stuff that did n't abide by YouTube 's TOS , and I flagged it .
My one flagging was n't enough , but I pooled together with friends and kept flagging it , and the video disappeared shortly thereafter .

Xiao -
At that point we would be stooping down to their level .
What we need to do is get Google and YouTube to start implementing a peer review board , or have someone look over the actual videos that are apparently problematic .
Yes , it does cause some problems down the line , but then it does n't allow something like this to happen .

Why do n't these clowns piss off to Godtube.com ?
That 's where they belong , anyway .
They do n't like dissenting opinion so they cheat their way to censuring those that oppose their view .
Would n't they be happier just going somewhere they do n't have to hear it take place ?

I 'm not in favor of launching a counter - attack against Christian YouTube accounts .
It might be fair , but it would n't be right , nor would it be good tactics .
What I find most puzzling about YouTube 's policy is that it takes so long for an appeal to be reviewed .
Posted by : Wally Hartshorn | Apr 3 , 2009 6:39:35 AM
Before we start getting all pissed off at Google / Youtube , just remember that is the DMCA thing out there .
Of course , I am not a lawyer , but as I understand it , the DMCA works like this .
If you believe that someone is using your copywritten material outside of Fair Use , you can send a Takedown Notice against the host of the material .
In other words , if I put the song Thriller into music video and hosted it on Youtube , Michael Jackson could come along and demand that it be taken down , and my account canceled .
At that moment , Youtube can do nothing legally - even if it turns out that Michael Jackson is wrong and I 'm using the song in a Fair Use manner , Youtube * must * take down my video and perhaps shut down my account .
But - here 's where things get fun .
Youtube has to let me petition the decision .
I believe ( and please , feel free to call me wrong if I am ) there 's a 30 day review time once I fill out the counter paperwork claiming that " Dude - it was legal .
Restore my account . "
If the media holder ( in this case , Youtube ) determine that no , I was perfectly within my rights , then ta - da - my account is back up .
And from there things can get more legal .
Here 's the big problem .
Suppose that Michael Jackson did n't give a crap .
Or , that I was n't using any copywritten material illegally , and somebody just issued a notice either a ) fraudulently on use ( aka - they knew I was n't abusing copy written material ) , b ) fraudulently on ownership ( aka - they claimed to represent Michael Jackson 's legal interests when they had no claim at all ) , they can get fined .
Hard .
Because when you sign that claim , you file that claim under penalty of perjury .
And as Scooter Libby and Clinton and others know - perjury is serious shit .
You can go to jail for that , and pay massive fines .
So , I 'd just let the legal system work its way out .
If it * is* a bunch of creationist douchenozzles using the DMCA to claim copyright in an illegal manner , like that Youtube user VenomFangX ( PCS ) who had to apologize to save his ass from being hauled to jail .
If it 's something else , then we can get all upset .
Until then , let 's just stay cool , keep our eyes on things - then get pissed if there 's something hinky going on .

John Hummel - correct in all the main points - should also point out that if MJ reported a violation but had n't considered Fair Use , he has committed an offence EVEN if the video does n't come under Fair Use - obviously if it does come under fair use he has also committed an offence unless there are extenuating circumstance as to why ( when they were considering if it was fair use ) they missed that it was indeed Fair Use

Like the virus in 28 Days Later , Time Warner 's internet - strangling broadband caps is spreading all over the country .
They 've got brand new pricing plans too and they yep , they suck .
Let 's look .

The old cap scheme was pretty limited , only going up to a max of 40 GB .
Now they 've got a whole Skittles bag of caps .
Here 's how Time Warner Cable 's COO Landel Hobbs breaks it down , all while breaking out the familiar warning that the internet is about to die if you do n't limit your porn consumption to two times a day — MAX :
AT&T : The Internet Will Explode in 2010 South Park already showed us how to fix the internet , but what really struck me was Randy 's speech Read more
Internet demand is rising at a rate that could outpace capacity within a few years .
According to industry analysts , the infrastructure may not be able to accommodate the explosion of online content by 2012 .
This could result in Internet brownouts .

• 1GB with 768 kbps downstream for $ 15 / month with $ 2 / GB overcharges
• 10 , 20 , 40 and 60 GB will go with Roadrunner Lite , Basic , Standard and Turbo packages , respectively , and maintain the same pricing .
Overage is $ 1/ GB .
• 100GB will be the new Road Runner ... Turbo ( I 'm not sure why there are two Turbo packages ) which is 10 M bps downstream and 1 M bps upstream for $ 75 / month .
This is still an order of magnitude more restrictive than AT&T and Comcast , who have caps of 150GB and 250GB , respectively .
• A 50 Mbps / 5 Mbps down / up speed tier is coming for $ 100 / month when they launch DOCSIS 3.0 .
I 'd expect this in FiOS - competitive markets first .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 " 8 K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Overages are capped at $ 75 a month , meaning $ 150 a month gets you unlimited internet with the Turbo package — or really , you could just get a lower package and use as much as you want and pay less .
The only real consideration is speed .
GigaOM astutely notes that $ 150 / month for unlimited internet is the exact amount Time Warner would need to pull in to make the same amount of money if you killed the cable box and switched to watching all of your video online — as we 've long crowed that much of this is about their fear of internet video .

It 's notable that Time Warner 's not rolling this out anywhere Verizon has FiOS deployed — where in certain markets , for under $ 150 a month , you can get 50 M bps downstream and 20 M bps upstream ( yes , that 's more upstream than downstream in any of Time Warner 's packages ) and it 's totally unlimited .
Oh , competition , why can't you be everywhere and save the internet ?
I 'd like to hope we do n't have to rely on legislators like Eric Massa in NY to do it , since more bad than good would probably come out of the government getting involved .

CSTs - Concrete Syntax Trees ( a.k.a. Parse Trees ) and ASTs - Abstract Syntax Trees ( a.k.a. Syntax Trees ) are two terms that come up a lot in compiler & parser nomenclature .
However , it is not always understood what is the difference between the two , because they are closely related .
In this article I attempt to explain the difference , at least for myself .
Concrete Syntax Trees CSTs are a representation of grammars in a tree - like form .
Here 's a definition from the Dragon book :
A parse tree pictorially shows how the start symbol of a grammar derives a string in the language .
That is , the CST is a one - to - one mapping from the grammar to a tree - form .
An example will make this easier to understand .
Consider parsing the C statement return a + 2 ; .
Following the ANSI C grammar defined in K&R2 and appearing in its YACC representation in various places on the web , the parse tree of this statement looks thus :
And this is not even the complete tree .
The path between conditional_expression and additive_expression goes through the sequence : logical_or_expression , logical_and_expression , inclusive_or_expression , exclusive_or_expression , and _expression , equality _expression , relational_expression and shift_expression .
I kid you not !
There are two more nodes between unary_expression and constant as well .
Indeed , this is a very formal representation that strictly shows how the parser understands the statement return a + 2 ; , but it is not a very useful representation to work with , is it ?
This is where ASTs come in .
Abstract Syntax Trees ASTs are simplified syntactic representations of the source code , and they 're most often expressed by the data structures of the language used for implementation .
Quoting from the Dragon book again : Abstract syntax trees , or simply syntax trees , differ from parse trees because superficial distinctions of form , unimportant for translation , do not appear in syntax trees .
ASTs do n't show the whole syntactic clutter , but represent the parsed string in a structured way , discarding all information that may be important for parsing the string , but is n't needed for analyzing it .
Here 's an AST for return a + 2 ; , as generated by pycparser :
Looks like something much more manageable , does n't it ?
Note that an AST conveys information in the internal nodes as well , and not only at the leaves .
So , instead of going through a long list of expression nodes just to represent the type of the expression , a simple op attribute in a BinOp node does the job .
Also , the AST does n't hold syntactic nodes like ' ; ' , because these are useless for analysis .
ASTs are usually the last product of the front - end of a compiler .
They represent the structure of the code in a compact and useful way that facilitates convenient analysis and further processing .
From a CST to an AST Parsers usually either construct ASTs directly in their actions , or first construct CSTs and then convert them to ASTs .
It 's interesting to note that CSTs are trivial to build once you have a grammar written , and some tools will build it automatically .
After all , a CST is just another representation of the grammar .
But beware of tools that promise to automatically build ASTs - this can work in a general sense only for trivial grammars , and what you 'll get is most likely a CST rather than an AST .
For some languages , it is far from trivial to construct an AST from a CST .
A good example is the syntax of type declarations in C , which is known to be tricky .
Consider the declaration int* arp [ 5 ] ; - an array of 5 pointers to int .
Here 's its parse tree , according to the ANSI C grammar : Clutter aside , there are two other problems here that make analysis difficult :
Note that the pointer node is actually above the array , so working through the CST directly , it can be thought that we 've declared a pointer to an array !
This is the " reverse logic of declarations " problem of C .
Where is the array name ?
It 's buried deep down in the tree , which is n't very convenient .
Because of these problems , it would be very difficult to work directly with a CST for C , without converting it to AST .
pycparser converts to AST on the fly ( without generating an explicit CST ) , and here 's the AST that represents int* arp [ 5 ] ; : Both problems are solved .
The pointer is now clearly below the array , and the variable name was raised to the top - most node .
This AST can be just read out loud to produce the correct interpretation of the declaration : " arp is an array of 5 pointers to int " .

The financial events that have taken place in the U.S. and around the world over the last few months are , in many ways , no surprise .
In a September , 2008 financial seminar ( http://www.truthpublishing.com/Heal…), I publicly predicted the majority of the big trends you ’re seeing unfold right now :
The wave of commercial bankruptcies , the second round of bailout money , the dangerous creation of new money by the Fed and a continued weakening of both the housing market and the stock market .
Some people are trying to save America , and others are actively working to destroy it and eliminate the existing Federal Reserve altogether , defaulting to a single , global “ Fed ” organization .
These are all playing out like clockwork , driving the U.S. toward financial collapse that now seems irreversible .
There is one new element in all this , however , that has emerged in the last month or so , and I ’d like to share that with you in this article .
Over the last few months , I ’ve kept in touch with some extremely well - connected individuals who have been cluing me in on what ’s really happening behind the scenes in the world of global finance .
For obvious reasons , these people shall go unnamed , but what they ’re now telling me is that the economic meltdown is merely a means to an end .
It is being done deliberately , they say , at the very highest levels to achieve a well - planned outcome .
What outcome is that ?
Global rule over all banking , of course .
How to take over the world ’s finances
Imagine an international Federal Reserve that creates and controls the money supply for the entire world .
The centralization of financial power into the hands of the few would be unprecedented .
What power the Fed wields over the United States today , a " global Fed " could soon wield across the entire world .
Achieving such a power grab , however , is no small task .
Nations will not voluntarily surrender power over their currencies …
Unless there is a crisis !
In a crisis scenario , nations will give up practically anything — freedoms , finances , and yes , even their own currencies if it means avoiding certain economic disaster .
If there ’s one thing that the world has learned from 9/11 , it ’s that the best way to grab power from the People is to either engineer a disaster or piggyback on one that occurs on its own .
When faced with the fear of annihilation , the People of any nation will not merely surrender their freedoms and finances , they will beg to turn them over to any apparent " authority " who promises a solution .
( For those who follow David Icke , this is described by him as the " Problem – Reaction – Solution " approach to mass manipulation . )
From this , then , it is rather obvious that the best way to grab control over world currencies and establish one global " Fed " money authority is to engineer a global financial disaster that threatens the stability of the entire global banking system .
As stability collapses and life savings are lost , it ’s only a matter of time before the riots begin and blood really starts running in the streets .
It is in this moment that the global elite will appear on television screens , as if delivered by God himself , promising an end to all the suffering if only the leading nations of the world will agree to surrender their own currencies and adopt a new , global currency operated by the new " International Fed " ( which wo n’t actually be called that , mind you ) .
The battle for the future of America is under way right now
With all this in mind , we are faced with a rather sobering scenario .
Even though there are many people within the U.S. power structure who are no doubt attempting to save the U.S. economy and prevent outright collapse , there are almost certainly far more powerful people involved in this game who have as their agenda the creation of a global currency controller .
And the rise of that institution necessitates the economic downfall of nations like the U.S. and the U.K. , to name just two .
So there ’s a tug of war going on : Some people are trying to save America , and others are actively working to destroy it and eliminate the existing Federal Reserve altogether , defaulting to a single , global " Fed " organization .
It ’s important to note that regardless of which side of this battle we ’re talking about , none of these power elite are looking out for YOU , the People .
This is all just a high - level territorial chess match in which you and I are the lowly pawns .
Destroying a nation in order to rule it
What ’s interesting in all this is that if you believe this particular explanation , it means there are elite power brokers in this world who are so arrogant and greedy that they will actively risk the destruction of an entire nation ’s economy just to take control over its financial resources in the long run .
If all this sounds familiar , that ’s because this is exactly how military warfare works , too :
The aggressor invades a country , bombs it to rubble , then takes control over it in order to capture and control the long - term economic benefits and resources produced by that country .
( Iraq , anyone ? )
It ’s also exactly what drove Hitler ’s mechanized army eastward into Soviet territory in World War II .
The battle at Stalingrad was not merely a Soviet victory over German military units , it was the end of Germany ’s last desperate attempt to expropriate the lucrative oil fields needed to keep its war machine running .
The point is that , throughout history , power - hungry madmen have always demonstrated a willingness to destroy practically anything ( families , cities , nations ) in order to get what they wanted .
The United States is n’t innocent on this front , either : Read your history on the Dresden bombings to see a dark chapter of U.S. history involving outright genocide on the part of the allies ( http://www.rense.com/general19/flam…).
Warfare , of course , can take many forms .
The traditional " bombs and bullets " form of warfare is simply the most easily recognizable form of taking over a country .
It is by no means the most efficient form .
From an economic perspective , it is far more intelligent to take over a nation while leaving its physical infrastructure intact so that all the slave workers can get back to work as quickly as possible after the war , producing new gains for the new controllers .
By one interpretation of world events , America now seems to be in the midst of an economic war that may actually be attempting to crush America ’s currency and economy in the hopes that the nation will surrender both to a new global financial authority .
The " New World Bank " would be the benefactor of all this .
What does it mean for you ?
[ efoods ]
My predictions along these lines have been consistent : Reduce your spending , get out of debt and convert your soon - to - be - worthless dollars into something real that can out - last any currency collapse .
Some of those " real " things include land , gold , storable food and even your own personal education .
A great many people have also chosen to purchase and store firearms , which are likely to become extremely valuable in an Obama gun confiscation scenario .
For the record , although I ’m not a gun advocate by any means , there is no doubt in my mind that gun confiscation only results in the GOOD guys turning in their guns while the BAD guys keep theirs .
In virtually every case around the world , gun confiscation essentially translates into a massive de-arming of the population and an unleashing of either armed criminals or armed criminal governments .
In any gun confiscation scenario , those who still have their firearms will find them becoming instantly valuable .
On the dollar front , there is little doubt in my mind that a collapse ( or abandonment ) of the U.S. currency is inevitable .
The most likely scenario emerging right now is that once the economic crisis gets so bad in the U.S. that people are rioting in the streets , Obama will cave in to a new world bank authority and , in doing so , abandon the U.S. dollar .
If this unfolds , it means the U.S. dollar will be " traded in " for a new world currency of some sort , and in that exchange , U.S. dollar holders will maddeningly discover ( surprise ! ) that they have lost anywhere from 60 percent to 90 percent of their purchasing power .
This is the evil genius of the whole plan :
Sure , you can trade in all your dollars , but for how much spending power ?
The answer , of course , is whatever they want to pay you .
Because if all you hold are dollars , you do n’t have much choice in the matter , do you ?
That ’s why diversifying out of the dollar right now is so important for anyone who does n’t want to lose most of their savings .
I ’ve covered numerous strategies for this in my course Health Ranger LIVE : Health Preparedness and Financial Protection ( http://www.truthpublishing.com/Heal…).
It ’s worth noting that an ounce of gold buys you the same goods and services today that it bought fifty years ago .
Gold always holds its value , no matter what happens to paper currencies .
Who can you really believe in all this ?
As you ponder all this information , keep in mind that historically , in every economic downturn , there have always been politicians and economists who pronounced the end of the downturn practically every week as the markets churned lower and lower .
Nobody involved in the financial system ( banks , lawmakers , Presidents , etc. ) can actually admit the truth for fear of causing runaway financial panic .
Hence the fact that the Federal Reserve outright refuses to name which banks it has funded with bailout money .
The very mention of a bank on such a list would likely cause an overnight collapse of the bank itself , so the Fed remains silent in its secrecy .
( http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?…)
The fragility of this whole system should clue you in on just how bad things really are .
When the system is so close to cracking that the Fed does n’t even dare name which banks it is helping , that ’s probably a big , red warning sign that it ’s time to exit that system and move your resources to something more stable .
The bottom line ?
Do n’t believe any of the typical authorities on this issue .
They all have a stake in keeping the People in the dark while they maneuver their own financial chess pieces around in total secrecy .
The only way to not be financially harmed by all this is to make sure you ’re not left holding a bag of worthless green paper when the U.S.
Treasury merry - go - round music comes to a stop .
And that day is coming sooner that I previously thought .
A year ago , I thought the U.S. dollar might survive another decade or two .
But now , after watching the Bush bailout followed by the similarly insane Obama bailout , I believe the U.S. dollar will be either declared worthless or abandoned well inside of ten years , and perhaps as early as three .
Only time will tell , of course , and there are a lot of variations that could delay or even reverse all this in the short - term , but in the long - term there ’s no denying the fate of the world ’s largest debtor nation : America will eventually be forced to abandon its currency , which is much the same as declaring national bankruptcy .
Do n’t get caught in this financial trap , friends .
Trade your dollars for something real while you still can .
And if you have the chance to do so , establish your own income stream that can not be taken away from you .
Job losses will continue to mount , and entire industries could come tumbling down before this is all over .
We are not out of this yet .
Not even close .

Beware the vegans ! /
The evil gay agenda is nearly complete .
Who poses the next horrible , godless threat ?
This much we know :
We gotta have an enemy .
It 's just a basic , nation - defining requirement .
We must , as a culture , as a people , always find some sort of scapegoat upon which to blame all our ills .
It 's just how we roll .
We have our standards .
It needs to be a truly nefarious threat , some unsavory group whose members , through covert recruitment techniques and / or by flaunting what they like to do to each other with their genitalia , are secretly trying to undermine the American way of life , destroy families , prey upon ' tweens and turn our children into heathen pervert socialists who want to smoke Cuban cigars , wear sequined turbans and marry livestock .
You know the type ?
Of course you do .
Communists had their turn .
Feminists .
Hippies .
Then came the evil homosexual people , with their famous , much - lauded agenda to destroy the holy sanctimony of Christian marriage via encouraging girls to smoke and listen to punk rock , teaching interior decorating to straight boys and convincing innocent church pastors and Republican senators to fellate them in cheap motel rooms .
The horror !
But no longer .
Proposition 8 and The Ugly Mormon Uprising of 2008 notwithstanding , the gays have nearly completed their vile mission .
They are everywhere .
They are almost normal .
Gay marriage , the last civil right , is now less an impossible dream and far more a foregone conclusion .
It 's merely a matter of waiting for bitter old homophobes to die off .
Which leaves us a gaping hole , an urgent question in need of an answer .
Who 's next ?
Whom will the pseudo - moralists in America accuse of trying to convert our innocent children to their depraved ways ?
After all , it 's only through clearly identifying those things we hate and fear and do n't understand that we become better parents , Americans , Christians .
Was n't that Jesus ' message ?
Damn right it was .
Will it be , say , the polyamorists ?
Vegetarians ?
Yoga teachers ?
Polyamorist vegetarian yoga teachers who like anal sex and Ecstasy and really strong coffee ?
We must ponder .
We must find out .
Some possibilities :
The rich .
An obvious choice , given the current climate , the witch hunts , the fact that gaggles of furious citizens are actually picketing outside the homes of millionaire AIG jackals , as if the latter were wearing puppy - fur trench coats and the former were screaming and hurling fake blood outside Neiman Marcus .
Weird .
But it 's also a very bizarre choice , insofar as hating undeserved wealth is a bit like hating your nose to spite your face .
Protesting the dark art of making lots and lots of money in the rigged capitalist system is downright un-American , is it not ?
It 's all sorts of fun hypocrisy .
Put it this way :
Offer any one of those protesters $ 5 million to walk away and never come back , and watch how fast their ire vanishes .
In other words , we can't truly loathe and fear what we all secretly want to become .
Or can we ?
Vegans .
Let 's see :
Often self - righteous ?
Check .
Preachy ?
Check .
Like to gather in suspicious little clusters and share weird tips about the best ways to cook kale as they hand out flyers at the New Life Expo and smoke lots of pot and twirl flaming Hula Hoops at Burning Man ?
Check .
Plus , they can be sorta whimpery , frail , taste like kombucha .
Could they take over ?
Nah .
Fearing a vegan revolution is like fearing a takeover by Muppet squirrels .
Plus , they actually do have very good intentions and can be wonderfully nice , happy people , despite being no fun at barbeques and always bringing that weird seitan dish to the potluck .
Plus , the lack of animal protein in their diets means they have little muscle mass and brittle bones and , if you have to , you can snap them like twigs .
Buddhists / Hindus .
Were you thinking Muslims ?
You 're so retro .
Fearing militant Islam is so 2005 .
" The Muslims are coming ! " hysteria is now the sole domain of frothy right - wing conspiracy nutballs who think Obama is a terrorist mastermind and " The Audacity of Hope " is secret code for " Allah is going to eat your face . "
No , the real threat is , of course , the supposedly peaceful , ancient , non-dualistic philosophies of Hinduism and Buddhism .
What with China and India growing like demons and stealing all our precious water , oil , sunlight and the Internet bandwidth we desperately need for porn , it 's just a matter of time until the Eightfold Path sneaks into your bedroom at night and whispers that all life is just a silly illusion and you should breathe through your eyeballs .
Buddha lunchboxes !
Shiva shampoo !
Zen liquor !
Yoga in every mall !
Oh crap .
It 's already here !
We are so doomed .
Journalists .
I know what you 're thinking .
" What ?
You mean those pale little writer people who never go outside ?
How can they possibly be a threat ? "
Oh you poor misinformed peasant .
As newspapers shut down and thousands of talented reporters are ruthlessly laid off across the country , these underappreciated scribes could easily regroup and rise again to undermine the very foundations of the new , bite - sized , malformed Twitter / ADD info society .
In short :
They 're a threat because they might try to infiltrate the dominant OMG paradigm and make us smarter and more informed about the world around us .
And who the hell wants that ?
Not the GOP or the church , that 's for sure .
Old people .
Oh my God , of course !
Generation Boomer is just about to swarm into retirement , destroy Social Security , ruin Medicare and collectively forget where they parked their golf cart .
Their nefarious agenda : black socks with sandals , " Mama 's Family " reruns on prime - time , and turning the entire country into south Florida .
Watch in horror as grandma lures your children into compliance with stories about long - play records and Pontiac Trans Ams and giving blowjobs to the Grateful Dead .
Our country 's fallen and it can't get up !
Babies .
That 's right , I said it .
Endlessly needy , ruthlessly selfish , utterly self - absorbed , spreading like a virus , these resource - sucking drool factories are clearly a massive drain on every true American value , like porn , toxic Glade air fresheners and prescription medication .
Think they 're far too cute and helpless to have an agenda ?
Wrong .
Their evil plot is painfully clear :
To induce guilt , mountains and mountains of guilt .
Their very existence is an excruciating reminder of just how horribly we 've f--ked up the planet for their generation , and how lousy we should feel about it .
Can they be stopped ?
Shall we make the planet a better place so they quit all that damn screaming ?
Nah , screw it .
Smart people .
And now , the most sinister threat of all .
Is there a darker menace to the American way of life , to Christian panic and Republican clenchiness and widespread hysteria , than lots and lots of calm intelligence ?
After all , knowledge is power .
Knowledge is the ability to see past the knee - jerk reactionaries , the sexual panic , the shrill , God - thumping nonsense .
Knowledge is , therefore , evil like candy .
It might be too late .
The disturbing agenda of President Obama , already one of the most calmly intelligent humans in U.S. political history , is beginning to have a truly nightmarish effect , as he inspires millions to take more responsibility , not merely for their lives , but for their choices , for their kids ' future , for the health of their very own brains .
He is , in short , well on his way to destroying the very ideas that made this country great : insularity , fear of the Other , gluttony , lousy grammar and generally not knowin ' much ' bout nuthin ' .

Posted on 05 April 2009 by Quaid
Hi all .
Quaid here , introducing you to a very strange young man .
His name is Colonel Mandrake , and he ’s here to blow your mind with some out - of - character high - brow musings on our favorite Mexican director , Robert Rodriguez ( as well as politics and why paradise ai n’t what it used to be ) .
So without further ado , say hello to ColonelMandrake …
Gregori Rasputin…Cassandra… Tiresius … Rodriguez…?
Move over seers and oracles ; there ’s a new kid in town .
When widespread violence erupted in Mexico , one man had seen it coming .
P.S. –he makes action films .
In his prescient , epic Once Upon A Time
In Mexico Robert Rodriguez foretold a future where the drug cartels were within reach of seizing control of the Mexican government .
Fast forward and see the prophecy fulfilled .
Mexico has come to resemble Columbia or Afghanistan , rife with factional violence fueled by drug money .
The body count in Mexico has topped five thousand with the potential to double in the second year of fighting .
While these statistics are staggering , they merely speak to an underlying crisis of confidence in the Mexican Government that has allowed alternate power structures to assume its place .
And in a country with a strong history of patronage structures operating as the defacto government , drug cartels are a natural fit .
The success of America ’s war on drugs in Columbia has created an opening in the world of drug trafficking , and Mexico is clearly making a bid to be the new top dog .
Its proximity to America ’s drug users , and therefore markets , put it in an elite class along with several Caribbean nations .
Rampant corruption among Mexican police , who treat kickbacks as an expected part of their salaries , has allowed the drug trade to proliferate over years .
Previously , there was a ceiling in terms of the total volume of narcotics traveling through the region .
With Columbia slacking in its production , the market has shifted to its next logical producer .
Throw in tons of armaments brought across the border from the United States due to its cache of weapons and loose gun laws , and what you get is a system of ‘ roided out street gangs engaged in the mother of all turf wars – with the government .
This is a perfect storm that would make even Wolfgang Peterson salivate .
And it all adds up to the drug base of Latin America relocating to Mexico .
Now Mexico is finding itself in a role it has n’t been accustomed to in nearly one hundred years –that of a contagious source of violence and upheaval that alarms its neighbors .
The passing of the anniversary of the Mexican Revolution augers poorly considering this milestone has coincided every century with yet another revolution .
Remember Pancho Villa ?
You know … that guy Antonio Banderas played in another action film ?
Yeah , that ’s right .
He was involved in the last revolution , so the actor ’s casting in both pics is an inspired act of genius .
At the very least this turn of events grants OUATIM an extended shelf - life and provides the mother of all inside jokes to those in the know .
As the Cartels arm themselves with 50 Caliber sniper rifles , anti-tank rockets , appropriated military hardware , and stolen munitions that may next reappear as IEDs , something appears dreamlike about it all .
I half expect Bob Rodriguez to end the take and watch the carnage vanish like on oh so many of his digital special effects .
Andy Dufresne could return to Zijuatenjo ( an epicenter of the violence ) and all would be well .
I am loath to admit that such a return to normalcy is just not in the cards at the moment .
But we can all draw succor from Señor Rodriguez ’s words of inspiration , “ Are you a Mexi - CAN … or a Mexi - CAN’T ? ”
So get in there , Mexi-CANs , and take back your county .
And to the Mexican Chuck Norris , Danny Trejo , I entreat you – Mexico needs you and your throwing knives to dispense justice .
Personally , I sleep better at night knowing that OUATIM ended with the cartels losing and the people retaking their country .
I will take Rodriguez at his word .
Though if he was right about this one , then maybe I should n’t have laughed at those Enquirer stories about vampires and alien faculties …
" I call on all governments to join with the United States and the community of law - abiding nations in prohibiting , investigating , and prosecuting all acts of torture ... " - Official proclamation by President Bush , June 26 , 2003 .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
First the good news : bird flu is becoming less deadly .
Now the bad : scientists fear that this is the very thing that could make the virus more able to cause a pandemic that would kill hundreds of millions of people .
This paradox – emerging from Egypt , the most recent epicentre of the disease – threatens to increase the disease 's ability to spread from person to person by helping it achieve the crucial mutation in the virus which could turn it into the greatest plague to hit Britain since the Black Death .
Last year the Government identified the bird - flu virus , codenamed H5N1 , as the biggest threat facing the country – with the potential to kill up to 750,000 Britons .
The World Health Organisation is to back an investigation into a change in the pattern of the disease in Egypt , the most seriously affected country outside Asia .
Although infections have been on the rise this year , with three more reported last week , they have almost all been in children under the age of three , while 12 months ago it was mainly adults and older children who were affected .
And the infections have been much milder than usual ; the disease normally kills more than half of those affected ; all of the 11 Egyptians so far infected this year are still alive .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Experts say that these developments make it more likely that the virus will spread .
Ironically , its very virulence has provided an important safeguard .
It did not get much chance to infect other people when it killed its victims swiftly , but now it has much more of a chance to mutate and be passed on .
The WHO fears that this year 's rise in infections among small children , without similar cases being seen in older people , raises questions about whether adults are being infected but not falling ill , so acting as symptomless carriers of the disease .
Its investigation , due to start this summer , will see if this is happening by testing the blood of people who may have been in contact with infected birds , but who have not themselves become sick .
John Jabbour , who works with WHO in Cairo , told Reuters last week : " There is something strange happening in Egypt .
Why in children now and not in adults ?
We need to see if there are sub-clinical cases in the community . "
He added that if the research did find such cases , they would be the first to be discovered anywhere in the world .
Though he stressed that there was still no evidence of the disease passing from person to person , other experts are also becoming alarmed .
Professor Robert Webster , of St Jude Children 's Research Hospital in Memphis , Tennessee – who is the world 's leading authority on the disease – told The Independent on Sunday that , while he himself had not seen firm data , the WHO in Egypt was raising " a very , very important issue " which should receive " maximum attention " .
He added : " I hope to hell they are wrong .
If this damn thing becomes less pathogenic , it will become more transmissible . "
And Professor John Oxford , of Queen Mary , University of London , said that any evidence that H5N1 was becoming less deadly would be serious , as the greatest cause for concern was the disease 's ability to spread .
Even a much less virulent strain of the virus could result in a devastating pandemic .
Studies show that an outbreak that killed as few as 5 per cent of those it infected could still cause hundreds of millions of deaths around the world .
Jose Reyes Will Be Happy To Speak With You In The Language Of Your Choice : Video
Spring Training is a great place for fans to get to know their favorite players .
In a relaxed setting with fewer people around , players let their guard down and converse with fans .
Unfortunately for some fans , they ca n’t handle the fact that some of these players , like Jose Reyes of the New York Mets , might speak another language .
Prior to his departure from Port St. Lucie , Florida , the Mets’ Spring Training home , for the World Baseball Classic , Jose Reyes was talking with a friend in Spanish at about the same speed that he runs .
A woman got increasingly agitated with Reyes , twice saying , “ Now we ’re going to practice English . ”
Presumably she will not be attending the Jose Reyes Spanish Academy any time soon .
Jose responded with a cleanly spoken “ How are you ? ” in English to the woman , then went right back to speaking in Spanish with his friend .
Ooh , dissed .
Do n’t worry though , Lady , Lou Dobbs supports you completely in your attempt to have everyone speak in a language you understand .

S&R has been following Newt Gingrich ’s lies about energy and climate since last year when he pushed the “ Drill Here .
Drill Now. Pay Less . ” lie in response to last summer ’s oil price woes .
On Friday , Gingrich appeared as a minority witness , on a panel all by himself , before the House Energy and Commerce Committee – Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment hearings on the Waxman - Markey American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 ( ACES ) .
S&R has reviewed Gingrich ’s prepared remarks for today ’s hearing and has determined that Gingrich is still up to his old tricks of lying to Congress and the American people .
What follows is a series of key quotes from Gingrich ’s prepared remarks that illustrate his deceptions .
Gingrich ’s claimOur current energy import strategy is entirely a function of our own government ’s anti- domestic energy policies .
The United States government blocks the development of new energy sources and inhibits the use of existing energy and then explains that we will have a shortage of energy .
It is an artificial , government imposed shortage not a naturally occurring phenomenon .
This is a gross distortion of reality .
Our import strategy is mostly a function of the capitalistic nature of our oil industry , not of domestic energy policy .
When oil prices were high , the oil industry lobbied hard ( and largely successfully ) for drilling subsidies and the opening of the outer continental shelf ( OCS ) .
But now that oil prices have fallen well off their peak , oil companies are stopping their domestic drilling in order to focus on more profitable foreign sources .
Put simply , oil companies and low oil prices are the reason that there ’s not much domestic energy production .
Gingrich ’s claim
Make no mistake about it :
This bill amounts to a $ 1 - 2 trillion energy tax levied on a struggling economy , which is destructive and wrong .
Carbon capitalism is not a tax .
Gingrich is repeating a GOP talking - point that declares capitalism is taxation in the hopes of scaring people into believing that black is white and the sun rises in the west and sets in the east .
In addition , Gingrich did n’t even read the entire Waxman - Markey bill and admits to that fact before even starting to read his written testimony ( The statement is at about 2 minutes in the CSpan video of Gingrich ’s testimony .
He stopped at around page 230 of a 600 + page legislative draft – when the portion about carbon capitalism starts on page 322 .
Gingrich ’s claim [ E ] xpect utility bill increases up to $ 3,128 per year per household .
This is a lie for a number of reasons .
The most important is that the MIT study from which this wrong number was calculated was conducted in 2007 , and paper author Dr. John Reilly has not updated the conclusions for the details of of the Waxman - Markey ACES draft legislation that Gingrich was testifying about .
Furthermore , Dr. Reilly had the following to say at Climate Progress : “ it is inappropriate to draw conclusions on the costs of Waxman - Markey . ”
After all , ACES has a number of cost - containment provisions specifically designed to prevent revenue gained from carbon capitalism such as offsets , public investment in energy efficiency , and an unreasonably low estimate of fuel prices for 2030 between $ 2.10 and $ 2.40 , while the EIA estimated in it ’s 2007 Annual Energy Outlook that gasoline prices would be $ 3.20 in 2030 .
It also does n’t help that the wrong GOP number would only be correct if you turned all that money into a giant bonfire .
Using an out - of - date study to tarnish current legislation is a misrepresentation of the MIT study at best , and an attempt to mislead Congress and the American people at worst .
Gingrich ’s claim According to the Heritage Foundation , the cost of cap - and - trade , with even only a small percentage of allocations being auctioned , would be $ 1.9 trillion .
While Gingrich is accurately reporting what the Heritage Foundation ’s study found , Heritage has a history of misrepresenting economic data and faulty logic as applied to climate , and as such their analysis can not be trusted .
The EPA has analyzed the carbon capitalism portions of the ACES draft and found that the total cost to the national economy is only $ 22 billion in 2015 and between $ 54 and $ 64 billion in 2030 .
The increase in household energy cost ( excluding gasoline ) over a reference projection for “ business as usual ” is 9 % , or approximately $ 200 per year .
In addition , the EPA analysis contains a literature review at the end that points out that the Heritage study does n’t even define the baseline from which it projects the supposed $ 1.9 trillion , making the results of the analysis and the underlying assumptions impossible to verify .
Gingrich ’s claim
In a recent paper for the Tax Foundation , Andrew Chamberlain concludes that the costs of this energy tax would be “ disproportionately borne by low - income households , those under age 25 and over 75 years , those in Southern states , and single parents with dependent children . ”
The effects of energy price increases on struggling households would be a serious concern if it were n’t for one very important fact : everyone who studies carbon capitalism is aware of this problem and so writing legislation and / or regulations to correct for the disparity will actually be quite simple .
In other words , this is a non-issue and an attempt at fear mongering .
Gingrich ’s claim A recent estimate from the Tax Foundation shows that cap - and - trade could cost America 965,000 jobs , and reduce economic output by $ 136 billion per year .
This is n’t a false claim by Gingrich so much as it ’s a false claim by the Tax Foundation repeated by Gingrich .
However , economist Kristen Sheeran , Ph.D. , of St. Mary ’s College of Maryland , has addressed this directly : “ [ The Tax Foundation ] report assumes that in a cap - and - trade system , there are no carbon revenues recycled back to households to offset the impacts of higher energy prices … .
[ A ] cap - and - trade system where all permits are auctioned will generate a revenue stream that can be recycled back to households in these ways .
This is well established in the literature , and the Tax Foundation report makes no reference to this literature at all . ” ( quote via 1Sky ) .
Gingrich ’s claim The United States government failed to regulate Wall Street correctly , and the result has been trillions of dollars of taxpayer money to clean up the mess that politicians and bureaucrats created .
The U.S. government did fail to regulate Wall Street properly , but to claim that “ politicians and bureaucrats ” created the problem is a lie .
In fact , a number of economists suggest that one of the men most directly responsible for regulatory failures of Wall Street was former GOP Senator Phil Gramm , author of the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act of 1999 that overturned many of the financial regulations that had maintained financial stability since 1933 .
Gingrich ’s claim Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were charged with managing mortgages , and in 2008 we saw a collapse of the United States housing market .
This is a lie that the GOP has stated repeatedly – and that S&R has exposed repeatedly .
See the links for a more detailed deconstruction of the lie itself , but put simply , deregulation of the financial system was the cause of the housing market bubble and subsequent meltdown , not the number of mortgages insured by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and economic data supports this conclusion .
Gingrich ’s claim
The first good thing in it is a provision that restricts the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) from regulating carbon , which the EPA is currently positioning itself to do .
This would be a power grab of staggering proportions ….
This is a lie .
The Supreme Court of the United States decided on April 2 , 2007 in Massachussets et al v. Environmental Protection Agency et al that the “ EPA has statutory authority to regulate emission of such gases ” due to the the fact that the definition “ includes ‘ any air pollution agent … , including any physical , chemical , … substance … emitted into … the ambient air … , ’ § 7602 ( g ) ( emphasis added ) — embraces all airborne compounds of whatever stripe .
Moreover , carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are undoubtedly ‘ physical [ and ] chemical … substance[s ] . ' ”
In addition , the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the EPA could choose not to regulate : “ Under the [ Clean Air ]
Act ’s clear terms , EPA can avoid promulgating regulations only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether they do . ”
In other words , the EPA not only has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) , the Clean Air Act requires that the EPA regulate GHGs if they ’re a public health hazard via the effects of climate disruption .
When Congress requires that the EPA act on a pollutant , then it ’s false to claim that following the law is a “ power grab of staggering proportions . ”
Gingrich ’s claim Before anyone gives the Department of Energy sweeping new powers they should consider the absolute failure of the Department of Energy to keep its 2003 commitment to build an innovative “ green coal ” pilot project [ FutureGen ] by 2008 .
The FutureGen program was canceled in 2008 by the Department of Energy ( DoE ) .
However , it ’s interesting to point out that the failure Gingrich is complaining about happened under President George W. Bush .
Painting the Obama Administration ’s DoE with the same brush as the Bush era DoE is inaccurate at best .
Newt Gingrich was also caught in a bind by Representative Inslee when the latter pointed out that only two years ago , Gingrich had been a strong proponent of cap - and - trade :
Media Matters also has some interesting quotes further supporting Inslee ’s point .
In his testimony before Congress , Newt Gingrich did what he always does – distorted facts , manipulated data , proved himself a hypocrite , and outright lied .
If this was the best that the minority of the House Energy and Commerce Committee – Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment could do , then the draft version of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 is well on its way to becoming part of the U.S. Code .
These days , it 's routine for businesses to fail , get rescued by the government , and then continue to fail .
But ethanol , which survives only because of its iron lung of subsidies and mandates , is a special case .
Naturally , the industry is demanding even more government life support .
Corn ethanol producers -- led by Wesley Clark , the retired general turned chairman of a new biofuels lobbying outfit called Growth Energy -- want the Obama Administration to make their guaranteed market even larger .
Recall that the 2007 energy bill requires refiners to mix 36 billion gallons into the gasoline supply by 2022 .
The quotas , which ratchet up each year , are arbitrary , but evidently no one in Congress wondered what might happen if the economy did n't cooperate .
Now the recession is hammering demand for gas .
The Energy Information Administration notes that U.S. consumption fell nearly 7 % in 2008 and expects another 2.2 % drop this year .
That comes as great news for President Obama , who is achieving his carbon - reduction goals even without a new carbon tax , but the irony is that the ethanol industry is part of the wider collateral damage .
Americans are unlikely to use enough gas next year to absorb the 13 billion gallons of ethanol that Congress mandated , because current regulations limit the ethanol content in each gallon of gas at 10 % .
The industry is asking that this cap be lifted to 15 % or even 20 % .
That way , more ethanol can be mixed with less gas , and producers wo n't end up with a glut that the government does not require anyone to buy .
The ethanol boosters are n't troubled that only a fraction of the 240 million cars and trucks on the road today can run with ethanol blends higher than 10 % .
It can damage engines and corrode automotive pipes , as well as impair some safety features , especially in older vehicles .
It can also overwhelm pollution control systems like catalytic converters .
The malfunctions multiply in other products that use gas , such as boats , snowmobiles , lawnmowers , chainsaws , etc .

A woman holds an iPhone along a street in Hong Kong last year .
Apple is reportedly considering Verizon as a service provider for the gadget .
Read more on AAPL at Read more on VZ at Verizon ( VZ ) and Apple ( AAPL ) are discussing the possible development of an iPhone for Verizon , with the goal of introducing it next year , people familiar with the situation say .
It would mark the first time Apple has produced a version of the iPhone for a CDMA wireless network , which is different from AT&T's GSM technology .
Vodafone , co-owner of Verizon Wireless , already sells the iPhone in Europe .
The New York - based telecom entered into " high - level " discussions with Apple management a few months ago , when CEO Steve Jobs was overseeing day - to - day business , these sources say .
They declined to be named because they are n't authorized to speak publicly .
Jobs is on medical leave until June , but the conversations are continuing , they say .
Apple declined to comment on the specific question of whether it is talking to Verizon .
The company provided USA TODAY with a prepared statement , culled from comments to investors by COO Tim Cook last week : " We 're very happy with the relationship that we have ( with AT&T ) and do not have a plan to change it . "
Cook added that " CDMA does n't really have a life to it after a point in time . "
Verizon is in the process of upgrading its network to a fourth - generation wireless technology known as " LTE . "
It is possible to build phones that work on both CDMA and LTE networks .
AT&T ( T ) has exclusive U.S. distribution rights to the iPhone into 2010 , though specifics are n't known .
The deal was struck in 2006 , when the iPhone was still on the drawing board .
Many telecom analysts expect AT&T to try to persuade Apple to extend the contract for another year , at least .
Should Verizon succeed , it would be a big loss for AT&T , says Roger Entner , head of telecom research for Nielsen .
" Breaking the ( iPhone ) exclusivity with AT&T is a huge thing , " he says .
" That would send shivers into AT&T 's stock and senior leadership . "
The power of the iPhone was on full display last week , when AT&T reported stellar wireless results .
AT&T signed up 1.6 million iPhone customers during the quarter — 40 % of them new to AT&T .
Revenue from mobile data was up almost 40 % .
Verizon reports results today .
By linking arms with Verizon , Entner says , Apple would gain access to its 80 million customers .
While a few may already have an iPhone ( some people have more than one carrier ) , the bulk do n't .
Regardless , Entner says , Apple would likely maintain ties with AT&T .
The biggest winners , by far , would be consumers , he says .
" They could pick the network they wanted to use : AT&T's or Verizon's , " he says .
" It would finally give consumers choice , and choice is a good thing . "
Entner says Verizon would fare well in that fight .
While AT&T's 3G network is " somewhat faster , " he says , Verizon 's network " is generally perceived to be better in terms of reliability . "
The biggest loser ?
" AT&T , " Entner says .
" It would be a reversal of fortune , because a lot of people who have been disappointed in AT&T's network but love the iPhone would probably " jump to Verizon .
Apple would also benefit , he adds , " because that means they 'd have to buy a new iPhone . "

Maybe Vladimir Putin is Russia ’s Forrest Gump .
Matthew Continetti at The Weekly Standard discovers this photographic gem at Foreign Policy , from Ronald Reagan ’s visit to Moscow in 1988 .
Standing on the left , with cameras around his neck looking very much like a tourist , is a man who appears to be Vladimir Putin , the current Prime Minister of Russia and the power behind the presidency of Dmitry Medvedev .
But was he really ?
Compare this to a photo of Putin now :
Gray hair now , and less of it — but it appears to be the same man , nevertheless .
Matthew says the photographer has since confirmed it .
In an NPR interview , Pete Souza recounts the knowledge imparted by Secret Service agents on that trip :
Souza recounts a story from a trip to Russia with Reagan .
He shot photos of Reagan as the president toured Moscow ’s Red Square with then - Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev .
Gorbachev introduced Reagan to various tourists , who asked the American president pointed questions about subjects such as human rights in the United States .
Souza says he remembers turning to one of the Secret Service agents standing nearby .
“ I ca n’t believe these tourists in the Soviet Union are asking these pointed questions . ”
The agent replied , “ Oh , these are all KGB families . ”
Putin was actually a fairly high - ranking officer in the KGB , though .
Would they have used such an agent for this kind of detail and risk his exposure ?
It seems like a strange decision , unless Putin was already so exposed as to make him a better choice than exposing other , more covert agents .
Also , the publicly - acknowledged timeline for Putin ’s KGB work puts him in East Germany from 1985 - 1990 .
A Reagan visit might have been an opportunity to bring Putin to Moscow , but again , why bother ?
It ’s intriguing , to say the least .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Warren Buffett said on Monday the U.S. economy had “ fallen off a cliff ” but would eventually recover , although a rebound could kindle inflation worse than that experienced in the late 1970s .
Speaking on CNBC television , the 78 - year - old billionaire said the country is experiencing a “ close to the worst - case ” scenario of falling business activity and rising unemployment , causing consumer confidence and spending to tumble .
Buffett called on Democratic and Republican policymakers to set aside partisan differences and unite under the leadership of President Barack Obama to wage an “ economic war ” that will fix the economy and restore confidence in banking .
He urged policymakers and regulators to communicate their efforts better to the public , though he stopped short of major , specific policy recommendations .
“ People are confused and scared , ” he said .
“ People ca n’t be worried about banks , and a lot of them are . ”
Buffett spoke nine days after his insurance and investment company Berkshire Hathaway Inc said quarterly profit fell 96 percent , largely from losses on derivatives contracts .
Berkshire ’s book value per share fell 9.6 percent in 2008 , the worst year since Buffett took over in 1965 .
RECOVERY COULD TRIGGER MORE INFLATION
Buffett said Americans , including himself , did not predict the severity of home price declines , which led to problems with securitizations and other debt whose value depended on home prices continuing to rise , or at least not plummet .
“ It was like some kids saying the emperor has no clothes , and then after he says that , he says now that the emperor does n’t have any underwear either , ” Buffett said .
“ We want to err on the side next time of not allowing big institutions to get as unchecked on leverage as we have allowed them to do . ”
Consumers too should reduce their reliance on debt such as credit cards , he said .
“ I ca n’t make money borrowing money at 18 or 20 percent , ” said Buffett , ranked as the second - richest American by Forbes magazine in October .
“ I ’d go broke . ”
Buffett said the economy was mere hours away from collapse last September when credit markets seized up , Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc went bankrupt and insurer American International Group Inc got its first bailout .
While praising efforts by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and others to stimulate the economy , he said the economy “ ca n’t turn around on a dime ” and that their efforts could trigger higher inflation once demand rebounds .
“ We are certainly doing things that could lead to a lot of inflation , ” he said .
“ In economics there is no free lunch . ”

The stock of Omaha , Nebraska - based Berkshire has fallen by half since September .
Growth in some units such as auto insurer Geico Corp has been offset by weakness elsewhere , including jewelry retailers that Buffett said have “ gotten killed . ”
Buffett said Berkshire will write less catastrophe insurance this year after investing roughly one - third of its cash in high - yielding securities issued by General Electric Co , Goldman Sachs Group Inc and other companies .
In morning trading , Berkshire Class A shares were down $ 795 , or 1.1 percent , at $ 72,400 .
Their 52 - week high is $ 147,000 , set last September 19 , Reuters data show .
BANKS SHOULD “ GET BACK TO BANKING ”
Buffett called on banks to “ get back to banking ” and said an overwhelmingly number would “ earn their way out ” of the recession , even if stockholders do n’t go along for the ride .
Saying that “ a bank that ’s going to go broke should be allowed to go broke , ” Buffett nevertheless added that the “ paralysis of confidence ” in the sector is “ silly ” because of safeguards such as deposit insurance .
He said Wells Fargo & Co and U.S. Bancorp , two large Berkshire holdings , should appear “ better than ever ” three years from now , while the ailing Citigroup Inc , which Berkshire does not own , would probably keep shrinking .
Bank of America Corp Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis , in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece on Monday , agreed that the vast majority of banks will survive .
Berkshire has reported a small stake in Bank of America stock .
Buffett said he still expects Berkshire ’s derivatives contracts , whose value depends on where four stock indexes trade a decade and more from now , to be profitable .
Over 10 years , he said , “ you will do considerably better owning a group of equities ” than U.S. Treasuries .
Buffett also defended his imperfectly timed October opinion piece for The New York Times , where he said he was moving non-Berkshire holdings in his personal account to stocks .
“ I stand by the article , ” he said .
“ I just wish I had written it a few months later . ”

Roy Anderson : Science is one of the few options to create a new industrial base for Britain
The head of Britain 's largest science university says the Bank of England 's governor was wrong to caution against more spending on science .
Professor Sir Roy Anderson says that investment in science is " one of the few options " the government has to kick - start the economy .
He thinks there should be a big rise in science spending as part of a new high technology industrial strategy .
Professor Anderson is the rector of Imperial College .
Last month , BBC
News revealed that ministers were arguing the case for a one billion pound boost to science spending as part of an overall economic stimulus package .
Within days the governor of the Bank of England , Mervyn King , argued against a further stimulus package because of the high levels of public debt .
The government 's chief scientist , Professor John Beddington , has said that Mr King 's remarks and their timing had reduced the chances of the government approving a boost to science spending .
Professor Sir Roy Anderson , however , believes that the case for a science stimulus package is still " in the balance " and so has spoken to BBC News to argue the case for such a measure .
" Mervyn King 's announcement of course was not the best news for science when [ we ] were just trying to persuade senior ministers that this is a real opportunity to the British economy , " he said .
" I can understand his caution , however I 'd still argue with him that in essence how are we going to position the UK economy coming out of the recession ?
I 'd argue that science and technology is one of our few options and it's a good time to provide that stimulus . "
Picking winners
As well as supporting moves for increased spending on science , Professor Anderson is leading efforts to persuade the government to set up a separate £ 1bn venture capital fund to support small high technology companies .
" We have a wonderful discovery base , But we do n't have sufficient venture capital money to establish these companies with good quality management to help them to grow and market themselves to become bigger , " he explained .
" Secondly , we do n't have a vision for the manufacturing opportunities for high technology manufacturing to create a new industrial base for the United Kingdom . "
Some observers argue that this kind of investment is best done by the private sector .
How would he respond to criticisms that this use of public money to support promising new ideas is akin to the old controversial government policy of " picking winners " ?
" My argument would be that the culture and environment and cautiousness of venture capital in the UK is such that it has n't generated the translation of our discovery into good quality companies , " he said .
" ( That environment is ) far too cautious , far too limited in the amount of money it is prepared to invest in new ideas and it is far too limited in scientific literacy . "
Professor Anderson believes that a publicly directed venture capital fund would quickly create new and much needed hi-tech jobs in the midst of the recession : " Small companies employ more people than big companies in total in the UK , " he explained .
" Often the focus is to protect the giants - we feel that one could generate very quickly a lot of small high technology companies which would provide exciting and interesting employment for graduates in a very diverse array of disciplines . "

City shareholders have threatened a revolt against the board of Lloyds Banking Group ( LBG ) over yesterday 's announcement of a £ 260 bn bailout by the government .
Chairman Sir Victor Blank and chief executive Eric Daniels , who brokered last year 's controversial merger of Lloyds TSB with the ailing HBOS , are now fighting for their survival after being forced to give the government a majority stake in the bank , a move both had resisted .
Any departure would pile fresh pressure on Downing Street over rewards for failed bankers , following the controversy over Sir Fred Goodwin 's huge pension from RBS .
Institutional shareholders will meet the pair this week , demanding answers over the acquisition of HBOS , which generated more than 80 % of the bad loans yesterday placed in a government scheme to let banks insure themselves against future losses from toxic assets .
They are also questioning the terms of the deal under which Lloyds paid a larger - than - expected £ 15.6 bn fee in return for insuring £ 260bn of toxic loans , and agreed to make £ 28bn available in new commercial and mortgage lending over two years .
A leading shareholder said Lloyds was " largely in this position because of the decision to buy HBOS " , adding : " One or both [ of Blank and Daniels ] is going to come under quite a lot of pressure .
That was a transaction they negotiated and recommended to shareholders , and it has turned out to be disastrous . "
The departure of two such senior executives would risk further destabilising the bank .
But MPs warned yesterday that lessons must be learnt from Goodwin 's departure from RBS with a controversial £ 16 m pension pot , demanding assurances that there would be no such payoffs for failure if heads rolled at Lloyds .
John McFall , chairman of the Treasury select committee , said banks in majority public ownership should " absolutely not " agree such payoffs .
" I think it should presage a much closer involvement with UK Financial Investments [ the body running part - nationalised banks ] .
The model of these banks has got to change fundamentally : it ai n't business as usual . "
Downing Street sources said it was " premature " to consider what restrictions might cover any boardroom departures .
But delegates at yesterday 's Scottish Labour conference in Dundee passed an emergency motion demanding the government pursue " every legal means " to ensure Goodwin and other bankers were not rewarded for " massive failure " .
The chancellor , Alistair Darling , last night hailed the Lloyds deal as " another vital step in our efforts to clean up banks ' balance sheets and give them the strength and confidence to increase their lending " .
LBG will add another £ 6bn in mortgage lending to the £ 14bn recently promised by Northern Rock , plus £ 22bn of lending to businesses .
McFall said his committee would scrutinise whether the lending actually does flow freely .
However , the £ 6bn earmarked for mortgages represents less than half the total loans from British lenders during January alone , when offers were at a historic low .
The taxpayer will end up with a 65 % share in what the Treasury minister Stephen Timms yesterday insisted would be a " strong and successful " bank .
However , he failed to deny speculation that the taxpayer could lose up to £ 100bn on the deal , saying only that " precedents would suggest that the loss would be a great deal less than that " .
Shadow chancellor George Osborne said the real test of the measure would be whether lending was resumed .
Lib Dem spokesman Vince Cable called on the government to run the bank " in the public interest " because of the amount of taxpayers ' money at risk .
Opposition MPs also warned that ministers will now be dragged directly into controversial lending decisions and held accountable for resulting job losses .
Cable used a speech to the Lib Dem spring conference yesterday to suggest unemployment could eventually reach 4 million .
“ Introduction to metaphysics ” accordingly means : leading into the asking of the fundamental question .
But questions , and above all fundamental questions , do not simply occur like stones and water .
Questions are not given like shoes , clothes , or books .
Questions are as they are actually asked , and this is the only way in which they are .
Thus the leading into the asking of the fundamental question is not a passage over to something that lies or stands around somewhere ; instead , this leading - to must first awaken and create the questioning .
Leading is a questioning going - ahead , a questioning - ahead .
This is a leadership that essentially has no following .
Whenever one finds pretensions to a following , in a school of philosophy , for example , questioning is misunderstood .
There can be such schools only in the sphere of scientific or professional labor .
In such a sphere , everything has its distinct hierarchical order .
Such labor also belongs , and even necessarily belongs , to philosophy , and has today been lost .
But the best professional ability will never replace the authentic strength of seeing and questioning and saying .
– Heidegger , “ Introduction to Metaphysics ”
Consider the notion of truth in the Greek term “ alethea : ” there is the alpha - privative as well as the word Lethe , and the point seems to be that it is a lack of forgetfulness that characterizes Truth .
Whether one actually has the truth is besides the point , ironically enough : what we feel marks the truth is that we do n’t forget it .
From this we get Heidegger ’s basic idea that Truth is something covered up , always , and that if Truth is connected to Being ( Sein ) , then while we cannot know the nature of Being , it would seem all of human history consists in attempts ( Dasein ) to uncover that nature .
It is with that in mind that I want to talk about this notion of leading into the fundamental question , “ Why are there beings [ das Seiende ] at all instead of nothing ? ”
The question already has Dasein in it , as “ beings at all ” refers to what is more immediate , as opposed to some more universal concept of Being , which , to be apprehended , one might have to stand beyond ( cf. Plato , Republic , 529c8- 530c3 ) .
Nonetheless , “ fundamental questions ” do have a special status , as they “ do not simply occur like stones and water . ”
The reference could be to Moses striking the rock and bringing water forth ; necessity means that the miraculous is lowered , that it is a simple occurrence despite its singularity , and that it is a question that can always be asked that truly has weight .
Further , the image of a river that might be crossed is another possibility .
The idea here would not be to cross that river , ignoring what it represents , but to contemplate .
So one does something remarkable in life when addressing these “ fundamental questions , ” as there is a dignity especial to the asking .
The list of “ shoes , clothes , books ” brings the idea of covering into the passage .
Our motion involves a covering , our identity involves a covering , and even our minds are covered in a sense : in each case , it is as if everyday life depends on not asking the deepest questions that could be asked .
The being of a question is in its asking , and it uncovers .
Thus it is beyond the necessitous ( virtually equated with the vulgar in early books of Aristotle ’s Politics ) .
Now I think I have established that Heidegger in this passage is dismissive , for very good reasons perhaps , of the everyday and that which needs to be done .
“ Leading ” seems not to be getting things done as much as a making in and of itself , and perhaps he has picked the philosophical as creative over the political which is merely active .
What is most curious is this notion of a leading that has no following , despite the assertion that philosophy used to have a hierarchy because of labor necessary to it .
I think all of us understand when Heidegger talks as if philosophy were pure freedom , but his talk of “ labor ” and “ hierarchy ” sounds as if it were taken from Bacon ’s New Atlantis , where everyone participates in scientific discoveries , helping out according to his ability .
But philosophy does not seem to even mimic the political as we understand it – why does Heidegger treat , then , philosophy as if it had a politics unto itself ?
( Note the “ seeing , questioning , saying ” trifecta , where the act comes after the thought : usually , considering politics a noble endeavor means taking into account that some acts occur well before any sort of thought , let alone well - developed thought ) .
Joshua Parens has mentioned that his problem with Heidegger & Arendt is that both think going back to the ancients is possible .
Heidegger seems to ignore the dignity Aristotle and Plato give to the political , give to the spirited as opposed to Spirit , and treats the “ philosophic ” as the only serious sphere of living ( whether Heidegger actually endorses philosophy in any substantial sense is a problem ) .
I have been nagging poor Joshua Rocks with the thought that Heidegger was so easily able to embrace Nazism because of an assumption of human inequality : some people are more capable , and can be shaped , and there are therefore those who are undesirable , and need not exist .
I think one can see these assertions about Heidegger in this passage somewhat – the latter is something I ’m not sure about nowadays .
People wore the term “ fascist ” with pride before the Second World War : as a commenter elsewhere once noted , fascist parties did n’t label themselves “ Evil Thug Butcher Parties ” and expect votes .
Moreover , all serious thought demands a hierarchy .
I think one can see something absolutely essential to education in this passage , something that Heidegger saw in the ancients that he got exactly right .
There is a notion that there are higher goods and that we are most in pursuit of them when we are in pursuit , not when we have .
Questioning fundamental things seems to transcend Dasein in a sense , as we are reaching for a perspective to which we might not attain , but still have found an authenticity that is not particular to our age necessarily ( Dasein considered strictly as “ being - the - open , ” or “ openness , ” may complicate this statement ) .
Further , this most prior questioning means that institutions devoted to education should always be suspect .
A pre-established order cannot contain , perhaps cannot even make manifest , the life of the mind and its fruits .
That observation led Plato and Aristotle to say philosophy was the highest , but to not dismiss the political entirely , as it was something different to a degree .
Heideggeer , on the other hand , might be willing to devote far too much to institutions , for the ironic reason that he is utterly dismissive of them in their most fundamental sense .
I have revised my submission to ATPS’09 — a german workshop on programming .
The most important changes are :
a simplified implementation of iterative deepening depth - first search and
an additional section with experimental results .
There is also an extended one page abstract summarising the work .
Abstract
Almost ten years ago , Ralf Hinze has written a functional pearl on how to derive backtracking functionality for the purely functional programming language Haskell .
In these notes , we show how to arrive at the efficient , two - continuation based backtracking monad derived by Hinze starting from an intuitive inefficient implementation that we subsequently refine using well known program transformations .
It turns out that the technique can be used to build monads for non-determinism from modular , independent parts which gives rise to various new implementations .
Specifically , we show how the presented approach can be applied to obtain new implementations of breadth - first search and iterative deepening depth - first search .

When it comes to weight loss , what you drink may be more important than what you eat , according to researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
Researchers examined the relationship between beverage consumption among adults and weight change and found that weight loss was positively associated with a reduction in liquid calorie consumption and liquid calorie intake had a stronger impact on weight than solid calorie intake .
The results are published in the April 1 , 2009 , issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
" Both liquid and solid calories were associated with weight change , however , only a reduction in liquid calorie intake was shown to significantly affect weight loss during the 6 - month follow up , " said Benjamin Caballero MD , PhD , senior author of the study and a professor with the Bloomberg School 's Department of International Health .
" A reduction in liquid calorie intake was associated with a weight loss of 0.25 kg at 6 months and 0.24 kg at 18 months .
Among sugar - sweetened beverages , a reduction of 1 serving was associated with a weight loss of 0.5 kg at 6 months and 0.7 kg at 18 months .
Of the seven types of beverages examined , sugar - sweetened beverages were the only beverages significantly associated with weight change . "
Researchers conducted a prospective study of 810 adults aged 25 - 79 years old participating in the PREMIER trial , an 18 - month randomized , controlled , behavioral intervention .
Caballero along with colleagues from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine ; the National Heart , Lung , and Blood institute ; Duke University ; the Pennington Biomedical Research Center ; the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research ; the University of Alabama ; and Pennsylvania State University measured participant 's weight and height using a calibrated scale and a wall - mounted stadiometer at both 6 and 18 months .
Dietary intake was measured by conducting unannounced 24 - hour dietary recall interviews by telephone .
Researchers divided beverages into several categories based on calorie content and nutritional composition : sugar - sweetened beverages ( regular soft drinks , fruit drinks , fruit punch , or high - calorie beverages sweetened with sugar ) , diet drinks ( diet soda and other " diet " drinks sweetened with artificial sweeteners ) , milk ( whole milk , 2 percent reduced - fat milk , 1 percent low - fat milk , and skim milk ) , 100 percent juice ( 100 percent fruit and vegetable juice ) , coffee and tea with sugar , coffee and tea without sugar and alcoholic beverages .
They found that at 37 percent sugar - sweetened beverages were the leading source of liquid calories .
Consumption of liquid calories from beverages has increased in parallel with the obesity epidemic .
Earlier studies by Bloomberg School researchers project that 75 percent of U.S. adults could be overweight or obese by 2015 and have linked the consumption of sugar - sweetened beverages to the obesity epidemic , which affects two - thirds of adults and increases the risk for adverse health conditions such as type 2 diabetes .
Researchers recommend limited liquid calorie intake among adults and to reduce sugar - sweetened beverage consumption as a means to accomplish weight loss or avoid excess weight gain .
" Among beverages , sugar - sweetened beverages was the only beverage type significantly associated with weight change at both the 6 - and 18 - month follow up periods , " said Liwei Chen , MD , PhD , MHS , lead author of the study and a Bloomberg School graduate .
" Changes in the consumption of diet drinks and alcoholic beverages were inversely associated with weight loss , but were not statistically significant .
Our study supports policy recommendations and public health efforts to reduce intakes of liquid calories , particularly from sugar - sweetened beverages , in the general population . "
" Reduction in Consumption of Sugar - Sweetened Beverages is Associated with Weight Loss : The PREMIER Trial " was written by Liwei Chen , Lawrence J. Appel , Catherine Loria , Pao - Hwa Lin , Catherine M. Champagne , Patricia J. Elmer , Jamy D. Ard , Diane Mitchell , Bryan C. Batch , Laura P. Svetkey and Benjamin Caballero .
The research was supported by the National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute ; National Institutes of Health ; the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health 's Center for Human Nutrition ; and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development .

Former RNC director convicted in phone jamming case gets off without penalty John Byrne
Published : Friday February 20 , 2009

This Judge rules new charges are ' vindictive '
The Republican National Committee employee convicted of a plot to jam the phone banks of Democratic get - out - the - vote efforts in New Hampshire in 2002 has escaped penalty in his case , after a federal judge ruled that new charges against him could not be brought .
The latest charges against James Tobin , whose at least $ 722,000 dollars in legal fees were paid for by the Republican National Committee , were nixed by a federal judge on Thursday .
Tobin was convicted in December 2005 by a New Hampshire jury of being part of a conspiracy to jam Democratic phone banks led by Democrats and a nonpartisan firefighters union on Election Day 2002 .
That night , Republican Senate candidate John Sununu narrowly defeated Democratic Gov. Jeann Sheehean in a closely contest Senate race .
But after his 2005 conviction , Tobin found himself legally absolved after the First Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the ruling in his case , finding that the telephone harassment statute under he was convicted " was not a good fit for what [ he ] had been convicted of doing . "
Government prosecutors then sought fresh charges against the former RNC reigional field director on making false statements .
Tobin was indicted by a Portland federal grand jury in October .
But district Judge George Singal agreed with attorneys for Tobin and ruled Wednesday that bringing new charges against the former GOP political organizer qualified as a vindictive prosecution .
The vindictive prosecution doctrine places constitutional limits on prosecutors ' discretion .
Singal said those limits were exceeded in Tobin 's case .
The judge 's decision came less than two weeks after a hearing on a motion by Tobin 's attorneys to dismiss the indictment against Tobin .
Tobin was indicted in October by a federal grand jury in Portland on two counts of making false statements about the phone - jamming incident to an FBI agent .
It 's unclear whether the RNC continues to have paid for Tobin 's lawyers .
Upon his sentencing , the national GOP organization paid $ 1.7 million to the lawfirm representing Tobin , which could have put the price tag for his defense at well over $ 2 million .

HARDLY ANYONE KNEW " MARIJUANA " WAS CANNABIS HEMP .
HOW DID WE LOSE A BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY ?
Industrialist tycoons could not control or monopolize the hemp industry .
Evidence reveals that a treacherous plot was conceived to prohibit farmers and all Americans , ( and all nations ) from cultivating hemp ,
while allowing patented toxic chemicals for fuel , fiber , plastic , paper , foods and pharmaceuticals to to take its place .
These special interests conspired and deceived Congress and the public with lies in the form of mythical evils about " marijuana " .
Every American from that day forward has faced the threat of imprisonment under color of law .
This is a crime against the people of the United States .

This is not a protest .
This is a PEACEFUL assembly calling for a redress of grievances and a repeal of cannabis prohibition .
Voters who want cannabis prohibition laws abolished are gathering in number to show we definitely want New York State to :
1 ) Let the people go free who are being held in prison or on probation for growing , selling , consuming this beneficial plant .
2 ) Rescue their children who were kidnapped under color of law & handed over to strangers where they are subject to mistreatment .
3 ) Return the property that has been confiscated from these innocent people peacefully gathered while growing or smoking the herb .
4 ) Expunge criminal records that prevent further education , good jobs or other future opportunities because of a harmless cannabis offense .
5 ) Allow citizens to heal themselves with whatever herbs they grow in their gardens .
Allow free use and research of cannabis medicines .
6 ) Allow farmers to grow freely cultivate all forms of hemp on their land and to create bio - fuel refineries for ethanol fuel .
7 ) Protect New York Citizens from Federal statutes and prosecution that violates their constitutional rights .
WE WANT PROTECTION FROM THIS CORRUPT DRUG WAR THAT ONLY FUNDS AND CATERS TO THE BLACK MARKET .
IT HAS CORRUPTED OUR POLICE , OUR JUDGES , OUR REPRESENTATIVES AND IT MUST STOP .

Scientists are to hold an emergency summit to warn the world 's politicians they are being too timid in their response to global warming .
Climate experts from across the world will gather in Copenhagen next month to agree a stark message to policy makers , which they hope will break the political deadlock on efforts to curb rising temperatures .
The meeting follows " disturbing " studies that suggest global warming could strike harder and faster than expected .
It comes ahead of a year of high - level political discussions on climate change , which climax with international negotiations in Copenhagen in December , where officials will try to hammer out a successor to the Kyoto protocol .
Katherine Richardson , a marine biologist at the University of Copenhagen , who is organising next month 's event , said : " This is not a regular scientific conference .
This is a deliberate attempt to influence policy . "
The meeting will publish an update to the 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
Richardson said the IPCC report was " wishy - washy " on issues such as sea level rise .
" The IPCC talks of a 40 cm sea rise this century .
Well , if the consensus now is a rise of a metre or more then they need to know that . "
A number of studies published since the IPCC report was prepared show that carbon emissions are rising faster than expected and that existing greenhouse gas targets may not be enough to prevent catastrophic temperature rise .
Climate experts , including Jim Hansen , of Nasa , have warned about so - called " tipping points " that could lead to runaway warming and rapid sea level rise .
Bob Watson , a former head of the IPCC and chief scientist in the environment department , Defra , said : " Certainly in Defra they 're aware of the situation .
Whether all governments are aware of it is another matter .
Even without the new information there was enough to make most policy makers think that urgent action was absolutely essential .
The new information only strengthens that and pushes it even harder . "
One issue to be addressed next month is whether it is still possible to limit average global temperature rise to 2C , which the EU defines as dangerous .
Richardson said a key question for politicians is the balance between efforts to limit warming and steps to adapt to the likely consequences .
Watson has warned that nations should prepare for an average rise of 4C .
The IPCC said temperatures could soar by up to 6C by 2100 if current rates of carbon pollution continue .
Martin Parry , a British scientist who jointly chaired the IPCC working group on impacts for the 2007 report , and will attend next month 's meeting , said : " I think it 's a good idea .
I would have thought most of this stuff is out there already but it deserves to be brought together and hammered home in a credible way . "
A number of " disturbing " trends seem to have accelerated since the IPCC report was published , he said , such as a decrease in the amount of carbon pollution absorbed in the oceans , and an increase in Greenland ice melt .
But he denied that the new findings made the IPCC report obsolete .
" They are not so radical as to undermine the report .
They reinforce it . "

The Batman Movie on VHS .
I was like , " Sign my The Batman Movie , dude , I think you 're mad good , " and at first he was like , " That is n't me . "
And I 'm all , " I know dude , it 's The mysterious Batman , right ?
Nah , for real sign it , " then I gave him a wink .
And he said , " No , you do n't understand , " and I 'm like " No , dude , I get it .
It 's cool , your secret 's safe with me , " and then I winked at him a few more times and he signed it .
It 's like he was still in character and did n't want anyone to know he was Batman .
That 's like method acting and shit .
I studied a little acting , and I 'm pretty good at it , so I totally get where he 's coming from and totally respect him for it .
DAY 8
No lie , today was literally the best day of my life .
We were filming a scene for the Terminator movie and C - Bale ( I think it 's safe to call him " C - Bale " now because we 're basically like best bros , we 're gonna hang out ) , he , like , shot this robot in the head or whatever and was being intense in the movie and I was like , " Yo , I bet his heart is beating mad fast right now , " so I snuck in so you could barely see me and I captured the sound of his heartbeat for the audio .

DAY 11
DAY 15
Everybody was real impressed and the sound is so fucking intense .
Not to brag or anything , but I 'd make a seriously great sound engineer , I 'm just great with natural sounds , you know ?
Everyone always says so .
I 'm like a painter but the paint is sound , and the canvas is like a microphone and the paintbrushes are also sounds .
Anyway they have to film that same scene again tomorrow for some reason , so I think I might try to get a different angle on his heartbeat .
Surprised C- Bale at his house today at like 2 AM to go partying .
He was n't in the mood to party .
We 'll probably go tomorrow or whatever .
C- Bale was a little weird today , I do n't know what his deal was .
The thing was , he was doing this real close - up scene with this other guy in the movie and they were talking and arguing about the robots ( or maybe the one dude was a robot ) , and it was all intense but I was thinking to myself like , " Yo , there 's
Pleasent
And so as I start on this submission , it has some interesting points , some not so interesting parts aswell , but I guess thats what the reiew feedback is for , for what works and what doesnt work , But it starts off kind of so - so but does get better , I was pleased with a few parts and hope the rest does get better , But I will suggest some feedback later .
Well this was a pleasent film here and the little guitar was such a nice touch aswell as having a good tune for it to flow with , overall a decent little flick you have here .
The animation was very nice in that it looked like you spent a nice amount of time working on it , and that really shows , right off from the start , but there were still some sreas that could be even better as explained in review , some basic ideas are thrown out there for your improvment of this submission , but even with that said it was a nice flash entry .
~~THINGS TO IMPROVE ON ~ ~
everything can allways be improved and or made better , may it be the little things so hope these small yet helpfull ideas help .
So here I have added a few tips and advice on your submission , in hopes that you go with it and allow for more creativity throughout the whole flash , and in the end it will be a much better experience .
I actually thought this was kind of short , I could see you stretching it out a tad more though .

MIAMI --
Here 's a sign of how badly Isiah Thomas wanted to return to coaching :
He 's working for free at Florida International .
At his introductory news conference at FIU on Wednesday , Thomas said his salary the first year from the Golden Panthers will be donated back to the school 's athletic department .
Thomas was fired by the New York Knicks last year .
The team still owes him around $ 12 million for the final two years of his deal there .
Isiah Thomas said he knows building FIU 's basketball program will take effort , but said " I 'm willing to pay the price to do that . "

FIU athletic director Pete Garcia said that when Thomas learned about layoffs and budget cuts , he told the university president that the school should keep his salary .
Thomas arrived outside FIU 's basketball arena at 10:25 a.m.
Wednesday , riding passenger in a sleek black Mercedes .
Even before he could get out of the car , three well - wishers could n't wait to greet him .
" Hey !
There he is ! " shouted one of the men , all of whom got handshakes from Thomas before the car pulled into a parking space .
Thomas said he took the FIU job because he enjoys challenges .
He said he talked to Bob Knight , his former coach at Indiana , and Duke 's Mike Krzyzewski , about what it took to build college programs .
" I like rolling up my sleeves .
I like taking some from the bottom and building it to the top .
There 's a lot of risk in that and there is also a lot of reward in that .
But that 's how I grew up .
I want to take FIU to the next level and I know it 's going to take a lot of hard work , but I 'm willing to pay the price to do that . "
His arrival was celebrated in Miami , much in the way his departure was in New York .
During his time with the Knicks , Thomas endured legal and personal troubles off the court , and more losses than wins on it .
His Knicks were 23 - 59 a season ago , prompting a firing many fans had long awaited .
The Knicks never won a playoff game in his tenure as president or coach , and many of his moves -- like acquiring Stephon Marbury -- did n't work out as planned .
In 2007 , a jury ordered Knicks owner Madison Square Garden to pay $ 11.6 million to a former team executive who alleged she was sexually harassed by Thomas , who continually maintained his innocence and was never found personally liable .
This past October , there was more drama .
Officers responded to Thomas ' New York - area home after a 911 call reported someone had overdosed on sleeping pills .
According to police reports , officers found a man passed out and gave him oxygen until an ambulance arrived .
Authorities never publicly identified Thomas as the victim , but a person familiar with the case confirmed to the AP that it was Thomas .
Garcia said FIU investigated Thomas and was aware of his history .
But he said he had an advantage -- he knew Thomas personally .
" We have mutual friends , we 've had them for a long time , " Garcia said .
" I 've known Mr. Thomas for a while .
I know Isiah Thomas .
And I guarantee oen thing , we are getting a great human being .... I 'll let him talk about basketball .
That 's his passion .
" We 're very fortunate to have him . "
Thomas will face some immediate challenges : FIU went 13 - 20 this past season , its third 20 - loss campaign in four years , and has not posted a winning record since 1999 - 2000 .
He started moving quickly to fill his roster : Thomas started recruiting Tuesday night , only a few hours after arriving in South Florida .
Mark down the date .
Tuesday , April 21 , 2009 , is the moment that any chance of a new era of bipartisan respect in Washington ended .
By inviting the prosecution of Bush officials for their antiterror legal advice , President Obama has injected a poison into our politics that he and the country will live to regret .
Policy disputes , often bitter , are the stuff of democratic politics .
Elections settle those battles , at least for a time , and Mr. Obama 's victory in November has given him the right to change policies on interrogations , Guantanamo , or anything on which he can muster enough support .
But at least until now , the U.S. political system has avoided the spectacle of a new Administration prosecuting its predecessor for policy disagreements .
This is what happens in Argentina , Malaysia or Peru , countries where the law is treated merely as an extension of political power .
If this analogy seems excessive , consider how Mr. Obama has framed the issue .
He has absolved CIA operatives of any legal jeopardy , no doubt because his intelligence advisers told him how damaging that would be to CIA morale when Mr. Obama needs the agency to protect the country .
But he has pointedly invited investigations against Republican legal advisers who offered their best advice at the request of CIA officials .
" Your intelligence indicates that there is currently a level of ' chatter ' equal to that which preceded the September 11 attacks , " wrote Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee , in his August 1 , 2002 memo .
" In light of the information you believe [ detainee Abu ] Zubaydah has and the high level of threat you believe now exists , you wish to move the interrogations into what you have described as an ' increased pressure phase . ' "
So the CIA requests a legal review at a moment of heightened danger , the Justice Department obliges with an exceedingly detailed analysis of the law and interrogation practices -- and , seven years later , Mr. Obama says only the legal advisers who are no longer in government should be investigated .
The political convenience of this distinction for Mr. Obama betrays its basic injustice .
And by the way , everyone agrees that senior officials , including President Bush , approved these interrogations .
Is this President going to put his predecessor in the dock too ?
WHEN data gets stolen , there ’s an unexpected suspect in the frame .
To protect their networks from viruses and hacker attacks , most companies insist their computers are “ locked down ” so they ca n’t run unauthorised software or CD and DVD content .
“ But woe betide the lowly IT director that would inconvenience the CEO with such restrictions , ” says Glenn Zimmerman , a technology expert with the Pentagon ’s cyberspace task force .
“ Most senior leaders ’ computers are often wide open to threats , ” and it is often the CEO who holds the most critical data , he warned a London conference on Cyber Warfare last week .
The way …
It 's an interesting evolution , because as Bethesda Game Studios specifically , you 've traditionally operated with what some see as a more antiquated development model -- spend three or four years developing a game , ship that big thing , get started on something else .
How much have you had to adapt your methods to adjust the way you think about development ?
PH : It does n't change how we think about it .
We have always been really good at what you 're talking about , which is managing the game 's life cycle -- what are you doing with the game three months out , six months out , one year out , two years out ?
I think it 's actually something we do better than most publishers , if not all publishers .
I say that because -- well , what does your average big publisher put out a year ?
Thirty games ?
Forty games ?
Whatever the hell the number is .
They 're doing that every year .
They have these large number of titles and they just do n't think about them like we do , whereas we do something like Oblivion or Morrowind .
We 're still selling Morrowind on a monthly basis .
We still have it out there .
Oblivion is still doing terrific for us .
We do n't give up on our stuff , ever .
There is always a market and a niche and people out there who are willing to buy it .
DLC is just another component of that .
We make games that have legs and that stick around and that people will continue to be vested in and play for a long time .
This is just another way to reach out to those folks to say , " If you really like this , here are some more things that you might like . "
It 's the lifecycle of the product as a thing you sell , as well as the game as a thing you play .
It allows people to keep coming back to it .
I have people who ping me about this -- I was just talking to a press guy who said , " I just had a friend start playing Oblivion .
He had never played it and now he 's really into it . "
That guy 's going to go out and start buying downloadable content .
He 's probably going to go buy the much - maligned horse armor .
There are people who are coming into our products years and years after folks like you or your readers have moved past them .
There are people who are experiencing it for the first time .
That DLC stuff is great because it 's still there and available and working with them , and for them that content is still a new experience , both from a product standpoint as well as within the game itself .
Particularly lately , Valve has spoken a great deal about that model -- the idea of a game as a living service .
It 's probably not a coincidence that you and Valve are among the more successful independent developers , while sharing that mentality .
PH : Well , honestly , those guys are masters of it .
I would n't ever try and compare us and them .
What they 've done with Steam is just wholly remarkable .
And when Steam first came out , they took what was the equivalent of their horse armor lumps and then some .
[ laughter ]
I remember just how much shit they got over it .
But they stuck to it and it 's great .
It 's now the gold standard of delivery online of new games and previously released ones -- it is fantastic .
That 's just owing to those guys having a vision .
This is what the industry wants and this is how it needs to work .
They refined it and made it better .
We released Fallout 3 on Steam and it 's done terrific for us .
It 's really easy to work with and it reaches a core audience .
Guys who are really into Steam are really into games in general and like them and buy them and play them .
They 've gotten it 100 % right in terms of how to use that kind of delivery mechanism to extend their product .
When you describe the idea of a game selling for even up to six years in the case of Morrowind , that reminds me very much of the '90s - era PC model , with huge , intricate games that would have an active scene for years and years , even before there was much web coverage -- and obviously , that 's exactly the time and place The Elder Scrolls was born .
Now you 're doing that in a multiplatform environment , even though that is n't actually how most multiplatform games are sold these days .
Did you just keep operating that way because that 's what you do ?
PH : Absolutely .
More than anything , it 's just focus .
When you 've got 50 titles in a year , you just do n't focus on those 50 .
When you 're going to a retailer , just one of the 50 you released last year is not what you 're talking to that guy .
We do n't have those 50 , and it 's by choice .
We could find a bunch of crap to put out if we just wanted to fill a pipeline or hit a number , but we just have a very different approach strategically .
When you have that approach , one of the benefits is focus .
You go back into a retailer in 2009 and you 're still able to say , " Hey , by the way , this game is still selling great .
Have you looked at our inventory levels lately ?
You 're selling it well enough that you guys need to think about reordering , and we have some ideas to keep selling it , because there are people out there who still want it . "
We 're getting ready to do something else with Oblivion this year , because it is still selling and retailers still like it .
If we were n't talking about that game , they 'd only be focused on the [ newer ] things .
But we stay on top it .
I think that owes to our sales guys who stay on top of it and do n't want to let it just die .
It 's not , " Oh , it 's two years old , it 's not going to sell any more . "
That 's not true .
It will .
If you pay attention to it and keep taking care of it , it 's still got a home , it can still do something .
When you say you 're thinking about doing something with Oblivion , what does that mean ?
PH : Oh , I 'll let you know .

Japan may be host to the world ’s most vibrant visual culture complex , but all areas do not share equally in this bounty .
In fact , outside the likes of Tokyo and Osaka , there are vast areas of the country where anime begins and ends with Doraemon and Naruto .
2ch analyses the subject in the ranking you see below :
Remarks :
These are the late night anime being broadcast on regional terrestrial stations in April ; in total there are 25 new titles .
There are some additional titles only aired on satellite .
Only newly airing titles are included – no repeats .
These are late night anime titles only .
The likes of Naruto is broadcast nationally almost without exception .
23 : Chiba & Saitama
22 : Kanagawa & Osaka
21 : Tokyo
17 : Aichi
16 : Hyogo & Tokushima
14 : Kyoto
13 ; Ibaraki , Gunma , Tochigi
12 : Mie
11 : Nara , Wakayama , Gifu , Fukuoka , Saga
10 : Shiga & Hokkaido
6 : Okuyama & Kagawa
3 : Miyagi
2 : Niigata , Kumamoto , Shizuoka
1 : Fukushima & Ehime
0 : Toyama , Ishikawa , Fukui , Yamanashi , Okinawa , Aomori , Iwate , Akita , Yamagata , Kochi , Nagano , Nagasaki , Oita , Miyazaki , Kagoshima , Yamaguchi , Tottori , Shimane
Although the top prefectures are amongst the most populous , this still indicates that in much of Japan anime fans are in the same boat as their international counterparts , and are reliant on DVD sales and unauthorised online distribution if they are to keep up with the latest series .
Sometimes series can end up airing to a tiny minority of the TV watching public as a result of all this .
The quality of these offerings varies widely too , with some being extremely high quality broadcasts without censorship , and others being bowdlerised and broadcast with cheap equipment .
When it comes to anime as a whole , outside the major conurbations it can be as obscure as it is overseas .
The other day I noticed a sign while waiting at a traffic light .
It claimed that I could earn “ CEO - level ” income working at home and had an 800 number ( for those of you outside the U.S. , these are toll - free numbers typically used by businesses ) to call , in this case , ( 800 ) 790 - 8061 .
I figured that like most “ Work at home !
Be your own boss !
Unlimited potential !
Look at me holding wads of cash in front of a yacht !
Read this lengthy page of testimonials that says absolutely nothing about the actual job you ’ll be doing ! ” - type ads , it would be a pyramid scheme .
That ’s exactly what it what it was .
If you do n’t want to read about this particular version of a scam that ’s been done a zillion times , you can stop here ; it ’s nothing new .
If you ’d like a taste of what it ’s like to “ fall ” for one , feel free to continue .
Wasting the time of scammers is a small hobby of mine .
I used Skype a bit in college to make calls when I did n’t have good cell service in my apartment , and after that situation improved I found myself with about $ 10 of credit .
I burned it on cheap international calls to spammers who left their phone numbers in lottery spam emails .
“ Dr. Michael Scott ” had ridiculous phone numbers like +5 555 555 555 5555 x555 , extremely long randomly - generated email addresses , confirmation codes with the letter “ q ” repeated an incredible number of times , and odd demands like requesting a million dollar prize to be reduced to $ 999,999.99 “ for tax reasons . ”
Since then , I ’ve wasted the time of exceptionally annoying marketers , especially if their businesses are deceptive or even illegal .
I do n’t have a landline , but when I did , I was generally nice and handled the standard telemarketer with a quick “ Not interested .
Put me on your do not call list ” so neither of us had much wasted time .
I ’m not a jerk to everyone .
But , when I ’m repeatedly called on my cell phone ( from callers spoofing their caller ids ) about a fictitious expiring car warranty , it ’s on .
The last time one of them called I answered , went through the questions to the second person ( it ’s some sort of affiliate - based scheme , where one person refers you to the next with a unique code ) , and then put them on hold before continuing on with my day .
They hung up after 12 minutes and have n’t called back .
Pat , Nate , and Mike also had some fun with them , and according to Nelson , one of them was able to get the spammer to hold for over an hour .
And now , back to that sign .
I decided to call the 800 number to see what it ’s like to join one of these schemes .
I ’m particularly angered by them during a period of rising financial hardship , since they prey upon those who are desperate for cash .
More on that later .
When I called the number , I was greeted with a recording about making money with a proven system or whatnot that was several minutes long , which finally asked me to leave my name and number .
I did .
The next day , someone from a local number called and began to “ interview ” me .
She started off by saying something about starting the business with her husband in Scottsdale , Arizona .
This of course is totally bogus , as she does not own the business and is just a victim of what she ’s trying to trick me into buying .
She then went into a schtick where she asked me very important interview questions like “ How much do you want this ? ” and “ How much would you like to earn ? ” and claimed that she ’d hang up if I ’m willing to settle for anything less than a million dollars a year .
Of course , no matter how uninterested and incompetent I sounded , the conversation continued , for a full 14 minutes , without any stalling on my part .
My favorite part was when she asked me if I knew the difference between direct sales and MLM .
When I said , “ I heard MLM is mostly scams , ” she actually told me that the entire industry was made of legitimate businesses .
Does n’t she know that she ’s supposed to earn my trust by claiming that 99 % of them are scams , she ’s been scammed by them before , and has finally found the one that actually works ?
It did n’t matter , though , because she claimed that what she was offering was n’t MLM .
Phew .
The interview must have been going pretty well at that point , and she told me the next step : call into a conference call , listen to more information , and then call her back if I was interested .
This point was kind of interesting , because I asked her if she could give me any more information about what would be required of me for the job .
She said that she could n’t , because all I ’d need is some quick information from the call and then I could get started .
“ You ’ll do what I do , ” she said .
“ All you need to do is put people on the phone . ”
Ha !
In a call less than 14 minutes long she had gone from “ I started this business ” and “ This is n’t MLM ” to “ You ’ll do what I do . ”
Well , this all sounds good to me .
Conference call it is .
Oh , and she confirmed the email address I had left in my earlier message .
“ That ’s an interesting address , ” she said .
“ I actually went there when I heard your message , because I wondered how someone could get a haircut online . ”
But before we get to the call , what industry would I , an unemployed man with no money who had just fooled around with websites in school be entering ?
“ Personal development , ” is what she told me .
I translated it for her : “ Self - help . ”
That ’s right , if there is any product that ’s actually sold as a result of this , it ’s tickets to motivational seminars or inspirational videos .
Thrilling .
I wonder if I could get a discount .
Getting to the last bit here …
I called into the conference call , which she said would run 20 minutes , about 10 minutes into it .
It sounded like it was actually live , but I did n’t want to break my character just yet and resisted un-muting myself and asking why I should fall for a pyramid scheme .
I found out the company name , “ Liberty League , ” a “ company built on integrity . ”
The scheme was called “ Beyond Freedom , ” and was told , “ If you can place ads and call people back , and get them to be on these calls , I think you understand what you need to do . ”
Yes , I understand .
But they wanted to be completely sure that I understood the exact structure of the program , and said , “ Just place people on these calls , ” that ’s all I ’d have to do .
They then had , after a lengthy disclaimer , a series of live testimonials .
Of course !
Both of these calls sounded exactly like phone versions of one of these pages .
I had to hang up before the call was over because I was helping someone convert a video , but just before I did they had opened it up to Q&A .
One person asked if this system had been affected by the economy .
“ The worse the economy gets , the better we ’re doing , ” they said .
Unfortunately , I ’m afraid this was one of the most truthful statements I heard .
I ’m sure many people who fall for these types of programs are desperately seeking any source of income .
And then on this same point , just before I hung up , someone said ( and I hope I misheard ) , that he was considering buying the $ 495 kit .
Four hundred and ninety - five dollars .
I really hope that before he pulls out that credit card he considers that he ’s offering to pay for the privilege of selling something .
This is not how real jobs work .
This is how scams work .
Slightly related : I started to wonder just how many levels this thing had .
Did the person I talked to even put up that sign , or did she outsource it ?
My eyes shifted through space , separated , multiple , roaming .
My eyes were my camera drones .
The feeling of looking in several directions at once was something I was not quite yet used to as I was only a few months old since my rebirth .
I did not feel the pod fluid I was suspended in , nor did I feel my body .
I felt space through the engines of my Rifter , saw it via the camera drones surrounding it and perceived what I could not see through the on board scanners of the ship .
It felt powerful .
It felt free .
I was the ship , and the Rifter responded to my every whim as it danced across the stars .
And now , for the first time , I was on the hunt .
Up until now I stayed in the secure parts of space , securing resources , making money and working on contacts .
But the call of the lawless frontier was impossible to ignore .
It pulled at me as my mining lasers consumed a precious asteroid and disturbed my dreams as I rested in my station quarters .
Finally , I had to make the jump .
I settled into my pod and waited patiently as it was installed aboard my Rifter - class frigate .
It was my first solo combat flight in this ship class , but I trusted my instincts .
A minute later , the station launch catapult spat me into space .
I warped my ship to the nearby gate and activated it .
I brushed the low - security space Concord warning aside as it appeared in my mind .
A bubble appeared around my ship .
Then the unmistakable feeling of being both everywhere and nowhere consumed me as the gate activated .
The disorientation of a gate jump was still there , but it was not the stomach - turning event I first experienced a few months ago .
My mind quickly went back to my scanners , while another part of my mind reached for the camera drones and looked around .
Concord 's pilot registry showed three people in the system except for myself .
Two were branded criminals , one was not .
I willed my ship into a warp towards the first planet at the system , exiting it 100 km from the common orbit our ships are programmed to enter .
My subconscious was already hard at work .
Realizing that our minds could effectively run several processes at once ( especially with the help of the ship 's computers ) was an important part of being a capsuleer .
As I was looking around via my camera drones , still somewhat in awe with the beauty of space , the back of my mind was operating the directional scanner .
Suddenly , that part of my mind demanded focus .
An Incursus - class frigate was on scan .
I conjured up the system map in my mind , with the size of the system and the scan resolution I used , it was obvious that the ship was in the belts of this very same planet .
The Rifter 's guns twitched as my excitement levels rose and Adrenaline pumped through my veins .
A mute command , and the Rifter picked up speed , aligned to warp , and broke through the light speed barrier .
I came out of warp to an empty belt .
My prey was not here .
I was disappointed , and scanned around again .
The Incursus was still on scan .
My lack of experience showed , however : I warped without zeroing in on my prey first and tried to find him by pure luck rather than clever method .
However , sometimes , all you need is luck .
The equivalent of a proximity alarm went off in my brain .
That was my ship indicating to me that I had company .
An Incursus class - frigate was exiting warp in the very belt I was .
How fortuitous .
The engines on my Rifter came alive as I threw the ship into a hard turn .
Then instinct took over .
I barely remember reaching across the stars to grab at the Incursus with my Warp Scrambler , and I do not recall even thinking about my weapons as I guided the Rifter into a tight orbit around my prey .
Nonetheless , the three 150 mm auto cannons spat death at the Gallente frigate before the pilot could even react to what was happening .
I remember feeling the sting of weapon impacts as the target 's blasters came alive and suddenly feeling heavy and sluggish as his Stasis Webifier activated , but the hits were sporadic , I did not care for speed , and my shield status never dropped below 70 % .
Then , as rapidly as it started , it was over .
The Incursus was an expanding cloud of dust and debris .
My own guns were silent .
A notification flashed in my brain about my Concord security status being lowered .
I did not care .
I tried to reach for the capsule of my foe , but he was too quick .
In under a minute , he was no longer registered in the system .
I started calming down .
A quick scan showed me that the wreck of the Incursus had enough intact parts to be nearly worth my entire Rifter .
Some of these parts were Cruiser weapons .
His loot from previous engagements , perhaps .
The Rifter came to life again after I picked through the wreckage as I engaged my warp drive .
I warped to another planet , making a note of a location in the middle of nowhere .
As I landed at the planet , I quickly warped again , back to that spot I just made a mental bookmark of .
I checked my security status .
I was branded a criminal .
I could not exit the system for about 12 more minutes .
As I waited , I realized one thing :
I felt alive .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - A veteran member of Britain ’s Labour Party announced she was leaving it on Saturday because she felt betrayed by its leadership under Prime Minister Gordon Brown and shocked by the behaviour of his team .
Alice Mahon , 71 , a well - known left winger and former Labour member of parliament who often criticised former leader Tony Blair and opposed the Iraq war , said she was “ scandalised ” by a series of offensive emails sent by one of Brown ’s advisers .
“ I ’ve reached the end of the road with the Labour Party , ” Mahon told Sky television .
“ I ’ve lost faith in the government and the direction they are taking us in . ”
One of Brown ’s most influential aides , Damian McBride , was forced to resign a week ago after sending emails containing unfounded smears about Conservative leader David Cameron and his finance spokesman George Osborne to a Labour Internet campaigner .
The emails were leaked , and Brown was forced to apologise for his adviser .
He said on Thursday he had been “ horrified ” when he found out what McBride had done .
Mahon said the scandal had shown her the kind of people who were running Labour .
“ I think that most decent people in the party would be shocked and absolutely scandalised by the smears that were about to be launched on our behalf , ” she said .
“ I cannot imagine what kind of person would think it is a good idea to smear a couple who have just lost a loving son , ” she said .
The Camerons ’ 6 - year - old son Ivan died in February .
Mahon , who served as a Labour member of parliament for northern English Halifax constituency between 1987 and 2005 , said she had joined Labour as a teenager , but no longer felt there was a place for people like her in the party .

Premium music videos will not be accessible to UK YouTube users YouTube will not reverse its decision to block music videos to UK users despite a plea from the Performing Rights Society to change its mind .
It is removing all premium music videos to UK users after failing to reach a new licensing agreement with the PRS .
Patrick Walker , YouTube 's director of video partnerships said it remained committed to agreeing terms .
But such agreement needed to be done " at a rate which is sustainable to all " , he told the BBC .
Thousands of videos were made unavailable to YouTube users from late on 9 March .
Patrick Walker , YouTube 's director of video partnerships , told BBC News that the move was " regrettable " but that it continued to talk to the PRS .
" The more music videos YouTube streams , and the more popular those music videos are , the more money YouTube will generate to share with the PRS and its song writers .
It 's a win-win arrangement .
YouTube , however , cannot be expected to engage in a business in which it loses money every time a music video is played - that is simply not a sustainable business model . " he said .
Steve Porter , head of the PRS , said he was " outraged ... shocked and disappointed " by YouTube 's decision .
In a statement , Mr Porter said the move " punishes British consumers and the songwriters whose interests we protect and represent " .
The PRS has asked YouTube to reconsider its decision as a " matter of urgency " .
This action has been taken without any consultation with PRS for Music and in the middle of negotiations between the two parties
PRS statement
The body , which represents music publishers , added : " Google has told us they are taking this step because they wish to pay significantly less than at present to the writers of the music on which their service relies , despite the massive increase in YouTube viewing .
" This action has been taken without any consultation with PRS for Music and in the middle of negotiations between the two parties . "
The Music Publishers Association ( MPA ) joined with the PRS is urging Google to rethink .
" Music publishers are in the business of getting their music heard by as wide an audience as possible , and websites such as YouTube rely on this music to attract traffic .
It is difficult to see how anyone 's interests are served by denying the YouTube community the content they most enjoy , " said MPA chief executive Stephen Navin .
Lord Carter , the UK's Minister for Communications , Technology and Broadcasting , has also waded into the debate .
Giving evidence before the Business Select Committee the minister said he suspected a degree of " commercial posturing on the part of both parties " but said the row was indicative of a wider issue .
" It is an example of the question of how do you price and fund content in the digital world ? " he said .
" We have had decades of content being funded in one way - via the license fee and advertising - and that model is changing at a rapid speed , " he told MPs .
Mr Walker told BBC
News the PRS was seeking a rise in fees " many , many factors " higher than the previous agreement .
He said : " We feel we are so far apart that we have to remove content while we continue to negotiate with the PRS . "
" We are making the message public because it will be noticeable to users on the site . "
Consumers must be scratching their heads in amazement at such obstacles to delivering legal content in a timely and straightforward fashion .

The majority of videos will be made inaccessible over the next two days .
YouTube pays a licence to the PRS which covers the streaming of music videos from three of the four major music labels and many independent labels .
Stream online
While deals with individual record labels cover the use of the visual element and sound recording in a music video , firms that want to stream online also have to have a separate deal with music publishers which covers the music and lyrics .
In the UK , the PRS acts as a collecting society on behalf of member publishers for licensing fees relating to use of music .
YouTube stressed that it continued to have " strong partnerships " with three of the four largest record labels in the world .
Mr Walker said the PRS was asking for a " prohibitive " rise in the cost of a new licence .
While not specifying the rate the PRS was seeking , he said : " It has to be a rate that can drive a business model .
We are in the business for the long run and we want to drive the use of online video .
" The rate they are applying would mean we would lose significant amounts of money on every stream of a music video .
It is not a reasonable rate to ask . "
New deal YouTube has also complained of a lack of transparency by the PRS , saying the organisation would not specify exactly which artists would be covered by any new deal .
" That 's like asking a consumer to buy a blank CD without knowing what musicians are on it , " a statement from YouTube UK says on its official blog .
YouTube is the world 's most popular online video site but has been under increased pressure to generate more revenue since its purchase by Google for $ 1.65 bn in 2006 .
" We are not willing to do this [ new licensing deal ] at any cost , " said Mr Walker .
He said the issue was an industry - wide one and not just related to YouTube .
" By setting rates that do n't allow new business models to flourish , nobody wins . "
Services such as Pandora.com , MySpace UK and Imeem have also had issues securing licence deals in the UK in the past 12 months .

Arizona health officials said Friday that they plan to seek more than $ 1 million in federal grant money for abstinence - only education in schools - a reversal from one year ago when then - Gov. Janet Napolitano rejected the funds , saying such programs do n't work .
In choosing to pursue the grant , the state said teen pregnancies and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases among youth are " urgent public - health issues " and the programs are too important to drop .
" Gov. ( Jan ) Brewer believes in abstinence education , " spokesman Paul Senseman said Friday .
" She believes these are very effective programs .
. . .
And with over a million dollars available , she felt this was a good opportunity . "
The revenue stream provides sexual education for more than 20,000 of Arizona 's middle - and high - school - age students each year , officials said .
But while the decision to apply for the funds emphasizes the ideological differences between Brewer and her predecessor , it 's unlikely the move will have a big impact on what 's taught in the classroom - for several reasons .
First , there is speculation that President Barack Obama and the Democratic - led Congress might not reauthorize the grant program , which was highly touted under former President George W. Bush .
Under the program , the state contracts with outside providers responsible for designing the curriculum .
No money actually goes to the schools , and many of the contractors , which include Catholic Charities and the Arizona Youth Partnership , are non-profits eligible for multiple grants through a variety of government programs .
Second , Arizona law is unlikely to change anytime soon .
Existing statutes require public schools to teach abstinence as part of their sexual - education curriculum , but they also leave the door wide open for comprehensive sex education , which includes information about condoms and other forms of contraception .
Individual districts choose how to structure their programs .
The Phoenix Union High School District , for example , offers both approaches , spokesman Craig Pletenik said .
" Compared to some , we may be a bit more progressive , " he said .
" But with the population we serve , we believe it 's our obligation to give the kids all the information we can .
We bring in all different sides of the issue . "
At the federal level , the reauthorization of the grant program is expected to cause political wrangling , particularly in light of a 2007 report that cast doubt on the effectiveness of abstinence - only education .
New data from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention show the teen - birth rate has risen the past two consecutive years .
It had previously declined for 14 straight years .
In Arizona , there are varying viewpoints on how best to educate teens .
But most agree there is cause for concern as the state has one of the nation 's highest teen - pregnancy and teen - birth rates .
" I do n't really get the debate because everyone is after the same goal : to prevent teen pregnancy and the spread of ( sexually transmitted ) diseases , " said Will Humble , interim director of the Arizona Department of Health Services .
" I do n't believe that it should be a ' one size fits all ' philosophy . "
For the coming year , the federal program requires a state match of $ 776,082 .
The match was one of the reasons Napolitano declined the funds last year .
But the Department of Health Services found outside contractors to put up the matching funds , officials said , eliminating any need to pull cash from already - depleted state coffers .

Unless you ’re a one person web shop with no team to collaborate with , you ’ve experienced the frustration that goes along with file sharing .
No matter how hard you try , when multiple people are working on a single project without a version control system in place things get chaotic .
If you work with developers on the buildout and implementation of websites , the merge between front - end templates and back - end functionality can be a scary black hole .
Issues like overwrites , lost files , and the all - too - common “ working off a previous version ” phenomenon crop up constantly .
And once back - end functionality has been put into your templates , you become terrified to touch them for fear of breaking something a developer spent a great deal of time getting to work .
In addition , even if you have a common repository that everyone is pulling from odds are at least one member of your team forgot to grab the latest files and is about to blow things up with their latest additions .
In this article , I ’ll give you a quick review of Git , an excellent version control system .
Version Control – A Quick and Dirty Explanation
Version Control ( also known as Revision Control or Source Control Management ) is a great way to solve the file sharing problem .
The basic concept is this : there is one main repository for all of the project files .
Team members check files out , make changes , and then check them back in ( or commit them ) .
The Version Control System ( VCS ) automatically notes who changed the files , when they were changed , and what about them was new or different .
It also asks you to write a little note about the change so everyone on the project knows at a glance what you did and why .
Each file will then have a revision history so you can easily go back to a previous version of any file if something goes horribly wrong .
A good VCS also allows you to merge changes to the same file .
If you and another person work locally on the same file at the same time , when you push these files back into the main repository the system will merge both sets of changes to create a new and fully up - to - date file .
If any conflicts arise during the merge it will highlight them for you .
You ’re probably using a very crude VCS right now to keep your files straight .
If you ’re a designer , it looks something like this :
This works well enough for PSDs and other large binary files , which do n’t really lend themselves to VCS .
But there ’s a much better way to do it when you are managing the source code for a website .
Benefits to using a Version Control System include :
Files cannot be overwritten
be overwritten
There is a common repository that holds all the latest files
that holds all the latest files People can work on the same files simultaneously without conflict
without conflict
Allows you to revert back to an older version of the file / project if needed
to an older version of the file / project if needed Making your developers very happy
Even if you do n’t work with a team , version control can be a lifesaver .
Backing up files is one of the easiest things you can do to save yourself from losing work or having to start over .
The idea of a VCS seems daunting at first , especially since most of the documentation is written by and for developers .
But once you make the move to incorporate it into your workflow , you ’ll find it ’s not nearly as hard as it looks .
Meet Git
OK , so now you can see why a Version Control System is a must - have for your web team .
If you do a little Googling you ’ll see that there are quite a few options out there including SVN , Mercurial , CVS , Bazaar and Git .
Any one of them could be a good solution for your needs , and I encourage you to do some research before selecting a VCS .
In this article I ’m going to focus on Git , the one I use daily .
It ’s a “ rising star ” that has gained popularity thanks to a strong Linux fanbase , GitHub and the Rails community .
Git is a free open - source Version Control System originally created by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernal development .
Linus is a very smart guy ; when he sets out to solve a problem , he does n’t mess around .
One of Git ’s big differentiators is that unlike SVN and CVS it is a distributed version control system .
This means that every user has a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their machine .
What ’s so great about that ?
A few things :
Everything is local , so you can work offline

Git has a slightly tougher learning curve than SVN , but the tradeoff is worth it .
Just think how impressed your developer friends will be when you tell them you ’re using the new hotness that is Git !
In all seriousness , I do n’t think the learning curve is all that steep .
SVN was equally confusing for me at the start , and I ran into more day - to - day problems when using it .
Installing Git is n’t fun and games .
I was lucky to have a knowledgeable developer willing to help , but there are plenty of resources online to get you through it .
It will run on a PC , Mac or Linux box , although installation for Linux and OSX is considerable easier than for Windows .
You can download the latest version of Git here
Once you have the files , try this quick guide to get you started with the installation process .
For Windows users , this step - by - step visual guide should be helpful .
Mac users , try this guide found on GitHub
Getting Started
Once you have Git installed , you can create your repository .
To turn an existing folder into a Git repository , use the following commands in your Terminal or Command Prompt window :
cd path / to / project git init git add .
git commit
What you ’re telling Git to do is :
Initialize this directory
this directory
Add everything in it – all files and subdirectories
– all files and subdirectories Commit or store , all current changes in the repository
If you hate the command line you can also do this using the Git GUI .
It ’s not the prettiest thing you ’ve ever seen , but it ’s there if you need it .
A Sample Git Workflow
I ’m currently using Git on a Mac to work on a web application with multiple web developers .
We have a “ master ” version of the code that we push our files to , and we each run a full copy locally .
On any given day , my workflow goes something like this :
Fire up Terminal .
Start up my local mysql database ( so the application we ’re building can run locally on my machine ) .
Use Terminal to check out the latest changes by using the “ git pull ” command .
This gets me all the changes made by other team members and checked into our master repository .
Open the project in TextMate and make my changes .
Commit changes and add my notes .
This only commits them locally .
I commit frequently , probably ten or more times a day .
This helps keep me on track .
Push my changes to the master repository using “ git push ” .
Now other team members can check out and see my changes .
You should do this at least once a day or after any major addition .
All of these actions can be done easily through the Terminal window , but I ’m a visual kind of girl .
For that reason , I use GitX , a Git gui for OSX , to make my commits .
I still push and pull through Terminal , but GitX makes it easy for me to organize my commits and wrap my head around what I ’m doing .
At the top , it highlights what change was made to the files .
In the lower left is your list of Unstaged Changes .
To commit them , you drag one or more files to the “ Staged Changes ” area on the right , type in your commit message , and hit the Commit button .
If I flip to the tree view , I can see what has been pushed to the repository .
If my files were not current with the master files , the green and blue tags at the top would be out of sync .
GitNub offers a similar Mac - style interface .
There ’s also a great TextMate bundle available .
With it , you can push , pull , commit , and more without ever leaving TextMate .
It ’s extremely efficient .

T. Boone Pickens ’ kicked off a “ virtual march ” on Washington , D.C. today , organizing the collective power of over 4.5 million people to flood Congress with e-mails , calls and faxes in support of clean energy .
The virtual march will wrap up on Friday , but between now and then , march organizers are mobilizing Pickens ’ New Energy Army to voice support for the Pickens Plan , including a bill introduced just today into the House of Representatives called the NAT GAS Act .
“ I applaud Congressmen Boren , Larson , and Sullivan for introducing the NAT GAS Act today .
In doing so , they ’re showing that a bi-partisan approach to energy policy is not only possible , but do - able , ” said Pickens in a statement .
Pickens will be in Washington this week , attending meetings , bill introductions , press conferences and meeting with the news media .

Pickens ’ Virtual March is not the only virtual political action to take place in recent months .
Those who were interested in following the COP14 UN Climate talks in Poznan , Poland in December of 2008 could attend the conference virtually .
The benefits of participating in virtual political action include : reduced energy use ( smaller carbon footprint ) ; lower overall cost , and ; generally lowering the barriers to entry for those who might not otherwise be able to attend .
Whether a virtual march is as effective as a real march is not the important issue from my perspective .
Pickens has once again shown his ability to make a big splash with his Pickens Plan campaign , this time using the unprecedented tactic of a virtual march .
Whether you are hip with the Pickens Plan or not , his creativity should be applauded .

Other phrases about :
What 's the meaning of the phrase ' Eat humble pie ' ?
Act submissively and apologetically , especially in admitting an error .
What 's the origin of the phrase ' Eat humble pie ' ?
Umbles , aprons and newts ; what have they in common ?
Umbles , aprons and newts ; what have they in common ?
In the USA , since the mid 19th century , anyone who had occasion to ' eat his words ' by humiliatingly recanting something would be said to ' eat crow ' ( previously 'eat boiled crow ' ) .
In the UK we 'eat humble pie ' .
The unpalatability of crow , boiled or otherwise , seems clear , but what about humble pie ?
In the 14th century , the numbles ( or noumbles , nomblys , noubles ) was the name given to the heart , liver , entrails etc. of animals , especially of deer - what we now call offal or lights .
By the 15th century this had migrated to umbles , although the words co-existed for some time .
There are many references to both words in Old English and Middle English texts from 1330 onward .
Umbles were used as an ingredient in pies , although the first record of ' umble pie ' in print is as late as the 17th century .
Samuel Pepys makes many references to such pies in his diary ; for example , on 5th July 1662 :
" I having some venison given me a day or two ago , and so I had a shoulder roasted , another baked , and the umbles baked in a pie , and all very well done . "
and on 8th July 1663 :
" Mrs Turner came in and did bring us an Umble - pie hot out of her oven , extraordinarily good . "
It is possible that it was the pies that caused the move from numbles to umbles .
' A numble pie ' could easily have become an umble pie ' , in the same way that ' a napron ' became ' an apron ' and ' an ewt ' became ' a newt ' .
This changing of the boundaries between words is called metanalysis and is commonplace in English .
The adjective humble , meaning ' of lowly rank ' or ' having a low estimate of oneself ' derived separately from umbles , which derives from Latin and Old French words for loins .
( Incidentally , if you feel like girding your loins and are n't sure exactly where they are , the OED coyly describes them as ' the parts of the body that should covered with clothing ' ) .
The similarity of the sound of the words , and the fact that umble pie was often eaten by those of humble situation could easily have been the reason for ' eat humble pie ' to have come to have its current idiomatic meaning .
He has truly gone off the deep end , folks .
THIS is his spin on the whole thing ?
He 's actually trying to paint the pirates as the VICTIMS now ??
Dear Lord .
Sorry , I know it 's not much of a diary , but I do n't even know what to do with this one .
Up next : " Adolph Hitler : Misunderstood artist ? "
Update : H/T to wyvern in the comments below for this gem :
Now , just imagine the hue and cry had a Republican president ordered the shooting of black teenagers on the high seas
There would be 5 results : -- For years to come , the " shooting of black teenagers " ( known as " pirates " to everybody who does n't have their head up their asses ) would become a campaign talking point for the Republican president .
-- The Republican president would dispatch 4 dozen meatpuppets to saturate the TV media ; their mission would be to extol the warrior machismo displayed by the president .
Rush Limbaugh would be kissing the fictional Republican president 's ass all day everyday in his radio booth .
-- The Republican president would officially sanction Samolian pirates as " terrorists just as dangerous of Al - Qeada . "
-- Bill Kristol & his ilk would pressure said Republican president to invade Somalia .
There would be a 50/50 chance the Republican president would comply .
Update x2 : Well , since I 've hit the Rec list and all , let me use this opportunity to also pimp my diary from YESTERDAY :
Weekly Obameter : 11.7 % of promises kept in the first 5.8 % of term !
( updated every Tuesday morning , for future reference !!)
Update x3 : There 's some discussion in the comments that Limbaugh may have been being sarcastic , ie , that he was actually parodying Al Sharpton , who in turn had noted that the pirates refer to themselves as a " voluntary coast guard " or some such nonsense .
I suppose this is conceivable ; you 'd have to actually listen to the voice inflection and tone of the audio to be certain ( ie , to tell whether there 's a sarcastic tone ) .
However , there 's no way in hell that I 'm subscribing to his drivel , so I 'll leave it up to others to make this call .
What I can say is that given Rush Limbaugh 's record of absurd , offensive and flat - out outrageous statements , I 'm not exactly inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt .
Update x4 : OK , I 've thought about this a bit , and realized that even if this was an attempt at irony / sarcasm ( ie , comparing the response to how the Left would respond if Bush had been the one who ordered the shootings ) , it 's still way off target for one simple reason : Bush enjoyed a 90 % + approval rating for about 6 months after 9/11 .
Hardly anyone bitched about him invading Afghanistan and going after Al Queda and bin Laden , since that 's , you know , the guy who attacked us .
It was n't until he let bin Laden go loose and turned to Iraq that " the Left " started to criticize .
In other words , if Obama had decided to respond to the Somalian Pirate situation by , say , ordering an air strike on Oklahoma , I 'd certainly understand the Right ( or anyone , for that matter ) being critical about it .

First off , it is highly illegal and incredibly stupid to cheat on your taxes .
This is n't to say that no one does it , but it 's important to stress this point strongly off the top .
See , the thing about an audit by the Internal Revenue Service is this : it 's nothing like being arrested , where you 're innocent until proven guilty .
It 's just the opposite .
When the IRS comes a - knocking you 're guilty until you can prove yourself innocent .
But with such a tiny fraction of returns audited each year this does n't mean people are n't out there looking for shady ways to pare down their tax burden .
" A lot of tax evaders come to my site , " says Kelly Phillips Erb , the highly ethical tax attorney who runs the blog Taxgirl.com .
" And I let people talk about it because I find it interesting , and I find their logic interesting . "
So do we .
And with April 15 less than a week away , we ran a couple tax - dodge tactics by Erb to see what she thought .
Tactic : Not Reporting Your Gambling Winnings
href= " http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/07/54dae3e7806e8_-_f1098c.pdf "
The law requires that you report every penny you win gambling , even if it seems like charity ( say , those wrinkled twenties your drunk buddies reliably fork over chasing low pairs ) .
But while small at - home winnings are easily concealed , if you win more than $ 600 at the track or $ 1,200 from a slot machine , the casino will force you to fill out Form W - 2G declaring that income to the IRS which means you can't hide your big payday .
This is n't to say you can't lessen the tax hit .
" You can actually deduct gambling losses , " Erb says .
" But you can only take them against your winnings .
So if you have a sucky year , you 're kind of out of luck . "
A tip :
If you 're going to write down losses ( or feel the urge to declare those winnings , especially if you win a lot ) , make sure you keep a journal , including the date , time and location you were gambling , along with the amount lost and who was with you .
It 'll come in handy later , if you 're ever audited .
Tactic : Inventing a Dependent
iStockPhoto
Who 's to say how many children really depend on that sweet , sweet taxable income or yours for survival ?
" I had a bunch of people send me e-mails this year [ through my blog ] where they cheated on their 2007 returns by claiming dependents that either were n't real or were n't theirs so they could claim more stimulus because there was an unlimited number of children you could claim for stimulus checks , " Erb says .
In fact , fabricating dependents was such an issue , that when the IRS finally forced people to write down the Social Security numbers of the children they were claiming in 1987 , they found 7 million fewer dependents that year .
Like cheating in any relationship , the key to keeping Uncle Sam in the dark about his imaginary nieces and nephews is keeping the story consistent .
" If for ten years you claimed no children , one year you claim ten dependents , and then the next year you do n't claim anything , then , yeah , that 's going to raise their eyebrows , " Erb says .
" Either you 're hanging out with the octuplet mom for a year and then leaving , or there 's something else going on . "
Aside from your basic tax fraud , bear in mind that inventing people enters other Patriot Bill - era danger - zones , like swiping Social Security numbers .
Probably a real dumb idea to do this one aggressively .
Tactic : Giving ' A Lot ' to ' Charity '
iStockPhoto
If you should n't make up kids , it stands to reason that inventing charities is an equally boneheaded idea .
The IRS keeps a list of organizations eligible to receive tax - deductible charitable contributions and cross-references your donations against it , so no matter how hard up you feel at the moment , the IRS does n't consider self - love charity .
It 's equally challenging to invent large donations to these organizations .
( Although when you 're filling in the " VALUE " box on the Goodwill receipt for those sweater - filled trash bags , remember : any donations under $ 500 , and the IRS generally takes your word for it .
Anything over , and you 'll need an appraisal . )
" For things like cars , they 've changed the rules , " Erb says , " so you ca n't just donate a car and say how much you think it 's worth anymore . "
In the old days , you could just claim the Blue Book value of your car , buy now it 's only worth what someone else will pay for it .
In other words : say you donate a car that 's got a book value of $ 10,000 , but the charity can only sell it for $ 5,000 ?
You can't claim a $ 10,000 deduction .
To claim a deduction for the car ( or boat , or airplane ) , you 'll need to attach Form 1098 - C , which is basically a receipt of sale the charity will give you after selling your car .
You 'll just have to find another way to make up that $ 5,000 .
Ten bags of sweaters could do it .
Tactic : You Have a Very Expensive ' Home Office '
iStockPhoto
Bring work home ?
You can deduct rent , utilities , anything for a home office that and this is important is a place exclusively set aside to conduct business .
" You can't claim a home office deduction for your kitchen if you also cook on the same counter , " Erb says .
" Now if you have a small space in your kitchen where you only do your work , then that might qualify . "
This means that you can deduct some ( but not all ) of your rent and mortgage , it is not a license to go hog wild and deduct everything .
Like , say , your home phone line .
For whatever reason , even if you only have one and use it only to conduct business , the IRS views your home phone line as a personal expense .
You can deduct call waiting , call forwarding , voice mail , but not the original line .
A good rule of thumb here is to never write off more in expenses than you make and rarely write off 100 percent of the value of something toward a home office deduction these could be red flags .
If you want to make sure that your home office is audit proof , the IRS has a handy ( and because it's the IRS , also endless ) document , Publication 587 , chockfull of so many worksheets and forms you 'll feel like you 're back in elementary school .
Tactic : Just Don't Pay
iStockPhoto
Ah , the good ol ' Wesley Snipes " fuck 'em !! ! " approach , where you just simply opt out of this whole taxes thing and hope it all works out .
" Yeah , a lot of those people end up in jail , " Erb says .
Unless you 're a suspected mob boss and they can't nail you any other way , the IRS is usually not that interested in imprisoning people for tax evasion .
Like any good shakedown artist , they just want their money .
So you 'll likely file your taxes , pay a hefty penalty , and move on with a black mark on your permanent record .
Forgetting , poor math skills , being in a coma for six months ... these things happen .
" But the people who willfully evade taxation , who choose not to file , you can do jail time for that , " says Erb .
So if you 're very rich or very a prominent human in the world of music , movies , law , business , you might want to get cracking on those taxes .
Sure , it 's only a crime if you do n't get caught , but if you do , the IRS will use you to send a message to all the other non-famous tax cheats and they 're going to nail your ass to the wall .

In this file photo Madonna arrives for the premiere of the film " I Am Because We Are " during the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival in New York April 24 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - U.S. singer and actress Madonna was thrown from a horse and suffered minor injuries on Saturday after the animal was startled by photographers on New York ’s Long Island , her spokeswoman said .
The 50 - year - old entertainer was later released from a hospital with minor injuries and bruises , spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg said in a statement .
“ The accident occurred when the horse Madonna was riding was startled by paparazzi who jumped out of the bushes to photograph the singer who was visiting friends on Eastern Long Island over the weekend , ” the statement said .
It added she would be having further tests and remained under observation by doctors .
One thing is always recommended for maximizing the chances of a successful claim for the claimants and that is the consultancy with the expert lawyers .
This step is being declared by the law experts as the most significant one that counts a lot for the claim and the claimant .
Whether it is going to be an out of the court settlement or the legal claim proceedings , the claimant is always advised to get in touch with an expert and a specialist personal injury lawyer .
Well , it has strong reasons for this recommendation .
Though there are those claimants as well who do not get in contact with the professional lawyer to get the consultancy when going for the settlements , they think that they can do this on their own and they do not want t get involved on the lengthy nod nerve shattering law procedures being followed by the lawyers .
But , most of them have to acknowledge that despite having a lot of the information related to the compensation claim procedures , they cannot surpass the expertise of a skilled lawyer .
They may b lured into accepting the offer by the third party insurers that is far low than they deserve but in the presence and under the guidance of a lawyer , this cannot happen to them .
The guidance of an Injury lawyer adds a lot to the strength of the case .
It is to be kept in mind that the lawyer is required to be a professional one dealing in the field of personal injury claims .
The consultancy being done with him results in favorable outcomes for the claimant like
· The accurate determination of the extent of the fault
· The estimation of the compensation claim
· Negotiations with the third party insurers
· Getting all the proofs lined up in the favor of the claimant
· Presenting the case with full confidence and sincerity , proving the fault of the responsible one that results in a successful compensation claim for the claimant .
These are the expertise being practiced by a professionally skilled lawyer who needs to be consulted by the victims of personal injury cases .
He is supposed to lift up all the burden of the responsibility from the claimant , leaving him calm and cool .
A specialist lawyer maneuvers the case in the best possible manner in the favor of the claimant .
Right from the very basic steps to the final stages , a skilled lawyer is the one who steers the case in the right direction and help the claimant in winning it eventually .

I was asked to go on Hardball on Tuesday night to discuss the news that Spanish prosecutors are likely to recommend a full investigation be conducted to determine if six former Bush administration officials — including ex-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales — ought to be indicted for having sanctioned torture at Guantanamo .
So I thought I ’d ask White House press secretary Robert Gibbs about the matter .
This could become a true headache for the White House — a high - profile case in which Spanish prosecutors bring charges against Gonzales ; Douglas Feith , former undersecretary of defense ; David Addington , former counsel to Vice President Dick Cheney ; William Haynes , a former Pentagon lawyer ; and John Yoo and Jay Bybee , two former Justice Department officials .
Several steps must occur before any prosecution proceeds .
If the prosecutors determine a full criminal investigation is warranted –as is expected –it will be up to a Spanish judge to open a full - fledged inquiry that could produce indictments .
He could decide not to accept the recommendation .
And , of course , it ’s possible that an investigation could end without indictments .
The Spanish hook for the case is a simple one : Five Guantanamo detainees were either Spanish citizens or residents .
And , by the way , Spanish courts claim jurisdiction that extends to other nations when it comes to torture and war crimes .
What would the Obama administration do , if the Spanish judge currently overseeing the Bush Six case , Baltasar Garzon ( who is famous for pursuing terrorists and for having chased after Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet ) , greenlights the investigation ?
At the Tuesday afternoon White House daily briefing , I asked Gibbs if the administration would cooperate with any requests from the Spaniards for information and documents .
He had a predictable response : “ I do n’t want to get involved in hypotheticals . ”
He quickly pivoted to point out that Obama has moved to prohibit torture at Gitmo and elsewhere .
I posed a follow - up : Have you spoken to the Spanish government about this case ?
He seized on my use of the word “ you ” and , with a broad smile , said , “ I have not spoken with the Spanish . ”
Reporters in the room laughed .
I obviously did not mean him personally ; the “ you ” had referred to the Obama administration .
Nor did I mean , I added , Bill Burton , the deputy press secretary , or any of the other press aides in the room .
The point was whether the administration had been in contact with the Spanish government about the Bush Six investigation .
“ The Justice Department ? ” I asked .
Gibbs , though , essentially brushed off the question : “ I would send you to Justice .
Like I said , I ’ve not spoken ” to the Spanish government .
That , too , was to be expected .
Often White House press secretaries say , take your query elsewhere .
Yet moments later , when a reporter asked Gibbs if Obama had any reaction to the conservative groups organizing “ tea parties ” of protest on tax day , he replied , “ I ’ve never monitored them nor spoken with the Spanish about them . ”
People in the room laughed .
And when the questioning in the room turned to the all - important subject of the Obama ’s new Portuguese water dog , Gibbs continued the joke .
Noting that the dog might be spotted on the White House lawn later in the day or that it might not , he added that “ the dog has also not talked to the Spanish about impending torture cases . ”
More laughter .
But I wondered , had the press secretary just made a joke about a torture investigation ?
Gibbs , like other press secretaries , uses humor to disarm , deflect , or dodge .
But was this untoward ?
The president and his aides do not seem eager to investigate the alleged misdeeds of the Bush - Cheney administration .
The political calculation is obvious and not without justification :
There ’s a lot of hard stuff to get done these days and probing former Bush officials could be seen as a distraction and possibly undermine political support for the administration and Democrats in Congress .
But such political figuring may not influence the independent Spanish judicial system and Judge Garzon ( who has been asked by Spanish prosecutors not to continue handling the Bush Six case because he is already overseeing terrorist prosecutions against these ex-Gitmo detainees ) .
If an investigation proceeds , Obama could well have to decide whether or not to comply with Spanish requests for US government documents –that is , to help or hinder the investigation .
Later in the process , Obama could even conceivably have to contend with extradition requests .
If any of this comes to pass , it wo n’t then be a laughing matter .
AIG may have benefited foreign banks by up to 70 % .
I am told in some cases that these U.S. banks are being asked to accept reductions of over 70 % of the total debt owed to them .
In a letter released by Barney Frank , the Chairman of the Committee of House Financial Services is requesting information from Geithner and Bernanke as to how AIG may have treated its U.S. bank counterparties differently from foreign banks .
Frank is referencing a letter by Spencer Bachus in which the latter raises yet another aspect of the AIG debacle , namely that disproportionate treatment byBachus claims that " in contrast with [ AIG's ] treatment of foreign banks [ which were not asked to reduce the sum they received from AIG by any amount whatsoever ] , AIG is now attempting to force many of its creditors that are U.S. banks to accept severe reductions in the debt owed to them .
The disparity in treatment between foreign banks and U.S. banks is troubling , particularly since the U.S. banks now being asked to take such reductions are some of the very taxpayers that have been funding AIG .
In addition to the clear inequity involved , this conduct obviously runs counter to our efforts to stimulate credit in the U.S. economy through bank lending .
" While not at the core of the problem Zero Hedge discussed previously about improper liquidations from a " stable company " generating abnormal profits at banks , any discovery in this inquiry could potentially raise yet another significant problem , namely how the U.S. is willing to bend over backwards to not displease foreign entities ( and potentially purchasers of U.S. treasuries ) at the expense of domestic banks .
Then again , if ZH is correct in its prior claims , AIG made sure that even its U.S. counterparties would be more than compensated for any losses they may have had to taken on the abovementioned obligation discounts .
And all of this would occur , of course , with U.S. taxpayers footing the bill as is standard these days .
The Super Bowl has existed for more than 40 years dating all way back to 1967 .
The Super Bowl is the ultimate NFL football show down between the champions of the American Football Conference and the National Football Conference .
The Super Bowl is probably the most viewed televised program run every year .
Some of the advertisement slots are so sought after that companies are willing to pay a million dollars for a 30 second advertisement .
Millions of Americans gather annually to throw Super Bowl parties to drink beer , eat junk food and cheer on their favorite team .

Fun Fact :
In the history of the Super Bowl , no home team has ever played in their home stadium !
I just checked these out at Cabella 's today .
The sales man showed me one when I was looking at some Surefires and my first thought was " It 's an Energizer ! " .
Well , I decided to humor the guy and picked up the Night Strike Compact 1 AA version , all I can say is WOW !
This light is not at all what I expected from Energizer .
Folks these guys have jumped up a class or two .
If you have n't given these lights a look ... you should .
I 'm buying one after my wallet cools off a bit
Global warming is in the news once more .
Following more calls to change the way we live , to protect the earths resources * and do n't get me wrong , I am all for recycling and not wasting as much as we do as a country , but its wrong to make me pay more for doing the right thing , but thats another post for another day * but it seems that until there can be a definitive answer to the questions and scientific data that is being quoted then who do we believe ?
And how much more is it going to cost us to come to the conclusion that no one really knows what is actually happening ?
Global Warming Teach -In
Global warming is not a crisis , but it may be creating a crisis of intellectual integrity .
By Jane S. Shaw
Last month , college campuses held a “ National Teach - in on Global Warming Solutions . ”
The thrust of the message was that there is a crisis because global temperatures are rising , endangering the world ’s future , and humans are to blame .
I agree that there may be a crisis , but I do n’t believe that it is a crisis of impending heat ; it is , rather , a crisis of intellectual integrity .
First , let me point out something that most people may not realize .
Since 1998 , there has been no trend in world temperatures , neither up nor down , in spite of population growth , greater resource use , and lots of carbon dioxide production .
True , 1998 , was the warmest year on record , and we are still in a warm period , but world temperatures are no higher than when today ’s college seniors began middle school .
The likelihood of the catastrophic effects that gave Al Gore a Nobel Peace Prize is weak .
We do n’t know who AIG ’s counter parties were , i.e. , who got the money .
And the folks at the Fed and the Treasury are n’t saying .
But there are a lot of snippets and shreds of information out there that do allow us to get a decent picture of who some of the major beneficiaries are .
Zack Roth has the details in this piece today at TPMmuckraker .
And then there ’s this from a close observer of the AIG matter …
Josh , your reporting on the AIG credit default swap / counterparties issue has been spot-on .
But to understand what happened there , you have to understand the Fed ’s “ Maiden Lane ” vehicles and how it ’s used them to avoid what Congress intended with TARP , which was the real story that came out of Dodd ’s hearing on the AIG mess today .
And the roots of it go back to the Bear Stearns rescue last year .
By law , the Fed is n’t allowed to buy assets — it can only lend , as lender of last resort .
That was a problem for the Bear Stearns bailout , because JP Morgan said it would only buy Bear if someone else assumed responsibility for the crap .
Fed came up with this idea to start a shadow company , called a special purpose vehicle ( SPVs were how Enron operated , creating “ Chewco ” and the like named after Chewbacca – the New York Fed called their SPV “ Maiden Lane LLC ” for name of the street the NY Fed is located on in southern Manhattan ) .
The deal then was JP Morgan put $ 1 billion into Maiden Lane , the Fed put $ 29 billion in cash into it .
Maiden Lane paid Bear Stearns $ 30 billion , which went straight back to JP Morgan as this deal happened simultaneously to JP ’s purchase of Bear .
So Morgan got $ 30 billion in cash ( $ 29 billion net ) and the Fed got stuck owning the crap , but was legally only making a loan to Maiden Lane , who was the legal owner ( Maiden Lane was incorporated not in NYC , but in Delaware to avoid paying taxes ) .
By the Fed ’s own accounting – which is very different from a real company ’s accounting – Maiden Lane has lost $ 5 billion between its creation and today .
The same problem happened in AIG , but this time there was no buyer .
In Sept , the Fed bought AIG ( 80 % ) in exchange for an $ 85 bill loan .
By Oct , it was clear AIG was still dying , so the Fed lent it another $ 40 billion .
This $ 40 billion was restructured in November when the Treasury put in $ 40 billion of TARP funds , which was needed to bail out the Fed ’s loan which had by this time gone bad .
But essentially AIG had 2 problems : it had lent out safe securities with real values and used that money to buy shit mortgage backed securities — this was called ‘ Secured Lending Facility ’ which was done right under the nose of the state insurance commissioners .
It was in the hole $ 20 billion .
The other problem was the crappy insurance that AIG ’s financial products company had written on other people ’s shit mortgage backed securities – the credit default swaps ( CDS ) .
When the bad mortgages that AIG insured went bad , the insurance had to pay - up — but because it was n’t called insurance , but rather derivatives , AIG had n’t reserved any money against it .
This had lost about $ 25 billion .
Using the loophole it had learned during Bear Stearns , the Fed set up two new companies : Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III .
Two dealt with the secured lending and Three the shitty credit default swaps .
The Fed lent each Maiden Lane $ 20 billion and $ 25 billion and then Maiden Lane paid off the investors that had either lent AIG the money to buy the shitty mortgage backed securities ( ML II ) and those who had the shitty mortgages and the corresponding insurance ( ML III ) .
To avoid booking a loss on the Fed ’s balance sheet , because the Fed had some legal problems if either of these Maiden Lanes lost money , and because of a reporting requirement that Dodd had put into TARP which actually required the Fed to report to the Congress and the public about the cost to taxpayers from ML I , the Fed did some creative accounting .
They still paid all of the investors off at full value ( par ) , so that they did n’t lose anything .
But they booked the loss on AIG ’s balance sheet and kept Maiden Lane clean .
This is the hidden story behind how AIG went from losing $ 38 billion during the first 9 months of 2008 to losing $ 61 billion in the 4th quarter .
This was all exposed at today ’s hearing .
And despite repeated requests from Senators on both sides – Dodd , Shelby , Corker , Warner – the Fed is still refusing to say who it bailed out through Maiden Lane II and III .
You may say no big deal but .....
Mrs. Feinstein 's intervention on behalf of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was unusual : the California Democrat is n't a member of the Senate Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs with jurisdiction over FDIC ; and the agency is supposed to operate from money it raises from bank - paid insurance payments - not direct federal dollars .
This looks bad - how are we going to hold onto majorities in Congress if we accept this type behavior - I for one do not want a new " Culture of Corruption " under Democratic leadership taking place .
When statements like that have been made , you open your flank for criticism and hypocracy if Democrats engage in poor ethical behavior .
To me , this is unacceptable .
I urge all to contact their Senators and Representatives and tell them that this behavior will not be tolerated .

Once again , its appears Perl Monks may benefit if I link out to a useful tool that somehow has never been mentioned within our abbey .
Many of us likely have used Perl to manipulate speadsheets , either as CSV , or using one of the Spreadsheet : modules from CPAN .
But how many of us use Perl One - Liners to manipulate MS Excel Spreadsheets ?
Can you do this ...
Yes You Can , with XLSPerl http://perl.jonallen.info/projects/xlstools
While not the most elegant solution I am sure , I have worked up a short example .
The code below reads " Sheet1 " and prints the value of cells in column " F " each time a unique value is discovered .
This has the effect of ' deduping ' , or removing duplicates .
xlsperl - nle " $ val=$_ ; if ( $ WS eq q( Sheet1 ) && $ COL eq q( F ) ) {unless ( $ found{$val} ) {print qq( $val ) }$found{$val} ++} " Contacts.xls
Note the use of q( ) and qq ( ) to account for the requirement under Windows to use double quotes on the command line .
I was wondering if anyone else can share their XLS one - liners , particularly if my musings have prompted you to experiment with XLSperl for the first time !
Those deft enough to execute the hack within cmd.exe deserve extra cudos .
Please reply with your wizardly one - liners , or if you merely came with an opinion , offer a well written one ... -- Patrick spectre#9 --

Re : MS Excel One - Liner Challenge
( Chancellor ) on Apr 22 , 2009 at 09:11 UTC by graff on Apr 22 , 2009 at 09:11 UTC I 'm impressed .
I see that XLSperl even does the right thing when cells contain unicode characters !
I managed to find one issue that seems to limit the usefulness of the " XLSprint " function : it looks like it should be easy to do one - liner editing to create a modified xls file , like this : XLSperl - lane 's/fubar/foobar / for(@F ) ; XLSprint @ F ' < old.xls > new.x + ls [ download ] and that does in fact work well -- except when the input xls file has two or more non-empty worksheets one or more non-empty worksheets with a name other than " Sheet1 " , in which case all worksheets get glommed together into " Sheet1 " in the output xls file .
( If there is a way to preserve worksheet names and boundaries in this sort of edit proces , someone please enlighten me . )
I noticed the problem when trying verify the results of such an edit process , using a one - liner like this : XLSperl - lne ' $h { " $ WS : $CELL : $ _" }++;END {print for ( grep { $h{ $_}==1} key + s %h ) } ' old.xls new.xls [ download ]
That turns out to be very handy for listing cell - value differences between two xls files -- provided that they both contain the same worksheets and are mostly similar except for value differences in particular cells .
But if the two files do n't have the same quantity and names of worksheets , this sort of comparison is useless ( or rather , it reports an awful lot of diffs , which actually makes it good for discovering problems , like the loss of worksheet boundaries caused by simple cell - editing operations . )
UPDATE : Here 's a slightly more verbose but more informative version of the one - liner for comparing two xls files : XLSperl - lne ' $h { " $ WS : $ CELL :$ _ " }.= " in $ ARGV " ; END {print " $ _ ( $ h{$_} ) " for ( grep{$h{$_}!~/\.xlsin
/ }sort keys %h) } ' + a.xls b.xls [ download ]
It sorts the cells in the output listing , and tells which file contained each of the unique cell values .

I truly like the ' find differences ' functionality you illustrate in the second code block .
This is exactly the sort of contribution I am seeking !
Thank you .
-- Patrick UPDATE :
The use of END in the second and third examples above is something that , despite 15 years of Perl usage , I have never employed .
Therefore this monk has been bless with a serendiptous enlightenment from his Meditation .

The sparring between the United States and Israel has begun , and that ’s a good thing .
Israel ’s interests are not served by an uncritical American administration .
The Jewish state emerged less secure and less loved from Washington ’s post - 9/11 Israel - can - do - no - wrong policy .
The criticism of the center - right government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come from an unlikely source : Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
She ’s transitioned with aplomb from the calculation of her interests that she made as a senator from New York to a cool assessment of U.S. interests .
These do not always coincide with Israel’s .
I hear that Clinton was shocked by what she saw on her visit last month to the West Bank .
This is not surprising .
The transition from Israel ’s first - world hustle - bustle to the donkeys , carts and idle people beyond the separation wall is brutal .
If Clinton cares about one thing , it ’s human suffering .
In fact , you do n’t so much drive into the Palestinian territories these days as sink into them .
Everything , except the Jewish settlers ’ cars on fenced settlers - only highways , slows down .
The buzz of business gives way to the clunking of hammers .
Without presuming to psychoanalyse Damian McBride , I imagine he is upset about the way he has been condemned by colleagues he recently believed to be friends .
Has he considered therapy to help deal with feelings which may surface in the shape of obscenities , incontinent rage or other forms of unacceptable behaviour ?
By way of a first step , he might want to consult a new work by one of the country 's best - known psychotherapists .
" If you are beset by clouds , do not despair , " writes Derek Draper , in a characteristic line from Life Support .
" It may be hard to believe , but behind them your own personal sun is still shining , waiting to burst through . "
None the less , Mr McBride will want to delve deeper into his " negative dynamics " , as Draper calls them in a chapter called " Dealing with the Past " .
Are we talking about all - round gittishness here ?
Or could we be dealing with something buried in McBride 's childhood ?
From his own trusted supervisor , Susie Orbach , Mr Draper says he has learnt to ask , in a negative dynamic situation , if " anything else might be going on " .
In Draper 's case , he and Susie were trying to understand feelings of hostility towards Tony Blair , a man who was once his friend .
" So if you find yourself in a similar cycle of conflict , try and step aside from it for a moment and ask yourself that question : what does this person ( or thing ) mean to me ? "
With a bit of effort , McBride may not need to undergo therapy .
" Some people , " writes Draper , " find that writing down their thoughts and feelings , either in a journal or just on a piece of paper , can stimulate greater understanding of why we do what we do . "
In his case , routes to self - knowledge include the multiple , cross-referenced promotional identities featured on derekdraper.net and his contributions on LabourList , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube , his incessant interventions on rival blogs ( " I ask that you correct your original post by midday today or I will place this matter in the hands of my lawyers Schillings " ) and the Draper - packed pages of Life Support
However useless this assortment of banalities might be , Draper presumably derives comfort from setting down thoughts and feelings about himself : his fascination with celebrities , for instance , his birthday musings ( " happy birthday to me ! " ) or his agonies over a " major rejection " .
" Prior to that moment I 'd been on a high , " he writes , in " Being Popular " , after being excluded from the Murdoch party at Labour 's conference .
" A rejection like this can puncture our self - possession . "
People who have suffered similar episodes of negative invitation may feel that an absurd oversensitivity on this point makes Draper the ideal psychotherapist for them .
As Draper says : " We are healers , not heroes " and : " There will be occasions when we are struggling with our own issues while trying to help our patients . "
But still , given the explosion of demand for psychotherapy and the haphazard regulation of its 50,000 practitioners , it seems reasonable to ask how often and to what extent a healer is allowed to be reprehensible .
We may accept a therapist who is , from time to time , bullying , boastful , greedy , shallow , self - obsessed , vulgar , unprincipled , childish and hypocritical .
But should it be possible for Draper to work in mental health now he is known to endorse the use of mental health rumours as not merely an acceptable political weapon , but " absolutely totally brilliant , Damian " ?
The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy , BACP , of which Draper is a member , will respond to complaints that he has contravened its ethics .
Although ( perhaps because it is thought to be confined to novels by Wilkie Collins ) there does not seem to be an explicit prohibition against false allegations of madness , a list of desired " personal moral qualities " includes those of empathy and humility .
But in the event that the BACP did exclude Draper , it would be possible for him to continue to practise as a psychotherapist or counsellor , since neither term is protected .
Anyone in need of podiatry , on the other hand , can be reassured that Draper will never be allowed to mess with their feet .
An end to his BACP membership would require only minimal adjustments to a professional website in which Draper is opaque about his therapeutic approach .
" The kind of therapy I practise rests on the interaction between two people as it unfolds in the therapy room , " he says , mysteriously .
" I urge you to take that difficult first step and bring whatever is on your mind directly to me . "
Well , Derek , what 's on my mind is this : does anyone with a problem deserve to have you , after your second public disgrace , as their psychotherapist ?
Is there no presumption , in your line of therapy , of an enhanced degree of self - knowledge on the part of the healer ?
I notice that even though you have apologised to Labour supporters for " juvenile " emails , presumably written by your inner child , there has been , as yet , no similar courtesy to fellow practitioners of your day job .
Admittedly , to listen to some of his colleagues , the inherent unpredictability of an hour with Draper would be part of the attraction of a therapeutic process that lies beyond definition , let alone questions of qualifications , conduct or humdrum notions of " feeling better " .
A government project to bring all psychotherapists and counsellors under statutory regulation has recently inspired an argument about the nature of talking treatments that is as revealing as it is bitter , even by the impressive attritional standards of the psychotherapeutic community .
Negotiations between psychotherapists and their designated regulator , the Health Professions Council , had no sooner begun last year than anti-regulator Denis Postle compared participating clinicians to Nazi collaborators in Vichy France .
A pained Mark Seale , chief executive of HPC , said he did not expect a spokesman claiming to represent " a caring profession " to resort to " offensive and demeaning propaganda " .
The therapist retorted that " caring profession " had nothing to do with it .
" My occupation is personal and professional development , with a special emphasis on group process . "
Anyway , so far as an outsider can understand it , the camps are currently divided into 1 ) an alliance of psychotherapists who accept , grudgingly , the argument for protecting vulnerable patients ; and 2 ) an alliance of psychotherapists who believe it is not in the nature of talking treatments to be susceptible to state - imposed regulation .
" Psychotherapy and counselling , " says the anti-alliance , " though usually helpful , are inherently ' risky ' ; they can not be made to conform to safety - first culture . "
It seems unlikely , then , that any of Draper 's clients will be able to get their money back on the grounds of proven non-empathy , even if it was Mrs George Osborne and not them he had hoped to pass off as loopy .
But - see the sun bursting through - his untouchability as a psychotherapist provides one of the clearest arguments possible for the proper regulation of talking treatments .
And that is absolutely totally brilliant , Derek .
As of this morning , Michael Phelps has been chastised by the U.S. Olympic Committee , his sponsor Kellogg , USA Swimming , and a few of the more annoyingly puritan members of the media .
Most egregious , however , is the rumor that Sheriff Leon Lott of Richland County , where Phelps apparently took his bong rips , will press charges if it ’s proven that a crime took place .
Lott even says Phelps ’ apology constitutes a “ partial confession . ”
Setting aside the fact that , depending on whose poll you read , roughly half the country has admitted to smoking weed at one time or another , this “ crime ” is , by a huge margin , the second - most dangerous youthful misstep that Phelps has taken in his public life ; as far as role - model misdeeds go , driving under the influence trumps getting high at a party every time .
And yet , unsurprisingly , the incident has sparked a sequence of self - righteousness and forced repentance not seen since Don Imus ’ commentary on the Rutgers Women ’s basketball team .
Kathleen Parker provided the most intelligent commentary on this non-issue I ’ve yet read ( barring Joe MacLeod ) , including the correct observation that “ [ w ] ere Phelps to run for public office someday and admit to having smoked pot in his youth , he would be forgiven .
Yet , in the present , we impose monstrous expectations on our heroes . ”
Parker notes that the list of reputable Americans who have admitted to smoking marijuana includes our current president .
I therefore propose that President Obama , who thankfully removed Clinton ’s silly “ I did n’t inhale ” double - speak from our political discourse , nip this ridiculousness in the bud and preemptively pardon Phelps .
We know from his memoirs that Obama ’s done more heavy shit than Phelps anyway , and since his political plate ’s too full to plausibly decriminalize marijuana in the near future , this would be an adequate refutation of the U.S. ’s ridiculous policy on the drug for the time being .
Until then , here ’s the message that our media ’s treatment of Phelps sends to The Children : A professional athlete , even one who ’s considered a role model despite drinking and driving , owes the entire country an apology if he ’s caught smoking marijuana .
Why ?
Because , kids , marijuana is an illegal drug that 's worse than cigarettes or alcohol , and used only by objectionable people like ( presumably ) your parents and the President of the United States .
Yesterday 's remix challenge — to mock the ridiculous new " anti-terrorism " posters the London police have put up that tell you to spy on your neighbors — was a smashing success .
I 've collected the 25 or so that came in to date below ( sorry if I missed one or two — I did it all by hand ! ) — click through to see them all and prepare to laugh and weep and laugh and weep .
Utah is far behind the top wind power producers , with just 20 megawatts generated by turbines like these in Spanish Fork .
SIOUX FALLS , S.D. 
Texas continues to blow away the competition , but Iowa can now generate more wind power than California , according to a new industry report released Monday .
The Lone Star state 's 7,118 megawatts dwarfs Iowa 's 2,791 megawatts and California 's 2,517 megawatts , but wind power has grown into a key part of the energy infrastructure in Minnesota and Iowa , where each state generates more than 7 % of their electricity from turbines , the American Wind Energy Association study said .
States are trying to lure wind energy companies and the jobs that come with them , especially with federal requirements that will require more power from alternative sources in coming years .
ON THE WEB : Read the study
While jobs in the wind industry jumped 70 % to 85,000 last year , the association 's chief executive warned that more must be done to prevent the industry from stalling .
" We need the right policies in place for our industry to maintain its momentum , " said Denise Bode in a release .
The passage of a national Renewable Electricity Standard that would require utilities to generate a quarter of their electricity from renewable energy by 2025 is vital to long - term growth , Bode said .
Global investment in alternative energy was cut in half during the first quarter of 2009 , according to one study .
Billions in investments have vanished with the recession .
Shares in wind , solar and geothermal companies took a pummeling from investors this year .
Investments in companies devoted solely to clean energy fell to about $ 100 million from $ 2.1 billion , according to New Energy Finance , an industry - research firm .
Still , 2008 was a big year for the industry .
U.S. wind farms , with a combined capacity of 25,300 megawatts at the end of last year , should be able to generate some 73 billion kilowatt hours of power in 2009 , enough to serve nearly 7 million homes , the association said .
The association estimates that 10 new manufacturing facilities started up in 2008 , while 17 were expanded and 30 new plants were announced .
Indiana added its first utility - scale wind project .
Michigan , Utah , New Hampshire and Wisconsin grew at the fastest clip .
Still , big wind power states added the most capacity by far , led by Texas with 2671.3 new megawatts and Iowa with 1599.8 megawatts .
Minnesota , Kansas and New York added between 400 and 455 megawatts each .
FPL Group subsidiary NextEra Energy Resources continues to dominate the landscape with ownership of about 25 % of the total installed U.S. wind projects , totaling 6,290 megawatts .
Iberdrola Renewables , MidAmerican Energy and Horizon - Energia de Portugal combine for the next 25 % .
GE
Energy installed the most turbines in 2008 , accounting for 43 % of new capacity .
Vestas , 13 % ; Siemens and Suzlon , 9 % each ; and Gamesa , 7 % , rounded out the Top 5 .

The Government 's Forecast If Flu Problem Explodes : Two Million Americans Die
Somewhere in the basement of a government warehouse , federal employees with too little to do have come up with estimates of the what the effects of an all - out flu pandemic would be .
Like most estimates , these have a significant chance of being wrong .
They draw on theoretic models which cannot do much to take into account the most recent advances in science and disease control .
According to the AP , which has gotten hold of documents put together by the federal government and large companies , the country would face devastation .
The most important figure in the forecast is the number of people who would die .
The information from the news service is “ A full - scale pandemic — if it ever comes — could be expected to claim the lives of about 2 percent of those infected , about 2 million Americans . ”
Ninety million citizens would get sick .
The economy would shut down .
US economic output could drop 5.5 % .
All of the frightening information almost certainly points to a remarkably unlikely case .
The government ’s ability to partially isolate major diseases geographically has improved since the SARS outbreak six years ago .
Flu treatment drugs have become more effective and widely available .
The Internet is a far superior way to spread detailed information to tens of millions of people than TV , radio , or newspaper ever were .
The press will deluge the public with reports about “ worst case scenarios ” .
But , scenarios are all they are .

Epicurus and Lucretius on love and death
4 February 2002
Scribe : Ruth Lancashire
These minutes were not spoken ; for another version , go to the spoken minutes
What possibly could be a better lecture than one on Woody Allen ?
Woody
Allen often writes his films about two ideas that , as humans , overwhelm our minds , one of which we attempt to achieve , and the other attempt to ward off .
Woody
Allen goes where not many other men have dared to go before , he writes about love and death , as did the philosopher Lucretius , who attacks love and makes us think clearly about death .
Being only a one hour lecture , we were forced to skip over most of the mortality of the soul portion of readings , but not without a brief discussion , of course .
Lucretius goes against the grain of most of the philosophers we have already studied .
He states that the soul is mortal , not immortal ; it dies when the body dies .
He uses at least twenty - eight separate arguments to support his case .
Nowadays we recognize many ways in which certain biochemical and hormonal changes in the physiological aspect affect the mind as well as the rest of the body .
In modern times there is no longer really a debate .
The mind does not exist of separate matter ; it is part of the body .
It lives with birth , and dies in death .
After a brief look at the Lucretius ’ view on the mortality of the soul , we quickly moved on to book four .
This section is a controversial one about love and sexual desire .
It begins with the discussion of mind issues , such as , dreaming , wondering and imagining .
Lucretius attempts to give an explanation for sleeping and dreaming .
He , yet again , goes against the views of his fellow philosophers and states that dreams are nothing but images in our head .
They are not prophetic , and are not a form of communication between the Gods and the individual .
A student then stated that this should be fairly obvious to people .
If one spends his day pushing a button , then most likely , he said , he ’s going to dream about it because his mind has been occupied with it all day .
Professor Hutchinson agreed quickly with the student ’s comment stating that dreams do have a lot to do with experience , but then asked how we can explain dreams about the future .
He also pointed out to the class that only one other philosopher , up until Lucretius , had taken this standpoint about dreams , the other being Aristotle , who did it in a less obvious way .
Epicureans , Hutchinson stated , believe that dreams are just night time perception .
With a clever and sudden transition at 4.103 , Lucretius shifts our focus from dreams to sexual desire ; Lucretius ’ transition topic is wet dreams , and readers suddenly find themselves reading about sex .
Lucretius views sexual desire as an injury ; the mind is wounded with the invasion of love .
Hutchinson points out that Lucretius often juxtaposes the depiction of pleasure with an immediate cold shower of a depiction of regret , frustration , and absurdity .
In 1142 a connection to Plato ’s Republic ( 474d + ) was pointed out by Hutchinson to the class .
Lucretius describes the desire of women .
In The Republic Plato discusses the idea of creating special names for our loved ones .
Found in 1090 , is the attempt to heighten the metaphor between sexual desire and injury .
The reading states that once you ’ve had it [ sex ] , you always want more .
Lucretius compares sex to dreaming of food .
The images are there , but when you wake up you are still hungry , your craving has not been satisfied .
He states that sexual desire can never be satisfied .
If one is hungry , one can eat and become satisfied with being full , but one does not take anything away from sex or become connected to their lover , there is no point because there is always desire .
Food , drink , and sex are great temptations , all being natural and pleasurable .
But with eating , we often do not find the pleasure in it because we have grown accustomed to it .
Professor Hutchinson then re-counted a story about a friend of his who was unable to digest food for a long period of time .
After he was able to start again , he found great pleasure in digestion , a pleasure that most of us do not notice .
Clearly sex is a less urgent need , but it is natural .
One becomes satisfied when one eats , but does not become satisfied when one makes love .
Hutchinson pointed out that this suggests a deep confusion in the act of sex ; it is natural and pleasurable , but one should n’t have it .
But what Lucretius is saying is that the real problem is letting yourself fall in love .
The cold shower is turned on full at 1172 where Lucretius states that every woman is the same , one like the other .
He tells his reader that he ( the one who has fallen in love ) was able to live without her before , so why can he not now ?
He speaks very cynically about love .
Epicureans suggest that love , sex , and friendship must remain separate .
One must cultivate as many friendships as possible , and indulge in risk free sexual desire since it is not a necessary desire or need .
As professor Hutchinson pointed out “ no guy ever died from not getting laid . ”
The decision to have sex should weigh the downside risk , not the imagined upside potential .
It was determined who the individual could have sex with , for example , the daughters of prominent men were off - limits .
To the Epicureans , sex is fine as long as the other person is consenting , BUT make sure you do n’t fall in love .
The professor then re-counted a college meeting at which he was in attendance .
He asked the participants if they had to live without either love , sex , or friendship , which would it be ?
Hutchinson stated that the least number of people were willing to give up love .
A question then comes into play , where does family come in ?
For the Epicureans , marriage was to be avoided at all costs .
One should only marry if they are mature enough to handle the challenge .
Sex should be separated from the family .
The lecture then moved on to something , as mortals , we cannot avoid , death .
A topic , Hutchinson points out , that Mr. Allen is successful at in creating in his films , the sense of anxiety one feels about the subject .
Then again , Lucretius is also successful at this .
The idea of death for the Epicureans was not a reward and punishment system , which was the basis of most other religions and beliefs during his time .
Their idea was a very politically subversive one .
David Hume , who died in 1776 , was an Epicurean , and at that time in the UK held an illegal opinion about death .
He was a known Epicurean , and on his last days was completely cheerful and content , even in the site of death .
His friend Boswell had visited him days before he died and Hume joked about death .
After his death Boswell was unable to sleep for months , until he dreamed that Hume had changed his mind and been let in to St. Peter ’s gate .
Two hundred and twenty five years have passed since that time , and as professor Hutchinson showed us , viewpoints have changed as well .
In funerals we do not mourn the deadly sensations the individual must have felt , but we mourn the pain and grief for that of his close relatives .
Hutchinson , again , related the topic to a personal story .
His good friend Don Fowler passed away three years ago , leaving a half grown up daughter , and a widowed wife .
He was a known Epicurean , in fact that is how he and his wife had met , through the love of philosophy .
He wrote a note which was posted in the memorial program .
He stated that he had been a fortunate man and had died happy .
Then , in defiance of the grim reaper had the memorial sing “ Always Look on the Bright Side of Life . ”
Hutchinson had proved the changing ways of the world .
Fowlers ’ attitude is not a normal one , but it is one that is understood and accepted , when just 225 years ago it was outlawed .
Panasonic has just gotten around to releasing their next Micro Four Thirds camera , and it looks awfully familiar !
That 's because the GH1 is , more or less , the G1 , with added 1080 p HD video capabilities .
In fact , it looks as though allthe GH1's changes revolve around that single new feature , which was sorely missed in the G1 .
But first , about that HD : the camera will record full , 1080 p video at 24 fps in the relatively common AVCHD format , or 720 p content at an buttery 60 fps , framed through either the new digital viewfinder or a flip - out , 3 - inch LCD screen .
Checking out some of the video they 're demoing , it 's definitely impressive and — other than the depth of field control for sharp subjects and soft backgrounds — indistinguishable from any other 1080 p camcorder , at least in daylight — they 're not showing any night footage though .
To bolster video performance , Panasonic is bundling the GH1 with a video - optimized 14 - 140 mm / F4.0 - 5.8 lens .
What qualifies the lens as " optimized " , apparently , is the autofocus system : the smooth , continuous AF is driven by a silenced motor to minimize sound pollution during video sessions .
To round out the video capabilities , Panasonic has included a " Creative Mode " , which provides aperture and exposure control during video recording — a capability that is conspicuously absent from some pricier video - enabled DSLRs .
As far as still shooting goes , the GH1 is n't meaningfully differentiated from its predecessor , so you can get an idea of what to expect in our G1 review .
Check the presser below for full details .
PMA is an annual show where we get to see tomorrow 's digital cameras — the ones that 'll be populating pockets and purses for the rest of the year .
We 'll be here for the next couple of days .

The Panasonic LUMIX DMC- GH1 , a Creative HD Hybrid , Offers Professional - Level Still Photos and HD Video Performance Yet is Easy Enough for Entry - Level DSLR Consumers
Las Vegas , NV ( March 3 , 2009 ) – Panasonic today introduced the DMC - GH1 , the newest member of the company 's revolutionary LUMIX G Micro System – a new digital interchangeable lens camera system that delivers professional - level features and performance in a compact and easy - to - use camera body .
Compatible with the Micro Four Thirds System standard , the new LUMIX GH1 features advanced video photography functions , such as the ability to record High Definition ( HD ) AVCHD 1080 p / 24 p video . *
In addition , the new LUMIX GH1 comes with a newly developed long - zoom interchangeable lens – the LUMIX G VARIO HD 14-140mm/F4.0-5.8 ASPH ./MEGA O.I.S .
This lens was specifically designed to support HD movie recording and features a silent motor and continuous auto focusing ( AF ) capability ; two features which distinguish the LUMIX GH1 from DSLRs that offer HD video recording capabilities .
" Photographers of all levels – professionals , amateurs and beginners – will be stunned by the range of creative possibilities that the LUMIX GH1 creates in the world of high - quality photography and HD video .
Users will be equally amazed by the camera 's easy - to - use design and small size , " said David Briganti , National Marketing Manager , Imaging , Panasonic Consumer Electronics Company .
" Beyond its creative potential , the LUMIX GH1 , a sister product to the award - winning LUMIX G1 , is also innovative and differentiates itself from the pack by recording High Definition video with continuous AF , an indispensable feature for practical video recording . "
In late 2008 , Panasonic redefined the traditional DSLR category with its launch of the Panasonic LUMIX G1 – a digital , interchangeable lens camera system that takes the radical step of eliminating the large , internal mirror structure that is currently contained in all traditional DSLR cameras .
This innovation allows for dramatically smaller camera body and lens sizes and permits many new , advanced consumer features such as LUMIX G1 " Live View Finder " .
With its 2008 launch , the LUMIX G1 achieved several honors , including :
World 's first entry into the Micro Four Thirds Standard system camera segment
World 's first interchangeable lens camera to offer colored body options to consumers
Winner , 2008 Camera of the Year ( Popular Photography & Imaging magazine )
The new LUMIX GH1 provides cutting - edge video recording features , including the ability to record high - resolution full HD ( 1920 x 1080 ) video at 24 fps or smooth HD video ( 1280 x 720 ) movie at 60 fps using an AVCHD format ( MPEG - 4/H.264 ) .
The AVCHD format provides the important benefit of doubling the HD quality recording time compared with Motion JPEG .
The LUMIX GH1 hosts a dedicated video record button on the back of the camera which lets users instantly start recording videos , even while shooting still photos – removing the fear of potentially missing a must - see video moment .
The LUMIX GH1 also records video in high - quality stereo sound via Dolby Digital Stereo Creator , the global standard of audio recording .
An optional stereo microphone ( DMW - MS1 ) is also available to achieve a more intensive sound recording experience .
Finally , a convenient Wind Cut function is provided to help to block out distracting video background noise .
Like the LUMIX G1 , the LUMIX GH1 features the Live View Finder system which enables something that simply is not possible with conventional DSLR cameras – the ability to preview the effects of camera settings ( e.g. , exposure , aperture , shutter speed ) before taking the photo .
This helps take the guesswork out of the camera setting process and helps users ensure that every photo they capture comes out exactly as they envisioned .
The brilliant 1,440,000 - dot equivalent Live View Finder system can also display information settings that a user can see without removing their eyes from the subject .
Furthermore , a built - in eye sensor automatically switches on the viewfinder when the user looks into it , then switches it off and turns on the swivel 3.0 - inch large 460,000 - dot high - resolution LCD when the user looks away from the viewfinder .
The 60 - frames - per- second Live View is made possible by the Live MOS sensor , which takes real - time signals directly from the image sensor and sends them continuously to the LCD .
Both the Live View Finder and LCD provide a 100 % field of view – allowing the user to accurately frame and compose a shot from most any position .
The LUMIX GH1 kit lens – the LUMIX G VARIO HD 14-140mm/F4.0-5.8 ASPH ./MEGA O.I.S. –provides a broad focal length range of 28 - 280 mm ( 35 mm camera equivalent ) and supports continuous AF using the contrast AF system for both photo and movie capture .
The low - noise lens design also seamlessly supports video recording by minimizing the mechanical sound generated by AF / AE actions .
At the core of the LUMIX GH1 lies a newly developed 12.1 - megapixel high speed Live MOS sensor and Venus Engine HD , which features twin CPUs for outstanding processing capabilities .
The Live MOS sensor is capable of high - speed readout over four channels to be compatible with full - HD movie recording .
This sensor is also advantageous for photo recording with a high signal - to - noise ratio thanks to the new circuit structure that is unaffected by the noise generated in each of the circuits .
This results in crisp photos – even those taken at high ISO levels .
The multi-aspect type sensor allows users to take photos in 4:3 , 3:2 or 16:9 aspect ratios with the same angle of view .
The Venus Engine HD is also energy efficient , supporting long periods of AVCHD video recording on a single battery charge .
In addition to the digital camera 's HD video recording capability , the DMC - GH1 features the LUMIX Creative Movie mode which lets the user manually set the shutter speed and aperture , making their videos more creative and representative of their own personal video style preference .
Changing the shutter speed gives the videos a special look , particularly suitable for shooting fast - moving subjects .
Controlling the aperture is convenient when there are several subjects at varying distances , so the user can focus on the foreground and blur the background – or vice versa .
While the LUMIX DMC - GH1 has cutting - edge still image and video capture features , the LUMIX GH1 is also incredibly easy - to - use , thanks to Panasonic 's iA ( Intelligent Auto ) mode ** – a user - friendly setting made popular in the LUMIX line of digital point - and - shoot camera products .
Panasonic 's iA mode is a suite of technologies which engage automatically ( no settings needed ) .
The latest addition to the iA suite of features is Face Recognition , a feature that directs the camera to prioritize focus and exposure on a specific face that that the user had previously registered in the camera .***
This invaluable function makes it especially easy to take sharp and beautifully exposed images of things the user values most in their photos – the user 's friends and family .
Panasonic 's iA mode offers other innovative features which help deliver consistently outstanding photos : O.I.S. ( Optical Image Stabilization ) to help reduce blurring from hand - shake ; Intelligent ISO Control to help limit motion blur by adjusting the ISO sensitivity if the subject moves as the shot is taken ; AF Tracking that lets the camera lock onto any subject and keep it in focus even if it moves ; Intelligent Exposure which optimizes the exposure for each part of an image , preventing blocked shadows and blown highlights , and helps ensure that gradation and details are reproduced beautifully ; and Intelligent Scene Selector which automatically detects the five most common shooting situations - Portrait , Night Portrait , Scenery , Night Scenery and Close - up - and switches to the appropriate Scene mode .
Best of all , the benefits of Panasonic 's iA mode extend to motion image recording on the DMC - GH1 .
For example , the LUMIX GH1 motion iA includes O.I.S. and Face Detection , which automatically detects a face in the frame and adjusts focus , exposure , contrast , and skin complexion .
Intelligent Exposure continually checks the ambient light level and adjusts the exposure setting as conditions change to prevent blown highlights and blocked shadows .
Intelligent Scene Selector automatically switches between Normal , Portrait , Close - up , Scenery , and Low Light modes according to the environment .
The Contrast AF system adopted by the LUMIX GH1 is accurate , easy - to - use and fast .
Users can choose from a wide range of AF modes , including multiple - area AF with up to 23 focus areas , 1 - area AF with a selectable focus area , Face Detection , and AF Tracking .
To help keep the images free of spots from dust and particles , the Supersonic Wave Filter dust reduction system helps prevent foreign contaminants from adhering to the image sensor .
After users capture their images using the LUMIX GH1 , it 's easy for them to enjoy their photos or HD videos immediately on a large - screen Panasonic VIERA ® high - definition television .
All that is required is to remove the SD Memory Card from the LUMIX GH1 and insert it into the VIERA Image Viewer ( SDHC / SD Memory Card slot ) located in the VIERA HDTV or in the Panasonic Blu-ray disc player .
Alternatively , an optional mini HDMI ™ cable is available to output the images from the LUMIX GH1 directly to the Panasonic HDTV via VIERA Link™ .
Then , using the VIERA HDTV 's remote control , users can take advantage of the LUMIX GH1's advanced playback and slideshow features .
In addition to the new LUMIX G lenses , the DMC - GH1 and LUMIX G Micro System is compatible with any interchangeable lens that complies with the Four Thirds standard .****
This gives users access to the entire range of Four Thirds lenses .
Additional Micro Four
Thirds lenses will be announced in the future , giving users a large , diverse line of high - performance lenses to add to their photographic toolboxes .
With the LUMIX G Micro System and the growing assortment of lenses becoming available , the creative possibilities are endless .
The LUMIX DMC - GH1 is a system camera with a wide variety of options to choose from to match a wide range of shooting situations and styles .
Accessories compatible with the LUMIX G Micro System include : External Flash : DMW - FL220 ( GN22 ) / DMW - FL360 ( GN36 ) / DMW - FL500 ( GN50 ) ; PL Filter : DMW - LPL62 ; ND Filter : DMW - LND62 ( New ) ; MC Protector : DMW - LMCH62 ; Mount Adapter : DMW - MA1 ; Stereo Microphone : DMW - MS1 ( New ) ; Battery Pack : DMW - BLB13 ; DC Cable : DMW - DCC3 ; Soft Cases : DMW - CG1 , DMW - CG2 ( New ) ; Soft Bag : DMW - BAG1 ; Shoulder Strap ( Stylish ) DMW - SSTG1 - A/C/R/K( New ) ; Shoulder Strap ( Woven ) DMW - SSTG2 - W ; Shoulder Strap ( Leather ) DMW - SSTG3 - T ; Remote Shutter : DMW - RSL1 .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) - Under pressure from lawmakers and financial institutions , the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved the release of five different proposals for reinstating the uptick rule , a provision that would limit short selling .
The five SEC proposals , which will be put out for a 60 - day public comment period , were approved unanimously by the five - member panel .
The proposals vary from reinstating the old rule to creating a new rule that would only apply in severe market conditions .
" The commission is aware of balancing the benefits of its rules and the costs to trading , " said SEC Chairwoman Mary Schapiro .
SEC staff said the new rules could n't be approved for at least three months .
New Rules Coming on Short Selling ?
The uptick rule , which was removed in 2007 after 70 years , allowed short sales only if the preceding sale boosted a company 's stock price by at least a penny .
The uptick rule was designed to make sure short sellers could n't dominate trading in a stock to drive its price lower .
Short sales allow investors to bet that a share price will go down , by borrowing and selling shares of a company in hopes of buying back the shares at a lower price .
The original owner then gets the shares back , and the short - seller pockets the difference in the price as profit .
Short - selling is controversial .
Many companies say short sellers spread false rumors to drive prices lower , but short sellers say they provide the necessary counterweight to the boosterism of market bulls .
Some critics say the elimination of the uptick rule was a major factor in the bear market that has seen major stock averages fall 48 % since peaking in October 2007 , just three months after the rule was abolished .
In October 2008 , the SEC barred short sales of many financial corporations .
5 proposals
One approach the agency is considering would be to simply reinstate the uptick provision removed in 2007 .
The SEC is also asking the public to comment on four variations .
Another approach bears a resemblance to old uptick rule , but it would allow short sales only after a potential buyer bid at least a penny more than the company 's stock price .
This bid test is different than the original uptick rule because it would allow a short sale after a higher bid rather than a higher sale price .
For technological and implementation reasons , the SEC staff indicated that it favored this approach over reinstating the old uptick regulation .
Three other proposals , known as " circuit breaker tests , " would limit short selling for the duration of one trading day once certain triggers were met .
One provision would ban short selling outright in a particular security if there were a 10 % decline in its stock price , according to the agency .
The ban would be in place for the remainder of the day .
The agency also proposed two other similar " circuit breaker " tests .
One would reinstate the uptick rule for a particular security , for the duration of one trading day , if there is a 10 % decline in its stock price .
With another approach , a stock that experiences a 10 % price decline would have a bid - test uptick rule that would only allow a short sale at a price that is above the highest available bid .
Advantages of the bid test approach
Eric Sirri , the outgoing director of the agency 's division of trading and markets , told commissioners that the bid test rule would be significantly easier to implement , in part because of technological reasons , than reinstating the uptick rule as it existed until 2007 .
" Today 's markets are faster , they are more efficient , they are more electronic , " Sirri said .
" The bid test works better because there is one price that tends to stay constant for a fixed period of time .
The uptick is history , it 's a price at which the last trade occurred . "
Sirri said it is often difficult to accurately determine the last trade : " There is a problem in getting an accurate uptick price to you because you can have hundreds of trades a second and there are several markets combining and aggregating , in a way today that may mean its hard to find the last trade . "
Reinstating the uptick rule , as it existed until 2007 , could also be technologically difficult to implement .
Sirri said the agency removed the uptick rule at the same time as it approved a sweeping technological modernization plan .
Sirri said agency staff believes that a bid test would be easier and quicker to apply in today 's market .
He added that the three circuit breaker approaches would be easier to implement than any across - the - board uptick rule , and could be approved more quickly .
Some concerns about the proposals
An SEC official said the agency may consider approving a combination of the bid test uptick rule and the provision that would ban short selling in a particular stock for the remainder of the day if the corporation 's stock dips 10 % or more .
Kathleen Casey , a GOP commissioner , said she supported doing something , but she worried that each of the five measures could have unintended consequences , such as having a negative impact in an " advancing market . "
Luis Aguilar , a Democratic commissioner , said he supported the measure but wished it went further .
He said any new uptick rule would have the impact of pushing short - sellers from established exchanges into the unregulated markets , such as credit default swaps , or cash - settled equity swaps , which are part of the shadow derivatives market .
" Without comprehensive regulation we could shift activity from regulated to unregulated markets , " said Aguilar .
" Some market participants will move to swaps or other products that are not subject to SEC review . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Pirates off the eastern coast of Africa fired on U.S. sailors Saturday as they tried to reach the lifeboat where an American captain is being held , a U.S. official familiar with the situation told CNN .
The guided missile frigate USS Halyburton , with helicopter capabilities , is now at the scene .
The gunfire forced the sailors , who did not return fire , back to the guided missile destroyer USS Bainbridge , the official said .
Capt .
Richard Phillips reportedly offered himself as a hostage to the pirates during an attack Wednesday on the U.S. - flagged container ship Maersk Alabama in the Indian Ocean .
The Alabama was en route to Mombasa , Kenya , with a cargo of food aid when it was hijacked about 350 miles off the Somalia coast .
The American crew regained control of the vessel , but the Maersk company would not say how .
There are about 20 crew members .
The Alabama arrived Saturday in Mombasa , along with an 18 - person armed security detail on board .
" For security reasons , the vessel will berth in a restricted area of the port and will not be accessible to the media .
FBI agents will debrief members of the crew on board the vessel before they disembark .
The crew will not be available to the media in Mombasa , " Maersk Ltd. said .
Watch the latest Maersk briefing »
The U.S. Navy -- which is in charge of the situation -- requested help from the FBI to resolve the standoff .
The FBI is launching a criminal investigation into the hijacking and hostage - taking , two law enforcement officials told CNN .
The probe will be led by the FBI 's New York field office , which has responsibility for looking into cases involving U.S. citizens in the African region .
Agents from the office were scheduled to leave for Africa sometime this weekend , the officials said .
Phillips lives in Underhill , Vermont , where neighbor and longtime family friend , Tom Walsh , told CNN the captain 's wife , Andrea , was surrounded by relatives .
" If they need us to help with anything .
That 's kind of the way it is in these communities .
... just showing that we 're concerned .
We want to do whatever she needs , " Walsh said .
" She has a lot of family there . "

Earlier Saturday , pirates sailing a hijacked German cargo ship returned to port after failing to reach the area of the standoff with the Bainbridge , a local journalist told CNN .
The German ship Hansa Stavanger was among several pirated vessels trying to sail to the area some 300 miles off the Somali coast , a Somali journalist told CNN .
The pirate crew had intended to help the pirates holding Phillips but turned back because of the U.S. naval presence , the journalist said .
The Hansa Stavanger is now at the Somali port of Eyl , the journalist said .
The Hansa Stavanger was hijacked April 4 off the Somali coast .
Pirates have been searching the waters off Africa 's coast for the Alabama 's lifeboat , a U.S. military official with knowledge of the situation said Friday .
They are using hijacked vessels and skiffs launched from larger ships , the official said .
The guided missile frigate USS Halyburton , with helicopter capabilities , has joined the Bainbridge in the area .
A third ship , the amphibious assault ship USS Boxer -- with a medical facility aboard -- should be there by the end of the day .

Phillips is being held by four gunmen in the covered , fiberglass lifeboat .
He jumped overboard at one point to try to escape , but one of the pirates jumped into the water after him and brought him back onboard the 28 - foot boat .
The pirates fired shots , the military official said , without providing further details .
Phillips appeared to be tied up by the pirates after the escape attempt , a Defense Department official told CNN .
For the U.S. Navy , bringing in more firepower is more than just a means to resolve a hostage situation , said Chris Lawrence , CNN 's Pentagon correspondent .
Attacks in the area have picked up so drastically in recent months that the Navy has to reposition some of its fleet to deal with the threats , he said .
The pirates have shown no signs of giving in .
Meanwhile , the acts of piracy were having an effect on tourists disembarking from ships in Mombasa .
" Well , we got the international news stories on television on the ship and everybody 's concerned about the route that we were on because there was always the possibility that we would be approached by pirates , " one male passenger said .
CNN 's Stephanie Elam , Mohammed Jamjoom and Barbara Starr contributed to this report .

Dutch government identity
As part of the new brand identity of the Dutch government Peter Verheul designed a custom typeface for all forms of visual communications
Typeface : Rijksoverheid Sans / Serif Currently there are over 200 departments and ministries which all have different logos and uses different typefaces as their brand identity .
In a pitch held by the Dutch government studio Dumbar won this competition and introduced a new logo and 1 brand identity : 1 Logo .
From the beginning of 2008 Peter Verheul was asked by studio Dumbar to take his typeface Versa and transform the typeface usable for a larger audience .
He changed the look and feel of the Serif version of Versa Serif and created a complete new set of letters for the Sans version .
The fonts are named Rijksoverheid Sans and Rijksoverheid Serif .
The name of the typeface is recognizable as “ government ” and will be used in every way of visual communication .
The Rijksoverheid Sans will be used mainly for headings of text and in signage or wayfinding systems .
The Rijksoverheid Serif is used as bread letter for reading text .
In just under nine months Peter Verheul managed to finalize the fonts and released them in four different variations , from Regular , Italic to Bold .
Designing the Rijksoverheid typeface
First notebook sketches by Peter Verheul , designing the bracket of Rijksoverheid Serif .
Print preview of the typeface as workhorse .
Letterijk book During the time of creation Peter Verheul did not have much time to take pictures ( as said in his introduction speech ) but he kept a note book full of drawings and notes of creating and designing the typefaces .
After finishing the typefaces he donated them to Bijzondere Collecties , a Dutch important collection of valuable work from Dutch graphical , typographical - artists .
The Bijzondere Collections hosts the booklet , first printouts and everything that is related in creating the typeface Rijksoverheid .
Letterrijk Book is a story about the birth and why of creation the typeface Rijksoverheid written by Mathieu Lommen , published by De Buitenkant Publishers .
The booklet covers everything from the start of the project and the combination with project 1 Logo , a story about how the typography started working together , with many drawn examples of early stages of letter design .
It also covers the complete glyphs of the typeface variations , with over 700 glyphs each this typeface is multi-language proof .
With the design of the typeface several key factors of demands where given to Peter Verheul and Studio Dumbar .
The typeface should be easy to read , should not be too wide in order to reduce printing costs , it could be used for all forms of visual communication of the Dutch Government and every department will use it therefore it will reduce the costs of different typeface licenses .
The typeface will function as a bridge between society and government , a typeface that everybody will feel comfortable with .
Rijksoverheids typeface The Rijksoverheid Sans , an easy to read typeface with a large x -height .
This allows maximum legibility for heading text , signage , wayfinding and other forms of visual identity .
In the introduction speech Peter Verheul mentioned that he was impressed by the way the Sans version would be used for bread letter .
He is interested to see the further development of Rijksoverheid Sans in this field .
Rijksoverheid Serif is the bread letter for reading text , I have read the booklet a couple of times and it seems to be a very legible typeface .
Which will form the basis of the whole brand identity of the Dutch Government .

Exelon and SunPower to Develop Nation 's Largest Urban Solar Power Plant in Chicago
More Alternative Energy Articles
Exelon and SunPower today announced an agreement to develop the nation 's largest urban solar power plant at a former industrial site on Chicago 's South Side .
The 10 - megawatt solar photovoltaic ( PV ) facility is scheduled for completion by the end of this year .
The $ 60 million project is contingent upon Exelon receiving a federal loan guarantee under the recently passed federal stimulus legislation formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , which includes provisions for investment in green jobs and emissions reduction .
Exelon is seeking a loan guarantee for up to 80 percent of the project cost from the U.S. Department of Energy Loan Guarantee Program Office ( LGPO ) .
Exelon plans to lease 39 acres of the West Pullman Industrial Redevelopment Area from the City of Chicago for the project .
The former industrial site is a " brownfield " property that will be redeveloped for productive reuse .
Exelon Generation will own and operate the plant and market the electricity and Solar Renewable Energy Certificates ( SRECs ) it generates .
SunPower , a manufacturer of high - efficiency solar cells , solar panels and solar systems , will design , manufacture and install the solar system .
" With nearly 2,000 megawatts of renewable power in our energy portfolio , including hydro- electricity , wind , landfill gas and solar , Exelon is investing aggressively but wisely in renewables as part of our comprehensive environmental strategy , Exelon 2020 , " said Exelon Chairman and CEO John W. Rowe .
" As a provider of electrical service in urban areas , we understand the importance of finding urban locations for renewable energy and we are pleased to bring the largest urban solar installation to West Pullman , helping to revitalize an area where industry once thrived .
"
The project 's 32,800 solar panels will convert the sun 's rays into enough clean , reliable electricity to meet the annual energy requirements of 1,200 to 1,500 homes per year .
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's system for calculating emissions savings , the installation will displace approximately 31.2 million pounds of greenhouse gas emissions annually , the equivalent of taking more than 2,500 cars off the road or planting more than 3,200 acres of forest .
" Today , SunPower 's solar PV technology can be implemented anywhere and at any scale - from rooftops , to parking lots , to utility - scale power plants , and urban industrial sites , " said SunPower Chief Executive Officer Tom Werner .
" Delivering a 10 - megawatt solar plant in a space - constrained , 39 - acre area is only possible using SunPower 's high - efficiency solar technology , which generates more power per square foot than competing technologies .
" Exelon and SunPower 's environmentally sustainable design supports the City of Chicago 's efforts to create an environmental legacy for its residents .
The project will create about 200 jobs at prevailing wage rates during construction , maximizing the use of local labor and providing job training opportunities .
The solar power systems will consist of many U.S. - made components , including steel tubing sourced from businesses on Chicago 's South Side .
" Exelon 's planned solar installation will benefit the West Pullman community in many ways , including increased economic activity , new jobs , and the revitalization of these unused parcels of land , " said Chicago 34th Ward Alderman Carrie M. Austin .
" Exelon has always been a great corporate citizen to Chicago , and I look forward to working with Exelon and the community to bring this high - tech solar plant to the West Pullman area . "
SunPower solar panels generate up to 50 percent more power than conventional solar panels and two to four times as much power as thin - film solar technology .
Exelon selected SunPower Trackers , solar tracking systems that tilt toward the sun as it moves across the sky , increasing daily energy production by up to 25 percent , improving the economics of solar power and reducing land - use requirements .
SunPower has installed more than 500 solar power systems totaling more than 400 megawatts worldwide , including solar power plants in Europe , Asia and North America .
The project supports Exelon 2020 , Exelon 's strategy to reduce , offset or displace more than 15 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year by 2020 .
Among other things , Exelon 2020 calls for Exelon to offer more low - carbon electricity in the marketplace that will replace electricity generated by higher - emitting energy sources .
Latin American ex-leaders urge legalization of marijuana , end to failed drug war Reuters

The war against drugs is failing and the U.S. government should break with " prohibition " policies that have achieved little more than cram its prisons and stoke violence , three former Latin American presidents said on Wednesday .
The respected former presidents urged the United States and Latin American governments to move away from jailing drug users to debate the legalization of marijuana and place more emphasis on the treatment of addicts .
Former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria said there was no meaningful debate over drugs policy in the United States , despite a broad consensus that current policies had failed .

[ digg- reddit - me ]
We are keeping the finger in the dike .
Sgt. David Azuelo of the Tuscon , Arizona police force as quoted by Randal C. Archibold in The New York Times .
I ’ve been arguing for some time that the War on Drugs and the prohibitionist policies underlying it must be ended for the sake of our national security .
I ’ve made the argument from a civil libertarian point of view ; I ’ve made the argument that the War on Drugs is interfering with the fight against terrorism ; and I ’ve made the argument based on the fact that this war is destabilizing our neighbors .
Here ’s a parallel argument :
The Pentagon listed Mexico as a country that might collapse suddenly into a civil war between the central government and the cartels .
A top cabinet official in Mexico claimed that “ unless [ the cartels are ] confronted , ‘ the next president of the republic would be a narco - trafficker . ”
The levels of violence in the country now are astounding – with higher rates than those in Iraq in recent months – and they are continuing to spill over the border into America .
We are currently supplying both sides of this conflict with weaponry and funds – and the conflict is escalating .
Mexico is now following the route of Colombia by militarizing it ’s approach to the problem of drugs .
For decades , war raged in Colombia to stop the drug smugglers – inflicting an enormous cost on the country as they – in the words of an influential and prestigious report by former Mexican , Brazilian , and Mexican presidents , “ implemented all conceivable measures to fight the drug trade in a massive effort whose benefits were not proportional to the vast amount of resources invested and the human costs involved . ”
The report explains that the “ traumatic Colombian experience ” should teach other nations “ not to make the mistake of adopting the US prohibitionist policies . ”
Yet , that is what Mexico is doing .
For decades , America has waged a war on the suppliers of drugs and on drug users at home and abroad .
The casualties have been high – but no matter the body count or the number of arrests has gone , the War on Drugs has remained “ an utter failure . ”
This failure has allowed the reach of the Mexican cartels to extend far into America :
United States law enforcement officials have identified 230 cities , including Anchorage , Atlanta , Boston and Billings , Mont. , where Mexican cartels and their affiliates “ maintain drug distribution networks or supply drugs to distributors . ”
As Stephen Walt explained in Foreign Policy :
[ O ] ur policy helps enrich drug lords and make it possible for them to destabilize whole governments , as they are now doing in Mexico and Afghanistan .
As The Economist reported :
[ P]rohibition has fostered gangsterism on a scale that the world has never seen before … [ T ]he war on drugs has been a disaster , creating failed states in the developing world even as addiction has flourished in the rich world .
By any sensible measure , this 100 - year struggle has been illiberal , murderous and pointless …
At the same time , the harm reduction strategy of the European Union , while mitigating the effects of drugs locally , has exacerbated the effects of drug production and smuggling elsewhere .
The failure of both the War on Drugs and the harm reduction strategy has created an enormous market incentive for smuggling , for money laundering , and for corrupting government officials .
Together , these and other effects of the Drug War create a sense of lawlessness which is exactly where the cartels thrive .
The cartels are able to thrive in part because the scale of their operations and the enormous profits generated give them both incentive and means to experiment with different methods of smuggling , money laundering , and corrupting officials .
If there were a way to reduce these profits , it could undercut their successes in all of these areas and undermine the incentives that drive them to take these steps .
The cartels might no longer be able to acquire military - grade weaponry ; they might not be able to afford to buy subs to smuggle items in ; they might not be able to afford to buy off the top Mexican drug enforcement official .
We have reached the point that The Economist has characterized as a choice between “ A calculated gamble , or another century of failure . ”
The calculated gamble is to legalize drugs , or at least marijuana .
People have asked me if legalizing marijuana would really make a difference in undercutting the Mexican cartels .
Marijuana represents 60 to 70 % of the profits that fuel the Mexican drug cartels .
Legalizing it would take away one of the main props holding them up – just as legalizing alcohol helped rollback the gangs that dominated American cities in the 1920s .
Violence in Mexico stemming from the drug war is destabilizing the country and spilling over into America .
With a single move , we could remove the monopoloy which gives them 60 to 70 % of the cartels ’ revenue – in a single move , we could take away their “ king crop . ”
Without the enormous profits of marijuana propping up the rest of the drug market , the costs of smuggling would increase .
The distribution network would be pressured .
The cost of bribing officials would likely increase as harder drugs would be the only things being smuggled and enforcement could focus more on these drugs .
The pressure on our criminal justice system that is currently imprisoning a higher percentage of our people than any nation on earth would be eased .
Border guards would be able to focus more on harder drugs , or even on serious threats to our security , rather than searching teenagers for pot .
All of this would undermine the cartels – most of all , taking away 60 - 70 % of their profits .
We have reached a point where one of our most aggressive drug czars has publicly stated that he “ would n’t care ” if marijuana were legalized !
Where another former drug czar has acknowledged that marijuana “ pose[s ] no significant public health problem . ”
These are men who led the fight against drugs .
A massive propaganda campaign , $ 40 billion a year , millions of arrests , and untold casualties and – and the price of drugs has remained the same and the extent of drug use has barely been affected .
Why are we continuing a failed policy that only serves the interests of the Mexican cartels it is propping up ?

Not much has budged me from my sick bed in the past two weeks ( pneumonia and complications ) , but I could n't miss coverage of Thursday 's ceremony at The National Press Club giving the 6th Annual Ridenhour Awards to four brave Americans who represent citizens at their best .
( Deep Harm wrote an excellent Diary on the subject that was read and recommended by far too few here . )
The awards are named for Ron Ridenhour , the Vietnam veteran who blew the whistle on the 1968 massacre of civilians at My Lai .
You can read his 1969 letter to selected members of Congress here .
In part based on interviews with Ridenhour , Seymour Hersh won the Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the massacre , a story he had a devil of a time getting published .
Ridenhour later became an investigative journalist himself .
He won a 1987 George Polk Award for coverage of a tax scandal in New Orleans .
Ridenhour died in 1998 .
You can view a tribute to him here .
Begun by the Nation Institute and the Fertel Foundation in partnership with the Project on Government Oversight , the Fund for Constitutional Government , and the Government Accountability Project , the Ridenhour Prizes seek " to recognize those who persevere in acts of truth - telling that protect the public interest , promote social justice or illuminate a more just vision of society . "
The winners this year :
Jane Mayer - the Ridenhour Book Prize - for her fierce look deep into The Dark Side : The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals .
Bob Herbert - The Ridenhour Courage Prize - for his columns focusing on injustice and abuse on the Op - Ed pages of The New York Times .
Nick Turse - special Ridenhour Prize for Reportorial Distinction - for his searing article in The Nation of December 1 , 2008 , " A My Lai a Month , " which confirmed what many have long thought : that the killings at My Lai were not an aberration of the Vietnam War , but , in fact , all - too - common occurrences .
Thomas Tamm - the Ridenhour Prize for Truth - Telling - for his courageous willingness to drop a dime on the Cheney - Bush administration 's illegal interception of phone calls and e-mails .
Each of these is worthy of an entire essay , but let me focus on Thomas Tamm .
Because his story , as reported last December by Michael Isikoff , in Newsweek , is not untypical of what happens to whistleblowers in America .
You can view or read his Thursday interview with Amy Goodman here .
From a subway payphone in 2004 , Tamm , a lawyer at the Department of Justice anonymously called The New York Times reporter Eric Lichtblau , informing him that he had knew the National Security Agency was illegally spying on U.S. citizens .
His efforts to bring this to the attention of his bosses and congressional committees had failed , so he called Lichtblau and later met with him and Times reporter James Risen .
The two won a Pulitzer for their belated story on the subject - appearing in December 2005 .
As a result of the exposé triggered by Tamm ( although he was n't the only source of the story ) , Congress subsequently passed a weak and much - criticized " reform " of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
So what happened to Tamm ?
The guy whose uncle and father were FBI agents , who led the Young Republicans when he was at Brown University and who had a stellar career at the DoJ until he decided to expose the criminal behavior of the government he served ?
He got caught .
And he 's since been treated like a criminal .
As Isikoff wrote :
The FBI has pursued him relentlessly for the past two and a half years .
Agents have raided his house , hauled away personal possessions and grilled his wife , a teenage daughter and a grown son .
More recently , they 've been questioning Tamm 's friends and associates about nearly every aspect of his life .
Tamm has resisted pressure to plead to a felony for divulging classified information .
But he is living under a pall , never sure if or when federal agents might arrest him .
Exhausted by the uncertainty clouding his life , Tamm now is telling his story publicly for the first time .
" I thought this [ secret program ] was something the other branches of the government — and the public — ought to know about .
So they could decide : do they want this massive spying program to be taking place ? " ...
If somebody were to say , who am I to do that ?
I would say , ' I had taken an oath to uphold the Constitution . '
It 's stunning that somebody higher up the chain of command did n't speak up . "
Not so stunning considering who those higher up the chain of command were .
What is stunning is that Tamm , who has gone deeply into debt , lost his job and been afflicted with depression as a result of the harassment he 's suffered at the hands of the government , is still uncertain whether he will be indicted under the Obama administration .
Here 's a fellow who should have had a front - row seat at Obama 's inauguration or gotten a glowing mention and maybe a fist - bump when the President spoke to a joint session of Congress in February .
As Joe Conason writes in today 's Salon.com :
If the telecommunication companies that helped the NSA to violate the law could be immunized with Obama 's vote last year , if the Obama administration is reluctant to prosecute former Bush officials for their alleged crimes , and if the president and the attorney general recognize that illegal wiretapping is an intolerable offense against the Constitution , then it is long past time to lift the burden of investigation from Thomas Tamm .
Let the government acknowledge what by now is obvious .
No fair - minded jury would convict him , and none ever should .
Attorney General Eric
Holder should make a point of informing the nation that Thomas Tamm will not be prosecuted .
And President Obama ought to reinforce that Ridenhour Prize with a Freedom Medal .
He ought also to take a stand in favor of Rep. Chris Van Hollen 's proposed legislation , H.R. 1507 , the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2009 , as he was encouraged to do earlier this month .
While this law would not rescue whistleblowers of the past like Tamm , it would shield those who , in the future , act as he did .
That 's a message that ought to made loud and clear .
Dauphin County District Attorney Edward M. Marsico Jr. says his office will not be filing criminal charges in a mix - up that landed a Philadelphia man in jail four times for not paying child support for someone else 's child .
Marsico said his investigation , ordered by President Judge Richard A. Lewis
after The Patriot - News reported on the situation
, revealed that a " screw up " occurred in Montgomery County , but did not involve any criminal intent .
That mistake left Walter Andre Sharpe Jr. of Philadelphia forced to pay $ 12,000 in support for another man 's child and thrown in Dauphin County Prison four times for not keeping up with the payments .
It took The Patriot - News less than a hour to find the real father , who said he had custody of the child Sharpe had been supporting .
Sharpe was paying support to the child 's mother and then her grandmother .
Google has confirmed it will build a data center on the defunct Finnish paper mill it purchased last month for roughly $ 50 million .
In mid-February , global paper - maker Stora Enso announced that Google would shell out € 40 million ( $ 50 million ) for its Summa Mill in Kymenlaakso , Finland .
And Google told The Reg it was " considering " building a data center on the site .
Now , the ad giant has admitted its mind is made up .
Google says the mill purchase includes approximately 166 hectares ( 410 acres ) of land , and it will spend roughly € 200 million ( $ 251 million ) , including the mill purchase , erecting one of its top - secret data centers .
It 's an apt metaphor for the gradual destruction of the world 's newspapers .
Stora
Enso shut down its Summa Mill early last year , citing a decrease in newsprint and magazine - paper production that lead to " persistent losses in recent years and poor long - term profitability prospects . "
Nowadays , the world gets its news through things like , well , Google 's data centers .
As our friends at Data Center Knowledge point out , that $ 250 million figure is a significant drop - off from the $ 600 million it recently budgeted for each of its Project Will Power expansions in North Carolina , South Carolina , and Iowa .
In the fourth quarter of last year , Google significantly chopped its data center spending , as it ( temporarily ) halted construction in Pryor , Oklahoma and slowed work in Lenoir , North Carolina .
Naturally , it cited " volatile economic conditions . "
The ad broker 's infrastructure spending was $ 368 million in Q4 versus $ 842 million in Q1 2008 .
At two separate tech conferences this week , Google boss Eric Schmidt stressed that the company was letting its cash " pile up " as the rest of the economy melts around it .
Nonetheless , Google is moving ahead in Finland .
The company expects its latest data center will be open for business in 2010 , after roughly 200 person - years of construction work .
It will employee roughly 50 workers full - time . ®

On January 22 , 2009 , the National Emergency Centers Establishment Act ( NECEA ) was submitted to Congress for consideration .
It was introduced by Congressman Alcee L. Hastings of Florida , a man who , in 1989 , became only the sixth federal judge in the history of America to be removed from office by the Senate for corruption and perjury .
Even though NECEA has received very little mainstream media coverage , action alerts are making their way across message boards and Internet sites due to Global Research ’s Michel Chossudovsky , who has brought to light both the Act itself as well as the U.S. government ’s actions leading up to the presentation of NECEA .
The question we must ask ourselves is simple : if NECEA is meant to address natural disasters , then why is the scope of the Act so vague , large and open - ended ?
The flipside of which is : if NECEA is only meant to address natural disasters , they why is n’t NECEA crystal clear on this point ?
Instead , we find that the purpose of these military - based emergency centres may be used to “ meet other appropriate needs , as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security . ”
It is when we attempt to understand the pocket of obscurity created by NECEA ’s vagueness , and while factoring in the readying of the U.S. military ’s response to the anticipated civil unrest ( due to the economic war being waged on all but the ‘ haves ’ ) , that the potentially insidious nature of the centres becomes evident .
21st century internment camps ?
On the surface , NECEA proposes to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security in the establishment of six “ national emergency centers on military installations , " one in each of the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) regions .
The purpose of these centres is to use existing military infrastructure for several emergency situations or natural disasters that might render individuals and families “ dislocated . ”
NECEA further proposes that over the course of the next two years , $ 360,000,000 is to be appropriated for this initiative .
( To whom do you think such construction contracts will be awarded ? )
[ efoods ]
As already mentioned , primary concern must be given to the following catch - all phrase : that the purpose of these military - based emergency centres may “ meet other appropriate needs , as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security . ”
In other words , that the purpose is to be determined by the same U.S. government body who , since launching the trailer for the War on Terrorism in 2001 , has systematically worked to institutionalize prejudice against civil rights groups and activists , anti-war movements , unions , ‘ brown ’ people ( you are homogeneous , do n’t challenge this ) and Muslims , while stripping the American citizen of their right to privacy and dissent .
Second , nowhere does NECEA provide clear indication as to which system of justice those inside of the emergency centres would be held .
Since they are to be established within the parameters of military bases , the de facto assumption is that those within would be subject to military law .
More dangerous perhaps is an all - together different system , removed even from the military one , learned courtesy of Guantanamo and all other secret and illegal US ‘ security ’ facilities across the globe .
NECEA does , however , mention that within six months , the “ Secretary of Defense shall transfer to the Secretary of Homeland Security administrative [ sic ] jurisdiction . ”
It would then follow that the definition of ‘ administrative ’ jurisdiction here may have nothing to do with legal jurisdiction , and so NECEA makes it possible that those within the emergency centre would , for the duration of their ( interred ) stay , not be subject to the regular legal system .
Once more , Americans may welcome the suspension of habeas corpus .
At a more general level , these centres are “ capable of being scaled up or down ” and would each be subject to a “ 24/7 operations watch center [ which ] shall be in full ready mode . ”
For what , exactly , the watch centre will be ready , is left to our imagination and to be utilised at the discretion of those in power .
Nowhere is it mentioned for whom these centres are to be established , or more specifically , who would be kept within these locations .
NECEA begs the following questions :
Are these ‘ emergency centres ’ only for U.S. Citizens ?
How does one become eligible ?
Is it on a first - come , first - served basis ?
Does one have to be arrested ?
If the centre is filled to capacity and there is indeed a natural disaster , how will individuals be kept out ?
If one is inside of the emergency centre , can they simply walk out and leave , or will their freedom of movement be at the discretion of the military ?
Etc. , ad infinitum .
Finally , and if not more insidious , is the reality that nowhere in NECEA is mentioned either the duration of these emergency centres or the efforts that must be undertaken to restore to order and to normal the lives and environment post ‘ emergency . ’
‘ None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free ’
Within the reality presented above and in order to understand the full weight of this silent war on Americans , it is necessary to view it within a greater context .
First , there is the unfortunate reality that Obama has time and again stated that his administration will neither investigate , hold to account , nor prosecute the officials responsible for the United States ’ criminal policies of torture , illegal detention and “ extraordinary rendition ” ( whereby alleged terrorists were kidnapped and sent beyond American borders to foreign countries or secret CIA prisons , where they were tortured ) .
More importantly , the Bush Administration ’s disregard for and mockery of international , as well as constitutional , law have not been undone by this new Administration , and there are no clear indications that they will be undone by Obama ’s campaign of ‘ change . ’
In fact , there is strong evidence to the contrary .
In laymen ’s terms , Obama ’s letting criminals walk , and in this context , this can only mean the following : that he does not believe they are guilty of a crime , thereby making it clear that Obama himself does not view torture , illegal detention or extraordinary rendition as criminal actions .
Second , that many experts are foreshadowing that the on - going financial disaster being levelled against all - but - the - wealthy is going to lead to great civil unrest within the United States .
Rightly , there exists a palpable fear that the ‘ have - nots ’ will take seriously their right to bear arms and they will rise against — not only the government — but all institutions who continue ( at the expense of the ‘ have - nots ’ ) to lie and behave in fraudulent manner .
Finally , that the reality that in the fall of 2008 , military bodies previously active only on foreign soil became operational within America ’s borders , with much of their mandate focussed on how to address ‘ civil unrest . ’
To recap , the U.S. has a President who — until he fully proves otherwise — seems relatively chill about torture , indefinite detention , extraordinary rendition and the suspension of habeas corpus .
Also , there is a strong foreshadowing of great civil unrest within the US , as well as a now present military contingent trained to deal with civil unrest .
Add to this recipe the creation of military - based emergency centres used to “ meet other appropriate needs , as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security ” and one is left with the choice to believe either they are witnessing random unrelated events or layered preparation to further dilute — and possibly completely suspend — civil rights .
Naturally , the third option is to view these events as a combination of coincidence and design ; no matter from which perspective you choose to approach it , the reality remains that NECEA , as it stands today , is a dangerous Act which threatens what remains of American civil liberties .

SAFA , West Bank ( Reuters ) - Dozens of Israelis from a Jewish settlement where a Palestinian killed a youth last week rampaged on Wednesday through a West Bank Arab village , smashing car windows and damaging homes , residents and medics said .
Slideshow ( 5 images )
At least five Palestinians were injured in violence that included confrontations between stone - throwing villagers and Israeli soldiers who arrived at the scene after the settlers , from Bat Ayin , entered neighboring Safa .
“ A large number of settlers came at 7:30 in the morning and started to smash car windows and throw rocks at houses , ” said Abu al - Abed , a resident of Safa , where 300 Palestinians live .
An Israeli military source said the violence started when Palestinians threw stones at Bat Ayin settlers praying on a nearby hill before the Jewish Passover holiday .
Safa residents said about 200 settlers , some of them carrying weapons , entered the village .
Soldiers fired rubber - coated metal bullets and also used tear gas during the clashes with Palestinian stone - throwers , villagers said .
There were no reports of any injuries or arrests among the settlers .
Last Thursday , a Palestinian wielding an axe killed a 13 - year - old youngster and wounded a boy , aged seven , in Bat Ayin .
The attacker , who was not identified , fled .
Some 1,000 Israelis live in Bat Ayin , near the Palestinian towns of Hebron and Bethlehem .
In 2002 , three settlers from Bat Ayin were sentenced by an Israeli court to prison terms ranging from 12 to 15 years for trying to set off a bomb near a Palestinian girls ’ school in Arab East Jerusalem .
The injured seven - year - old boy is a son of one of the three jailed settlers .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Spider silk is already tougher and lighter than steel , and now scientists have made it three times stronger by adding small amounts of metal .

The technique may be useful for manufacturing super - tough textiles and high - tech medical materials , including artificial bones and tendons .
“ It could make very strong thread for surgical operations , ” researcher Seung - Mo Lee of the Max Planck Institute of Microstructure Physics in Halle , Germany , said in a telephone interview .
Lee and colleagues , who published their findings in the journal Science , found that adding zinc , titanium or aluminum to a length of spider silk made it more resistant to breaking or deforming .
They used a process called atomic layer deposition , which not only coated spider dragline silks with metal but also caused some metal ions to penetrate the fibers and react with their protein structure .
Lee said he next wanted to try adding other materials , including artificial polymers like Teflon .
The idea was inspired by studies showing traces of metals in the toughest parts of some insect body parts .
The jaws of leaf - cutter ants and locusts , for example , both contain high levels of zinc , making them particularly stiff and hard .
Spider silk has long fascinated scientists but producing it in commercial quantities is difficult because spiders kept in captivity tend to eat each other .
As a result , researchers have looked at alternative ways of producing silk without spiders , by duplicating their spinning technique .
Approaches being tried include deriving fiber from the milk of transgenic goats with an extra spider - silk gene and adapting silk produced by other insects , such as silkworms .

A test tube based system of chemicals that exhibit life - like qualities such as indefinite self - replication , mutation , and survival of the fittest , has been created by US scientists .
The researchers say their perpetually replicating RNA enzymes take us a step closer to understanding the origins of life on Earth , as well as to how life may one day be synthesised in the lab .
The system , created by Gerald Joyce and Tracey Lincoln at the Scripps research institute in La Jolla , California , involves a cross-replicating pair of ribozymes ( RNA enzymes ) , each about 70 nucleotides long , which catalyse each other ’s synthesis .
So the ’ left ’ ribozyme templates the synthesis of the ’ right ’ , which in turn templates the ’ left ’ and so on , building each other via Watson - Crick base pairing .
’ This is the very end of the line , where chemistry starts turning into biology , ’ says Joyce .
’ It ’s the first case , other than in biology , of molecular information having been immortalised . ’
Joyce ’s experiment was designed to test the ’ RNA World ’ theory , which proposes that DNA - based life evolved from a stage whereby RNA acted as both an information - storage molecule , like DNA , and as a catalyst , like enzymes , and was also capable of self - replication .
’ This work is the biggest injection of support for the RNA world hypothesis in a long time , ’ says Donna Blackmond , Chair in Catalysis at Imperial College London , UK .
’ It ’s a demonstration of principle that indefinite replication , coupled with selection via mutation , is quite plausible for RNA .
The fact that it goes on indefinitely is a big thing for showing that this really could have been how life started , ’ she adds .
Scientists have previously dabbled with similar synthetic replicatory systems , but these systems fell short of mimicking biological systems because they eventually stop replicating .
This is because the bond between the catalyst and its product becomes too strong , making the system self - poisoning .
By using cross-replication , Joyce and Lincoln seem to have overcome this problem and shown , for the first time in a purely synthetic chemical system , indefinite replication , so long as the team continue adding oligonucleotide building blocks .
Only the strongest will survive
The system also demonstrates natural selection .
The team created twelve sets of cross-replicating enzymes ( ’ left ’ and ’ right ’ 1 to 12 ) and allowed them to compete for a common pool of oligonucleotide building blocks .
Occasionally , a mutation would arise , so instead of making ’ right 7 ’ , ’ left 7 ’ would instead combine oligonucleotides in a new way to make , for example , a ’ right 7 - left 12 ’ hybrid .
Such recombinants arose and then grew over many , many rounds of replication to dominate the population .
’ This parallels what happens in biological systems , like natural selection or survival of the fittest , ’ says Joyce .
’ It is n’t alive , however , because what it does n’t have is the ability to invent novel functions out of whole cloth .
If it could do that then most scientists would say that it crossed the line into life . ’

Advertisement Several EU states have criticised Pope Benedict for saying that the use of condoms could endanger public health and increase the problem of HIV / Aids .
The Pope argued that distribution of condoms aggravated the problem , rather than helping to contain the virus , as he began a visit to Africa this week .
France 's foreign ministry said condoms were fundamental to prevention .
German ministers said it was irresponsible to withhold family planning from the poorest of the poor .
The Roman Catholic Church believes marital fidelity and sexual abstinence are the best way to prevent the spread of HIV .
Some 22 million people are infected with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa , according to UN figures for 2007 .
This amounts to about two - thirds of the global total .
' Extremely harmful '
French foreign ministry spokesman Eric Chevallier said : " While it is not up to us to pass judgment on Church doctrine , we consider that such comments are a threat to public health policies and the duty to protect human life . "
The Pope is making matters worse
Bert Koenders
Dutch development minister
Why the Pope opposes condoms In Berlin , German Health Minister Ulla Schmidt and Development Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek - Zeul said in a joint statement : " Condoms save lives , in Europe as well as on other continents .
" Modern assistance to the developing world today must make access to family planning available to the poorest of the poor - especially the use of condoms .
" Anything else would be irresponsible . "
Dutch Development Minister Bert Koenders said it was " extremely harmful and very serious " that the Pope was " forbidding people from protecting themselves " .
" There is an enormous stigma surrounding the subject of Aids and Aids sufferers face serious discrimination , " he added .
" The Pope is making matters worse . "
' Increasing the problem '
On his way to Cameroon , the Pope said HIV / Aids was " a tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone , that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms , which can even increase the problem " .
Pope 's visit raises hopes Can Catholicism help Africa ?
The solution lay , he said , in a " spiritual and human awakening " and " friendship for those who suffer " .
Campaigners say condoms are one of the few methods proven to stop the spread of HIV .
Rebecca Hodes , of the Treatment Action Campaign in South Africa , said the Pope's " opposition to condoms conveys that religious dogma is more important to him than the lives of Africans " .
On Wednesday , the Pope attended a gathering of more than 30 Cameroonian bishops in the capital , Yaounde .
The Pope said Catholicism faced a threat from superstition
He told the bishops they had to preserve traditional African families and protect the country 's poor .
" In the context of globalisation with which we are all familiar , the Church takes a particular interest in those who are most deprived , " he said .
He said it was the duty of Christians to help to build " a more just world where everyone can live with dignity " , the Associated Press reported .
The Pope also warned of a threat to the Catholic Church in Cameroon from evangelical movements and from the " growing influence of superstitious forms of religion " .
Earlier on Wednesday , he held a private meeting with Mr Biya at the presidential palace .
The BBC's Caroline Duffield in Yaounde says Mr Biya 's consistent electoral victories have been widely condemned as fraudulent .
Having spoken out publically against corruption , many Cameroonians will be hoping that the Pope delivered his message in private as well , says our correspondent .
Pope Benedict is due to end his visit to Africa with a stop in Angola .

It 's the Genesis Wave !
They 're on a build - up to detonation !
Stars are born when gas clouds in galaxies collapse .
Eddies form , clumps and knots of higher density gas a hundred billion kilometers across , which then contract under their own gravity and form stars .
Sometimes , galaxies undergo violent bursts of star formation , making huge numbers of stars all at once .
What does it look like when that happens ?
This :
-- David MarcusStar Trek II : The Wrath of Khan
Coooooool .
This is Hubble 's view of the nearby dwarf galaxy IC 4662 .
At 8 million light years distant , it 's one of the closest galaxies in the sky , and that makes it a perfect target for all kinds of investigations .
In this case , astronomers targeted IC 4662 and several other nearby dwarf galaxies -- smaller - than - usual galaxies , much smaller than our Milky Way -- to try to understand how stars form in them .
IC 4662 is undergoing a current burst in star formation even as we watch .
See those two big red regions ?
Those are gigantic clouds of gas furiously forming new stars .
Take a close look at them : you can see how they appear to be less red in the middle , and there are lots of stars there .
That 's because massive stars born inside the clouds blast out ultraviolet light and strong winds of subatomic particles ( like a super solar wind ) , eating away at the gas and carving out a giant bubble in the cloud .
That kind of structure is a sure sign that stars are being born at a high rate ^*.
But we already knew this !
What 's new here is that it appears that in these dwarf galaxies , star formation happens in waves , starting in one place and sweeping across the entire galaxy over time .
That 's very interesting , and surprising .
It was thought that these starbursts , in general , just happened in one location and lasted for a few million years .
Now it looks like they start that way , but then spread out from there like an infection , with the whole process lasting for two hundred million years or more !
That tells us something about the way stars form in these galaxies , which also tells us about their structure , how the gas clouds are laid out , and how these galaxies behave .
We care about this for two reasons : one is that we are pretty sure that big galaxies , like our own , form by the collision and merger of smaller dwarf galaxies like this one .
The more we understand about dwarf galaxies , the better a picture we get of the history and composition of our own .
But we also care because this is just so very cool .
We can watch as stars are born in other galaxies !
We can understand how this happens , why it happens , and what the implications are ... and we do it using an observatory orbiting our planet , pointed toward a cosmic collection of stars and gas that lies 80 quintillion kilometers away !
Always try to remember that when you read something about science .
We do this stuff because it 's important , but we also do it because it 's so tremendously wonderful .

^*If you download the ginormous version of this image ( it 's 5 Mb ) you can see faint , arc - shaped extensions to the two reddish gas clouds ( above the one at the top of the picture , and below the one at the bottom ) .
I suspect that 's where the furious winds from the stars have literally popped the bubbles ; what astronomers call a blowout for obvious reasons .
You can see that the hollow parts of the clouds " point " toward those blowouts , just as you 'd expect if the stars inside had pushed on the cloud itself and caused it to pop in that direction .
Tres , tres cool .
You 've probably heard by now .

Black Swan Love Triangle Results In Babies
Two black swans were donated to Wooleng Park , in Taiwan back in 2002 .
The two swans were very close and would always be together everywhere they went .
Everyone in the park was very happy and was hopeful that they should have baby swans soon and that they would be a big happy family .
Years went by , none of the eggs were hatched , and finally everyone realized both swans were actually female .
Everybody accepted the fact that there would be no baby swans and were happy that at least the swans had each other and were happy .
In May 2008 a zoo nearby donated a really old male swan to the park to retire and that changed everything .
Nothing would ever be the same for the two black swans .
Soon after the male arrived , it turned into a love triangle .
One of the females fell in love with the male swan and left her partner for him .
In February 2009 , eggs were hatched and baby swans were born .
All the visitors to the park now ca n’t stop complimenting on how cute the babies are and what a happy family they are .
However , nobody seems to remember the ex . she is always by herself taking long walks on the shore and spends less and less time in the pond .
Seeing the new happy family just reminds her of the happy time that she used to have and she can never have it back , plus now that babies were born everything is too late .
She is the laughing stock of the park .
While a world of Trekkers believed the new J.J. Abrams Star Trek would premiere Tuesday in Australia , Leonard Nimoy made a surprise appearance Monday night in Texas to screen the film for an unsuspecting audience .
A theater full of Trek fans showed up in Austin , Texas , thinking they were going to see a new print of the classic Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan and 10 minutes of Abrams ' reboot , all organized by Ain't It Cool News .
But the original Spock shocked the house by announcing they would in fact see the entire new movie just hours before it made its international bow in Sydney .
The early fan reviews on Twitter are running almost entirely positive so far .

Trivia
Its highly plausible , though not officially confirmed , that the television mini-series Jesus von Nazareth ( 1977 ) , and the later 1979 extended version , inspired Monty Python to later create this movie .
Both have a similar plot , some of the same sets were re-used , and in particular the scene with John the Baptist declaring he's not the Messiah , is obviously part inspiration for the later " he 's a very naughty boy " .
In fact , this movie was shot on the same sets as the mini-series and with the same extras .
Terry Jones recalled that some said to him , " Well , Franco Zeffirelli would n't have shot it like that , you know . "

New tactics in film piracy battle
The FBI are investigating the online leak of an almost finished copy of X - Men Origins : Wolverine , a month before the film 's cinema release .
The Hugh Jackman film was downloaded an estimated 100,000 times from file - sharing websites on Tuesday .
20th Century
Fox confirmed the copy had now been removed and the FBI informed .
The studio behind Wolverine stated : " The source of the initial leak and any subsequent postings will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law . "
" The courts have handed down significant criminal sentences for such acts " the studio noted .
' Stolen and incomplete ' Both the FBI and the Motion Picture Association of America are " actively investigating " the crime .
The film is not due for release until 29 April in the UK and 1 May in the US .
Fox called the leaked movie a " stolen , incomplete and early version " .
Viewers reported that green screens and wires attached to actors were still visible .
One user wrote on film website aintitcool.com : " The CGI is missing and the movie looks horrible without it .
Such theft undermines the enormous efforts of the filmmakers and actors and , above all , hurts fans of the film
20th Century
Fox statement " Even if you see the workprint you 're still going to have to go see it in the theatre to fully experience the full movie with CGI effects fully intact . "
Fox confirmed the film " was without many effects and had missing scenes and temporary sound and music . "
' Forensically marked '
A statement from the studio said that once the film was discovered online they " immediately contacted the appropriate legal authorities and had it removed " .
The studio added that because their content is forensically marked they should be able to trace the person who uploaded it .
A brief caption at the beginning of the film reads ' Rising Sun Pictures ' and is dated 2 March , 2009 .
Rising Sun is an Australian visual effects company that worked on the film - but there is no evidence to suggest it was involved in the leak .
The film features many special effects , not all of which are in the leaked copy
In a statement , the company 's chairman , Tony Clark , said : " From the reports we 've had , the stolen material is a work in progress version of the film with many incomplete sections .
" As we worked on individual sequences within the film , neither RSP nor its staff members have ever been in possession of a full - length version , so it would have been impossible for the movie to have been leaked from here .
" It 's common practice for work in progress between us and the production to carry vendor watermarks and for these works in progress to be integrated into various edits of the film for screenings , which would explain why our name appears . "
The Federation Against Copyright
Theft said a leak of this kind was extremely unusual as pre-release security had been tightened in recent years .
Access to a whole film is severely restricted , with post production workers being given small portions of the movie to work on and measures put in place to stop it being copied on to disc .
Spokesperson Eddy Leviten explained : " No - one working on a film in any capacity wants to see their hard work released through illegal means - piracy is not a fun thing . "
' Hurts fans '
Although several reviews of the incomplete film have appeared online , Fox was quick to praise the reaction of web users to the leak .
" We are encouraged by the support of fansites condemning piracy and this illegal posting and pointing out that such theft undermines the enormous efforts of the filmmakers and actors and , above all , hurts fans of the film " the studio said .
In 2007 director Eli Roth blamed an online leak of his horror film Hostel : Part II for reducing box office returns .
In an interview with MTV he claimed : " You could buy Hostel : Part II for a quarter in Mexico City .
As a result , in a lot of countries where the piracy was bad , they just did n't even release it . "
The leak came as a new campaign against film piracy launched in UK cinemas .
In a change from recent years , the adverts move away from the message that piracy is theft .
Audiences will instead see a trailer , fronted by Dr Who actor Noel Clarke , thanking them for paying to come and watch a film .

Louie Bellson , a jazz drummer and bandleader who combined remarkable instrumental virtuosity with far - ranging compositional skills , has died .
He was 84 .
According to his wife , Francine , Bellson died Saturday at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles of complications of Parkinson ’s disease following a broken hip in November .
Bellson ’s long , productive career stretched from his teens -- when , in competition with 40,000 other young players , he won the Slingerland National Gene Krupa drumming contest -- to the tours and seminars he continued until 2008 .
Best known as a superlative big band drummer as a result of his work in the 1940s and ‘ 50s with Tommy Dorsey , Count Basie , Benny Goodman , Harry James , Duke Ellington and others , Bellson was also an adept small group player .
His more than 200 recorded appearances as leader and sideman encompass sessions with Jazz at the Philharmonic , Woody Herman , Stan Getz , Dizzy Gillespie , Louis Armstrong , James Brown and dozens of others , including Ellington ’s Big Four alongside guitarist Joe Pass and bassist Ray Brown .
“ What makes Bellson so special , ” former Times jazz critic Leonard Feather wrote in 1991 , “ is his overall musicianship .
A gifted composer and arranger who has written everything from jazz instrumentals to ballets , he can incorporate his role logically instead of banging away without regard to the dynamic or melodic structure of the work in progress . ”
Bellson often said that he regarded his tenure with Ellington as one of the significant points in his career .
Performing with the orchestra in the early ‘ 50s triggered a forward leap in his development as an instrumentalist and his confidence as a composer .
A pair of his best - known big band works , “ The Hawk Talks ” and “ Skin Deep ” became popular staples of the Ellington repertoire -- but not without some initial reservations from Bellson .
In a 2006 interview he said he had written “ The Hawk Talks ” with Harry James in mind .
“ Harry was called ‘ The Hawk , ’ ” Bellson recalled .
“ But I wrote it when I was with Duke , and it took a lot of coaxing from [ trombonist ] Juan Tizol to make me bring it to Duke .
I told Juan , ‘ Are you crazy ?
You want me to bring music in to a place with Duke and Billy Strayhorn ?
Geniuses like that ?
No way . ’
I brought it in anyhow and lo and behold , Duke recorded it right away .
“ But it was Duke who taught me how to write .
How to be original .
How to know what to do with the rhythm section , with the horns . ”
Ellington returned Bellson ’s high regard , noting , “ Not only is Louie Bellson the world ’s greatest drummer . . . he ’s the world ’s greatest musician ! ”
Other artists concurred .
Oscar Peterson described Bellson as “ the epitome of musical talent .
. . .
I consider him one of the musical giants of our age . ”
Bobby Colomby , former drummer for Blood , Sweat & Tears , pointed to Bellson ’s pioneering work with the difficult technique of employing two bass drums , saying , “ Louie had awesome , jaw - dropping technique .
And I really do n’t think he was ever fully appreciated for what an amazing drummer he really was . ”
Bellson was born Luigi Paulino Alfredo Francesco Antonio Balassoni , on July 6 , 1924 , in Rock Falls , Ill .
Drawn to percussion as early as age 3 , he was urged by his father , who owned a music store , to study keyboards , harmony and theory .
After winning the Krupa drum competition , he was offered a job in Ted Fio Rito ’s dance band at Los Angeles ’ Florentine Gardens .
A few months later , still in his teens , he was hired by Goodman .
After serving in the Army for three years , Bellson returned to the Goodman band in 1946 for a year before moving on to play with Dorsey and James .
The arrival of bebop , however , shifted the jazz world ’s orientation toward smaller groups and a different style of rhythm playing .
He was an instrumentalist and percussionist , more than simply a drummer , and immediately sought ways to adapt his own technique to the newly emerging styles .
“ I was used to driving a big band -- four solid beats on the bass drum , ” he explained to the JazzTimes .
“ Coming from that to bebop , I still liked to drop bombs now and then .
Then Lester Young came to me once and said , ‘ Lou , just play titty - bop , titty - bop and do n’t drop no bombs . ’
That ’s when I got it , putting all that energy up into the right hand , playing on the cymbal .
And I loved it .
The left hand was syncopated , and the bass drum could be syncopated also , because a good bass player playing four beats to the bar took care of that basic beat . ”
While performing with Ellington from 1951 to 1953 , Bellson met and married singer Pearl Bailey .
Their interracial marriage , rare for the early ‘ 50s , coincided with Bellson ’s presence as the only white member of the Duke Ellington Orchestra .
He spent the next few decades alternating between leading his own small groups and big bands , serving as Bailey ’s music director and occasionally returning to work as a stellar sideman .
A stint with Basie in 1961 was followed by a return to Ellington , performing the Concert of Sacred Music that Ellington described as “ the most important thing I ’ve ever done . ”
After Bailey ’s death in 1990 , Bellson continued his growing activities as a jazz educator while leading various - sized ensembles , including a pair of on - call big bands available for performances on both coasts .
His most recent recordings include “ The Sacred Music of Louie Bellson and the Jazz Ballet ” and “ The Louie and Clark Expedition 2 " with trumpeter Clark Terry .
Bellson wrote more than 1,000 compositions and arrangements , including ballet music , sacred music , “ The London Suite , ” the “ Concerto for Jazz Drummer and Full Orchestra ” and a Broadway musical , “ Portofino , ” in addition to his numerous big band charts and small ensemble pieces .
He wrote more than a dozen books and booklets on drums and percussion .
He received a Jazz Masters Award from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1994 ; a Living Jazz Legends Award from the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 2007 ; a Jazz Living Legend Award from the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers ; and an American Drummers Achievement Award from the Avedis Zildjian Co .
He is survived by his wife of 16 years , Francine ; daughters Dee Dee Bellson and Debra Hughes ; two grandchildren ; two brothers and two sisters .
A Los Angeles - area service is being planned , followed by a funeral and burial in Moline , Ill .

Heckman is a freelance writer .
Professor Belcher holds up the battery Viruses have been used to help build batteries that may one day power cars and all types of electronic devices .
The speed and relatively cheap cost of manufacturing virus batteries could prove attractive to industry .
Professor Angela Belcher , who led the research team , said : " Our material is powerful enough to be able to be used in a car battery . "
The team from MIT in the US is now working on higher power batteries .
Scientists at MIT used the viruses to build both the positively and negatively charged ends of a battery , the cathode and anode , the journal Science reports .
A battery typically has four key components - the anode and cathode , an electrolyte that flows between them , and a separator to keep the anode and cathode apart .
Essentially , a battery turns chemical energy into electrochemical energy when an electron flow passes from the negative end to the positive end through a conductive chemical , the electrolyte .
Researchers constructed a lithium - ion battery , similar to those used in millions of devices , but one which uses genetically engineered viruses to create the negatively charged anode and positively charged cathode .
The virus battery could be commercialised
The virus is a so - called common bacteriophage which infects bacteria and is harmless to humans .
Three years ago the MIT scientists manipulated genes inside a virus that coaxed the particles to grow and self - assemble to form a nanowire anode one - tenth the width of a human hair .
The microbes are encouraged to collect exotic materials - cobalt oxide and gold - and because the particles are negatively charged , they can be formed into a dense , virus - loaded film which acts as an anode and " grows " on a polymer separator .
Researchers , including MIT Professor Gerbrand Ceder and Associate Professor Michael Strano , have now developed a highly powerful cathode .
The work was more difficult because the material had to be highly conductive in order to be effective and most candidate materials for cathodes are highly insulating .
The virus picks up a carbon nanotube after being genetically engineered
The virus was coaxed into binding with iron phosphate and then carbon nanotubes to create a highly conductive material .
The batteries have the same energy capacity and power performance as rechargeable batteries used to power plug - in hybrid cars .
The prototype battery is currently the size of a coin but the scientists believe it can be scaled and be used to create flexible batteries that can take the shape of their container , which is perfect for mobile or small devices .
The scientists have also been able to create micro-batteries which could be used to power a future generation of tiny devices .
" The advantage of using genetics is that things can be made better and better , " explained Professor Belcher .
" You are not stuck with a particular material ; you have selection and evolution on your side because it can be genetically engineered . "
The researchers are now looking for better materials to work with the viruses to create a next - generation battery , which is even higher powered .
" Scale is the issue , " admitted Professor Belcher .
" But we are not going to scale until we have the right material .
We believe this is possible and has commercial implications otherwise we would not be researching in this area . "
Currently , the virus battery can only be charged and discharged about 100 times before it begins to lose its capacity to store a charge , but Professor Belcher said " we expect them to be able to go much longer " .
The process to build the batteries uses no harmful or toxic materials and so is attractive from an environmental point of view .
Professor Belcher said : " To us , the environmental aspects are very important .
" Put simply , we can't do anything that kills our organisms . "

Australia : Racism and the 47 Afghan asylum seekers
22 April 2009
The arrival of a boatload of 47 Afghan asylum seekers , five of whom tragically died in an explosion last week off Australia ’s northern coast , has triggered an hysterical national security and anti-refugee campaign by politicians and the media .
Anyone looking in from outside would be forgiven for believing that the country was under imminent threat of invasion from a huge influx of aliens , intent on seizing scarce resources and undermining the “ Australian way of life ” .
Within hours of the boat explosion on April 16 , and before any investigation , the Western Australian state premier vilified the impoverished Afghans , declaring that they had deliberately doused their vessel with petrol and ignited it .
The federal opposition criticised Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd for weakening Australia ’s “ border protection ” — the use of the navy and offshore detention centres to prevent asylum seekers from reaching Australian shores .
Rudd responded by declaring that Labor was just as tough on “ border security ” and denounced “ people smugglers ” as “ evil ” and the “ lowest form of human life ” .
Behind these positions lies , first and foremost , a callous indifference to the plight of millions of ordinary people driven by desperate circumstances to seek refuge in other countries .
The latest global report of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimates there are 11.4 million refugees , most of them from impoverished and war - torn countries .
The flood of asylum seekers leaving Afghanistan and Iraq , for example , is a product of the US - led neo-colonial occupations that Australian governments have backed to the hilt .
Those seeking asylum in Australia during the past year — a total of 4,750 — form a tiny percentage of the 383,000 applications made last year in industrialised countries .
Australia is not the only country that imposes physical and legal barriers to those whose only “ crime ” is to seek a better life for themselves and their families .
Nor are Australian politicians the only ones to whip up anti-immigrant xenophobia in times of crisis to divert attention from their own failure to provide jobs , decent housing , education and health care for their citizens .
But in Australia , anti-refugee sentiment plays a particularly odious and prominent role , which is deeply rooted in the very formation of Australian capitalism and the consolidation of the nation state in 1901 .
The racist “ White Australia ” immigration policy — which officially excluded all non-European immigrants — was one of the first acts of the newly established Australian parliament .
Contrary to myth , its roots do not lie in the Australian people , but in the policy of the British authorities who wanted a stable colonial outpost in the Asia Pacific region .
Its purpose was to keep the rebellious Australian working class separate from the oppressed masses in the colonies and semi-colonies of Asia .
The Labor Party and the trade unions became the most enthusiastic proponents of White Australia as the country ’s national ideology .
Seeking to derail the class struggle within the country , and prevent the emergence of an independent socialist movement , they promoted the reactionary utopian conception that the “ working man ’s paradise ” could be secured by excluding the alleged common enemy outside .
While overt White Australian racism became untenable by the late 1960s , as the ruling elite increasingly depended on economic ties with Asia , the underlying conceptions that the impoverished masses of Asia were a “ threat ” , and that workers ’ living standards could only be maintained by sealing the country ’s borders and excluding others — remained the basis of the immigration policy of every subsequent government .
The subtext of virtually every statement issued by politicians from both major parties since the Afghans ’ boat was intercepted by the navy is that their arrival signals a threat , not merely to Australia ’s “ border security ” , but to the living standards , jobs and social services available to the population as a whole .
These positions are as false and reactionary today as they were at the time of federation , more than 100 years ago .
Mounting social problems and economic deprivation are not caused by “ foreigners ” but by the parasitic operations of the profit system .
The world has abundant resources , which , if brought under the rational and democratic control of working people , would be more than capable of providing secure jobs and a decent standard of living , fit for human beings , to everyone on the planet .
Under the existing social and economic order , however , these resources are monopolised by a tiny ultra - wealthy elite .
That the current anti-refugee campaign coincides with the onset of recession is no accident .
Just as the ruling elite utilised White Australia to derail an upsurge of the working class in the 1890s , a similar political diversion is being drummed up today .
Its primary goal is to head off a unified struggle by working people in Australia , throughout the region and internationally , in defence of their own independent class interests amid the greatest crisis of world capitalism since the 1930s .
That the Australian ruling elite is once again reviving the filthy traditions of White Australia is a warning of what will undoubtedly develop in every advanced capitalist country .
The notoriously brutal immigration legislation of the former Howard government was closely followed and imitated by governments in a number of countries , most notably Britain .
As the economic crisis worsens , racism and the scapegoating of asylum seekers will be stepped up .
Under the profit system , capital is free to roam the globe in pursuit of the most profitable conditions , while ordinary people seeking to establish nothing but a secure life free from violence and hunger , are harassed and punished as criminals .
Against this poisonous campaign , the working class of all countries must fight for the right of all people to live and work wherever they wish , with full citizenship rights .
There are no national solutions to the deepening crisis facing working people .
What is required is the development of a globally unified movement of the working class , based on an internationalist and socialist perspective aimed at the abolition of capitalism , and the outmoded nation - state system upon which it rests , and the establishment of a planned world economy that will satisfy the economic , social and cultural needs of all .

This year 's winning photo is of a male corkwing wrasse building a nest , by Robert Bailey .
The male wrasse scours the shallows looking for a suitable nook or cranny in the rocks , then spends several days carefully selecting pieces of seaweed with which to decorate and line it .
This should attract a female to leave a clutch of eggs
Harry Young , an 82 year old black farmer from Owensboro , Kentucky
was arrested and released on $ 50,000 bond in connection with allegations
of threatening US Department of Agriculture employees .
terroristic threatening .
It all stems from a contested foreclosure and sale of his family farm in 2005 .
Young was arrested over the weekend on allegations that he threatened a federal employee of a farm agency last week via phone .
Supporters are questioning the arrest on those allegations , particularly given the fact that Young has consistently maintained an orderly , legal attempt to regain his land and has been in plain sight ,
presenting his case to Congress and to the world and working his rented fields for years .
Young says he never made threats to " blow something up " , and supporters question whether
the allegations have merit , particularly because of the state of feud that has existed between
Young and the FSA office in Owensboro .
Since the foreclosure and auction his Utica Kentucky farm in 2005 , Young has given interviews ,
written hundreds of letters to Congress and newspapers and has testified before Congress .
And he has made enemies along the way , in and out of governnment .
Young 's outspokenness has generated emnity from supremacists and hate groups .
His property has
been vandalized and he has also been the target of terroristic threats by phone .
The situation has been
so volatile , that the county sheriff advised him to carry a gun .
Vandals have shot at his house .
They have pulled protest signs from his front yard on
several occassions .
In 2007 , supremacist groups reportedly tresspassed on his rented fields .
When he secured the fields with a locked gate , tresspassers cut the locks and chains and
pulled gateposts out of the ground with a tractor .
Long before the current foreclosure fraud and Wall Street mortgage meltdown began generating
headlines , Young and farm rights supporters maintained that the Farm Service Agency and
the United States Department of Agriculture had major problems in the loan application process .
Civil rights activists and audits noted problems in loan servicing , document forgery ,
conflicts of interest , employees benefitting from bonuses from foreclosing on loans they serviced ,
and maintaining a hostile environment for minority employees and farmers alike .
Noting the endimic institutional racism and anti-family farmer bias within the USDA ,
more than one author has called the USDA the " Last Plantation . "
Even after years of investigations , lawsuits and congressional hearings , critics say the agency
remains biased against minority farmers and family farmers .
According to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack ,
the agency still has problems .
Secretary Vilsack told a group of black farmers at a conference sponsored by
the Federation of Southern Cooperatives and the Land Assistance Fund , that " Some folks refer to USDA as
the last plantation , and it has a pretty poor history of taking care of people of color . "
( Congress Daily , 2-23-09 )
Historically , agency employees have been downright antagonistic , spending careers working in a culture of
institutional bias , which has existed for generations .
Critics say the agency has been practicing agism , sexism
and racism for so long , that discrimination against minority employees and farmers is as much a part of the
culture as the paperwork the bureaucracy generates .
" You 've got outright bias and discrimination .
Also you 've got good people who do n't even know that they 're discriminating , " said Vilsack .
" It 's necessary to begin the process of re-educating people . " ( Ibid )
Activists say " business as usual " in the agency includes document forgery , identity theft and collusion with
local real estate developers , favored white farmers and county deed registration offices .
Documents have
reportedly been destroyed in some local farm loan offices , and farmers around the country have voiced
complaints over alleged foot dragging and obstruction of Freedom of Information ( FOIA ) requests to the
agency .
Many say the information in their files is not accurate and often contains forged or incomplete documents .
s in the cases of tens of thousands of foreclosure cases , , and that many documents are missing , as well .
He says
he has a signed document from the local Farm Service Agency supervisor that his loan was paid .
While Young
maintains that he has never had his day in court , the government says he has had a day in court , represented by a local attorney .
Young claims he never hired the man .
Land theft activists say , at one time , it was common for white attorneys to " represent "
black clients who never hired them , in favor of biased interests who wanted the black victim 's land or property .
Historic problems in the Farm Services administration continue .
Family farmers and black land owners continue to be victimized
by the system .
White employees within the system worked in a culture of racism and bias toward large farm operations .
Lawrence Lucas , a retired USDA employee , who was one of the whistleblowers in the historic Pigford vs. Glickman " Black Farmers Case , "
says " Racism and sexism is institionalized and perpetuated .
We 're not just talking about black farmers but Hispanic farmers , women farmers . "
Dr. John Boyd , will lead a protest April 28 , 2009 in Washington , DC .
Among the issues Dr. Boyd will cover are : * Failure to pay administrative costs
necessary to process black farmer discrimination claims ;
* Failure to pass legislation that will provide full compensation to all eligible black farmers ;
* The need to re-open black farmer complaints closed by the USDA Office of Civil Rights without an investigation ;
* The need to revamp the USDA 's County Committee System that discriminates against black farmers ;
* The need to include black farmers in subsidy programs .
According to Donald Burger , a retired federal employee , former director Iowa Civil Rights Commission ,
" Harry Young 's case is one of the best and well document examples of the collaboration between the
Department of Agriculture Office of General Counsel and the prolonged failure of the Office for
Civil Rights within the Department of Agriculture in providing a remedy .
It is encouraging that Secretary Vilsac has appointed a Special Assistant , who
formerly served as Director of Office of Civil Rights in the Clinton Administration .
His name is Lloyd Wright . "
Burger says " Mr. Wright met with a delegation of black farmers last month to discuss
the nature of complaints nationwide on ongoing problems within the Office of General
Counsel abetted by the US Department of Justice Michael Sitkof and dozens of US Attorneys nationwide . "

Advertisement Campaigners have reacted with anger to new rules on the eligibility of Gurkha veterans to live in the UK .
The Home Office said that new rules would allow about 4,300 more to settle , but the Gurkha Justice Campaign said it would be just 100 .
Actress Joanna Lumley , a campaigner for the Gurkhas , said the announcement made her " ashamed of our administration " .
Immigration Minister Phil Woolas denied he had betrayed the Gurkhas , adding : " This improves the situation . "
He said : " It has never been the case that all Gurkhas pre-1997 were to be allowed to stay in the country .
With their dependants you could be looking at 100,000 people .
" It 's simply not true that we have betrayed the Gurkhas .
When people read the guidelines they will see the sense of them . "
' Truly appalling '
In September 2008 , the High Court ruled that immigration rules denying Gurkhas who retired before 1997 - about 36,000 - an automatic right to stay in the UK were unlawful .
If they want Gurkha soldiers , they should treat them equally
Dhan Gurung
Ex -Gurkha
Lumley tears over Gurkha cause Send us your comments Peter Carroll , from the Gurkha Justice Campaign , said the fight to allow them to stay in this country would continue with renewed vigour .
He added : " The one group of people that has never let this country down has been let down today in a manner which is truly appalling . "
David Enwright , a solicitor representing the Gurkhas , said : " This government , Mr Woolas , should hang their head in shame so low that their forehead should touch their boots .
" This is a disgrace and a betrayal of our armed forces and our veterans . "
Dhan Gurung , the first ex-Gurkha to be elected as a councillor in the UK , said the announcement was " insulting to loyal Gurkhas " .
He added : " If they want Gurkha soldiers , they should treat them equally . "
SETTLEMENT CRITERIA
Three years continuous residence in the UK during or after service Close family in the UK A bravery award of level one to three Service of 20 years or more in the Gurkha brigade Chronic or long - term medical condition caused or aggravated by service Gurkhas who retired before 1997 must meet at least one of these conditions But Prime Minister Gordon Brown insisted the new rules were fair and took into account " the responsibilities we have accepted " towards the Gurkhas .
" To go back 20 years from 1997 is something that 's a major change in policy and will help a large number of Gurkhas if they wish to make the decision to come to Britain , " he said .
" And remember that there are costs involved in that decision that we have got to meet . "
Gurkhas have been part of the Army for almost 200 years and are hand - picked from a fiercely - contested recruitment contest in Nepal to win the right to join .
They have seen combat all over the world , with 200,000 having fought in the two world wars and 45,000 believed to have lost their lives fighting for Britain .
The regiment moved its main base from Hong Kong to the UK in 1997 and the government had argued that Gurkhas discharged before that date were unlikely to have strong residential ties with the UK .
That meant those who wanted to settle in the UK had to apply for British residency and could be refused and deported .
Gurkhas are known for their bravery and fighting spirit Mr Woolas outlined the eligibility criteria in a written ministerial statement .
Gurkhas and their families will be allowed to stay in the UK if they meet at least one of five requirements .
These are three years of continuous residence in the UK , close family in the country , 20 or more years of service , a level one to three bravery award , and a serious medical condition caused or aggravated by service .
Alternatively , veterans can gain residency if they meet at least two of an additional set of three criteria .
These are having been awarded an MoD disability pension but no longer having a chronic condition , having been mentioned in dispatches , and 10 years ' service or a campaign medal .
But Ms Lumley , whose father served with the Gurkhas , said most Gurkhas would not have been allowed to stay in the UK for three years or have gained a bravery award .
She added that only officers would have achieved 20 years of service , and that it would be near - impossible for troops who served in the 1950s and 1960s to prove that their medical conditions were caused by their time in the forces .
" They 've given five bullet points that virtually cannot be met by the ordinary Gurkha soldier , " she said .
" It is so obvious that the treatment of the Gurkhas has been a huge injustice , " she said .
" To treat them like this is despicable . "
ALTERNATIVE CRITERIA
Awarded a UK MoD disability pension but no longer have a chronic medical condition Mentioned in dispatches Service of 10 years , or a campaign medal for active service Gurkhas who retired before 1997 must meet at least two of these conditions
The Home Office said that as a result of the decision , a total of 4,300 Gurkhas who served prior to 1997 would be eligible for residency .
A spokesman added there were currently 1,300 applications outstanding , 300 of which would now be granted .
In September , Mr Justice Blake ruled that instructions given by the Home Office to immigration officials were unlawful and needed urgent revision .
He said the Gurkhas ' long service , conspicuous acts of bravery and loyalty to the Crown all pointed to a " moral debt of honour " and gratitude felt by British people .
The government promised to revise its guidance , but in March 2009 , the Gurkhas returned to the High Court to try and enforce the ruling .

Contrary to Microsoft marketing honcho David Webster 's snarky recent assertion , Macs are n't " washed with unicorn tears " -- at least as far as I know .
However , lots of extremely rational reasons exist to choose a Mac running OS X over a Windows PC .
Macs can leave you happier and more productive than you would have been if you 'd bought a Windows system , and feeling you got good value for your money even though a Mac is never the cheapest option .
I 'm no hidebound advocate for the supremacy of Macs in every instance -- the last two computers I 've bought have both been Windows laptops , and I cheerfully and sincerely wrote an article called Eight Reasons Your Next Computer Should be a PC to accompany this one .
But when friends toss the eternal " PC or Mac ? " question my way , these are the points I bring up in favor of the Mac .
They 're listed rough order of their positive impact on your everyday computing experience as I see it .
1. Macs are consistently consistent .
Windows Vista reminds me of the legendarily inexplicable Winchester Mystery House -- a place with endless wings and far - flung rooms connected by twisty staircases and secret passages .
And every time Microsoft does a redecorating job ( also known as an upgrade ) , it moves some stuff around for no apparent reason .
OS X's logical , minimalist interface simply involves fewer things that must be learned and relearned , and Apple messes less with it in new releases such as Leopard .
Bottom line :
It 's easier to get stuff done .
2 . The joy of predictability .
Anyone who 's ever suffered the indignity known as a Kernel Panic knows that Macs are n't bulletproof .
But logging thousands of hours both on Windows PCs from multiple manufacturers and on Macs has convinced me that the average Mac is meaningfully less flaky than the average PC .
In my experience Macs crash less , suffer from fewer inexplicable slowdowns , deal better with tight memory situations , and boot up and shut down quicker and more reliably .
I do n't pretend to have all the answers why , but it presumably does n't hurt that Apple is the only company in the business that writes its own operating system and designs its own hardware .
3 . Who needs security headaches ?
If the Internet 's bad guys ever decide to pummel OS X with the same intensity that they 've pounded on Windows for years , the free ride for Mac fans may end .
But for now , this fact is indisputable : A Mac owner who uses no security software at all runs less risk of being infected by spyware or a virus than a Windows user who obsessively protects his or her PC .
In the last week alone , two Windows - using pals have been crippled by attacks ; I 've never heard even one real - world horror story from a friend about a Mac security meltdown .
4. Crud , or the lack thereof .
Windows is an infinitely better operating system when it is n't smothered by the demoware , adware , and other unwantedware that so many PC manufacturers splay onto the Start menu , the desktop , and the System Tray .
Macs are utterly free of such junk , as well as native - to - Windows irritations like word balloons burbling out of the System Tray , Windows Activation , and User Account Control .
And while PC manufacturers sometimes fix things about Windows that were n't broken -- take the inscrutable Wi-Fi utility that Lenovo bolts onto Windows Vista -- Apple wrote OS X in the first place .
You can't tamper with your own OS .
5. Details count .
You can buy a perfectly pleasing Windows PC that matches a Mac's CPU speed , RAM , hard - drive space , and other specs for a lot less money .
But it wo n't have an AC adapter with hooks that let you wrap up the cord for travel , or a MagSafe connector that wo n't get damaged if it 's accidentally yanked out of the computer .
It wo n't have an oversized touchpad with multitouch gestures that help you navigate through documents and around the Web .
And it will likely be heavier and bulkier than a comparable Mac .
Next time I encounter a Microsoft executive tsk- tsking about the onerous " Apple Tax " imposed by a Mac 's needless glitz , I 'm tempted to ask him what car he drives -- and whether he chose the model with the cloth seats and hand - cranked windows , or one with a few creature comforts .
6 . Apple is one of the world 's best software companies .
Forget about all those Macs , iPods , and iPhones for a moment : Apple 's applications are useful , enjoyable , and innovative , from the iLife creativity suite ( whose presence on every new Mac is in itself an argument for the platform ) to industrial - strength tools such as Final Cut Pro .
Most run only on OS X .
( The Windows versions of iTunes , Safari , and QuickTime are okay , but Apple does its best work on its own operating system and hardware . )
7 . The Apple Store 's Genius Bar rocks .
Buy a Mac , and you qualify for free in - person technical support from a patient rep with a deep knowledge of your system .
I 've had Geniuses do everything from reinstall my OS to replace broken keys on the spot .
Microsoft has announced plans to train " Windows Gurus " to provide similar customer care at other retailers ; it 's worth trying , but there 's no way it 's going to replicate the Genius Bar experience .
There are simply too many PCs from too many companies running too many variations on Windows for any one person to be an expert on everything .
8 . Hey , Macs are PCs .
By which I mean that Leopard 's Boot Camp feature -- and better yet the Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion virtualization utilities -- let you run Windows , and Windows applications , on a Mac . ( I do it myself on my Macs to use such Windows - only apps as TurboTax Business , as well as Office 2007 , which I prefer to Microsoft 's Mac version of Office . )
I 'm listing this last because I ultimately see running Windows on a Mac as a last resort :
It 's usually not necessary , and it degrades some of the other virtues of the Mac , such as protection from Windows security risks .
But when it 's valuable , it 's really valuable .
If you 've got more reasons to buy a Mac , sound off in the comments below .
Also welcome : arguments against the Mac ... some of which I detail in my list of reasons to stick with Windows .

There can be little doubt as to who is currently in charge of America 's Democratic Party .
Rush Limbaugh and Sarah Palin are Republican stars From behind his desk in the Oval Office , Barack Obama can usually rely on the members of his party to follow his lead .
But the divided nature of the American political system means that the party that does not hold the White House does not have a single figure it can look to for leadership .
This means that the Republicans - who currently hold neither the White House , nor either House of Congress - find themselves without a leader .
A number of high - profile Republicans are attempting to fill this vacuum by promoting their own policy ideas , and the resulting debate about the future direction of the party has been vigorous , verging on rancorous .
' Hip hop settings '
Nominally , the job of bringing together the various distinct entities and factions that go to make up the Republican Party belongs to Michael Steele , chairman of the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) .
Mr Steele is responsible for overseeing the party 's campaigning and fundraising operations ; so while Senators and Governors speak for their states , and congressmen speak for their districts , Mr Steele is - by virtue of his position - one of the few party officials with a national perspective .
He won election to his position in January , and during the campaign he was characterised as a moderate .
In his acceptance speech , he struck a note of inclusiveness : " We 're going to say to friend and foe alike :
We want you to be a part of us , we want you to with be with us . "
It 's not our job to be the opposition party .
It 's our job to be the ' better solutions party '
Newt Gingrich
Former Republican House Speaker
Since taking up his post , he has raised eyebrows with his attempts to use slang in order to - in his words - " apply [ conservative principles ] to urban - suburban hip - hop settings . "
To that end , in an interview with the Washington Times , he promised that his public relations efforts would be " off the hook " , and in a radio interview he dismissed elements of President Obama 's stimulus package as " bling bling " .
Mr Steele believes that in order to regain the electoral initiative , the party needs to reach out to new voters .
Another prominent Republican - former House speaker Newt Gingrich - thinks the party needs new ideas and fresh policies .
" It 's not our job to be the opposition party .
It 's our job to be the ' better solutions party , ' " he told the Conservative Political Action Committee ( CPAC ) 's annual conference , an important gathering for the right - wing of the party .
His policy centre , American Solutions , regularly publishes position papers and pamphlets , and fellow Republicans are increasingly turning to the man who in 1994 led them out of the wilderness to victory in that year 's congressional elections .
Not complicated So , Mr Steele wants to reach out to new voters , Mr Gingrich wants to come up with new ideas .
Enter Rush Limbaugh .
Speaking to the CPAC conference , Mr Limbaugh , the most popular right - wing radio host in the country , said the party needed strong leadership , not modified policies .
" The American people may not all vote the way we wish them to , but more Americans than you know live their lives as conservatives in one degree or another , " he said .
" And they are waiting for leadership .
We need conservative leadership .
We can take this country back .
All we need is to nominate the right candidate .
It 's no more complicated than that . "
Mr Jindal 's response to the president 's speech was poorly received
And in what was perceived as a dig at Mr Gingrich , Mr Limbaugh insisted " one thing that we can all do is stop assuming that the way to beat them is with better policy ideas right now . "
His speech was received rapturously by the CPAC audience , not least for his unabashed declaration that he wanted President Obama to " fail " .
This assertion , which he had previously made on air , has been greeted with criticism in some Republican circles .
South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford noted that " anybody who wants [ Mr Obama ] to fail is an idiot , because it means we 're all in trouble " .
And Michael Steele , speaking on CNN , dismissed Mr Limbaugh as " an entertainer " , with an " incendiary " and " ugly " style .
Mr Steele 's remarks provoked a trenchant reaction from the radio host , who suggested Mr Steele was " off to a shaky start " at the RNC .
" I hope the RNC chairman will realise he's not a talking head pundit , that he is supposed to be working on the grassroots and rebuilding it , " Mr Limbaugh continued .
" It 's time , Mr Steele , for you to go behind the scenes and start doing the work that you were elected to do instead of trying to be some talking head media star , which you 're having a tough time pulling off .
' Personal bulk '
It was Mr Steele 's reaction to the outburst , however , that gave a hint as to the real locus of power in the Republican Party .
Shortly after Mr Limbaugh had spoken , Mr Steele told Politico.com : " My intent was not to go after Rush - I have enormous respect for Rush Limbaugh . "
" I was maybe a little bit inarticulate , " he added .
" There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership . "
Mr Steele 's handling of the row has been criticised by some in the party .
" [ Michael Steele 's ] exchange with Rush Limbaugh ... was very clumsy , " says Peter Wehner , a conservative writer and Senior Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center .
" The jury is still out [ on his performance as RNC chair ] , " he adds .
But Mr Limbaugh 's ascendance has provoked opposition on the moderate wing of the party .
Former Bush speechwriter David Frum , writing on his website newmajority.com , bemoaned the prominence conservatives were giving to the radio host .
" With his private plane and his cigars , his history of drug dependency and his personal bulk , not to mention his tangled marital history , Rush is a walking stereotype of self - indulgence - exactly the image that Barack Obama most wants to affix to our philosophy and our party .
And we 're cooperating ! "
There 's no need to settle on a single leader now ; my view is that there should be a lot of different voices out there , making their case , trying their arguments out
Peter Wehner
Ethics and Public Policy Center Undeniably , Mr Limbaugh has - for the moment - become the uncrowned king of the conservative wing of the Republican party .
But he has no apparent desire to seek elected office ; he will never truly lead the party by becoming , for example , its presidential nominee .
Who , then , is in the running to take charge of the party in its next battle for the White House ?
Mr Wehner thinks it is too soon to tell .
" It 's much too early to ordain a single GOP leader , and some of this - and perhaps much of this - depends on unfolding events , " he tells me .
" There 's no need to settle on a single leader now ; my view is that there should be a lot of different voices out there , making their case , trying their arguments out . "
Rising stars
For the attendees at the CPAC conference , former Massachusetts governor and failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney is still the favoured standard - bearer .
For the third year running , he won the organisation 's presidential preference straw poll , this time with 20 % of the vote , to Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal 's 14 % .
Mr Jindal has in recent years been hailed as a rising star of the party , and - his recent , poorly received response to President Obama 's keynote speech to a joint session of Congress notwithstanding - he will likely be in the running for the party 's nomination .
But CPAC do not have a track record of picking winners , as their consistent preference for Mr Romney indicates .
A recent CNN / ORC poll of Republicans nationwide indicates that a different candidate may emerge to rise to the top of the party .
CNN found that 29 % of Republicans wanted Alaska governor Sarah Palin to be their party 's candidate in 2012 , with former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee coming in second with 26 % .
Ms Palin - who rose to prominence last year as John McCain 's running - mate - has been quiet while the furore over Rush Limbaugh 's remarks has raged .
But if the polls are to be believed , then Republican voters may well be keen to find out where she stands on the future direction of the party .
And we could be hearing a lot more from her over the next few years .

Grayson said ...
I got mine on Saturday , though I guess living only a few hours from Lulu's HQ sped up the shipping a bit !
Anyhow , I 'm going to get windy here , so here 's the condensed version :
New prepper or seasoned , or in - between , you WILL find something informative , or at the very least thought provoking .
Heck , there 's even a part on how to make your kid eat his dinner ...!
I 'm not a newbie to prepping ... but , financial limitations aside , I guess I really could be trying harder .
The book really opened my eyes to some flaws , or just things I could be doing better .
Like , I wear shades almost all the time .
Proper shatter - resistant shooting glasses do n't cost much more than the cheap sunglasses I favor ( LESS than them in some cases ) ... so why NOT have a little extra eye protection ?
Body armor is something I overlook too , to my detriment given the increasingly - dangerous job of working in a pharmacy .
Even if I COULD carry a gun with their blessing , it 's very hard to stay in ' condition yellow ' in an insanely busy pharmacy .
Also , some GREAT tips on Precious Metals for guy like me that 's " late to the party " in that department .
Hmm , I do have a question regarding that though ... what if you really suck as an actor , like I do ?
Do you really get that much of a better deal if they think you 're selling YOUR wedding ring or your " Grandma 's " bracelet , as opposed to just one you had on hand from a pawn shop ?
It ’s important to learning how to control the image you project .
For haggling certainly , it will help .
A thief selling a snatched chain gets paid only 10 pesos , for example .
That ’s all he needs for a “ paco ” ( drug ) fix and that ’s all he ’ll get .
If I go with the same piece of jewelry I know I ’ll get a better price , simply because I ’m not some desperate junky .
In general , if you pretend to have a bit of an internal struggle because of sentimental value for example , you ’ll get a few more extra bucks if the person is interested .
Not only that , but it ends up looking as if you do n’t have a drawer full of stuff , and therefore you do n’t attract attention to people that may have robbery in mind .
Look desperate ( even if you really are desperate ) and you ’ll sure get a worse price .
It ’s not that different from real estate business .
The guy with the rope around the neck will be offered less money , and he ’ll usually accept .
In general terms , it ’s good to be able to somewhat control the image you project .
Dealing with people in my neighborhood , I simply do n’t care to look particularly wealthy or sophisticated .
In my book , the poorer I sound the better , so talking like the poor locals helps .
Skipping a final “ s ” when talking is typical of the local lower class , so I can slip some of it in a conversation .
Remis and taxi drivers will usually ask personal stuff here , like where are you going and what do you do for a living , and its not wise to sound as if you are doing better than the general average .
“ I ’ve been out of work for the last couple of months ” is a good reply here , or at least complaining about hardly being able to pay the bills .
You ’d be amazed by the amount of robberies and kidnaps caused by loose lips .
People that ca n’t help themselves and start bragging or showing off .
Then again , when I ’m doing business with other kind of people and want to project a better cultural level , I can do that as well , even drop a bit of snob in there if I think the person will relate better to that .
When there ’s lots of poverty and you live dealing with these two different worlds you want to be able to speak in both “ languages ” .
When you visit markets and fairs like “ La Salada ” where you usually haggle for a better price , again , you do n’t want to look or “ sound ” wealthy .
These street merchants are n’t stupid , you have to dress accordingly and talk like someone that is rather poor , even if you had a good education .
Vid Conversion kits have been developed which can upgrade any normal car for autonomous driverless operation .
Video is now available from such a car , driving without human input in the Nevada desert , showing fruitless attempts by US navy bombers to destroy the self - directed machine .
The vid comes courtesy of Kairos Autonomi , the Utah company which makes the " Pronto4 " robo - car conversion kit .
Rather than one of their automated drivers snapping the shackles of human control and having to be destroyed by the military , however , the bombing was actually a training exercise for US Navy jet pilots .
It took place at the end of January at Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada , and was announced by Kairos last week .
The bombs being dropped around the speeding car are inert training rounds rather than live 500 or thousand - pounders .
But they are smart laser - guided ones , showing the difficulty that normal smartbombs have scoring direct hits on moving targets .
The car was stopped on the eighth try , the nearby impact of the inert bomb stalling the engine .
According to Kairos , the car is a Nissan Altima and converting it to unmanned driverless operation took less than four hours using the Pronto4 kit , which the firm refers to as a " strap - on autonomy system " .
The company says that any vehicle you like can be fitted out with a strap - on robo driver and then perform such tasks as " perimeter patrol " , convoy leading / following " or even " covert operations " .
The car , van , lorry or whatever is then " optionally manned " .
Driver strictly optional .
Kairos believe that the robo strap - on gear would be ideal for driving unmanned supply trucks through the minefields and roadside bombs of Iraq or Afghanistan , or other dangerous military applications .
They say it can be remotely " tele - operated " using a video feed , or follow a pre-generated course on its own .
Pronto4 - pimped cars competed in the last DARPA robocar event , apparently .
The machine can cope with " city , highway and off - road " according to the product sheet ( pdf ) , acting as an autopilot for a human driver if required : you just tap the brake to take manual control .
Kairos , like many others , are literally having no truck with Vista - the controlling computer is a Core 2 Duo , 1 gig RAM Windows XP box .
The only thing the Pronto4 does n't seem able to do is cope with traffic .
Once it can do that , it would seem that the long - anticipated day when we can simply set our cars to take us wherever we want and then sit back for a snooze , a beer or a bit of TV is finally at hand . ®
Both in the capitalist and in the socialist world , tractors have been seen as machines of freedom , symbols of progress and modernization .
Indeed , mechanized agriculture has been a worldwide revolution that has freed a large part of humankind from the Biblical curse of hard work .
However , with the reserves of fossil fuels being slowly depleted , can we keep tractors running ?
The RAMSES project proposes an answer : a new model of agricultural mechanization based on battery powered vehicles and renewable energy sources .
Today , agriculture in the industrialized world is a task for a minuscule fraction of the workforce ; people whose job is to operate heavy machinery powered by fossil fuels .
But , with peak oil arriving , or perhaps already arrived , we are going to see big changes .
In itself , mechanization does not affect agricultural yields , but higher costs of fossil fuels are already affecting food prices .
And , without power from mechanical engines , farming would have to go back to the old ways ; relying again on human and animal muscles .
Richard Heinberg has spoken of the need of " 50 million farmers " for agriculture in the USA .
But that would imply transforming overweight and under - excercised office workers into the kind of lean and fit peasants who are the typical workforce of countries where the industrial revolution has not arrived yet .
It wo n't be easy , especially if we were forced to do it in a short time .
When the issue of powering agricultural machines is raised , the usual answer is in terms of biofuels .
But that is not a very good idea unless we can develop some new and much more efficient way of making biofuels .
In their present form , biofuels need too much land , need artificial fertilizer and , more than all , are in competition with food production .
Other , exotic forms of fuel , hydrogen for instance , are too expensive and complex for agriculture , at least for the time being .
As it is often the case , the solution of a difficult problem can be found thinking " out of the box " .
Here , we are often locked to the concept that what we need is some kind of fuel , possibly in liquid form , to operate traditional engines .
But the internal combustion engine is very inefficient ; the only reason why it has had so much success is because fossil fuels have been extremely cheap so far .
With that condition becoming rapidly obsolete , we need to move to more efficient systems .
Modern renewable technologies ( mainly photovoltaics and wind ) are much more efficient than biofuels in terms of land needed per unit energy produced .
In addition , most renewable sources produce electric power , compatible with cheap and efficient electric motors .
These advantages are offset , in part , by the need of storing electric power in heavy and expensive batteries .
Nevertheless , battery powered electric vehicles are making a comeback on roads and there exist light electric tractors available on the market .
Can we think of electric motors and vehicles taking a major role in agriculture ?
The RAMSES project
About three years ago , Ugo Bardi ( your author ) and Toufic El Asmar ( agronomist at the University of Florence , Italy ) sat together and conceived the idea of a complete , renewable energy system that would provide both electric and mechanical power for agriculture .
We gave it the name of " RAMSES " , an acronym that stands for something like " renewable multipurpose agricultural systems for farmers " .
But , actually , " Ramses " is an ancient Egyptian word that meansand that seemed to us an auspicious name for the idea ( later on , we learned of another vehicle named " Ramses " ; a modern Egyptian battle tank ) .
The idea of the RAMSES system is to couple a renewable energy source ( in this case a photovoltaic plant ) with a multipurpose , battery powered agricultural vehicle .
The system also includes a stationary battery pack for energy storage .
The energy produced can be used in the farm , stored in the vehicle 's batteries , in the stationary batteries , or sold to the grid .
The batteries of the vehicle can also be used for powering the farm if needed .
It is a complete energy system that makes the farm - potentially - independent from fossil fuels .
Once we had thought of all this , we assembled a team able to build the system and we submitted the project to the European Commission which financed it under the 6th framework program .
RAMSES is a multinational effort which includes four European countries ( Italy , Poland , Spain and UK ) and three Mediterranean ones ( Jordan , Lebanon and Morocco ) .
After almost three years of work , a complete prototype system has been assembled .
Below , you can see the RAMSES 12 kWp photovoltaic plant , based on monocrystalline silicon cells .
It has been built at the final destination where the system will be tested : the monastery of Mar Sarkis and Bakhos , in Lebanon , about 35 km from Beirut .
The plant was built by the Lebanese company ADMElectric .
Here is an image of the power storage system : a pack of lead batteries capable of storing about 2000 Ah , complete with inverters for providing standard electric power to the farm .
All the batteries for the RAMSES project were provided by Tudor ( Spain ) .
And , finally , here is the RAMSES vehicle .
It was built in Italy , by OELLE .
Here , however , you see it in the snow , in Poland .
It was moved there for adding a number of accessories ( by the Krukowiak company ) and for testing by IBMER , the institute of agricultural mechanization and electrification .
The RAMSES vehicle is a multi-purpose light truck powered by a 12 kW electric motor .
For ease of use and ruggedness , we used standard lead - gel batteries as on - board storage .
Although the vehicle does n't look like a traditional tractor , it has many of the capabilities that normally are found on tractors .
Its 4 - wheel transmission lets it run on or off - road .
It can be used for transportation with its ability of carrying about 1 ton load and a maximum speed on roads of about 45 km /h .
It is not designed for very rough terrains or for heavy agricultural work , such as plowing all day long .
But its hydraulic three points hitch permits to link it to a variety of agricultural machinery for such tasks as watering , spraying , fruit collecting , seeding and many others .
In the following figure , you can see the vehicle equipped with a 200 liters agricultural sprayer .
Assessment
A prototype is a nice toy to play with but , eventually , we need to answer a few crucial questions about the RAMSES system :
1 . Is it really environmentally friendly ?
2 . How much does it cost ?
3 Can it replace conventional systems ?
With the prototype still under test , we can't answer these questions with absolute certainty .
But we carried out simulations and we can already give some answers .
In terms of environmental impact , there is no doubt that the RAMSES system is a winner .
Our LCA calculations show that it is better than its conventional competitors on almost all pollution counts , from greenhouse gases to local pollutants .
This is not surprising , since the system relies on renewable energy and it does n't use fossil fuels except as source of energy for the manufacturing of the system itself .
It turns out that the main source of pollution of the RAMSES system are the lead batteries during the manufacturing and recycling process ; but lead release in the environment is truly minimal .
Cost is a critical question : how does it compare with conventional systems ?
If we calculate the external costs ( pollution and global warming ) the RAMSES system has a significant advantage .
However , these external costs are not paid directly by farmers and , despite the fact that the RAMSES system does not need fuel , there are monetary costs in terms of investment and in terms of the periodic replacement of batteries and other parts .
Our calculations indicate that the RAMSES system in its present configuration is slightly more expensive than a conventional , diesel powered system over a life cycle of 30 years .
In order to have the same life cycle costs for the two cases - RAMSES and conventional - diesel fuel would have to cost more than 1.5 EUR / liter .
That is higher than the present cost at the pump , even without considering subsidies given to farmers .
Nevertheless , this result is encouraging .
In the future , the cost effectiveness of the system may be improved eliminating the stationary batteries and relying only on the grid as storage , but at present this is not possible in Lebanon because of the local regulations .
The advantage of the RAMSES system , anyway , goes beyond a simple cost comparison : it lies in being independent from fossil fuels and therefore not sensible to supply interruptions and oil price spikes .
Then , there is the question whether the use of the RAMSES vehicle will be practical for agriculture .
Agricultural vehicles come in many kinds and many shapes ; some as large combine harvesters and some as small , hand operated cultivators .
The RAMSES vehicle does n't pretend to be compared to giant agricultural machines .
It has been conceived and designed to be used in a specific environment : in a farm in Lebanon where the main product is olive oil .
Here , the vehicle will be used for a variety of light agricultural tasks .
Because of the specific climatic conditions there , we assume that the vehicle will work for 2 - 4 hours in the morning , then it will be recharged over midday , when the temperature is so high that it is impossible to work in the fields .
In the afternoon , the vehicle will be used again for 2 - 4 hours and will be recharged again overnight .
In the present configuration , the vehicle is expected to be able to perform these tasks , but modifications may be needed for different conditions .
If more endurance is needed , for instance , there is space in the present prototype for adding more on - board batteries .
The final question is whether an all - electric , renewable agriculture is really possible .
Can we think of an electric combine harvester ?
Can we plow the fields with electrical tractors ?
The answer is , " yes , but ... "
In principle , it is perfectly possible to design and build heavy electric agricultural vehicles such as tractors and combines .
But , if we use lead batteries and we want the machine to keep working all the day long , we need a very large battery pack and that would be very expensive .
There are many technological possibilities to improve on lead batteries and perhaps in the future the problem of storage will be solved with new possibilities .
But , if we have to stay with current technology , we must think of battery powered mechanized agriculture as something more limited than the kind of mechanization we are used to .
It is unavoidable , anyway , that future agriculture will be something very different from what it is today .
The problem with modern agriculture is not just that of powering tractors and vehicles .
It lies with the need of artificial fertilizers and pesticides , with the erosion of the fertile soil and , not the least , with the emissions of greenhouse gases and the resulting climate change that may damage agricultural yields .
For the future , we must think of an agriculture which will not destroy the fertile soil , which will need less ( or no ) artificial fertilizers and pesticides , and which will be , in general , less polluting and more sustainable .
It will not be anymore the kind of large scale , heavily mechanized enterprise we are used to but , likely , a smaller scale operation , more based on local resources .
Maybe it will be something like the " 50 million farmers " that Heinberg has proposed .
But it may not necessarily need human beings as engines , as it was the use before the industrial revolution .
The results of the RAMSES project show that using renewable electric power is a concrete possibility to break away from the present dependency on fossil fuels in agriculture .

RAMSES does n't claim to be the first electrical vehicle in agriculture , but it is an original idea under several respects : it has been designed from scratch as an electric vehicle , not as the retrofitting of an existing vehicle .
Also , it was conceived with production in series in mind , not as destined to remain a single prototype .
Finally , it is not just an electric vehicle , but a complete energy system designed for use in a world where fossil fuels are destined to become less and less abundant .
The RAMSES vehicle uses standard components which can be serviced or replaced with a minimum effort .
It is powered by a 96 V , 12 kW dc brushed motor located in the center , in a position protected from damage .
An auxiliary , on board 12 kW motor is used for powering external agricultural equipment and the hydraulic system .
The motors are powered by 16 6V 180 Ah lead - gel batteries .
The two battery packs can be connected in series at 96 volts , for street use , or in parallel , at 48 V , for the highest torque for off road use .
This set of batteries is expected to be able to power the vehicle for a range of about 70 - 80 km on roads and for 2 - 4 h of work in the fields .
The maximum speed on roads is around 45 km /h .
The vehicle weighs 1700 kg , including the driver and has a capacity of about one ton load .
The photovoltaic plant that powers the vehicle has a maximum power of 12 kW and is based on monocrystalline , silicon panels .
The stationary energy system is based a lead - acid battery pack of total storage capacity of 2000 Ah .

A 93 - year - old Japanese man has become the first person to be certified as a survivor of both US atomic bombings at the end of the second world war , officials said today .
Tsutomu Yamaguchi had already been a certified " hibakusha , " or radiation survivor , of the 9 August 1945 atomic bombing in Nagasaki .
Now it has been confirmed that he also survived the attack on Hiroshima three days earlier .
Yamaguchi was in Hiroshima on a business trip on 6 August 1945 when a US B - 29 dropped an atomic bomb on the city .
He suffered serious burns to his upper body and spent the night in the city .
He then returned to his hometown of Nagasaki .
" As far as we know , he is the first one to be officially recognised as a survivor of atomic bombings in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki , " said Nagasaki city official Toshiro Miyamoto .
" It 's such an unfortunate case , but it is possible that there are more people like him . "
Certification qualifies survivors for government compensation including monthly allowances , free medical checkups and funeral costs .
Miyamoto said Yamaguchi's compensation would not increase .
Japan is the only country to have suffered atomic bomb attacks .
About 140,000 people were killed in Hiroshima and 70,000 in Nagasaki .
Yamaguchi is one of about 260,000 people who survived the attacks .
Bombing survivors have developed various illnesses from radiation exposure , including cancer and liver illnesses .
Details of Yamaguchi's health problems were not released .
Thousands of survivors continue to seek official recognition after the government rejected their eligibility for compensation .
Last year , it eased the requirements for being certified as a survivor , following criticism the rules were too strict and neglected many who had developed illnesses that doctors have linked to radiation .
Chris Brown Arrested For Assaulting Rihanna
, 19 year old singer and songwriter , turned himself in to police at 7:15 p.m. last night at the Wilshire division of the Los Angeles Police Department , accompanied by high profile lawyerand his investigator
The musician was charged with assaulting and making criminal threats against his girlfriend , R&B singer Rihanna , who 's given name is Robyn Fenty .
Brown was released on $ 50,000 bail .
The case will be presented to the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's office , where additional charges are possible .
TMZ is reporting that a police source likened Rihanna 's injuries to what you would expect on an MMA fighter .
The injuries are described as two huge contusions , with significant swelling and bruising , on either side of her forehead .
The singer received a bloody lip and nose as well as bit marks on her arms and fingers .
The couple had attended the Clive Davis Pre-Grammy party in Beverly Hills on Saturday evening .
According to the Los Angeles Times , the couple left the event and got into a verbal and physical altercation while Brown was driving in the Hancock Park neighborhood .
He stopped the car and Rihanna reportedly got out and called for help on her cellphone .
Rihanna 's 911 call brought law enforcement officers to the scene , where they aided the 20 year old singer and discovered that Brown had fled .
According to the NY Daily News , Rihanna was treated at Cedar - Sinai Medical Center for her injuries .
Both singers canceled two hours before their scheduled performances at the Grammys .
Rihanna had planned to sing Disturbia and Brown was slated to sing Forever .
Show producers scrambled for additional performers , securing Justin Timberlake as a last minute replacement .
Check out winners and red carpet photos here .
The top photos were taken earlier on Saturday evening at the Clive Davis bash .
Check out another photo of the couple below .

PHILADELPHIA – Three - day - old broccoli sprouts , a widely available human food , suppressed Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) infections , according to a report in Cancer Prevention Research , a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research .
H. pylori infections are one of the most common bacterial infections worldwide and are a major cause of stomach cancer .
The cancer protective effects of sulforaphane , a phytochemical from broccoli , have been known for almost two decades , but this is the first study to show an effect of broccoli in humans on the bacterial infection that leads to stomach cancer .
In this study , researchers enrolled 48 Helicobacter - infected Japanese men and women and randomly assigned them to eat 70 grams of fresh broccoli sprouts daily for eight weeks or an equivalent amount of alfalfa sprouts .
" Broccoli has recently entered the public awareness as a preventive dietary agent .
This study supports the emerging evidence that broccoli sprouts may be able to prevent cancer in humans , not just in lab animals , " said Jed Fahey , Sc.D. , a faculty research associate in the Department of Pharmacology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine .
Researchers assessed the severity of H. pylori infection at enrollment , and again at four and eight weeks using standard breath , serum and stool tests .
H. pylori levels were significantly lower at eight weeks on all three measures among those patients who had eaten broccoli sprouts , while they remained the same for patients who had eaten alfalfa sprouts .
A reduction in H. pylori is expected to lead to a reduction in stomach cancer due to their well - established cause - and - effect link .
Stomach cancer has a grim prognosis and is the second most common and the second deadliest cancer worldwide .

Pakistan declared that it was in a " state of war " after masked gunmen ambushed the Sri Lankan cricket team as they were on their way to play a Test match , injuring six players and their English assistant coach as well as killing seven Pakistanis .
The spectacular military - style raid in Lahore bore marked similarities to the assault in Mumbai last year , which left 172 people dead .
Pakistani officials suggested the Islamist group , Lashkar - e - Taiba , responsible for the carnage in the Indian city , also carried out the attack in Lahore .
What happened yesterday is certain to stop sports teams from abroad visiting Pakistan for the foreseeable future and deals a grave blow to the country 's plans to host the World Cup in 2011 .
It also highlights how security is disintegrating , with the civilian government seemingly unable to cope with the tide of violence unleashed by militants .

About a dozen armed men mounted the attack as the Sri Lankan team was being driven in a convoy to the Gaddafi Stadium , shooting out the tyres of buses before opening fire with assault rifles and rocket - propelled grenades .
Six policemen and the driver of a bus carrying the match umpires were killed during a firefight lasting more than 15 minutes .
Players and match officials , some of them bleeding from bullet and shrapnel wounds , huddled on the floor of their vehicles .
The Sri Lankan all - rounder Thilan Samaraweera suffered the worst injury after being hit on the thigh with grenade fragments .
Among the others injured was Paul Farbrace , a former Kent cricketer who was assistant coach to the Test team .
He said : " There was a lot of shouting and people hitting the floor and when I got to the floor I realised that the blood I could see was coming from me . "
A former England player acting as an official , Chris Broad , helped protect an injured umpire , Ahsan Raza .
Pakistan 's President , Asif Ali Zardari , said he " strongly condemned " the attack and pledged that those responsible would be caught .
Rehman Malik , the Interior Minister , said the country was in a " state of war ...
Be patient , we will flush all these terrorists out of the country " .
Salmaan Taseer , the Punjab province 's Governor , said : " It was the same terrorists who attacked Mumbai .
It was the same pattern , the kind of weaponry they had , the way they attacked , they were obviously trained . "
He added that the gunmen had been chased into a nearby shopping area after the attack where police had lost track of them .
The province 's police chief , Khawaja Farooq , said " some " arrests had been made but refused to say whether they included any of those who had taken part in the attack .
The police displayed 10 AK - 47 rifles , two grenade launchers , 32 hand grenades and plastic explosives .
Imran Khan , the Pakistani politician and former captain of the country 's cricket team , said the Sri Lankan team had been given inadequate protection .
" This was one of the worst security failures in Pakistan , " he said .
The International Cricket Council cast doubts over Pakistan 's ability to continue to host high - level games .
" It 's difficult to see international cricket being played in Pakistan for the foreseeable future , " said its chief executive , Haroon Lorgat .
BusinessWeek 's Steve Hamm declares the death of Silicon Valley , which he says has become a land of get - rich - quick dreamers with the attention span of gnats .
One of Steve 's first stops : A member of a dying breed known as Andy Grove .
Dressed in a gray sweater with a BlackBerry ( RIMM ) clipped to his belt , Grove greets me at the door of his small office above a travel agency in Los Altos .
He launches directly into a diatribe against what he sees as the shortsightedness and shortage of ambition on the part of today 's Valley - ites .
He regrets that the U.S. ceded the market for computer batteries to Japan in the 1970s .
Now it 's way behind in the race to invent improved batteries for electric vehicles — something he thinks Silicon Valley companies should be working harder on .
What really infuriates him is the concept of the " exit strategy . "
That 's when leaders of startup companies make plans to sell out to the highest bidder rather than trying to build important companies over a long period .
" Intel never had an exit strategy , " he tells me .
" These days , people cobble something together .
No capital .
No technology .
They measure eyeballs and sell advertising .
Then they get rid of it .
You can't build an empire out of this kind of concoction .
You do n't even try . "
Grove does n't name names .
But his criticisms raise the question : Can any of today 's startups measure up to the giants of the Valley ?
Can any become the next Intel , Cisco , Hewlett - Packard , Oracle ( ORCL ) , Apple , or Google ?
It 's hard for some to imagine .
" These Web 2.0 companies are surfing on the old wave .
They 're not creating the next one , " says analyst Navi Radjou of Forrester Research ( FORR ) , which studies the tech market .
A full set of components with electronic gears will cost about $ 1,250 more than the newest mechanical version , which sells for about $ 2,750 .
Upgrading an existing Shimano system is expected to cost about $ 2,200 .
The system will fit onto nearly all racing bicycles .
Later this year , Giant , the largest bicycle manufacturer in the world , will offer a bike designed to use only electronic parts for about $ 14,000 , which includes the cost of Di2 .
If consumers fancy the device , it will likely follow the pattern of other new electronics and drop significantly in price over time .
Electronic gear - shifting technology has spent a long time in development .
Prototypes of Mavic ’s first system , the Zap , made a cameo appearance at the 1992 Tour de France and the company introduced its second attempt , the Mektronic , in 1999 .
For much of this decade , both Shimano , which dominates bicycle parts the way Microsoft dominates computer software , and its venerable Italian competitor Campagnolo occasionally tested prototype systems on the bikes of pro riders .
More often than not , the prototypes were devoid of trademarks , presumably to limit embarrassment if results proved as unfortunate as the Zap .
The Campagnolo and Shimano systems share the basic design of current mechanical derailleurs .
That is , a parallelogram that moves the chain back and forth and , in the rear , two spring - loaded wheels to keep the chain taut .
Two paddle - shaped electronic switches that sit behind the brake lever allow riders to shift gears .
Tapping either paddle lightly in Di2 sends an electronic signal through a wire to a small motor inside the derailleur , moving the body and thus the chain by turning a worm gear .
Even Devin Walton , a spokesman for Shimano , acknowledges that when it comes to the rear derailleur , there is little or no difference in shifting between the electronic and comparable mechanical offerings from the company .
The gains are more obvious , however , with the front derailleur , which moves the chain between the two large , toothed rings on the bicycle ’s crank .
TAIPEI — The Taiwanese company Elan Microelectronics has sued Apple , alleging infringement of two of its touch screen patents , an Elan spokesman said Wednesday .
The suit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco , Dennis Liu , an Elan spokesman , said by telephone from the headquarters of the chip design company in Hsinchu , Taiwan .
“ We could n’t find a common viewpoint with Apple , so we decided we had to take action , ” he said , adding that the companies had been in licensing talks for about two years .
Apple is based in Cupertino , California .
The lawsuit alleges that Apple products — including its MacBook computer , iPhone and iPod Touch — use technology that infringes on two of Elan ’s patents , Elan said .

I am proud to present a guest post from Julie Broad .
8 years ago , Julie and her husband set out to free themselves from their J - O - B’s .
Starting with just $ 16,000 , they bought their first investment property .
Today , they are real estate millionaires and Julie officially retired from work at age 31 .
They now own a small business around helping other people achieve their real estate investment goals .
Editor ’s Note : Julie ’s story just goes to show that there are many different ways to make money and you just have to find the way that works for you .

Martin , our money man and main investing partner , emailed us last night and said simply “ I ’ve pretty much lost it all ” .
We ’d been shopping for a commercial property to buy to diversify our investments .
Martin has partnered with us on four different residential properties , and had agreed to once again partner with us on this commercial property .
But , that was before .
It was before the markets crashed and Martin lost his six figure down payment !
Now , sitting on pennies ( o.k. , not quite , but definitely not enough to make a down payment on a million dollar industrial property ) , Martin is probably really wondering what so many other people do , “ Is real estate a much better investment than stocks ? ”
My answer is always a resounding “ It depends ” or “ Diversification is best ” … but if you change the question and ask me where my money is invested , 90 % of my money and my net worth resides in real estate ( even excluding my current home ) .
And yes , I am young – barely in my thirties if you must know !
I am also a millionaire and it ’s all thanks to real estate .
It ’s not to say that stocks wo n’t make you rich , Warren Buffet is one extreme example of the wealth that can be created through stocks , but I like real estate because :
You Can Kick It !
Real estate is tangible .
You can drive by a property and tell your friends or family that it is your property .
You can also check up on how it ’s doing .
That is not as easy if you just own shares in a company .
There ’s nothing to show your friends and family , and most company ’s wo n’t let you sit in on their meetings to see how they are doing !
Leverage :
If you have $ 16,000 to invest ( which is what I started with 7 years ago ) , you can buy $ 16,000 worth of stocks and bonds .
But , if you buy real estate , you can buy a property worth $ 160,000 ( which is exactly what I did ) .
While some stock investors are able to buy on margin ( when you only put down a portion of what the stock is worth ) , this is a sophisticated and high risk move that only experienced stock investors typically make .
If your stocks go up in value by 5 % , you ’ve made $ 800 .
But if your property goes up by 5 % you ’ve made $ 8,000 !
This is on the same $ 16,000 investment .
This does n’t even take into account the other ways you can make money from real estate …. which leads me to my third reason I love real estate .
There are three ways to make money from real estate : Appreciation , which we discussed above , rental income , and other people ’s money ( your renters ) paying the mortgage down .
Even if your property is decreasing in value , you are still getting paid rent and that rent is paying down the mortgage , and the surplus after expenses are paid is hitting your pocket !
Control :
As a shareholder of a company , you have no control over your investment .
And , you never really know what ’s happening behind closed doors .
I do n’t need to start naming the corporate disasters of the last decade like Nortel , Enron and WorldCom for you to really understand what I am saying !
But with real estate you do have control !
If electrical bills are too high you can change the light bulbs to more efficient ones , seal the windows , and take other measures to reduce the costs .
If you are losing money , you will know it very quickly !
And you will be able to take measures to improve this situation .
With shares , what can you do if your shares in Nike drop 15 % ?
You can sell more or you can buy more … that ’s it .
Creative ways to make money .
A simple stock investor has two ways to make money from stocks … appreciation in their value and dividends .
I owned stock with dividends once .
The $ 30 cheque once per year was incredibly rewarding .
Because you have control over your property , and there are three different ways to make money from the property , there are plenty of creative techniques to try to make more money from your asset .
Some people rent out the garage separate from the house .
In the right location , you could sell advertising space or just get price reductions on work done in exchange for some advertising ( ever asked a painter what kind of discount you can get on their work if you put up one of their signs on your lawn ? ? ) , you can add vending machines or laundry facilities , you can change the density of the property ( add more units … more units means more rent ) , or you can change the usage of the property to sell it to someone who can make better use of it ( if you are in a commercial area , an office developer might want to pay big bucks for a properly zoned property to develop on ) .
There are dozens of ways to turn a simple house into a money making machine with creativity .
The same ca n’t be said for stocks .
Access to the Equity without selling the asset .
In the example of the $ 16,000 I used to buy my first investment property , I was holding most of that money in mutual funds and GIC’s .
When I cashed out , I had to pay tax on the gains !
So , while I actually had just under $ 20,000 , after the government took their share , I only had $ 16,000 .
With real estate , when you need a chunk of cash , you can refinance a property or take out a secured line of credit against the equity you ’ve built up in the property .
This means that you get to continue making money from the rental income on that property AND someone else continues to pay down you mortgage AND if property values are appreciating , you will continue to have an appreciating asset AND you get the money you need – without taxes to pay too !
And speaking of taxes … real estate has a lot of tax advantages .
Taxes vary by province and state so I wo n’t get into all of the different advantages … but suffice to say that there are plenty of opportunities to write off expenses against your income , write off the interest on your mortgages , and reduce capital gains taxes .
With so many reasons to love real estate , I have n’t been able to go back to the markets .
It ’s not to say you should do that too !
It ’s a personal choice , but I know Martin , our money man , is wishing he ’d never put his money in the hands of his trusted stock broker .
Even in our absolute worst real estate investment we broke even … and in less then 2 months he lost 40 % of his money … and worse for him is he lost a significant portion of the down payment he was going to use to buy the commercial property .
Maybe some of them will come back , but he ’s afraid that a lot of his money is lost forever .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Sales at U.S. retailers unexpectedly fell 1.1 percent in March after rising for two straight months , government data showed on Tuesday , dimming hopes the 16 - month - old recession was close to hitting bottom .
A separate report showed prices received by U.S. producers fell a surprising 1.2 percent last month , underscoring the economy ’s weakness and lack of pricing power .
Despite the weak March sales data , economists said consumer spending likely rebounded in the first quarter , which could mean gross domestic product fell less steeply than the 6.3 percent annual rate recorded in the last three months of 2008 .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , meanwhile , said figures released in the last few weeks on housing and consumer spending suggest signs of improvement .
“ Recently we have seen tentative signs that the sharp decline in economic activity may be slowing .
A leveling out of economic activity is the first step toward recovery , ” Bernanke said on Tuesday .
The Commerce Department said March retail sales were weighed down by declining purchases for big - ticket items like motor vehicles and electronic goods .
It said February retail sales were revised upward to show a 0.3 percent gain , from a previously reported fall of 0.1 percent , while January ’s figures were adjusted to show a hefty 1.9 percent rise .
“ I do n’t think the recession is close to a bottom , but I do believe the rate of decline is slowing and it will slow very sharply , ” said Nigel Gault , chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington , Massachusetts .
“ Before we write off the consumer , we need to see what happens with the April numbers . ”
U.S. stocks fell on the data , with shares of department store chain Macys dropping over 7 percent .
The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 137.63 points at 7,920.18 .
U.S. government bond prices rose as investors bailed out of stocks .
NOT OUT OF THE WOODS
President Barack Obama said there were signs of recovery in the economy , but “ by no means are we out of the woods yet . ”
Economists argued that March data , which showed broad declines , had been negatively affected by Easter falling in April and did not weaken the argument consumer spending was stabilizing after huge drops in the second half of 2008 .
Weekly retail sales reports suggest consumers were shopping again in early April .
U.S. chain stores sales rose 0.8 percent last week , building on the previous period ’s 0.6 percent gain , according to the International Council of Shopping Centers .

Separately , the Johnson Redbook retail sales index climbed 0.9 percent in the first week of April after rising 0.4 percent the previous week .
“ It still represents a net positive for first - quarter GDP .
Stronger - than - expected January and February sales point to a small gain of close to 1.0 percent annually in real personal consumption expenditures for the first quarter , ” said Stuart Hoffman , chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh .
Consumer spending accounts for over two - thirds of U.S. economic activity .
The housing - led recession , characterized by steep job losses , plunging asset values and tight credit conditions , is forcing households to scale back consumption .

Excluding motor vehicles and parts , sales fell 0.9 percent in March , compared to a 1 percent gain the prior month .
The data highlighted the continuing problems in the U.S. auto industry , with vehicle and parts sales dropping 2.3 percent after a 3 percent decline in February .
Gasoline sales fell 1.6 percent in March after increasing by 3.1 percent the previous month .
Sales of electronic goods and appliances tumbled 5.9 percent , reversing a 0.7 percent gain in February , while building materials eased 0.6 percent after slipping 0.5 percent .
In another report , the Commerce Department said U.S. business inventories fell 1.3 percent in February following a decline of a similar margin the prior month .
Motor vehicle and parts inventories dropped l.3 percent in February .
“ This should begin to reduce the rate of decline in output , although no meaningful increase in output is likely until inventories are brought down significantly more , ” said Tony Crescenzi , chief bond market strategist at Miller Tabak & C0 . in New York .
Separately , the Labor Department said U.S. producer prices fell 1.2 percent in March and compared with the same period a year ago slumped 3.5 percent , the largest decline since 1950 .
Core producer prices , which exclude food and energy costs , were unchanged in March .
The core producer price index stood 3.8 percent higher from the same month last year .
“ The message from the PPI report is that the risk at the moment is still deflation , rather than inflation , ” said IHS Global Insight ’s Gault .
Dembski Weasels Out March 17 , 2009 19:30 MST
Over at uncommon descent William Dembski is musing over Richard Dawkins Weasel program .
Why you may ask ?
Way back in prehistory ( the 1980’s ) Dawkins wrote a little BASIC program ( in Apple BASIC of all things ) to demonstrate the difference between random mutation and random mutation with selection , which many people were having trouble grasping .
Now , this was n’t a simulation of natural selection , and Dawkins was very careful to point this out .
But as a demonstration of selection versus simple random mutation , with the string “ methinks it is a weasel ” being selected in a matter of minutes , when simple random mutation would take longer than the age of the Universe , it was pretty stunning .
As a result , creationists have been having conniption fits over this little program for decades .
Such is its power , the Issac Newton of Information Theory , William Dembski , spent a not inconsiderable portion of his time attacking this toy program .
In particular , he claimed that after every successful mutation , the successful mutation was locked into place , and could n’t be reversed .
But he was wrong , and it seems he just ca n’t admit it .
As you can see , by using the Courier font , one can read up from the target sequence METHINKS *IT *IS * LIKE *A*WEASEL , as it were column by column , over each letter of the target sequence .
From this it ’s clear that once the right letter in the target sequence is latched on to , it locks on and never changes .
In other words , in these examples of Dawkins ’ WEASEL program as given in his book THE BLIND WATCHMAKER , it never happens ( as far as we can tell ) that some intermediate sequences achieves the corresponding letter in the target sequence , then loses it , and in the end regains it .
However , it is very easy to understand from the description of the program in the Blind Watchmaker , that no locking is occurring .
The list Dawkins presents is not all of the strings that are generated per “ generation ” , just the “ fittest ” strings ( ie , just those closest to the target .
Showing all 6,400 strings in a paperback book is just not feasible , nor useful [ 1 ] ) .
And even then , Dawkins is only showing every 10th fittest string !
So even if the best string was backing and forthing , you are very likely to miss it ( and do n’t forget the back mutations to less fit strings will be selected against , and not show up when we are only displaying the best string ) .
It does n’t take a mathematical genius to work this out .
People have been telling Dembski this for years ( Wesley Elsberry for one , and again recently ) , but he just has n’t listened .
Now there is documentary evidence that Dembski is wrong , from a documentary on Dawkins work .
How does Dembski handle this ?
Interestingly , when Dawkins did his 1987 BBC Horizons takeoff on his book , he ran the program in front of the film camera : www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sUQIpFajsg ( go to 6:15 ) There you see that his WEASEL program does a proximity search without locking ( letters in the target sequence appear , disappear , and then reappear ) .
That leads one to wonder whether the WEASEL program , as Dawkins had programmed and described it in his book , is the same as in the BBC Horizons documentary .
Do n’t admit you were wrong , claim a different program is used ( ignoring for the fact that the weasel program in the documentary still converged on the correct solution in a matter of minutes ) .
However , it is easy to see from the video that all of the generated strings are being displayed , not just every 10th fittest as was in the book .
That ’s the difference between printed media and things like TV , you can easily show the intermediate steps without causing confusion , again , imaging if Dawkins had shown all 6,400 intermediates , that would be roughly 160 pages of gibberish [ 1 ] to demonstrate something anyone with an IQ above room temperature could figure out from themselves .
In any case , our chief programmer at the Evolutionary Informatics Lab ( www.evoinfo.org) is expanding our WEASEL WARE software to model both these possibilities .
Stay tuned .
Say what ?
How long does it take someone to write a program that basically takes a string , copies it with mutations , compares it to a target , chooses the best mutant , copies and mutates the new string , and compares again until the target is reached ?
When I first read Dawkins book I made my first weasel program in a couple of hours in GBASIC ( as did almost every geek in the Universe ) , converting it to QBASIC and using arrays and stuff took an afternoon , because I was trying to be fancy with the arrays , and adding in a lot of comments so people could follow what I had done .
So a real programmer should have been able to make a “ non-locking ” version in the time it took Dembski to write his blog post .
Heck , Dembski could have done it himself .
People have written versions of the weasel program in Matlab [ 3 ] , and Dembski is supposed to be a mathematician , why did n’t he ?
Indeed , if he were lazy he could have just looked one up on the web and checked how it was programmed .
For a time there was a cottage industry in making weasel programs , and there were lots of them .
To demonstrate , I have resurrected a program I made in QBASIC [ 4 ] .
Now , the program I ’ve written [ 4 ] is written to be as close as possible to Dawkins original as described in the book in terms of how it works ( although I ’ve added in the ability to change the string and the number of offspring ) .
All offspring strings are mutated ( one mutation per string , the mutation is a random letter placed in a random lcocation ) , and no mutation is “ locked ” into place .
Any given “ good ” mutation can potentially be mutated out again ( and is if you watch carefully ) .
If you run the program with 100 offspring ( as per Dawkins ) , unless you are preternaturally fast you wo n’t see any backing and froing .
If you run the program with 50 or 30 offspring , it is easier to see backing up [ 2 ] .
The screen shot below shows the current best string , which is worse than the previous best string ( and I had to add wait loops so it was slow enough for me to catch with PrintScreen , see also the string capture listed at [ 2 ] at the bottom of the post ) .
Even with the low offspring number the program converges on a solution ( see second screen shot ) .
This demonstrates that Dawkins program works just fine without “ locking ” .
With populations of 100 offspring , where it is hard to see back mutation , I got convergence in 65 , 36 and 100 generations in 3 separate runs .
Quite similar to the runs Dawkins reports in his book .
The question is , instead of constructing conspiracy theories about how Dawkins must have changed his program ( rather than realising the difference between showing all of a screen dump on an interactive medium like TV , and showing the most fit strings from each generation in a printed book is one of presentation , not core programming ) , why did n’t Dembski write his own program ( or get his minions to write one for him ) to check for himself before spinning wild theories ?
Oh .
I forgot .
That ’s the difference between Intelligent Design and real science ; real science actually tests hypotheses with data .
[ 1 ]
If he has 100 offspring per generation , than a run of 64 generations will generate 6,400 individual strings .
Typical books can have 40 lines to a page , hence 160 pages to show all offspring , as well as as the fittest of each generation .
[ 2 ]
Here are runs I did using my program , with the program dumping only the fittest strings to file .
Off spring size 100 , showing 10 individual generations ( convergence in 37 Generations )
Best string ; Generation
pewjhokr ju hs c wecule ; 20
pewjhokr ju hs c wecsle ; 21
pewjhokr ju hs a wecsle ; 22
petjhokr ju hs a wecsle ; 23
metjhokr ju hs a wecsle ; 24
metjhokr ju hs a weasle ; 25
metjhokr ju is a weasle ; 26
metihokr ju is a weasle ; 27
metihoks ju is a weasle ; 28
metihmks ju is a weasle ; 29
metihmks ju is a weasle ; 30
Hmm , that looks “ locked in ” does n’t it BUUUT here ’s what happens with a population size of 50 .
Remember , nothing else has been changed about the program except the population size .
Convergence is in 187 generations , in previous runs I have had convergence in 73 , 98 and 128 runs ) .
Best string ; Generation
lethinks jt is a weasle ; 135
lethinks jt is a weaske ; 136
lethinks jt is a weaske ; 137
lethinks jt is a weatke ; 138
lethinks jt is a weatke ; 139
lethinks jt is a weatke ; 140
lethinks jt is a weatke ; 141
lethinks jt is a weatke ; 142
lethinks ju is a weatke ; 143
lethinks ju is a weatke ; 144
lethinks gu is a weatke ; 145
Note we see reversion now , despite the program being unchanged .
If we had just looked at generation 130 and 140 ( every 10th generation , as Dawkins shows in order to conserve space in his book ) we would have seen
lethinks jt is a xeasle ; 130
lethinks jt is a weatke ; 140
Which Dembski imagines is locking , but its not .
[ 3 ]
Heck , you could even do this in Microsoft Excel ( shudder )
[ 4 ]
My weasle program in QBASIC can be found here .
Here ’s the relevant section of the code
Start :
CLS
LOCATE 5 , 2 : PRINT “ Target : ” ; TAB ( 12 ) ; Target $ ; “ Diff ” ; BestDiff ; “ Generation : “ ; Gen
LOCATE 7 , 2 : PRINT “ Current Best String is “ ; Test $ ( BestFit ) ; “ with a difference of “ ; BestDiff
LOCATE 8 , 2 : PRINT “ Previous Best String was “ ; Parent$ ; “ with a difference of “ ; CurrBestDiff
Wait10
Gen = Gen + 1
‘ Find the closest ( ie fittest ) string
‘ Note , there is NO locking
CurrBestDiff = BestDiff
Parent$ = Test $ ( BestFit )
‘ Create Offspring , all offspring are mutants
‘ no site is preserved , contrary to claims by Dembski
FOR I = 1 TO OffSpring
Site = ( RND * TargLen ) + 1
IF Site > TargLen THEN Site = TargLen
Char$ = CHR $(( INT ( RND * 26 ) + 96 ) )
IF Char$ = CHR$ ( 96 ) THEN Char$ = CHR $ ( 32 )
Test $ ( I ) = Parent $
MID $ ( Test $ ( I ) , Site ) = Char$
NEXT
UPDATE : I ’ve run a freely mutating version of the weasel against a “ locking version ” , I report the results here .

The latest allegation in the Damian Green MP arrest scandal , is that , according to The Times :
From The Times
April 18 , 2009
Shami Chakrabarti was target in police search Rachel Sylvester and Alice Thomson Police who arrested the Conservative frontbencher Damian Green trawled his private e-mails looking for information on Britain 's leading civil liberties campaigner .
Officers from Scotland Yard 's antiterror squad searched the computer seized from his parliamentary office using the key words " Shami Chakrabarti " - even though the Liberty director had nothing to do with the leaking of Home Office documents that prompted the investigation .
In an interview with The Times , Mr Green warned that his arrest and the raids on his Commons office and homes smacked of a " police state " .
The Tory immigration spokesman said that Ms Chakrabarti's name had been one of the keywords used to go through e-mails and computer documents going back several years .
" This feels to me like a fishing expedition on somebody who embarrasses the government of the day , " he said .
" That 's very disturbing . " [...]
Remember how Labour party apologists claimed that it was necessary for the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command to be involved in this affair , simply because they had inherited the functions of the former Special Branch , and that they were used to dealing with complicated computer evidence etc. ?
Somehow this did not apply to the " cash / loans for Honours " scandal investigation into the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his cronies , where the investigation , included email evidence from No 10 Downing Street .
This was left to a " normal " police investigation team led by Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Yates , who by an irony of fate , has now replaced the disgraced Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick , who was in charge of the supposedly elite Counter Terrorism Command unit when these controversial arrests and searches were made .
If it had been a genuine criminal or national security investigation , then the investigators would have forensically copied disk images of the seized computers , or mobile device flash memory , and done any of their searches and analyses on the copies , not on the originals , which have been returned to the ( wrongly arrested ) suspect .
The computer forensics disk cloning software used by the Police etc. , such as enCase , also creates cryptographic checksums of each image , which can be used to detect if the computer has subsequently been tampered with or slightly modified , something which usually happens simply by switching it on again .
Any politician or journalist or blogger who has their computer equipment seized by the police during a supposed whistleblower leak investigation , should get their equipment similarly cryptographically checksummed , before switching it back on when it is ( eventually ) returned .
Their lawyers should demand and obtain the cryptographic checksums of any forensic disk images taken by the police , for comparison , to help detect tampering or possible electronic snooping software installation when the equipment was in police custody .
This routine , standard procedure for handling computer evidence preserves the chain of evidence leading up to any possible prosecutions , and does not tip off the potential criminals about what the investigators do , or do not know about any accomplices or co-conspirators , who may not be aware that they are under suspicion .
Such " tipping off " offences can carry a criminal penalty of up to 5 years in prison .
Doing anything else with the original computer or mobile phone etc. amounts to tampering with the evidence , which will make it useless in Court , and requires disciplinary action or criminal prosecution of the police or others who were involved .
A " search " for " Shami " on the original computer , could just as easily have been an attempt to plant forged incriminating evidence or to destroy or tamper with something that might establish the alibi of the accused .
If that is the way that the computer evidence in terrorist cases is handled by the supposedly elite Metropolitan Police Counter - Terrorism Command , then they are likely to allow real terrorists to go scot free in court , if they ever catch any of them .
This sort of computer forensics incompetence or politically inspired malice , might not be a surprise in a very small Police force like the Jersey Police , ( see The arrest of opposition Senator Stuart Syvret in Jersey - another Damian Green MP style scandal ? ) , but it is utterly inexcusable in the elite Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command .
Which other prominent political opponents or critics of this creepy Labour government like Shami Chakrabarti CBE , are being snooped on by the political police or other appartachiki , under the false excuse of " national security " investigations ?
Will there actually be any worthwhile independent investigation into Damian Green 's claims about this targeting of Shami Chakrabarti ?
For April Fool 's
Day this year , ImprovEverywhere pretended they 'd done a flashmob at a funeral , posting a staged video of the prank to YouTube .
The Tribune 's CW11 news - team presented the prank as fact that night on their evening newscast , so ImprovEverywhere put a little clip on YouTube of the CW11 broadcast of their gag — CW11 simply aired their own video with the words " You Tube " superimposed on it .
So , naturally , CW11 sent a copyright notice to YouTube saying that the video infringed their copyright .
I was having brunch with my good friend Michael Vlahos ( who , by the way , has a new book , Fighting Identity : Sacred War and World Change , that I recommend reading ) , and , inevitably , the conversation touched on movies .
He and I both share a love of movies and feel that movies are more than just escapism and entertainment  they can also tell us a lot about ourselves and our times .
( I share a similar love of movies with Bill Esposito , former deputy director of the FBI in the Clinton administration , who teaches a terrorism class at Wilmington University in Delaware and has invited me to guest lecture on several occasions . )
So here are a few movies to watch ( in alphabetical order ) because the themes and messages help us understand the world today ( although what I take away from the movies may not necessarily be what their directors intended ) .
Blackhawk Down
Perhaps the most obvious pick and one of three movies on my list directed by Ridley Scott ( who also directed two other favorite movies , Alien and Blade Runner ) .
In many ways , Blackhawk Down captures the essence of what it means to be a soldier  epitomized by the special forces operator Hoot ( Eric Bana ) :
" When I go home people ’ll ask me , ‘ Hey Hoot , why do you do it man ?
What , you some kinda war junkie ? ’
You know what I ’ll say ?
I wo n’t say a goddamn word .
Why ?
They wo n’t understand .
They wo n’t understand why we do it .
They wo n’t understand that it ’s about the men next to you , and that ’s it .
That ’s all it is . ”
The closing scene invokes the soldier ’s credo about never leaving a fallen comrade behind on the battlefield .
But that credo is valued for its own sake , not because the particular mission represented sound U.S. policy , so more than any other movie Blackhawk Down captures the failure of humanitarian intervention unrelated to national security .
Gladiator
Another Ridley Scott film and winner of five Academy Awards , including Best Picture and Best Actor ( Russell Crowe as Roman general turned gladiator Maximus ) .
Rome is a metaphor for America .
The misrule of Emperor Commodus ( Joaquin Phoenix ) is a warning against placing too much power and faith in the presidency as the center of our government .
Clearly a timely message during the Bush administration in the wake of 9/11 ( Gladiator was released before the November 2000 election ) , but still important as Barrack Obama assumes the mantle of 44th president of the United States .
Not that we need a Maximus ; rather , we need to remember what it means to be citizens of a republic lest we lose our republic .
The Kingdom
Kind of like Jack Bauer and 24 on steroids on the big screen , or High Noon in Saudi Arabia .
Captures the " good vs. evil " mentality of the Bush administration ( and that because we are good everything we do in the name of good must also be good )  even when it ’s a Saudi ( Col. Faris al - Ghazi , portrayed by Ashraf Barhom ) speaking :
" I ’m 42 years old .
I have two daughters and a son .
Beautiful son .
And I find myself in a place where I no longer care about why we are attacked .
I only care that one hundred people woke up a few mornings ago , and had no idea it was their last .
When we catch the man who murdered these people , I do n’t care to ask even one question .
I want to kill him . "
But the reason it ’s on my list is because it ’s one of the few movies that dare to speak the truth about why America has become a target for terrorism .
Ellis Leach ( Kelly AuCoin ) , assistant secretary of state , Bureau of Middle East Affairs : " I advised withholding additional U.S. personnel , because a large part of the religious justification for these bombs is the presence of current U.S. personnel .
More boots on Saudi soil is only gonna make an already combustible situation that much more so . "
Of course , it would n’t be much of a movie if it was about the United States staying out of Saudi Arabia .
Kingdom of Heaven
The third of three Ridley Scott movies , and probably my favorite of the bunch .
Perhaps one of the most beautiful and lush movies ever filmed ( I think it surpasses Gladiator in terms of " epic- ness " ) .
Although it takes places during the Crusades in the Middle Ages , it ’s timeless because it captures the elusive conundrum of Middle East peace .
Balian de Ibelin ’s ( Orlando Bloom ) speech to the people of Jerusalem says it all :
" It has fallen to us , to defend Jerusalem , and we have made our preparations as well as they can be made .
None of us took this city from Muslims .
No Muslim of the great army now coming against us was born when this city was lost .
We fight over an offense we did not give , against those who were not alive to be offended .
What is Jerusalem ?
Your holy places lie over the Jewish temple that the Romans pulled down .
The Muslim places of worship lie over yours .
Which is more holy ?
The wall ?
The Mosque ?
The Sepulcher ?
Who has claim ?
No one has claim .
All have claim ! "
As does Saladin ’s ( Ghassan Massoud ) response to Balian , after Jerusalem is surrendered and Balian has negotiated terms for safe passage for all its inhabitants , when asked , " What is Jerusalem worth ? " : " Nothing .
Everything ! "
Lord of War
A movie about a serious subject that still manages to interject some levity .
Some of the wit and wisdom of Yuri Orlov ( Nicholas Cage , one of my favorite actors ) :
" The first and most important rule of gun-running is : Never get shot with your own merchandise . "
" I sell to leftists and rightists .
I sell to pacifists , but they ’re not the most regular customers . "
" Selling a gun for the first time is a lot like having sex for the first time .
You ’re excited , but you do n’t really know what the hell you ’re doing .
And one way or another , it ’s over too fast . "
" I sell guns to every army but the Salvation Army . "
" Back then , I did n’t sell to Osama bin Laden .
Not because of moral reasons , but because he was always bouncing checks . "
But it ’s Yuri ’s parting shot to his archnemesis , Interpol agent Jack Valentine ( Ethan Hawke ) , that sums up how Lord of War helps us understand the perils of an interventionist U.S. foreign policy :
" The reason I ’ll be released is the same reason you think I ’ll be convicted .
I do rub shoulders with some of the most vile , sadistic men calling themselves leaders today .
But some of these men are the enemies of your enemies .
And while the biggest arms dealer in the world is your boss  the president of the United States , who ships more merchandise in a day than I do in a year  sometimes it ’s embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns .
Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me to supply forces he ca n’t be seen supplying .
So you call me evil , but unfortunately for you , I ’m a necessary evil . "
Rendition
Probably the most " Hollywood lefty " movie on my list and , as the title implies , a criticism of the Bush administration ’s extraordinary - rendition program .
But that ’s probably what ’s least important about Rendition .
The better plotline is about interrogator Abasi Fawal ( Yigal Naor ) , who uses torture in his prison on Egyptian - born Anwar El - Ibrahimi ( Omar Metwally ) , an American citizen detained and rendered on suspicion of terrorism .
CIA analyst Douglas Freeman ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) quotes Shakespeare questioning the value of intelligence gathered by torture : " I fear you speak upon the rack , where men enforced do speak anything . "
Driving the point home , it turns out that the suicide attack that opens the movie ( intended to kill Fawal ) actually kills his daughter Fatima ( a fact not known to him and not revealed until the end of the movie ) , whose boyfriend ’s brother died in Fawal ’s prison .
The boyfriend , Khalid , is the trigger man for the suicide attack .
Just as he is set to carry out the attack , he is confronted by Fatima , who begs him not to do it , arguing that the target is her father .
After removing the pin on the detonator , he hesitates and is killed by snipers .
As a result , he releases the trigger of the detonator and the bomb explodes , killing Fatima .
Thus , Fawal ’s acts of torture ultimately lead to his daughter ’s death .
It ’s a powerful indictment of the claim that harsh interrogation saves lives .
Syriana
I ’ve previously written about Syriana , so I wo n’t repeat myself here .
But it ’s hard to think of another movie that better captures the complexity of the terrorist threat that afflicts us and how our own actions are intertwined with what happens to us .
300
300 is based on a graphic novel , i.e. , comic book , and shot largely in green screen with everything but the actors rendered via CGI ( computer generated imagery ) .
Many will mistake 300 as a celebration of the mythic status and heroism of the 300 Spartans led by King Leonidas ( Gerard Butler ) against Xerxes ’ army at Thermopylae , which eventually led to the Greeks uniting against Xerxes and defeating him at the Battle of Plataea .
But 300 is really about the overextension of empire and the folly of trying to impose one ’s will on different cultures in faraway lands .
We might want to believe that the 300 Spartans are supposed to represent us because they are portrayed as brave and virtuous , but the truth is that we are more embodied by Xerxes and his ambitions .
And the 300 Spartans are really all those nations , peoples , and cultures who would resist us .
Ultimately , 300 is a movie about what will happen if U.S. foreign policy continues to follow the path it ’s been on since at least the end of the Cold War .
Traitor
The most recent addition to my movie list ( I watched it for the first time this past weekend , thanks to FiOS On Demand ) .
I ca n’t remember a movie that Don Cheadle has been in that I did n’t like , and Traitor is no exception .
Samir ( Cheadle ) is a devout American Muslim and former special operations explosives expert who has gone deep undercover to penetrate a terrorist organization .
A large part of the movie explores the moral dilemma of trying to infiltrate al - Qaeda and its ilk by proving that you are one of them by doing the very thing you are seeking to prevent  the killing of innocent people .
Samir is chased by FBI agent Roy Clayton ( Guy Pearce ) , and one ca n’t help but think about the similar relationship between Joseph Cotten ’s Holly Martins and Orson Welles ’ Harry Lime in The Third Man .
But Traitor is also about the underlying reason Muslims resent the West and why some are willing to become terrorists : not that the United States has n’t resolved the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , but because U.S. " crusaders " remain in Muslim countries .
The fact that U.S. actions have consequences and that all too often we are blind to those consequences ( or rationalize them on the basis that we are good and , therefore , what we do must be good ) is apparent in this scene :
Samir Horn : " Oh , I ’m a terrorist ? "
Roy Clayton : " I do n’t know , you tell me .
You ’ve been selling them explosives . "
Samir Horn : " Oh , I sell to who can afford to buy it like the U.S. government . "
Max Archer : " Only ours do n’t kill innocent people . "
Samir Horn : " Oh yeah they do , genius , the people just usually have darker skin . "
Traitor is also a double entendre .
Is Samir a traitor to the United States because he ’s gone too far and has innocent blood on his hands ?
Or is Omar a traitor to Islam for being a terrorist ?
As in The Third Man , there ’s no clear - cut yes and no , black and white , good and evil  only shades of gray .
Finally , believe it or not , Traitor was co-written by Steve Martin ( yes , that wild and crazy guy ) .
So , not surprisingly , there ’s some subtle humor in the movie .
For example , Samir tells a bin Laden wannabe , " Not only will I sell you the explosives and triggers , but I will show you how to not blow yourself up .
By mistake , that is . "
But my favorite line is this by FBI agent Clayton , who , while watching a TV news story about DHS checking the visas of all foreign students to find suspected terrorists , says , " Homeland security .
A waste of time and resources .
We ’ll never find them this way .
There are 1.2 billion Muslims in this world .
Only 20 percent of them are Arabs .
These people could look like anybody . "
As a kid I was fascinated by a comic strip about a bumbling cop , Fearless Fosdick , most famous for his habit of pursuing bad guys by “ firing a warning shot into the crowd . ”
In one series of strips , there was a sinister murder weapon that was killing people off — a sheet of paper on which was written a joke that was so funny that anyone who read it would die of uncontrollable laughter .
Thus was planted in my adolescent brain the possibility that a thought could literally kill a person .
( And of course , an undying curiosity to read that joke .
Kind of the Fosdickian equivalent of Odysseus panting to hear the song of the Sirens . )
Later I discovered that various writers of thrillers had attempted to plumb the depths of this concept .
Two of the most famous were Agatha Christie and Thomas Harris .
Harris , in The Silence of the Lambs , included an episode in which the evil psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter persuaded a man in the next cell , “ Miggs , ” to commit suicide by swallowing his own tongue .
( Lecter is generally good at mindfucking , but this is his most notable example of having a non-drugged victim literally kill himself . )
In her novel Curtain — Poirot ’s Last Case , Agatha Christie creates a villain whose skill was in getting others to kill by means of psychological manipulation .
A string of murders are all committed , seemingly by a collection of unlikely suspects ; in each case the “ killers ” had been manipulated into performing the deed by this third party , labeled “ X ” for much of the book .
Generally , “ X ” needed only a brief , seemingly casual conversation to launch the “ bolt ” through the other person ’s actions .
It ’s often pointed out that “ X ” is a kind of Iago on steroids .
This is a fascinating topic .
But a moment ’s reflection might reveal that the idea of being manipulated into doing something horrendous is not far removed from our everyday experience .
Seductions abound , whether it ’s someone using sex or wealth or “ best foot forward ” lies to get us to marry ( or at least sleep with ) them , or advertisers conning us into buying the ten dollar shampoo when it cleans no better than the cheapest brand .
Much in our lives is about being , or resisting being seduced into doing things that may be against our self - interest , whether as individuals or “ demographics ” or entire nations .
The problem , for me , was that these literary examples seemed to lack convincing detail .
For instance , what specifically could Lecter have told Miggs that would have convinced him to use such a horrific way to kill himself ?
We do n’t get the transcripts , just a news bulletin that Lecter went to work on him verbally and Miggs eventually cracked .
And how about “ X ” — what exactly happened to make his murders by proxy effective ?
Christie ’s details , those that she shares , never seemed all that compelling to me .
In fact , it ’s precisely because we all , every day , must lash ourselves to the mast as we sail past multiplicities of Sirens beaconing us to the rocks ( “ Call now !
Operators are standing by ! ” ) , that I became skeptical .
But there was one place where I knew that words can be very powerful inducers of emotional pain and turmoil , and even self - destructive behavior : the psychoanalyst ’s couch .
In theory , this is never deliberate , and all analysts are supposed to be the “ good guys . ”
( Whether you think they ’re effective , we must assume they are at least well - meaning , and deeply believe in the effectiveness of what they do . )
But … but …
I also knew something that analysts generally avoid talking , or even thinking about : a surprisingly large percentage of psychoanalytic treatments have injured people .
This has been written about in the field for decades — even Freud admitted that psychoanalysis could be harmful .
( A good source on this is a wonderful book by Theo Dorpat , called Gaslighting , the Double Whammy , Interrogation and Other Methods of Covert Control in Psychotherapy and Analysis . )
And I knew first hand that not only was my own “ training analysis ” often pretty painful , but that many colleagues had gone through the same ordeals .
Friends talked about spending literally years struggling with and even hating their analysts , and one prominent analyst at a major institute told me that she estimated “ about half ” of her analytic colleagues had been traumatized by their analyses .
( Some research has confirmed this , such as a study done by my colleague Sue Nathanson Elkind .
Elkind surveyed therapists who had been patients themselves and found that many had been injured , and that that a sizeable percentage said that they would never go into therapy again because of the pain or frustration or injuries they had experienced there . )
Thus was born my plan : to write a novel in which psychoanalysis was the murder weapon .
And not in some vague way , like just asserting it happened — I wanted to see if I could convincingly demonstrate the process .
My goal is to show how we can be injured , or even destroyed by the definitions other people might impose on us .
A therapist , teacher , parent , or classmate calling you “ eccentric , ” might be more harmful than for them to tell you , based on the same evidence , that you are “ creative . ”
Especially if their real agenda is to get you to swallow your own tongue .
So the book , guided by my great agent , went out to editors this week .
Fingers are crossed .
But I ’ll talk more about the concept of psychoanalytic murder , and how one might weave important and ( hopefully ) constructive concepts into fiction , in future posts .

Google CEO Eric
Schmidt has hinted that his company - or at least its partners - will one day subsidize the purchase of extra-low - cost Linux netbooks in an effort to promote the use of its myriad cloud online services .
" What 's particularly interesting about netbooks is the price point , " Google 's Willy Wonka told a room full of financial types this afternoon at the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference in downtown San Francisco .
" Eventually , it will make sense for operators and so forth to subsidize the use of netbooks so they can make services revenue and advertising revenue on the consumption .
That 's another new model that 's coming . "
Schmidt called netbooks the " next generation " of the low - cost machines produced by Nicholas Negroponte 's One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) initiative .
" Products today are not completely done .
Things are missing .
It 's perfectly possible that operating systems that are Linux - based will become a significant player in that space , whereas they have historically not been a significant player in the PC space . "
In other words , Schmidt believes the US is going back to the future .
The subsidized - PC model famously failed in the late 90s and early aughts , with outfits like PeoplePC and emachines .
In the UK , mobile operators are already offering free laptops with wireless contracts .
If Google taps into this plan , you 'd have to assume that Googlicious netbooks will be sold by someone other than Google .
As the company has shown with its open - source Android mobile stack , Google prefers to keep the direct - sales biz at arm 's length .
Developers have often said that Android is already well - suited to netbooks as well as mobile handheld devices .
And rumor has it that motherboard - maker ASUS is already hard at work on an Android - based netbook , set for release at the end of this year or early 2010 .
Such devices could rule the world , Schmidt said , because cloud online apps are the future .
" Cloud computing is one of those changes that are going to happen - regardless of whether or not companies in the ecosystem want it to , " he said .
" IT systems today are so slow in the way that they evolve ... We now have an opportunity to build a whole new generation of applications that cycle much faster . "
Just as predictably , Schmidt began his Morgan Stanley Q&A by insisting that Google 's search monopoly could vanish at any moment .
He pointed to a recent snafu where Google 's search engine blocked access to the entire internet .
" We had a bug recently where we put a malware statement out for users , and in that time , Yahoo !
searches gained very , very quickly , " he said .
" It looks like people will move very quickly from one search engine to another , for any number of reasons .
We 've looked at this very carefully . "
But even a cursory examination would show that Google 's February snafu knocked out its search engine for less an hour - and that it promptly reclaimed over 60 per cent of the market .
In Google 's mind , Google is not a monopoly - but Microsoft certainly is .
When asked whether he was at all concerned about a possible search tie - up between Yahoo ! and Microsoft , Schmidt said " The problem has to do with Microsoft 's ability to use its Windows monopoly to restrict a user 's fair choice ... Anything that Microsoft would do that would eliminate user choice with respect to the way search engines and internet browsers are distributed - for which it was previously found guilty - would be of concern . "
But at one point during his chat - which was broadcast live over the net , but was not open to reporters - Schmidt 's typically extreme Google arrogance subsided .
At least a tad .
In recent months , Google has all but called itself Meltdown - proof .
But today he hedged those claims .
" I do n't need to talk to this audience about the state of the global economy .
The situation is pretty dire , " he said .
" During this time , what 's happening is that people are using the internet more .
But it obviously will affect the online advertising markets as well - simply because our systems are so tightly tuned that if customers are buying less it will eventually be reflected in [ cost per advertising click ] ...
" We are not immune - ' we ' Google and ' we ' the online - advertising industry .
But we may be better positioned than other advertisers . "
Google 's ad system is n't as " tightly tuned " as Schmidt would indicate .
And in the fourth quarter , the company pumped its revenues a cool 18 per cent .
But perhaps he 's hinting that Q1 is n't going quite as well as the company might like .
After conversations with countless " CEOs and customers , " Schmidt predicts that the global recession wo n't subside until 2010 .
But when it does , he says , Americans will still be Americans .
" What we have to do in our country in solve the credit problem .
We have to get the job situation at least stable .
And we have to do something about the housing crisis , " he said .
" All of those things are being worked on now .
When those things are done , it 's a reasonable bet that Americans will go back to what they do best , which is spend money . " ®

Times were so tough for window repairman Timothy Carl Klenke , police say , that he decided to take proactive measures :
He armed himself with a slingshot and began cruising around the city , shattering at least five windows and car windshields as he went .
“ The statements he gave to officers led them to believe he was out to drum up business and was prepared to go out and do some more damage , ” Redlands police spokesman Carl Baker said Tuesday .
Witnesses reported seeing Klenke , 50 , driving around in his Honda in the areas where the vandalism occurred .
When police arrived at his Redlands home , they said , they found a slingshot in his car along with projectiles that matched those used to smash the windows and windshields .
Baker said Klenke , who was arrested Monday , had planned to contact the victims later and offer to repair the windows for a fee .

The remarkable thing about today 's partisan Republicans is their capacity to forget instantly and entirely anything that went on for the past eight years .
And so suddenly we are rushing toward socialism , even though by far the biggest jumps in state power and debt occurred under a president they worshiped and worked hard to re-elect .
There were no tea-parties to protest the $ 32 trillion Medicare prescription drug benefit .
There was no Randian rumbling as Bush took over local schools .
There was no defense of the Constitution as Bush and Cheney secretly suspended the fourth and first amendments .
But put a moderate Democrat in office tackling a historic collapse in demand - and spending must be frozen !
Reading the partisan right blogs , this ability to disappear the past is striking , and it helps explain base GOP loathing of Obama ( even if the base is much smaller than it was ) .
But the broader public , those with eyes and ears and functioning short - term memory , are not so cocooned .
Greg Sargent :
... the economic crisis , by prompting debate about who ’s to blame for the mess , has frustrated the GOP ’s hopes of leaving Bush behind .
The economic mess all but ensures that Bush ’s policies will continue to loom large in defining the GOP in the public mind .
The new New York Times poll [ pdf ] tells the story .
It finds that fully a third , or 33 % , of the public blames the crisis on the Bush administration far more than anyone else .
Wall Street is a distant runner - up , with 21 % .
Only two percent blame Obama .

Who 's a Terrorist ?
Probably You ; or , Do n't Profile Me , Bro !
by Dan Clore
“ We melt you with acid rain / Keep you poor for economic gain / Convince you your biggest threat / Is drugs and terrorists . ”
— Jello Biafra with NoMeansNo , “ Bruce 's Diary ”
Terrorism means the use of violence or the threat of violence against civilians ( non-combatants ) for political ends .
To identify terrorists , therefore , one would logically look for evidence that such acts have been committed and attempt to identify the perpetrators .
However , much in the same manner that law - enforcement profiles consider African Americans likely drug dealers , a new Missouri Information Analysis Center ( MIAC ) report profiles militia members as likely terrorists , and in turn gives signs to help identify militia members that include support for Ron Paul , Chuck Baldwin , Bob Barr , the Libertarian Party , the Constitution Party ( mistakenly called the Constitutional Party in the report ) , the Campaign for Liberty , opposition to the UN , IRS , CIA , FBI , etc. , and displaying symbols associated with the American Revolution such as the famous “ Do n't Tread On Me ” flag .
And this is just the tip of the iceberg .
Other MIAC reports target groups of white supremacists and black separatists , along with reports on the “ anarchist movement ” and “ anarchist tactics ” ( the latter should put an end to speculation that the center only targets rightists due to a “ liberal ” bias ) .
Meanwhile , reports produced by other “ fusion centers ” enlarge the field of likely terrorists .
A report issued by the North Central Texas Fusion System identified organizations and individuals that have supposedly turned public support toward terrorism , including CAIR ( Council on American - Islamic Relations ) , ANSWER ( Act Now to Stop War and End Racism ) , IAC ( International Action Center , headed by former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark , ) and Cynthia McKinney , former US Congressmember and Green Party candidate for president .
And then there 's the Virginia Fusion Center 's report , “ 2009 Virginia Terrorism Threat Assessment “ .
You know things are getting off to a bad start when you see the center 's symbol bearing the motto SCIENTA EST POTENTIA .
That would mean “ knowledge is power ” , if they had n't misspelled the Latin word scientia .
This report has garnered little public attention other than criticism of its characterization of colleges , including what it calls “ Historically Black Colleges ” , as important centers of ideological “ radicalization ” and thus breeding grounds for terrorists .
The Virginia report gives an area by area breakdown of terrorist / extremist ( note the shift from terrorism to simple political dissidence ) group presence and activity along with entries for various groups of likely terrorists , also noting “ intelligence gaps ” — a term very difficult to mention without adding an ironic comment .
Concerning “ Anarchist Extremists ” we learn that : “ Anarchist extremists adhere to the anti-government movement which rejects governmental rule and police authority and advocates violent means to overthrow social , political , and economic hierarchies . ” and that “ Although the anarchist threat to Virginia is assessed as low , these individuals view the government as unnecessary , which could lead to threats or attacks against government figures or establishments . ”
The report describes various anarchist groups , such as the Garbage Liberation Front , whose terrorist activities seem to bear a remarkable resemblance to dumpster diving .
Another group profiled is Anonymous , who protest against the Church of Scientology .
It also includes a motley assortment of Islamists , white supremacists , black nationalists , and many environmentalist and animal - rights groups , such as Earth First !
( with the exclamation point usually omitted ) , ELF ( Earth Liberation Front ) , ALF ( Animal Liberation Front ) , and SHAC ( Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty ) .
In the report's “ projections ” we find the following : “ Current calls for vandalism , boycotts , and other ' direct action ' by environmental extremists such as Blue Ridge Earth First [ !] against financial institutions in Virginia deemed to be supporting environmental degradation are likely to continue . ”
And so merely failing to patronize certain businesses seems to have become an act of terrorism .
Some people are easily frightened –
Update : After complaints from Paul , Barr , Baldwin , and many others , the MIAC has apologized for and retracted its report on militias .
Other mischaracterizations of peaceful political dissidents and activists will most likely require a similar public outcry before the government takes any action to atone for labeling them likely terrorists .

US carmaker Chrysler has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , and has formed an alliance with Fiat , President Obama has said .
Chapter 11 protects firms from their creditors , allowing them to rearrange their finances while still trading .
The move came after talks had broken down with Chrysler 's lenders late on Wednesday , the White House said .
Chrysler said most of its plants would be shut until the transaction was complete but staff would still be paid .
Chrysler chief executive Robert Nardelli said he would step down after the company emerges from bankruptcy .
Mr Nardelli has been in charge at Chrysler since 2007 but said he felt it would be an appropriate time to leave after bankruptcy .
New Chrysler
The filing for bankruptcy protection will lead to the forming of a new corporate entity .
Details of the new Chrysler include : Fiat 's technology will enable Chrysler to build fuel efficient cars •
Fiat will take a 20 % stake , with the possibility of it rising to 35 % if performance targets are met .
It could reach 51 % by 2016 if Chrysler 's government loans are fully repaid •
The Treasury will have an 8 % stake , a union - run trust fund VEBA will take a 55 % stake , and the governments of Canada and Ontario will gain a combined 2 % stake • Current owner Cerberus will forfeit its 80.1 % stake • Daimler will give up its remaining 19.9 % stake in Chrysler • Chrysler bondholders will receive $ 2bn ( £ 1.35 bn ) in cash in exchange for forgiving their $ 6.9 bn debt •
The new company will be run by a nine - person board , with six picked by the government and three by Fiat .
The board will pick a new chief executive .
' Surgical bankruptcy ' Some Chrysler dealerships will close over time but no jobs will be lost in the short term , President Obama said .
BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION US bankruptcy protection is called Chapter 11
It gives US businesses time to rearrange their finances while continuing to trade , protected from their creditors
History of Chrysler Can Fiat save Chrysler ?
Q&A : What next for Chrysler ?
Chrysler bankruptcy : Your views Chrysler will receive a further $ 8bn in government aid , up from the $ 6bn the Treasury had promised it if it had successfully restructured the business by midnight .
The White House described the move as a " surgical short bankruptcy " which should last between 30 and 60 days .
President Obama said the " necessary steps " had been taken to give Chrysler " a new lease on life " .
He added that he had " every hope " that Chrysler will become " stronger and more competitive " now that it had Fiat on board .
" It 's a partnership that will give Chrysler a chance not only to survive , but to thrive in a global auto industry , " he said .
' Hedge fund block '
The deal will need to be ratified by the bankruptcy court .
While Chrysler 's main banks , holding 70 % of the debt , accepted this proposal , it was rejected by hedge funds that hold a sizeable proportion of its remaining debt .
Hedge funds are private investment funds that typically attract rich private investors .
Their stance in the negotiations was criticised by President Obama .
" A group of investment firms and hedge funds decided to hold out for the prospect of an unjustified taxpayer - funded bailout , " he said .
" They were hoping that everybody else would make sacrifices and they would have to make none .
Some demanded twice the return that other lenders were getting .
I do n't stand with them . "
Chrysler is owned by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management , which bought an 80.1 % stake from Germany 's Daimler for 7.4bn euros ( $ 9.9bn ; £ 6.6 bn ) in 2007 .
Cerberus will forfeit its stake as part of the deal .
Italian partner
The partnership with Fiat will create the world 's sixth largest carmaker .
Italy 's
Fiat will not have to pay anything for its share , which will give it access to the North American marketplace .
It will also have the right to appoint three company directors .
In pictures : Chrysler 's journey
In return , Chrysler will be able to take advantage of Fiat 's expertise in making smaller , more fuel - efficient cars in its existing US factories .
No Chrysler plants in the US will close .
Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne said he would spend time meeting Chrysler employees and touring its facilities over the next few weeks .
" While our agreement must necessarily go through the US legal system for a few weeks , we will be preparing ourselves to re-emerge quickly as a reliable and competitive automaker , " he said .
The Treasury will provide Chrysler with $ 3.3 bn in working capital to support it through the Chapter 11 process .
It will also extend a $ 4.7bn loan to the new company , once it has emerged from bankruptcy , repayable over the next eight years .
Chrysler 's financial arm - that makes loans to buyers and to dealers - will be merged into GMAC Financial Services .
GMAC is the finance arm of General Motors ( GM ) but was bailed out by the government in December .
The new GMAC will get government support .
Chrysler , the smallest of the US " Big Three " carmakers after GM and Ford , secured a $ 4bn loan from the US government at the start of the year , and has since gained $ 500 m more .

Waiting for the new Amazon Kindle e-book reader is no fun .
But if you already have an Apple iPhone or a T - Mobile G1 in your pocket , more than 1.5 million books are now at your fingertips .
The Google Book Search project , ever controversial since its introduction , yesterday launched mobile editions of its entire book collection .
Google used Optical Character Recognition ( OCR ) technology to transform the scanned book pages into screen - friendly text for iPhones and G1s .
To access Google Mobile Book Search , just point your mobile phone browser to http://books.google.com/m.
Book Search for PCs displays scanned images of pages and Google openly admits the OCR technology used to make these pages small screen - friendly can have drawbacks .
" Smudges on the physical books ' pages , fancy fonts , old fonts , torn pages , etc. can all lead to errors in the extracted text , " reads the blog post announcing Mobile Book Search .
Google is constantly updating its library of public domain books , currerntly 1.5 million strong , so you should expect an ever - increasing number of books available to read both on both PCs and on your phone .
Amazon is also reportedly working on making Kindle ebooks available for a variety of mobile phones , recognizing the future of reading on small - screen devices .
Meanwhile , if mobile e-books are your thing , a few other nifty apps are available for the iPhone that do a good job -- Stanza , eReader or BookShelfLT are all free .
Boy , 12 , knocked off his bike by car is threatened with legal action ... for smashing the driver 's windscreen
Sam Scott was left covered in cuts and bruises after his cycling accident .
The 12 - year - old had ridden into the path of a car , smashing its windscreen before he was sent flying on to the kerb .
While recovering at home an official looking letter arrived in the family post , addressed to him .
It was from the car driver 's insurance company , telling him he had to pay £ 150 .
The youngster , who does not even have a bank account , was also later warned he could be taken to court if he does not send them a cheque .
Yesterday his mother Tracey said : ' I 'm really furious .
I have never heard anything like it before .
It 's terrible that people are asking children for money . '
Sam flew through the front window of an oncoming car when he rode into it 's path in North Shields , Tyneside .
Shaken and bruised , he was taken to hospital but was not seriously injured .
His bike was a write - off , however .
Sam Scott 's accident left him covered in cuts and bruises - and with a threat of court action
' He is very lucky to be alive , it was the full impact , ' Mrs Scott said .
' He actually smashed her windscreen .
' I 'm so surprised he 's not been seriously injured .
' He was badly bruised and his back is still bad . '
The letter from insurer Direct Line arrived a month after the accident and demanded a cheque to cover the cost of the driver 's insurance excess .
When his parents ignored the letter , Sam received a reminder , warning him that he would be taken to court if he did not pay up .
Mrs Scott said : ' I can't believe they would consider suing a 12 - year - old .
At the end of the day it was an accident and he is a child .
' They wrote to Sam himself , the letters were addressed to Mr S Scott not me .
I just rang them and said ; " Is this a joke ? " .
They were asking him for a cheque , but he does n't even have a cheque book . '
Mrs Scott added : ' He is just a lad and was just doing what lads do .
When I was told he had been hit by a car , it is just your worst nightmare coming true .
But you never imagine something like this will happen .
' He 's been through this accident .
At that age , that 's enough . '
A spokesman for Direct Line said the company did not realise that it was trying to communicate with a child and apologised for the error .
Direct Line 's usual practice in such cases was to write to the child 's parent or guardian , said a spokesman .
' We are more than happy to discuss a suitable resolution with Mrs Scott and we will be in touch with her directly , ' the spokesman added .
What better way to spend a Wednesday evening eh ?
Yes UK retailer Game has released lifetime sales figures of all the current consoles .
Data like this is relatively rare in the UK and makes predictably interesting reading .
No surprises on the biggest sellers then – yes Nintendo leads the way with 8.8 million DS sales .
Next up is – gasp – the Wii with 4.9 million .
Perhaps the most interesting stat is next up with the 360 and PSP neck and neck at 3.2 million sales .
Yes that 's right , the PSP has sold as many units in the UK as the 360 .
But while the 360 is inundated with new releases the PSP , er , is n't .
Surely some mistake ?
Or do PSP owners simply not buy games ?
Last up is the PS3 with 1.9 million sales .
The PS3 is doing better in mainland Europe though , with 300,000 more sales than the Xbox 360 .
Go on then .
Grab a coffee / beer / water and let us know what you think these figures tell us .
Me ?
I 'm still a little surprised at how many PSPs have been sold .
But that surge , coupled with the madrasas ’ poor record in nonreligious subjects , high dropout rates and graduation of young people with few marketable job skills , worried the government .
It responded by making primary education at public schools compulsory in 2003 , allowing exceptions like the madrasas , provided they met basic standards by 2010 .
If they fail , they will have to stop educating primary school children .
Image A kindergarten class at Al - Irsyad Satya Islamic School , in Kota Baru Parahyangan , Indonesia .
This school , which used the Singapore school as its model , opened two years ago .
Credit ... Norimitsu Onishi / The New York Times
“ That forced the madrasas to shift their curriculum away from being purely religious schools , ” said Mukhlis Abu Bakar , an expert on madrasas at the National Institute of Education , a teachers college .
Last year , the first time all six madrasas were required to sit for national exams at the primary level , two failed to meet the minimal standards , though they still had two more years to pass .
Al Irsyad , which was the first to alter its curriculum , outperformed the other madrasas .
But neither it nor the others made any of the lists of best performing schools or students compiled by the Education Ministry in Singapore .
Mr. Mukhlis , who also was a member of Al Irsyad ’s management committee in the 1990s , said the madrasas still had a long way to go to catch up with mainstream schools .
While Singapore ’s teachers are among the most highly paid civil servants , the madrasas have had trouble attracting qualified teachers because they rely only on tuition and donations to operate , he said .
“ I think Al Irsyad has not achieved a level where I would say it is a model for Islamic education , ” he said , “ but somehow the system it has in place could become one . ”
Still , it began drawing students who would not have attended a madrasa otherwise .
Noridah Mahad , 44 , said she had wanted to send her two older children to madrasas but worried about the quality of education .
With Al Irsyad ’s adoption of the national curriculum , she felt no qualms in sending her third child .
“ Here they teach many things other than Islam , ” she said .
“ So Muslim students will have two understandings : the Muslim and the outside world . ”
It was odd enough that Bush ’s Justice Department was going after Stevens , but that they ’d apparently break the rules at the same time , in order to go after a fellow Republican , begs a lot of questions .
A furious federal judge on Tuesday took the extraordinary step of ordering that the prosecutors who bungled the case of former Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska be investigated for possible criminal wrongdoing .
Judge Emmet G. Sullivan dismissed the charges against Mr. Stevens , which was expected given the way the case has disintegrated since the conviction in October .
But the judge went well beyond that step , declaring that what the prosecutors did was the worst “ mishandling or misconduct that I ’ve seen in my 25 years . ”
Judge Sullivan spoke disdainfully of the prosecutors ’ repeated assertions that any mistakes during the trial were inadvertent and made in good faith .
He said he had witnessed “ shocking and serious ” violations of the principle that prosecutors are obligated to turn over all relevant material to the defense .
LKP ends strike in Guadeloupe
Negotiations continue in other French - controlled islands
Published Mar 15 , 2009 9:26 PM
The Collective Against Exploitation ( LKP ) signed an agreement with employers on March 4 ending a 43 - day general strike in the French - controlled Caribbean island of Guadeloupe .
Class struggles continue in the nearby island of Martinique and in La Reunion , an island in the Indian Ocean .
All three islands and French Guiana are held by France as “ overseas departments . ”
Actions in these French colonial possessions since late January have highlighted the impact of the economic crisis that began in the U.S. and the Western capitalist countries .
People residing in these areas are subject to higher prices for food , rent and other services , while their salaries are far lower than what prevails in mainland France .
The need for national independence and a break with French imperialist policy underlies the struggles in the four French - run areas .
Since Jan. 20 , the LKP coalition , led by the General Union of Workers of Guadeloupe , had engaged the bosses and French colonial authorities through work stoppages and mass rallies .
LKP disseminated regular reports through a web site that supplied photographs and daily briefings on strike developments .
Referring to the Jacques Bino Accord , named after a labor unionist killed on Feb. 16 and signed by the LKP and some Guadeloupe - based bosses , union leader Rosan Mounien stated that “ From now on , things will no longer be done as before !
That ’s over !
We have come to realize that when we are together , we are stronger !
So there is only one thing to do : stay together . ” ( Links , March 8 )
The preamble to the Jacques Bino Accord indicates what the LKP perceives as the underlying reasons for the strike : “ [ T ] he present economic and social situation existing in Guadeloupe results from the perpetuation of the model of the plantation economy . ”
The Accord continues : “ This economy is based on monopoly privileges and abuses of dominant positions that generate injustices that affect the workers and the endogenous economic actors and block endogenous economic and social development . ”
Finally the Accord calls for the end to these problems “ by establishing a new economic order enhancing the status of everyone and promoting new social relationships . ”
( Journal officiel de la Republique Francaise , March 7 )
The Accord includes the following : a 200 - euro wage increase per month ; an average 6 percent reduction in the price of water ; the hiring of 22 Guadeloupean teachers on the waiting list ; measures to aid farmers and fishers , including the setting aside of 64,000 hectares ( 158,000 acres ) of farmland for future use ; lower bank service rates ; lower interest rates on loans , which are still being negotiated ; a housing rent freeze and ban on evictions ; improvements in union rights through the appointment of mediators to resolve outstanding conflicts in some major industries ; and provisions for cultural development .
In Martinique , the February 5 Strike Collective is continuing with its negotiations to end the work stoppage .
On March 6 , a convoy led by the employers sparked anger and violent outbursts from the workers and youth on the island .
Most bosses are the so - called Bekes , descendants of French slave - owners who , in conjunction with the metropolitan France - based imperialists , control the economy .
Rebellions highlight Martinique strike
Striking workers clashed with the business owners .
Then French riot police launched tear gas against the people .
Martinique workers set up roadblocks to halt a convoy of automobiles owned by the bosses , who were demanding that the French authorities end the strike and force strikers back to work .
“ The provocation of the beke employers , in wanting to come to Fort - de - France , has produced these predictable effects and that translates into the same arrogance they express in the negotiations , ” said Philippe Pierre - Charles , a member of the CMDT union that encompasses hundreds of workers .
( International Herald Tribune , March 6 )
An agreement reached earlier in the week set a 200 - euro monthly pay increase as in Guadeloupe .
Other issues involving support for farmers and increased funding for education are still outstanding .
Strike in La Reunion
In La Reunion , workers struck March 5 .
Following French police provocations , youth began pelting gendarmes with rocks and set up road blockades .
According to a March 5 French Press Agency report : “ Hooded youths set up a roadblock near Reunion ’s capital , Saint - Denis , and a separate demonstration in the city forced a supermarket to close when protesters tried to burst in . ”
Thousands of workers and students marched in Saint - Denis and the town of Saint - Pierre to express their outrage over high prices , rising unemployment and the reduction in wages .
“ Our objective has largely been fulfilled , ” said Jean - Hugues Ratenon , president of Agir Pou Nou Tout ( Act for All of Us ) , which is part of a coalition consisting of 36 groups ( COSPAR ) that are fighting for better living conditions and wages .
“ Reunion is united , unified and together . ” ( AP , March 5 )
The strikers submitted a list of 62 demands to the French colonial authorities .
The most prominent on the list was the 200 - euro monthly wage increase that was demanded in Guadeloupe and Martinique .
The French prefect of La Reunion stated during the March 5 strike that there would be a decrease in the cost of bottled gas beginning March 12 and a reduction in the price of fuels starting April 1 .
However , the workers pledged to fight on .
“ We will lean on the victory in the [ Caribbean ] to satisfy the biggest number of our grievances , ” said Ivan Hoareau , a labor union leader .
“ If we continue here , it is to help our buddies in the [ Caribbean ] . ” ( AP , March 5 )
The strike collective in La Reunion announced that if their demands were not met immediately there would be another general one - day work stoppage on March 10 .
In 1933 , in the midst of the last Great Depression , one of the first acts of incoming Democratic president Franklin Delano Roosevelt , was to set in motion the procedure to repeal the Volstead Act .
By the end of the year , Prohibition was over .
It had n't worked .
At the time of repeal , it was estimated there were 100,000 speakeasies in New York City alone .
Organized crime was flourishing .
When Prohibition was enacted in the U.S. in 1920 , the criminal gangs were then concentrating on gambling and thievery , all petty stuff .
By the time it was ended , the bigger gangs , such as Al Capone 's in Chicago , were awash in liquor money and had branched out into prostitution , protection rackets , and the bribery of police and public figures .
Al Capone , in hat , leaves a Chicago courtroom in custody of U.S. marshals after being sentenced to federal prison for violating income tax laws in October 1931 .
( Associated Press )
Gun battles between gangs and sometimes with the police broke out on the streets of many cities , the Thompson sub - machine gun as ubiquitous then as today 's barrage of semi-automatics and the inner-city drug gangs that deploy them .
At the same time , the America public had lost faith in its government , which was battling both the Depression and an unemployment rate that bordered on 25 per cent .
Roosevelt saw all this , but none of these elements on its own was the main reason for repeal .
Roosevelt knew how to beat the Depression : spend and circulate money .
He had a stimulus plan but no money .
Taxing the sale of booze was his answer .
Cash cow
Something quite similar seems to be happening in the United States today .
Look closely and you find politicians are contemplating much more seriously than you might think the notion of legalizing marijuana .
With the attraction for many being the tax monies that could be available .
Government surveys show that 100 million Americans — almost one - third of the population — have smoked marijuana or its resin , hashish .
Twenty - five million say they used the drug in the past year .
Many tax - strapped politicians today are feeling the way Roosevelt did in 1933 , that the war on drugs is no more successful than the war on alcohol .
These U.S. politicians , mind you , are not at the federal level .
When asked recently about legalizing marijuana , President Barack Obama replied , " I do n't think that 's a good strategy to grow our economy . "
But in state offices and city halls around the country , the views are quite different .
Thirteen states have already legalized medical marijuana even though the federal Narcotics
Act says marijuana has " no currently accepted medical use . "
To many , the acceptance of medical marijuana is the first step on the way to legislating pot as a substance that , like alcohol , would fall under government control and be exploited for its tax revenue .
' The usual ailments '
How important could this be ?
Betty Yee , chairman of California 's State Board of Equalization , estimated recently that a regulated marijuana trade could earn the state about $ 1.4 billion annually .
California is one of the 13 states that have approved the sale of medical marijuana .
In a recent series on this phenomenon , the Washington Post reported that there were 400 " dispensaries " that have popped up in Los Angeles alone .
According to the Post , all a customer needs is to prove he or she is 21 and a state resident , and pay a $ 150 fee in order to see a doctor who can then provide a " physician 's recommendation . "
Valid for one year , this recommendation allows the holder to buy up to eight ounces ( 227 grams ) of marijuana at a time .
The Post interviewed some of the customers at one of these dispensaries .
A patient named Joe Rizzo said he told the doctor , " I had problems with my knee . "
Gayo , a 20 - year old , recited a list of ailments he saw in a newspaper ad : " Chronic back pain and the rest , like everyone else , " he said , " Non-sleeping .
Ca n't eat very much . "
What created the gold rush of " dispensaries " was the announcement on February 26 by U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder that the feds would no longer raid such stores .
A growing acceptance
Other signs of a growing acceptance of " medical marijuana ? "
For one , all three Democratic candidates in the contest to be New York State 's next attorney general support the notion .
Also , there are bills in Massachusetts , California and in the U.S. Congress that would legalize marijuana altogether .
There are other bills that would decrease federal penalties for possession as a way of dealing with overcrowded ( and costly ) courts and prisons .
Finally , it is getting hard to pick up a newspaper here without seeing someone opine on the subject or discuss whether the current Mexican drug troubles and violence would be much reduced if marijuana became legal .
The arguments point to the fact that marijuana makes up about 80 per cent of all the drugs smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico , a trade estimated at $ 14 billion a year that goes right into the coffers of the big drug cartels .
The Obama administration is currently embarking on tougher border policy , with more money for barriers , border agents and drug enforcement officers .
But many are wondering if this is money well spent .
It 's not possible at this point to predict the future of marijuana laws in this country , but the momentum seems to be moving and rather quickly .
Just as Roosevelt reckoned in 1933 when he pushed to kill Prohibition , there is money to be made in that drug business and a savvy public administrator can put it to better use than the gang bosses .
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Roughly one in twenty 15 - year - old German males is a member of a neo - Nazi group , a higher proportion than are involved in mainstream politics , according to a study released on Tuesday .
Many politicians fear a resurgence of right - wing extremism as unemployment creeps higher in Germany , which is facing its deepest recession since World War Two .
Government figures have shown anti-Semitic crimes rose at the end of last year .
“ It is shocking that right - wing groups have more success recruiting male youths than the established political parties , ” said Christian Pfeiffer , author of the report issued by Lower Saxony ’s criminal research instute .
Pfeiffer said fewer than 2 percent of young men were active in mainstream politics , compared to the 5 percent involved in far - right groups .
The study , conducted in 2007 and 2008 , also revealed that neo Nazi-symbols -- in either rock music , stickers or special clothing -- were used by one in 10 of the youths surveyed .
The swastika and other Nazi symbols are banned in Germany .
The highest proportion of neo -Nazis was in former communist eastern Germany , where almost one in eight youths were in such groups .
More than 14 percent of those questioned were described as racist , and anti-Semitism was rife .
More than 14 percent of those asked were inclined to brush off the Holocaust as “ not awful ” while a similar number tended to believe that Jews , through their behaviour , were not entirely blameless for their persecution .
Wolfgang Schaeuble , Germany ’s interior minister , said at the presentation of the state - sponsored report he would push for the creation of more sports clubs in regions with social problems .
Late last year , a violent attack on Bavarian police chief Alois Mannichl , who had taken a stand against far - right supporters , stoked a debate over the rise of neo -Nazis .
Earlier this month , an EU agency reported that peaks in anti-Semitism in Europe tracked tensions in the Middle East .
What do you get when you mix WH Smith – the largest UK distributor of " soft " porn – and a dozen peaceful political activists putting lads ' mags into paper bags emblazoned with anti-sexist slogans ?
A grade one police alert apparently .
Luckily for us , bemused police officers ended up agreeing with our actions and rebuking the store manager for overreacting to a perfectly legal protest .
The action was part of Object 's first Feminist Friday – a new form of national grassroots activism whose aim is to see lads ' mags no longer sold as part of mainstream media but put on the top shelf and recognised as pornography .
This would be a small step towards tackling attitudes that contribute to discrimination and violence against women .
Gradual mainstreaming of the pornography industries over the past three decades has led to images originating from porn becoming part of our daily lives .
Walk into any newsagent and you will face an array of newspapers and magazines that sexualise women and girls in a way which has little equivalent for men or boys .
This is mirrored online and on our television screens .
Our culture has , in effect , become " pornified " .
The result ?
Pornified culture sends out a disturbing message that women are always sexually available .
It dehumanises women into a sum of body parts , reinforces valuing women primarily for their " sex appeal " and undermines healthy sexual relationships – as well as reducing men to macho stereotypes that many men actually reject .
It also reinforces racism by promoting exclusionary ideals that objectify women according to their ethnicity and fail to represent the diversity of women in the UK .
The End Violence Against Women campaign ( EVAW ) – the largest coalition of women 's groups in the UK – argues that it provides a conducive context for violence against women ( pdf ) .
Obviously , the media is not the sole factor in all this .
Violence against women is nothing new .
However it is clear that our pornified culture , combined with 21st century media technologies , has amplified both the prevalence and impact of sexualised imagery .
A voluntary code of regulation for the media and retailers is not enough .
Despite legislation that tackles racist materials in the press , we still have no equivalent for sexism and the media is left to regulate itself .
This is why EVAW has repeatedly called for the Department of Culture , Media and Sport to be included as a part of an integrated governmental strategy to end violence against women , so that department is obliged take this issue seriously .
The UN Committee to End All Forms of Discrimination Against Women has frequently highlighted the UK 's lack of progress in this area .
We could take a leaf out of Spain 's book .
The country has begun to integrate gender equality into media regulation by providing incentives for the media and advertising industries to tackle gender stereotyping .
It would be a start , but it 's clear that both educational and legislative action is also needed .
Until then Object will continue organising Feminist Fridays and reviving activism on this issue .
Our next action is tonight – let 's hope for no more 999 calls .

President Obama plans today to sign a national service bill named for Senator Edward M. Kennedy , White House officials said .
The bill - signing event will take place at Washington 's SEED School , a public school with students who face challenges in school and at home .
Kennedy is expected to attend , along with former president Bill Clinton .
Kennedy , a Massachusetts Democrat , and Senator Orrin Hatch , a Utah Republican , championed the bill , which would increase the ranks of AmeriCorps to 250,000 slots over eight years and create five groups to help poor people , improve education , encourage energy efficiency , increase healthcare access , and assist veterans .
When Congress approved the legislation , Obama praised Kennedy 's role , saying that " it is fitting that this legislation is named after Ted Kennedy , a person who has never stopped asking what he could do for his country . "

Obama - Chávez handshake draws more Republican fire Former House speaker Newt Gingrich and former vice president Dick Cheney yesterday joined the critics of President Obama 's supposed chumminess with Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez during the weekend at the Summit of the Americas .
Former House speaker Newt Gingrich and former vice president Dick Cheney yesterday joined the critics of President Obama 's supposed chumminess with Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez during the weekend at the Summit of the Americas .
" I think there is something fundamentally wrong with weakness in America , and then playing to placate dictators , " Gingrich said on Fox News Channel .
" This does look a lot like Jimmy Carter .
Carter tried weakness and the world got tougher and tougher because the predators , the aggressors , the anti-Americans , the dictators , when they sense weakness , they all start pushing ahead . "
Cheney , who has accused Obama of making America less safe with foreign policy reversals , said he is disturbed by how much Obama seems to be apologizing .
" The world outside there , both our friends and our foes , will be quick to take advantage of a situation if they think they 're dealing with a weak president or one who is not going to stand up and aggressively defend America 's interests , " Cheney said last night on Fox News Channel 's " Hannity " show .
" The United States provides most of the leadership in the world .
We have for a long time .
And I do n't think we 've got much to apologize for . "
Obama told reporters on Sunday that the symbolism of his handshake , followed by handclasp , with Chávez is being blown way out of proportion .
" It 's unlikely that as a consequence of me shaking hands or having a polite conversation with Mr. Chávez that we are endangering the strategic interests of the United States , " the president said .

Financial sector is high among Dodd 's donors WASHINGTON - Wealthy Wall Street executives may be outcasts to some Americans , but not to Democratic Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut .
WASHINGTON - Wealthy Wall Street executives may be outcasts to some Americans , but not to Democratic Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut .
Facing his toughest reelection fight , the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee is reaching out to the financial sector 's deep - pocketed donors .
More than $ 100,000 of the $ 1 million Dodd raised in the first three months of this year came from political action committees for the financial , insurance , and real estate industries , according to his latest fund - raising report .
Dodd also raised $ 608,995 from individuals , among them top executives from companies such as Fidelity , Citigroup , and Citizens Financial Group .
In contrast , his take from Connecticut residents was $ 4,250 , an especially anemic display of political enthusiasm for the state 's five - term senator .
He was skewered in the public furor over $ 165 million in executive bonuses for American International Group Inc. , the bailed - out insurance giant .
After first denying it , Dodd acknowledged that he agreed to a request by Treasury Department officials to dilute a bonus restriction in the economic stimulus bill .
His approval rating sank to a career - low 33 percent in a recent Quinnipiac University poll .

WASHINGTON - President Obama 's prolific fund - raising carried on through inauguration day as his inaugural committee raised at least $ 53 million from donors for his swearing - in festivities .
That 's about $ 11 million more than President George W. Bush raised for each of his two inauguration days .
Obama 's inaugural committee filed a report yesterday with the Federal Election Commission listing donors who gave $ 200 or more .
Obama had already voluntarily disclosed his biggest donors on the website of his inaugural committee , which accepted donations of up to $ 50,000 from individuals .
Those who gave at least $ 50,000 had special access to inaugural events such as candlelight dinners with Obama and his wife , Michelle , and members of Congress , and tickets to a ball , the swearing - in , and the inaugural parade .

Exciting news from the LinuxDNA project , which earlier this month successfully compiled a recent Linux kernel with the Intel C/ C++ compiler ( ICC ) .
This is not just a compile without errors , this is — for the most part — a fully bootable , compatible Linux kernel that can boot into a full Linux system .
The full system is based on Gentoo Linux , and utilizes kernel version 2.6.22 .
The project 's goal is to be able to maintain an Intel - compiler - compatible kernel source along side the current kernel .
A few remaining issues that need to be resolved before moving to 2.6.23 and beyond are under investigation .
One might ask :
Why compile the kernel with something besides gcc ?
The answer : Performance .
Earlier work at compiling the Linux kernel with ICC found that ICC provided up to a 40 % boost in performance .
Ingo A. Kubblin , a German developer that worked on the original ICC porting project in 2004 , gave the following quote :
" ... boost up to 40 % for certain kernel parts and an average boost of 8 - 9 % possible "
This early work was based on version 8 of ICC ; current efforts are using versions 10.1 and 11 .
The Intel compiler often produces faster code as the result of two major optimizations : IPO ( Inter Procedural Optimization ) and PGO ( Profile Guided Optimization ) .
IPO is a heuristics based optimization mechanism , while PGO uses several code stages , first to build code with special modifications that analyse code use , and then a recompile of the code for better execution based on that usage .
As PGO is based on usage patterns , it can custom design an optimized kernel for a specific purpose : HPC , DCC , gaming , servers , etc .
Although , PGO is also available in gcc , ICC is generally regarded as producing a superior result .
Among the contributors to LinuxDNA are :
LuYi Cheng : A Chinese kernel hacker responsible for the code becoming fully operational .
Feilong H : An Intel employee who laid the groundwork for needed patching .
An unnamed kernel hacker at Broadcom who contributed advice and technical assistance .
Claude Tyler McAdams : Hacker & spokesperson .
Currently , closed source drivers will not install out of the box , though the developers believed this issue should be easily fixable .
LinuxDNA is an Open Source project that aims to bring a compatible , current kernel source to the high - performance Intel Linux compiler .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. senators began debate on a massive economic - recovery package Friday evening , after a working coalition of Democrats and some Republicans reached a compromise that trimmed billions in spending from an earlier version .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is hoping for a vote on the $ 827 billion bill on Tuesday .
Shortly before 11:30 p.m. , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told his colleagues that debate on the plan would continue on Saturday from noon to 3 p.m.
Reid said a vote could come on Tuesday on the plan , which is championed by President Barack Obama as a tonic for a badly battered economy .
The movement came after days of private meetings between centrist Democrats and Republicans who felt the price tag on the Senate 's nearly $ 900 billion version of the package was too much .
" There is a winner tonight , " said Sen .
Joe Lieberman , an independent from Connecticut and one of the moderates whose support was crucial in building support for the plan .
" It 's the American people and they deserve it . "
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the administration was pleased with the progress .
" On the day when we learned 3.6 million people have lost their jobs since this recession began , we are pleased the process is moving forward and we are closer to getting Americans a plan to create millions of jobs and get people back to work , " Gibbs said .
House Republican Leader John Boehner of Ohio issued a statement on the deal Friday night , saying , " Ultimately this bill should be judged on whether it works , and 90 percent of a bad idea is still a bad idea . "
Boehner 's criticisms echoed those of the House - passed bill ; he said the plan was focused on slow - moving and wasteful spending rather than immediate relief .
Stimulus cuts A coalition of Senate Democrats and Republicans trimmed billions in spending from the massive economic recovery package .
Here is an initial list of some of the items cut , according to a Democratic leadership aide .
Items cut $ 3.5 billion for energy - efficient federal buildings ( original bill $ 7 billion )
$ 75 million for Smithsonian ( original bill $ 150 million )
$ 200 million for Superfund ( original bill $ 800 million )
$ 100 million for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( original bill $ 427 million )
$ 100 million for Law enforcement wireless ( original bill $ 200 million )
$ 300 million for federal fleet of hybrid vehicles ( original bill $ 600 million )
$ 100 million for FBI construction ( original bill $ 400 million )
Items eliminated $ 55 million for historic preservation
$ 122 million for new Coast Guard polar icebreaker / cutters
" This is not what the American people want ; nor is it what the president called for at the start of the process , " he said .
" Both of these massively flawed proposals should be scrapped in favor of a truly bipartisan plan that will help our economy preserve and create jobs .
The American people want and deserve nothing less . "
Sen .
Ben Nelson , a Democrat from Nebraska and one of the chief negotiators of the plan , said senators had trimmed the plan to $ 827 billion in tax cuts and spending on infrastructure , housing and other programs that would create or save jobs .
" We trimmed the fat , fried the bacon and milked the sacred cows , " Nelson said as debate began .
Watch CNN analysts discuss what they think the stimulus deal means »
According to a senior Democratic aide , items fully eliminated from the plan include $ 55 million for historic preservation and $ 122 million for new Coast Guard polar icebreaker / cutters
According to several senators , the revised version of the plan also axed money for school construction and nearly $ 90 million for fighting pandemic flu .
Remaining in the plan are tax incentives for small businesses , a one - year fix of the unpopular alternative - minimum tax and tax - relief for low - and middle - income families , said Sen.
Susan Collins of Maine , who was the most prominent Republican negotiator in the bipartisan talks .
" Our country faces a grave economic crisis and the American people want us to work together , " she said .
" They do n't want to see us dividing along partisan lines on the most serious crisis facing our country . "
While Democrats appeared to believe they had enough Republican support to push the compromise plan through , most GOP members still were speaking against the plan , saying spending is not the answer to cure economic woes .
" This is not bipartisan , " said Sen. John McCain , who lost the 2008 election to Obama .
" If this legislation is passed , it 'll be a very bad day for America . "
Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell compared the plan to President Franklin Roosevelt 's " New Deal " public works program , which he said did not help the nation out of the Great Depression .
" We 're talking about an extraordinarily large amount of money , and a crushing debt for our grandchildren , " said McConnell of Kentucky .
" Now , if most Republicans were convinced that this would work , there might be a greater willingness to support it .
But all the historical evidence suggests that it 's highly unlikely to work . "
Earlier Friday , Ohio Republican Sen. George Voinovich dropped out of the negotiations .
Voinovich concluded that his " philosophical " differences with the approach of Republican negotiators was too great , a Voinovich aide said .
The senator said he could no longer support efforts at compromise or the final bill , the aide said .
Voinovich 's departure left four Republican senators involved in the negotiations : Collins , Lisa Murkowski of Alaska , Mel Martinez of Florida and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania .
Democratic leaders will need at least two or three GOP votes to pass the bill .
Sen .
Dick Durbin of Illinois confirmed Democrats were in a tough debate over cutting what they saw as core programs .
He singled out education as one of the largest areas of cuts -- and one of the hardest for Democrats to swallow .
" It 's a painful area for all of us , as Democrats , to make these cuts in education assistance , " he said .
There are " substantial " proposed cuts to a $ 79 billion fund created to help states deal with the economic crisis by giving them more money for schools , Durbin said .
Putting more pressure on senators was news Friday that employers slashed another 598,000 jobs off U.S. payrolls in January , taking the unemployment rate up to 7.6 percent .

" This is not some abstract debate .
It is an urgent and growing crisis , " President Obama said at a White House ceremony unveiling a new economic advisory board .
" If we drag our feet and fail to act , this crisis will turn into a catastrophe . "
The frenzy of meetings on Capitol Hill shifted into yet a higher and more powerful gear .
White House budget director Peter Orszag left a morning meeting in Reid 's office but would not comment on negotiations .
Senators who were meeting in their office buildings Thursday were negotiating directly with Reid just outside the chamber doors .

American Apparel cites Woody Allen 's affair with his stepdaughter after he sues over use of his image in ad campaign
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Woody Allen cannot sue an American clothing company for damaging his reputation in its adverts because he has no reputation left to ruin , the firm said today .
Allen has launched a $ 10 m ( £ 6.7 m ) lawsuit against American Apparel for the use his images in an advertising campaign , including one from 1977 film Annie Hall of Allen dressed as a Hasidic Jew with a long beard and black hat , without his permission .
The veteran director , who does not endorse products in the US , has branded the clothing firm 's campaigns " sleazy " , " adolescent " and " infantile " .
His lawyers say Allen is one of the greats of US cinema , alongside the likes of Clint Eastwood and Frank Sinatra , and that the use of his image falsely implied he endorsed American Apparel 's " low- end " products and damaged his reputation .
But American Apparel 's lawyers are attempting to turn the tables by claiming Allen ruined his own reputation by having an affair with his stepdaughter , Soon - Yi Previn .
The firm 's lawyers are targeting the torrent of negative publicity that surrounded the revelation in 1992 of Allen 's affair with Soon - Yi , his then - partner Mia Farrow 's adopted daughter .
The affair led to the messy and very public break - up of his relationship with Farrow .
As part of its case American Apparel is demanding documents relating to any advertising endorsements that were cancelled or withdrawn following the revelation of Allen 's affair with the then 22 - year - old Soon - Yi , whom he married in 1997 .
Allen 's lawyers have said that the request for documents relating to the affair with Soon - Yi are " vexatious , oppressive , harassing " and not relevant to the case .
" Woody Allen expects $ 10 m for use of his image on billboards that were up and down in less than one week , " said Stuart Slotnick , a lawyer for American Apparel .
" I think Woody Allen overestimates the value of his image .
Certainly , our belief is that after the various sex scandals that Woody Allen has been associated with , corporate America 's desire to have Woody Allen endorse their product is not what he may believe it is . "
" All I can say is that the company has apologised for the use of Mr Allen 's image , however brief .
And the company apologised if they offended Mr Allen 's sensibilities . "
The trial is scheduled to begin in a US federal court in Manhattan on 18 May .

Not all televisions are built the same .
For kicks , Japanese site Intermezzo compared the Final Fantasy XIII Blu-ray PS3 demo on two televisions ( one HD , one analog ) .
Let 's have a look .

One of the televisions was a US $ 200 model 14 - inch Sony WEGA from the year 2000 .
It was connected to the PS3 with composite cables .
The other was a US $ 4,000 50 - inch Pioneer plasma panel from 2006 .
It was connected to the PS3 with composite cables .

Wonder which one looks better ...
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
Of course , the HD television !
That 's not the point , but rather , just how different the picture quality is .
Square Enix previously stated it was trying to make FFXIII playable on analog televisions .
While the demo is not the final retail version , it 's concerning how difficult it is to read text on an analog TV — that is , concerning to those who own these kind of televisions !

Another interesting comparison : Blu-ray Final Fantasy VII : Advent Children Complete on a 50 - inch HD TV , Blu-ray FFVII : ACC on a 14 - inch analog TV , and DVD Final Fantasy VII : Advent Children on a 14 - inch analog TV .
There does n't seem to be much difference between Blu-ray and DVD on analog televisions .

Think of this as a not so subtle way to encourage you to buy an HD TV if you have n't already .
Come on !
Take the plunge .
It 's only US $ 4,000 , and what 's four grand when the global economy is in the toilet ?

By the Communist Party of India ( Marxist - Leninist ) Liberation

March 17 , 2009 --
On the eve of the Lok Sabha ( national lower house of parliament ) polls , which will be held in five phases between April 16 and May 13 , the launch of a ``Third Front ' ' spearheaded by the efforts of the Communist Party of India ( CPI ) and CPI ( M ) ( the Communist Party of India - Marxist ) has been announced .
The front , it is claimed , is a non-Congress party , non-Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) front committed to ``alternate policies '' .
Most of the non-Left Front * partners -- regional and small parties such as All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( AIADMK ) , Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) , Telengana Rashtra Samity ( TRS ) , Janata Dal ( Secular ) -- have at one point or the other been partners of either the BJP - led National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) or the Congress - led United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) or both .
Some parties -- such as Biju Janata Dal ( BJD ) and the Bahujan Samaj Party ( BSP ) -- have maintained a cautious pre-poll distance from the Third Front but are being touted as post - poll partners .
[* The Left Front is the CPI ( M ) - led alliance that rules the state governments of West Bengal and Tripura .
A similar alliance also operates in Kerala . ]
The establishment of coalition governments as the norm in India for over a decade reflects the eroded credibility of the main ruling - class formations –- the Congress and BJP -– and the rise of a range of third forces .
There is unmistakeable frustration and anger at successive NDA and UPA governments and their anti-poor , pro-imperialist policy orientation .
Clearly , there is an objective need for a credible Third Front .
The question is : can a rag - tag coalition ever constitute a meaningful Third Front ?
Is n't a vibrant left movement and a powerful democratic consolidation around a powerful left course a necessary foundation for any viable , serious and durable Third Front ?
The ``Third Front '' as it stands today is a highly amorphous formation riddled with paradoxes .
It is neither a full - fledged pre-poll alliance nor a well - defined programmatic coalition .
Partners like the TDP have been enthusiastic proponents of disastrous neoliberal policies ; as for the track record of partners like TDP , AIADMK or Janata Dal ( Secular ) on secularism and democracy , the less said the better .
Potential post - poll partners like the BJD and BSP have an equally dubious and tainted record on both neoliberal policies and secularism ( the BJD was the party in power in the state of Orissa , that , leading the state govt in alliance with BJP , has presided over the massacre of Christians at Kandhamal and over the repression and killing of tribal protesters against massive corporate land grab at Kalinganagar , and many other places ; while the BSP has the distinction of being the only party without a declared economic policy ) .
More importantly , the current arrangement ignores the fact that there is a distinct and crucial difference between ``Third Front government '' ( or non -NDA , non -UPA government ) and a ``Third Front ' ' .
A Third Front in its true sense can be nothing but a left and democratic front that is a powerful voice of a third alternative -– in policies , in vision , in people ’s movements - – but which may not necessarily be in a position to form government .
Only such a Third Front can be in any way durable , sustainable and credible .
What is being called a ``Third Front ' ' at this juncture is very different : it is merely a potential power - sharing that might emerge in view of the possibility that neither the UPA nor NDA achieve a majority in the impending parliamentary polls -– an eventuality that is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty .
Surely a genuine Third Front can not be a mere exercise in government formation ?
The role of the left parties , the CPI and CPI ( M ) , in such a coalition is yet another paradox .
On the one hand these parties face major setbacks in their strongholds of Kerala and West Bengal .
On the other , CPI ( M ) leaders have spoken of the possibility of joining a Third Front government at the centre !
Answering questions from the press at the release of the party manifesto , CPI ( M ) general secretary Prakash Karat indicated that the question of joining a Third Front government at the centre is very much open .
The CPI ( M ) , since its ``historic blunder '' of 1996 , has systematically removed all the programmatic roadblocks to being part of a government at the centre -– it is now free to join any central government which it claims to be in a position to ``influence ' ' .
The CPI ( ML ) Liberation has made it clear that a role in government formation is not on its agenda or priorities .
The party is contesting this election with the agenda of asserting a fighting left opposition within parliament .
The seat adjustment [ agreement ] forged by the CPI ( ML ) Liberation in Bihar with the CPI and the CPI ( M ) is quite distinct from any ongoing ``Third Front '' efforts of those parties .
This adjustment is based on the CPI ( ML ) 's consistent efforts in the direction of joint activities and electoral adjustments with left formations .
While there has been no let - up in our firm and sustained struggle against the CPI - CPI ( M ) 's opportunist tactics on the whole and anti-people policies and measures in Left Front - ruled states , the latter have , in the objective conditions of Bihar at this particular juncture ( the closing of doors on an alliance with the UPA partners and the impact among left ranks in the state of CPI ( ML ) 's practice of independent left assertion ) responded positively to our appeal for an adjustment in the Lok Sabha polls in Bihar .
We hold that a meaningful Third Front can only be forged on a left basis .
The ongoing adjustment achieved by the CPI ( ML ) , CPI and CPI ( M ) in Bihar is certainly linked in a strategic sense to the efforts and experiments in the direction of such a genuine Third Front -– efforts and experiments marked by a consistent and principled element of struggle as well as of unity of purpose .
The ruling - class design to subject the polity to a duopoly of the UPA and NDA must be frustrated .
But a rag - tag ``Third Front '' that offers no policy alternative and is crowded by forces with dubious track records cannot face this challenge .
Only a powerful left and democratic camp drawing its strength from the struggles and aspirations of the Indian people for a better tomorrow can be the most effective bulwark against the ruling class 's attempt to regiment the polity , and can be the basis for a principled and consistent third alternative and Third Front .

Neighbours said they saw a van being driven suspiciously by the farm
More than 500 pigs have been stolen from a farm in south Staffordshire .
The animals , all less than five weeks old , were stolen from Packington Fields Farm , known for its free range pigs , in Hopwas near Tamworth on Thursday .
Farmer Rob Mercer , who estimates the piglets to be worth more than £ 25,000 , said there had not been a theft of pigs on this scale for many years .
It is thought the thieves broke down a fence , walked half a mile to the pens and herded them into a truck .
Mr Mercer told BBC
News that the animals would be difficult to conceal .
" It 's not easy at all as they will be on a farm somewhere - whether that 's a large commercial farm or whether that 's a smallholding somewhere , " he said .
" They will be in a shed somewhere being fed and reared up for selling in five months time , so it 's difficult to hide . "
Neighbours said they heard a commotion and saw a van by the farm being driven suspiciously .
As darkness gave way to dawn , the doctors delivered the awful news :
There was nothing more they could do to save his son .
Jim Adenhart found his sanctuary where his son found joy .
The hospital was no place for a grieving father , not in the hour after death , not when there was solace in life , and in baseball .
And so the Angels unlocked their stadium , and their clubhouse , for a private sunrise service Thursday morning .
Nick Adenhart had walked through those doors just eight hours before , all smiles .
Jim Adenhart walked through those doors , just past 7 a.m. , all tears .

Mike Butcher , the Angels ’ pitching coach , led Jim to his son ’s locker .
Butcher stepped back , leaving a respectful distance .
This would be Jim ’s first memorial service for his son , all his own .
He saw .
He touched .
He prayed .
He cried .
Ken Higdon , the Angels ’ clubhouse manager , handed him the jersey his son had worn Wednesday night , when Nick pitched six shutout innings , the finest game of his young life .
He was 22 .

Perhaps
Jim thought about what his son had told him a few days ago .
He lives in Maryland , but his son urged him to fly to California for his first start in this new season .
“ You better come here , because something special is going to happen , ” Nick told his father , according to agent Scott Boras .
If the son had not been looking out for the father , then the father would not have been minutes away from the hospital when he got that 3 a.m. call , with the horrible news that his son had been critically injured in a traffic accident .
Jim was not alone in those predawn hours .
Butcher was at the hospital .
So was Tim Mead , the Angels ’ vice president of communications .
So were Boras and two of his lieutenants , Mike Fiore and Jeff Musselman .
Advertisement
The men accompanied Jim to the stadium and into the clubhouse , then left him alone at his son ’s locker .
Five minutes passed , then 10 , then 15 .
And then cellphones started ringing , almost all at once .
The word had gotten out .
The world demanded confirmation , details , reaction .
The Angels arranged a news conference .
Jim chose not to attend .
General Manager Tony Reagins and Manager Mike Scioscia spoke , not easily but without losing composure .
Boras lost his .
Advertisement
He is the agent fans love to hate , full of lengthy discourses on why his players deserve millions upon millions .
He can speak dispassionately , almost robotically .
On this day , he could not suppress his raw emotions .
He could barely get through a sentence .
He choked up .
He paused , then spoke haltingly .
He stopped midway through his first sentence , pulling out a tissue , wiping away his tears .
Boras , an agent for 25 years , said he ’d never had a day like this one .

“ As you could tell , ” he said .
“ This is an industry that is largely youth .
We ’re just not very prepared .
It ’s just shocking to get the phone call . ”
The Angels , sadly enough , get more than their share of those calls .
They ’re already wearing a memorial patch this season in honor of scouting consultant Preston Gomez , who died this year at 86 .
“ It seems like , for a while there , something happened to the Angels every year , ” Cincinnati Reds Manager Dusty Baker said .
Pitcher Donnie Moore committed suicide at 35 , three years after giving up the home run that kept the Angels out of the 1986 World Series .

Outfielder Lyman Bostock was murdered at 27 .
Michelle Carew , daughter of Hall of Famer Rod Carew , died of leukemia at 18 .
Coach Deron Johnson died of lung cancer at 53 .
Pitcher Dick Wantz died of a brain tumor at 25 .
Three players died in car accidents in the 1970s : infielder Chico Ruiz at 33 , infielder Mike Miley at 24 , pitcher Bruce Heinbechner at 23 .
This is not a curse .
That is the stuff of feeble minds .
This is a tragedy , not the loss of a baseball player but the loss of a son , the greatest tragedy that can befall any parent .
Jim Adenhart did speak Thursday , not to the media but in a closed - door team meeting .
He made a second trip to the clubhouse , eight hours after his first , to thank the players and coaches who had befriended his son .
Advertisement
After a few minutes , Mead escorted him onto the field , where the flags had been lowered to half - staff .
This was the middle of the afternoon , when the players normally would be stretching , playing catch , taking batting practice .
There was no game on this day ; the Angels were to have played the Oakland A’s , but it was postponed .
There was no one else on the field .

Jim Adenhart , wearing a red Angels pullover , walked slowly to the pitcher ’s mound .
He lingered for a few minutes .
He crouched , appearing to cry .
He stood up and looked to the heavens .
He fixed his gaze there for a few moments .
He bid farewell to his son , from the very place that made him so happy .

Each time a newspaper ’s corporate owners — and these days , most never worked as journalists — cut the editorial staff , the paper ’s readers lose access to a mind and a pair of eyes that keep watch over government , business , and the public ’s interests .
Until the discovery of newspapers as profitable cash cows by Wall Street more than four decades ago , newspapers were owned by people who had 1 ) worked as journalists , 2 ) understood the community the paper served , 3 ) believed in the public service mission of journalism , and 4 ) understood the need for an appropriate profit to maintain that mission of serving the public interest .
Those owners and publishers understood what they were selling — the ability of their editorial staffs to tell both wanted and needed stories to their readers about their communities .
They knew that readers wanted and would buy their papers for sports , Dear Abby , and crossword puzzles .
But they also knew their readers needed and would also buy well - done , “ eat - your - spinach ” stories about corrupt government and its agencies ; misbehaving businesses ; shenanigans of politicians ; and fire , court and police activities .
But that ’s all changed now .
Those owners and publishers understood their audiences ’ needs and wants .
They knew that to maintain the daily stream of salable and profitable content they needed a sufficient number of well - trained , experienced journalists who knew their beats and their sources .
Those owners and publishers are a minority now , bought out by profit - maximizing mega-corporations seeking to turn these 10 - percent papers into 30 - percent papers .
The old , ink - stained owners have been replaced by corporate minions who never worked in a newsroom and who believe that whatever is placed on a newspaper page ( or a Web site ) is sufficient to breed substantial profit .
Google “ editorial staff cuts . ”
You ’ll probably find that American newspapers cut a few thousand journalists last year and bought out hundreds more .
Gone are minds that produced the content that is the product that newspapers have historically sold to readers for a few hundred years .
Modern newspaper management has made numerous bone - headed decisions in the past 15 years , mostly from failing to anticipate the influence of the Web as a delivery vehicle for news — and from failing to charge for the unique content journalists produced during those nascent days of news Web sites .
Now these corporate management tycoons are making an error likely to prove fatal to their attempts to recover from their missteps and misdeeds .
Oh , sure , they ’re trying to dump the printing presses in a rush to be Web - only .
But what will they put there ?
Because current newspaper owners have so few roots into the meaning and role of journalism in American life , they ’re getting rid of the minds responsible for locally generated , unique content .
That ’s the content that readers used to be willing to buy .
If it ’s not present in these new , Web - only aggregations passing for news , no one ’s going to read it — free or not .
Corporate newspapers owners should show some spine — hire back experienced journalists , and plenty of them .
Produce newspapers , Web - only or not , worth reading .
That ’s their only route to return to profitability and respectability .
( Tip o’ the hat to my colleague John Hanchette . )
In Masai Mara , one of Africa ’s most treasured parks , researchers have found significant , in some cases catastrophic , declines of wild grazing animals .
In fifteen years six of seven hoofed animals — giraffes , warthogs , hartebeest , impala , topis and waterbucks — showed declines .
The study published in the British Journal of Zoology confirms what has long been expected : wildlife populations in Masai Mara are plummeting due to increased competition with humans and livestock .
The Masai Mara National Reserve lies over 1500 square kilometers in southwestern Kenya where it eventually links to Serengeti park in Tanzania .
Heavily visited by tourists , the park is one of the best places in the world to see the famous wildebeest migration .
According to a new study warthogs have declined by 80 percent in fifteen years in Kenya ’s Masai Mara Reserve .

Researchers from the International Livestock Research Institute ( ILRI ) conducted surveys of species every month for fifteen years , from 1989 to 2003 .
Giraffes fared the worse : dropping an astounding 95 percent in fifteen years .
Warthog populations fell 80 percent .
While hartebeest and impala dropped 76 percent and 67 percent respectively .
“ The situation we documented paints a bleak picture and requires urgent and decisive action if we want to save this treasure from disaster , ” said Joseph Ogutu , the lead author of the study and a statistical ecologist at ILRI .
“ Our study offers the best evidence to date that wildlife losses in the reserve are widespread and substantial , and that these trends are likely linked to the steady increase in human settlements on lands adjacent to the reserve . ”

The researchers point to the growing , largely impoverished , human population around the park as the reason for the wildlife declines .
Lands that were once grazed by ungulates are being co-opted by humans for livestock and crops .
In addition illegal hunting remains a persistent problem while incidents of wildlife killed for having broken fences , damaged crops , or threatened livestock is no longer uncommon .
“ Wildlife are constantly moving between the reserve and surrounding ranchlands and they are increasingly competing for habitat with livestock and with large - scale crop cultivation around the human settlements , ” Ogutu said .
“ In particular , our analysis found that more and more people in the ranchlands are allowing their livestock to graze in the reserve , an illegal activity the impoverished Maasai resort to when faced with prolonged drought and other problems . ”
The topi is one of six hoofed species to show significant decline .

The traditional peoples of the Mara , the semi-nomadic herders called the Maasai , have long co-existed peacefully with wildlife in the area .
But recently the Maasai , due to long neglect by the Kenyan government , have abandoned traditional lifestyles and begun moving into more permanent settlements .
The researchers note that in one of the Maasai ranchlands , the number of huts went from 44 in 1950 to 2,735 in 2003 .
“ The traditional livestock livelihoods of the Maasai , who rarely consume wild animals , actually helped maintain the abundance of grazing animals in East Africa , and where a pastoral approach to livestock grazing is still practiced , it continues to benefit wild populations , ” said Robin Reid , a co-author of the paper who is now director of the Center for Collaborative Conservation at Colorado State University .
“ There appears to be a ‘ tipping point ’ of human populations above which former co-existence between Maasai and wildlife begins to break down .
In the villages on the border of the Mara , this point has been passed , but large areas of the Mara still have populations low enough that compatibility is still possible . ”
The waterbuck is one of six hoofed species to show significant decline .

Currently , the Maasai are working with tourism companies to establish areas where the number of human settlements and livestock would be carefully managed to provide suitable habitat and grazing land for the reserve ’s world famous wildlife .
The Maasai community receives a portion of profits from tourism in the park .
“ We know from thousands of years of history that pastoral livestock - keeping can co-exist with East Africa ’s renowned concentrations of big mammals .
And we look to these pastoralists for solutions to the current conflicts , ” said Carlos Seré , Director General of ILRI .
“ With their help and the significant tourism revenue that the Mara wildlife generates , it is possible to invest in evidence - based approaches that can protect this region ’s iconic pastoral peoples , as well as its wildlife populations . ”

Fire in Kenya threatens some of the world ’s most beloved parks

All about giraffes : an interview with a giraffe expert
( 03/09/2009 ) Dr. Julian Fennessy probably knows the giraffe better than anyone .
Trekking across savannah , forest , and the deserts of Africa , Fennessy is collecting genetic samples of distinct giraffe populations and overturning common wisdom regarding their taxonomies .
It had long been accepted knowledge that the giraffe was made up of one species and several subspecies , however with Fennessy ’s work it now appears that several of the subspecies may in fact be distinct species .
Such discoveries could have large conservation impacts , since conservation funds and efforts are largely devoted to species .
The giraffe has suffered significant declines in the past decade with the total population dropping some 30 percent across Africa .
Africa ’s lions are disappearing
( 03/25/2008 )
The lion is Africa ’s best known carnivore .
Once widely abundant across the continent , recent surveys show that lion populations have plunged from over 100,000 individuals to around 23,000 over the past century .
The reason ?
Lions are poisoned , shot , and speared by locals who see them as a threat to livestock .
While lion populations in protected areas remain relatively healthy , conservationists say that without urgent measures , lions may disappear completely from unprotected areas .
The Kilimanjaro Lion conservation Project is working to avoid this fate by developing practical measures to encourage coexistence between people , livestock and predators .
Key to the effort is reducing livestock losses to lions .
Leela Hazzah , a field researcher with the project , says the “ Lion Guardians ” program at Mbirikani Ranch in Kenya has proved remarkably successful : not a single lion has been killed since its inception in November 2006 .
The program employs Maasai warriors to monitor lions and help local communities prevent attacks on livestock .
First they counted the votes .
Then they recounted them .
Then they painstakingly went over every disputed ballot by hand .
It was the most thorough and exhaustive recount process Minnesota has ever seen .
The BI - partisan canvassing board declared Al Franken the winner of the U.S. Senate race in Minnesota but Norm Coleman , and the Republican Party leadership do n’t like the result and the GOP and Coleman think they have found a way by which they can block the Democrats in the Senate from getting the magic number of 60 votes needed to close off filibuster in case of a contested vote in the Senate .
Coleman and the Republicans want to drag this process on in court , if necessary for years , even after a majority of Minnesotans have indicated by poll after poll that they want this matter resolved and they want Minnesota ’s other senator to be seated .
Even when , Coleman ’s own lawyers are now predicting he 'll lose if he appeals , Coleman is threatening to keep appealing anyway to more and more courts .
Because Norm Coleman and the Republican party do n’t care what courts , commissions or the people of Minnesota think .
As with McConnell , Boehner , Cantor , et al , party ideology trumps their duty to the people of their state and to the American people to abide by fairly arrived at election results .
So how many more recounts does Norm Coleman want ?
How many more delays ?
How much longer will the Republican Party hold Minnesota 's Senate seat hostage ?
My answer would be the following : IF the Republicans persist in stymieing the resolution of the Coleman - Franken vote controversy , and if they continue to seek to keep the second Minnesota Senate empty through endless litigation then Democrats are correspondingly justified if THEY use the special parliamentary maneuver in the Senate whereby the 60 vote majority requirement can be circumvented and legislation can be passed without needing the 60 votes for overcoming a fillibuster .
If the Republicans are going to play hardball , the Democrats need to also play hardball .
The Republicans are interfering with the official business of the United States , at a time when votes on key issues is critical to the survival of the country .
If these un-American party ideologues have to put their party ahead of their country , and they do , then they need to be swept aside by whatever means the Democrats have to use .
The Democratic majority was put in place by the American people , who elected them to enact needed reforms .
The Republicans are die - hard - sore - loser - obstructionists , while they continually lie and try to accuse the Democrats of being the ones who are unfair .
So bottom line , the Democrats have the power to play legislative hardball in the Senate and they are justified in doing so in order to fight fire with fire and give the Reublicans the Democratic answer to the GOP ’s unreasoning nay - saying and attempts to derail reform .
after the Minnesota vote count is essentially over , even if Coleman continues to tie it up in court .
Republicans can either be reasonable or else they need to simply be swept aside by the means the Democrats have at their disposal .
After all , when the Republicans had the majority , they did n’t hesistate to use their majority status to shut down Democratic congressional opposition .
Turnabout is fair play and the Coleman - Franken case proves that Mitch McConnell is a bald faced liar when he says “ Republicans have reached out but ca n’t get any bi-partisan cooperation from the Democrats ” .
Obviously the opposite is true .
If the gossip - mill is true , the next incarnation of the iPhone and iPod touch will see the devices add “ car stereo ” and “ moviemaker ” to their repertoires .
We reported recently that new generation models of both devices look to be in the works given the version numbers referenced in the newest edition of the iPhone operating system .
The latest discovery from the system ’s coding is support for Bluetooth streaming .
As well as the new devices , the feature will work on the current iPhone and iPod touch once the new operating system arrives in the summer .
The system ’s coding also includes references to components which suggest the new models will include upgraded chips which can use more reliable wi-fi connections and transmit FM signals .
That would mean the devices could be used for hassle - free playback on any car stereo without the need for adaptors or wiring .
The technology concerned could also make it possible for the iPhone and iPod touch to receive FM radio broadcasts .
That ’s hardly a major priority , but it certainly wo n’t do any harm .
Another rumor is sparked by stories that a Chinese firm has received large scale orders from Apple for image sensors .
Throw in some job listings at Apple for various camera - related design and engineering positions and several have concluded that means a greater emphasis on camera technology in the new model .
That certainly ties in with reports that the new operating system includes both a reference to an ‘ Upload my video ’ option in MobileMe and a folder with the type of graphics you ’d expect to see as templates and other tools in a video editing package .
By the way , you may remember that in our previous report we noted a mysterious new product code - named iProd which we concluded was likely a reference along the lines of ‘ prototype design ’ rather than a clue as to its content .
A reader pointed out the name was floated around last April in reports of a patent application for a personal training device ( think portable Wii Fit ) .
However , as best we can tell , the name was used by Apple itself and was thought up by a writer for New Scientist in their report on the story .
Two hundred schoolchildren in Britain , some as young as 13 , have been identified as potential terrorists by a police scheme that aims to spot youngsters who are " vulnerable " to Islamic radicalisation .
The number was revealed to The Independent by Sir Norman Bettison , the chief constable of West Yorkshire Police and Britain 's most senior officer in charge of terror prevention .
He said the " Channel project " had intervened in the cases of at least 200 children who were thought to be at risk of extremism , since it began 18 months ago .
The number has leapt from 10 children identified by June 2008 .

The programme , run by the Association of Chief Police Officers , asks teachers , parents and other community figures to be vigilant for signs that may indicate an attraction to extreme views or susceptibility to being " groomed " by radicalisers .
Sir Norman , whose force covers the area in which all four 7 July 2005 bombers grew up , said : " What will often manifest itself is what might be regarded as racism and the adoption of bad attitudes towards ' the West ' .
" One of the four bombers of 7 July was , on the face of it , a model student .
He had never been in trouble with the police , was the son of a well - established family and was employed and integrated into society .
" But when we went back to his teachers they remarked on the things he used to write .
In his exercise books he had written comments praising al - Qa'ida .
That was not seen at the time as being substantive .
Now we would hope that teachers might intervene , speak to the child 's family or perhaps the local imam who could then speak to the young man . "
The Channel project was originally piloted in Lancashire and the Metropolitan Police borough of Lambeth in 2007 , but in February last year it was extended to West Yorkshire , the Midlands , Bedfordshire and South Wales .
Due to its success there are now plans to roll it out to the rest of London , Thames Valley , South Yorkshire , Greater Manchester , Leicestershire , Nottinghamshire , and West Sussex .
The scheme , funded by the Home Office , involves officers working alongside Muslim communities to identify impressionable children who are at risk of radicalisation or who have shown an interest in extremist material – on the internet or in books .
Once identified the children are subject to a " programme of intervention tailored to the needs of the individual " .
Sir Norman said this could involve discussions with family , outreach workers or the local imam , but he added that " a handful have had intervention directly by the police " .
He stressed that the system was not being used to target the Muslim community .
" The whole ethos is to build a relationship , on the basis of trust and confidence , with those communities , " said Sir Norman .

" With the help of these communities we can identify the kids who are vulnerable to the message and influenced by the message .
The challenge is to intervene and offer guidance , not necessarily to prosecute them , but to address their grievance , their growing sense of hate and potential to do something violent in the name of some misinterpretation of a faith .
" We are targeting criminals and would - be terrorists who happen to be cloaking themselves in Islamic rhetoric .
That is not the same as targeting the Muslim community . "
Nor was it criminalising children , he added .
" The analogy I use is that it is similar to our well - established drugs intervention programmes .
Teachers in schools are trained to identify pupils who might be experimenting with drugs , take them to one side and talk to them .
That does not automatically mean that these kids are going to become crack cocaine or heroin addicts .
The same is true around this issue . "
But Inayat Bunglawala of the Muslim Council of Britain said the police ran the risk of infringing on children 's privacy .
He warned : " There is a difference between the police being concerned or believing a person may be at risk of recruitment and a person actually engaging in unlawful , terrorist activity .
" That said , clearly in recent years some people have been lured by terrorist propaganda emanating from al - Qa'ida - inspired groups .
It would seem that a number of Muslim youngsters have been seduced by that narrative and all of us , including the Government , have a role to play in making sure that narrative is seen for what it is : a nihilistic one which offers no hope , only death and destruction . "
A Home Office spokesman said : " We are committed to stopping people becoming or supporting terrorists or violent extremists .
The aim of the Channel project is to directly support vulnerable people by providing supportive interventions when families , communities and networks raise concerns about their behaviour . "

5 Water Can Explode , With No Explosives
OK , this one is incredibly dangerous .

This involves " superheating " water , by getting it way beyond the boiling point without having it actually boil .
It 's easier than you think , since actual boiling , that is bubbles escaping hot water , can only be achieved with a " seed " ( say a point , preferably sharp , where bubbles can form ) .
Normally , minerals in the water and imperfections in the surface of the container are more than enough for this to happen .
However , distilled water has no such minerals , and if you put it in a relatively smooth container and stick it in the microwave , the water can be heated beyond the normal boiling point and will remain perfectly still .

Then , you toss in an object in and watch it explode :
You 're watching the boiling process happen all at once , in a fraction of a second , in a way that will result in boiling water flying back into your face .
Do we need to tell you that if you must try this at home , to only do it with adult supervision and proper safety equipment ?
Do we really ?
Because we have a feeling that no matter what we say , some of your are going to try this , and that at least one of you , for some reason , will do it nude .

Packed bit - fields of type char were not properly bit - packed on many targets prior to GCC 4.4 .
On these targets , the fix in GCC 4.4 causes an ABI change .
For example there is no longer a 4 - bit padding between field a and b in this structure : struct foo { char a : 4 ; char b:8 ; } __attribute__ ( ( packed ) ) ;
There is a new warning to help identify fields that are affected : foo . c: 5 : note : Offset of packed bit - field ' b ' has changed in GCC 4.4
The warning can be disabled with - Wno - packed - bitfield - compat .

The SCOUNT and POS bits of the MIPS DSP control register are now treated as global .
Previous versions of GCC treated these fields as call - clobbered instead .
The MIPS port no longer recognizes the h asm constraint .
It was necessary to remove this constraint in order to avoid generating unpredictable code sequences .
One of the main uses of the h constraint was to extract the high part of a multiplication on 64 - bit targets .
For example : asm ( " dmultu\t % 1 , %2 " : " =h " ( result ) : " r " ( x ) , " r " ( y ) ) ;
You can now achieve the same effect using 128 - bit types : typedef unsigned int uint128_t __attribute__ ( ( mode ( TI ) ) ) ; result = ( ( uint128_t ) x * y ) >>
64 ; The second sequence is better in many ways .
For example , if x and y are constants , the compiler can perform the multiplication at compile time .
If x and y are not constants , the compiler can schedule the runtime multiplication better than it can schedule an asm statement .
constraint .
It was necessary to remove this constraint in order to avoid generating unpredictable code sequences .
Support for a number of older systems and recently unmaintained or untested target ports of GCC has been declared obsolete in GCC 4.4 .
Unless there is activity to revive them , the next release of GCC will have their sources permanently removed .
The following ports for individual systems on particular architectures have been obsoleted : Generic a.out on IA32 and m68 k ( i[34567]86-*- aout * , m68k-*-aout*)
Generic COFF on ARM , H8300 , IA32 , m68 k and SH ( arm - * - coff * , armel -*- coff * , h8300 -*-* , i[34567]86-*- coff * , m68k-*-coff* , sh-*-*) .
This does not affect other more specific targets using the COFF object format on those architectures , or the more specific H8300 and SH targets ( h8300 -*- rtems * , h8300 -*- elf * , sh-*- elf * , sh-*- symbianelf * , sh-*- linux * , sh-*- netbsdelf * , sh-*- rtems * , sh- wrs - vxworks ) .

This makes it possible to use such directives in inline assembler code .
The new option directs the compiler to not use directives .
The Graphite branch has been merged .
This merge has brought in a new framework for loop optimizations based on a polyhedral intermediate representation .
These optimizations apply to all the languages supported by GCC .
The following new code transformations are available in GCC 4.4 : - floop - interchange performs loop interchange transformations on loops .
Interchanging two nested loops switches the inner and outer loops .
For example , given a loop like : DO J = 1 , M DO I = 1 , N A( J , I ) = A ( J , I ) * C ENDDO ENDDO loop interchange will transform the loop as if the user had written : DO I = 1 , N DO J = 1 , M A( J , I ) = A ( J , I ) * C ENDDO ENDDO which can be beneficial when N is larger than the caches , because in Fortran , the elements of an array are stored in memory contiguously by column , and the original loop iterates over rows , potentially creating at each access a cache miss .
- floop - strip - mine performs loop strip mining transformations on loops .
Strip mining splits a loop into two nested loops .
The outer loop has strides equal to the strip size and the inner loop has strides of the original loop within a strip .
For example , given a loop like : DO I = 1 , N A( I ) = A( I ) + C ENDDO loop strip mining will transform the loop as if the user had written : DO II = 1 , N , 4 DO I = II , min ( II + 3 , N ) A( I ) = A( I ) + C ENDDO ENDDO - floop - block performs loop blocking transformations on loops .
Blocking strip mines each loop in the loop nest such that the memory accesses of the element loops fit inside caches .
For example , given a loop like : DO I = 1 , N DO J = 1 , M A( J , I ) = B ( I ) + C( J ) ENDDO ENDDO loop blocking will transform the loop as if the user had written : DO II = 1 , N , 64 DO JJ = 1 , M , 64 DO I = II , min ( II + 63 , N ) DO J = JJ , min ( JJ + 63 , M ) A( J , I ) = B ( I ) + C( J ) ENDDO ENDDO ENDDO ENDDO which can be beneficial when M is larger than the caches , because the innermost loop will iterate over a smaller amount of data that can be kept in the caches .
A new register allocator has replaced the old one .
It is called integrated register allocator ( IRA ) because coalescing , register live range splitting , and hard register preferencing are done on - the - fly during coloring .
It also has better integration with the reload pass .
IRA is a regional register allocator which uses modern Chaitin - Briggs coloring instead of Chow 's priority coloring used in the old register allocator .
More info about IRA internals and options can be found in the GCC manuals .
A new instruction scheduler and software pipeliner , based on the selective scheduling approach , has been added .
The new pass performs instruction unification , register renaming , substitution through register copies , and speculation during scheduling .
The software pipeliner is able to pipeline non-countable loops .
The new pass is targeted at scheduling - eager in - order platforms .
In GCC 4.4 it is available for the Intel Itanium platform working by default as the second scheduling pass ( after register allocation ) at the - O3 optimization level .

When using - fprofile - generate with a multi - threaded program , the profile counts may be slightly wrong due to race conditions .
The new - fprofile - correction option directs the compiler to apply heuristics to smooth out the inconsistencies .
By default the compiler will give an error message when it finds an inconsistent profile .

The new - fprofile - dir=PATH option permits setting the directory where profile data files are stored when using - fprofile - generate and friends , and the directory used when reading profile data files using - fprofile - use and friends .
New warning options
The new - Wframe - larger - than=NUMBER option directs GCC to emit a warning if any stack frame is larger than NUMBER bytes .
This may be used to help ensure that code fits within a limited amount of stack space .

The new - Wno - mudflap option disables warnings about constructs which can not be instrumented when using - fmudflap .
New Languages and Language specific improvements
Version 3.0 of the OpenMP specification is now supported for the C , C++ , and Fortran compilers .
New character data types , per TR 19769 : New character types in C , are now supported for the C compiler in - std=gnu99 mode , as __CHAR16_TYPE__ and __CHAR32_TYPE__ , and for the C++ compiler in - std=c++0 x and - std=gnu ++0 x modes , as char16_t and char32 _t too .
C family
A new optimize attribute was added to allow programmers to change the optimization level and particular optimization options for an individual function .
You can also change the optimization options via the GCC optimize pragma for functions defined after the pragma .
The GCC push_options pragma and the GCC pop_options pragma allow you temporarily save and restore the options used .
The GCC reset_options pragma restores the options to what was specified on the command line .

These extensions allow GNU / Linux executables to use a significantly more efficient code model than the one defined by the original ABI .
GCC support for this code model is available via a new command - line option , - mplt .
There is also a new configure - time option , -- with - mips - plt , to make - mplt the default .
The new code model requires support from the assembler , the linker , and the runtime C library .
This support is available in binutils 2.19 and GLIBC 2.9 .
GCC can now generate MIPS16 code for 32 - bit GNU / Linux executables and 32 - bit GNU / Linux shared libraries .
This feature requires GNU binutils 2.19 or above .
Support for RMI 's XLR processor is now available through the - march=xlr and - mtune=xlr options .
and options .
64 - bit targets can now perform 128 - bit multiplications inline , instead of relying on a libgcc function .
function .
Native GNU / Linux toolchains now support - march=native and - mtune=native , which select the host processor .
and , which select the host processor .
GCC now supports the R10K , R12K , R14 K and R16K processors .
The canonical - march= and - mtune= names for these processors are r10000 , r12000 , r14000 and r16000 respectively .
and names for these processors are , , and respectively .
GCC can now work around the side effects of speculative execution on R10K processors .
Please see the documentation of the - mr10 k - cache - barrier option for details .
option for details .
Support for the MIPS64 Release 2 instruction set has been added .
The option - march=mips64r2 enables generation of these instructions .
enables generation of these instructions .
GCC now supports Cavium Networks ' Octeon processor .
This support is available through the - march=octeon and - mtune=octeon options .
and options .
GCC now supports STMicroelectronics ' Loongson 2E /2 F processors .
The canonical - march= and - mtune= names for these processors are loongson2e and loongson2 f .
picochip
Picochip is a 16 - bit processor .
A typical picoChip contains over 250 small cores , each with small amounts of memory .
There are three processor variants ( STAN , MEM and CTRL ) with different instruction sets and memory configurations and they can be chosen using the - mae option .
This port is intended to be a " C " only port .
Power Architecture and PowerPC
GCC now supports the e300 c2 , e300c3 and e500 mc processors .
GCC now supports Xilinx processors with a single - precision FPU .
Decimal floating point is now supported for e500 processors .
S/390 , zSeries and System z9/z10
Support for the IBM System z10 EC / BC processor has been added .
When using the - march=z10 option , the compiler will generate code making use of instructions provided by the General - Instruction - Extension Facility and the Execute - Extension Facility .
VxWorks
GCC now supports the thread - local storage mechanism used on VxWorks .
Xtensa
GCC now supports thread - local storage ( TLS ) for Xtensa processor configurations that include the Thread Pointer option .
TLS also requires support from the assembler and linker ; this support is provided in the GNU binutils beginning with version 2.19 .

The Adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland/19
by Michele Simionato
April 21 , 2009
Summary
This is the first of six episodes concerning the R6RS module system .
The module system is quite new and it is the result of several compromises .
As a consequence , it has some rough edge and writing portable code - specially for macro writers - is not always trivial .

The R6RS module system
For nearly 30 years Scheme lived without a standard module system .
The consequences of this omission were the proliferation of dozens of incompatible module systems and neverending debates .
The situation changed with the R6RS report : nowadays Scheme has an official module system , finally .
Unfortunately the official module system is not used by all Scheme implementations , and it is quite possible that some implementation will never support it .
For instance Chicken , a major implementation , just released version 4 , which includes a brand new module system not compatible with the R6RS system .
You should be aware that the module system ( and actually the whole of the R6RS standard ) is controversial , and there are good reasons why it is so .
I cannot do anything about the political issues , but I can do something about the technical issues , by explaining the subtle points and by documenting the most common pitfalls .
It will take me six full episodes to explain the module system and its trickiness , especially for macro writers who want to write portable code .
Modules are not first class objects
Since the title of this series is The Adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland let me begin my excursion about the R6RS module system by contrasting it with the Python module system .
The major difference between Python modules and Scheme modules is that Python modules are first class runtime objects which can be passed and returned from functions , as well as modified and introspected freely ;
Scheme modules , instead , are compile time entities which cannot be imported at runtime , nor passed to functions or returned from functions ; moreover they cannot be modified and cannot be introspected .
Python modules are so flexible because they are basically dictionaries .
It would not be difficult to implement a Python - like module system in Scheme , by making use of hash - tables , the equivalent of dictionaries .
However , the standard module system does not follow this route , because Scheme modules may contain macros which are not first class objects , therefore modules cannot be first class objects themselves [ some may argue that having macros which are not first class objects is the root of all evil , and look for alternative routes with macro - like constructs which are however first class objects ; however , I do not want to open this particular can of worms here ] .
Since Scheme modules are not first class objects it is impossible to add names dynamically to a module , or to replace a binding with another , as in Python .
It is also impossible to get the list of names exported by a module : the only way is to look at the export list in the source code .
It is also impossible to export all the names from a module automatically : one has to list them all explicitly .
In general Scheme is not too strong at introspection , and that it is really disturbing to me since it is an issue that could be easily solved .
For instance , my sweet - macros library provides introspection features , so that you can ask at runtime , for instance from the REPL , what are the patterns and the literals accepted by a macro , its source code and its associated transformer , even if the macro is a purely compile time entity .
It would be perfectly possible to give an introspection API to every imported module .
For instance , every module could automagically define a variable - defined both at runtime and compile time - containing the full list of exported names and there could be some builtin syntax to query the list .
But introspection has been completely neglected by the current standard .
One wonders how Schemers cope with large libraries / frameworks like the ones we use every day in the enterprise world , which export thounsands and thousands of names in hundreds and hundreds of modules .
Let 's hope for something better in the future .
I also want to point out a thing that should be obvious : if you have a Scheme library lib.sls which defines a variable x , and you import it with a prefix lib . , you can access the variable with the Python - like syntax lib.x .
However , lib.x in Scheme means something completely different from lib.x in Python : lib.x in Scheme is just a name with a prefix , whereas lib.x in Python means " take the attribute x of the object lib " and that involves a function call .
In other words , Python must perform an hash table lookup everytime you use the syntax lib.x , whereas Scheme does not need to do so .
I should also points out that usually ( and unfortunately ) in the Scheme world people do not use prefixes ; by default all exported names are imported , just as it is the case for Python when the ( discouraged ) style from lib import * is used .
Compiling Scheme modules vs compiling Python modules
Let me continue my comparison between Python modules and Scheme modules , by comparing the compilation / execution mechanism in the two languages .
I will begin from Python , by giving a simplified description which is however not far from the truth .
When you run a script script .py depending on some library lib.py , the Python interpreter searches fo a bytecode - compiled file lib.pyc , updated with respect to the the source file lib .py ; if it finds it , it imports it , otherwise it compiles the source file on - the - fly , generates a lib.pyc file and imports it .
A bytecompiled file is updated with respect to the source file if it has been generated after the source file ; if you modify the source file , the lib.pyc file becomes outdated : the Python interpreter is smart enough to recognize the issue and to seamlessly recompile lib.pyc .
In Scheme the compilation process is very much implementation - dependent .
Here I will give some example of how things work in three representative R6RS - conforming implementations , Ikarus , Ypsilon and PLT Scheme / mzscheme .
Ikarus has two modes of operation ; by default it just compiles everything from scratch , without using any intermediate file .
This is possible since the Ikarus compiler is very fast .
However , this mechanism does not scale ; if you have very large libraries , it does not make sense to recompile everything every time you add a little script .
Therefore Ikarus ( in the latest development version ) added a mechanism similar to the Python one ; if you have a file script.ss which depends on a library lib.sls and run the command $ ikarus -- compile - dependencies script.ss Serializing " ./lib.sls.ikarus-fasl " ... the compiler will automatically ( re ) generate a precompiled file lib.sls.ikarus - fasl from the source file lib.sls as needed , by looking at the time stamps .
Exactly the same as in Python .
The only difference is that Python compiles to bytecode , whereas Ikarus compile to native code .
Notice that whereas in theory Ikarus should always be much faster of Python , in practice this is not guaranteed : a lot of Python programs are actually calling underlying C libraries , so that Python can be pretty fast in some cases ( for instance in numeric computations using numpy ) .
All I said for Ikarus , can be said from Ypsilon , with minor differences .
Ypsilon compiles to bytecode , like Python .
Precompiled files are automatically generated without the need to specify any flag , as in Python ; however they are stored in a so called auto - compile - cache directory , which by default is situated in $ HOME /. ypsilon .
The location can be changed by setting the environment variable YPSILON_ACC or by passing the -- acc=dir argument to the Ypsilon interpreter .
It is possible to disable the cache and to clear the cache ; if you are curious about the details you should look at the Ypsilon manual ( man ypsilon ) .
PLT Scheme / mzscheme works in a slightly different way .
The command $ plt - r6rs script.ss interprets the script and its dependencies on the fly .
The command $ plt - r6rs -- compile script.ss compiles the script and its dependencies , and stores the compiled file in the collects directory , which on my system is in $ HOME/.plt-scheme/4.1.2/collects .
Each library has its own directory of compiled files .
Compiling is not the same than executing
There are other similarities between a Python ( bytecode ) compiler and a Scheme compiler .
For instance , they are both very permissive , in the sense that they flag very few errors at compile time .
Consider for instance the following Python module : $ cat lib.py x = 1/0
The module contains an obvious error , that in principle should be visible to the ( bytecode ) compiler .
However , the compiler only checks that the module contains syntactically correct Python code , it does not evaluate it , and generates a lib.pyc file without complaining : $ python -m py_compile lib.py # generates lib.pyc without errors
The error will be flagged at runtime , only when you import the module : $ python - c" import lib " Traceback ( most recent call last ) : File " < string > " , line 1 , in < module >
File " lib.py " , line 1 , in < module > x = 1/0 ZeroDivisionError : integer division or modulo by zero R6RS Scheme uses a similar model .
Consider for instance the library $ echo lib.sls #!r6rs ( library ( lib ) ( export x ) ( import ( rnrs ) ) ( define x ( / 1 0 ) ) ) and the script $ echo script.ss ( import ( rnrs ) ( lib ) )
You can compile the script and the library without seeing any error : $ plt -r6rs -- compile script.ss [ Compiling ./script.ss ] [ Compiling ./.plt-scheme/4.1.2/collects/lib/main.sls ]
Running the script however raises an error : $ plt - r6rs script.ss /: division by zero Like in Python , the error is raised when the module is imported ( the technical name in Scheme is instantiated ) .
However , there is a gray area of the R6RS module system here , and implementations are free to not import unused modules .
To my knowledge , Ikarus is the only implementation making using of this freedom .
If you run $ ikarus -- r6rs - script script.ss no error is raised .
Ikarus is just visiting the module , i.e. taking notes of the names exported by it and of the dependencies , but the module is not evaluated , because it is not used .
However , if you use it , for instance if you try to access the x variable , you will get the division error at runtime : $ echo script.ss ( import ( rnrs ) ( prefix ( lib ) lib : ) ) ( begin ( display " running ...
" ) ( display lib : x ) ) $ ikarus -- r6rs - script script.ss Unhandled exception : Condition components : 1 . &assertion 2 . &who : / 3 . &message : " division by 0 " 4 . &irritants : ()
Here I have used an import prefix lib : , just to be more explicit .
Another difference between Ikarus and PLT is that in PLT both the script and the library are compiled , whereas in Ikarus only the library is compiled .
In the next episodes we will see many other examples of differences between R6RS - conforming implementations .
Acknowledgments
All the Adventures have my name at the top and I take full responsibility for the opinions and the mistakes .
But for the parts which are correct , I deserve little credit , since most of the time I am just reporting advice which I have received from the Scheme community , mostly from comp.lang .scheme and ikarus-users , as well from private emails .
This is true for all of my Adventures , but especially for the six episodes about the module system you are about to read .
I was very ignorant about the module system when I started this project , and this work would not have been possible without the help of Abdulaziz Ghuloum , Derick Eddington , Will Clinger , Eli Barzilay , Matthew Flatt , André van Tolder and many others .

The growing row over diffuser designs in Formula 1 appears to be heading for a showdown protest at the Australian Grand Prix , with the FIA saying it is now too late to resolve the matter before the start of the season .
The designs of the diffusers on the Brawn , Toyota and Williams have led to questions from rival teams , who think the trio are unfairly using a bigger diffuser than was originally intended by the regulations .
So far the FIA has said that it believes the designs are within the wording of the regulations , but the matter has moved up a gear with at least one team believed to have written to the governing body to state its belief that the design is illegal .
Now , FIA president Max Mosley has said that he thinks the matter can only be sorted out in Australia - because it is too late to organise a formal hearing before the first race .
In an interview with The Daily Telegraph on Saturday , Mosley said : " It 's a very clever device and you can make a very good case for saying that it 's legal and a very good case for saying that it 's illegal .
It 's going to be difficult .
" What 's actually happened is that teams are saying ' We think it 's illegal for this and this reason . '
" If there had been more time before the detailed objections to the system were sent in , I would probably have sent it to the FIA Court of Appeal before Australia .
And actually I have given thought to that this week .
But there is n't time .
It would n't be fair .
I think the thing will probably come to some sort of a head in Australia . "
The most likely outcome from the current situation is that one or more teams may choose to lodge a protest at the first race of the season - either once scrutineering has taken place on Thursday or after the finish of the race .
Mosley added : " One possibility is that all the teams agree that it is illegal , and therefore all the teams should n't have it from Barcelona .
But then those teams who say it is legal will say ' Why should we do that ? '
And those that say it 's illegal will say ' Why should we lose an advantage for four races ? '
" And so probably what will happen is it will end up going to the stewards , who will make a decision .
That will almost certainly be appealed by whichever side is disadvantaged .
And then that will go to our Court of Appeal and be hammered out .
" It 's not straightforward .
I have an open mind on it at the moment - I can see it going either way .
I really can .
But somebody has to make their mind up and fortunately it 's not my job . "

Time Warner Stops Pay - As - Use Internet Tests
Time Warner Cable said today it will stop testing a new pricing model where customers were being charged for how much Internet bandwidth they used after public uproar against the billing practice .
The cable television and Internet service provider was testing the consumption - based service in Beaumont , Texas and planned to launch similar experiments in Rochester , Austin , San Antonio and Greensboro , N.C .
In the experiment , users were offered various price plans based on how much data they consumed and for various access speeds .
And like some cell phone minute plans , users were charged more when they went over their monthly allotment , Time Warner said .
The company said that bandwidth on its network was being consumed disproportionately by a small group of users .
To prevent charging all customers more for all - you - can - use plans , the best solution was to charge heavy users more , Time Warner said .
Public interest groups and Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) complained that such practices would hurt consumers .
Users could end up paying more for Web use , and they might limit use at a time when more applications have lured people to the Web .
" It is clear from the public response over the last two weeks that there is a great deal of misunderstanding about our plans to roll out additional tests on consumption based billing , " said Time Warner Cable chief executive Glenn Britt .
" As a result , we will not proceed with implementation of additional tests until further consultation with our customers and other interested parties , ensuring that community needs are being met . "
Free Press , a public advocacy group that launched an online campaign against Time Warner 's practices last week , said such billing practices are unrealistic as more people use the Web and as applications like video are data intensive .
They believe network operators should not be able to limit the use of consumers .
" Let this be a lesson to other Internet service providers looking to head down a similar path , " said Timothy Karr , campaign director for Free Press .
" Consumers are not going to stand idly by as companies try to squeeze their use of the Internet .
This is a major victory , but the fight for a fast , open and affordable Internet is far from over . "

An ice bridge linking two Islands in Antarctica has snapped according to scientists .
They say this is evidence of rapid change in the region , and that it could mean the Wilkins Ice Shelf is breaking away .
The ice bridge was an important barrier which held the Wilkins Ice Shelf in place .
Without the bridge , Charcot and Latady islands are free to move into the open ocean .
European Space Agency satellite pictures revealed cracks in the bridge last week .
This video shows when the Wilkins Shelf first came under threat of breaking due to the break of the icebridge connecting the Wilkins Shelf to Latady and Charcot
Recently formed icebergs were shown floating into the western side of the peninsula and out to sea .
The peninsula juts up from Antarctica towards the southern tip of South America .
According to a Glaciologist with the British Antarctic Survey who placed a GPS tracker on the ice bridge in January , this breakage has been expected for a few weeks .
He says it was very likely that the ice shelf was to follow .
The breakage is floating and will therefore not affect sea levels directly , it does heighten concerns over the impact of climate change on this peninsula of Antarctica .
Separate research indicates that after ice shelves move , glaciers and landed ice begin to make their way towards the ocean more rapidly .
The glaciers and landed ice are the center of an ongoing scientific debate as to whether this movement increases sea levels .

Logo design in today ’s world is totally under rated .
People do not understand how important a good logo is and how valuable it is to their business .
In this article I am going to outline the ways in which you should NOT go about getting your logo designed … that is , if you are truly serious about business .
What is a logo ?
To understand what a logo is meant to do , we first must know what a logo is .
A logo ’s design is for immediate recognition , inspiring trust , admiration , loyalty and an implied superiority .
The logo is one aspect of a company ’s commercial brand , or economic entity , and its shapes , colours , fonts , and images usually are different from others in a similar market .
Logos are also used to identify organizations and other non-commercial entities .
It makes me wonder why people have no logo or why they would even bother with a cheap logo design if a logo is meant to do all of these things ?
Logo design contests
The worst deal you could probably go for is a logo design contest .
Logo design contests are where you give a brief and then you have multiple designers come back to you with their designs .
Although this sounds like a mighty good deal , the quality is usually far from anything you would want to represent your business .
You will be wasting your money and in the long term , in terms of damage done to your business , that amount could be quite considerable .
On another note , design contests & designers who design on a speculative basis are damaging the design industry as designers should not have to invest time and resources with no guarantee of payment .
If you want further proof , read these articles : Logo Design Contests Are Bad For Business or The Reality of Logo Design Contests .
Too good to be true deals
If you do a search on ‘ logo design ’ on google you will find many businesses offering logo designs for very cheap and unbelievable prices .
Such deals as “ 5 design concepts from 5 designers ! ” or “ 6 logos from 5 designers only $ 200 ” – Stay away !
These deals are extremely deceiving and the quality is far from satisfactory .
Have you ever wondered how much thought they actually put into your logo design ?
Professional logo designers have a strict logo design process that can take weeks or in some cases months to complete a logo .
They may offer you a result within 24 hours or maybe even less meaning literally no thought was put into your logo design .
Stock imagery
Some so called “ designers ” ( usually the same people who enter design contests ) steal images from stock sites to design your logo … or in some cases business owners download and use the stock images themselves .
This is a huge no - no .
Did you know that stock imagery gets downloaded by thousands of people ?
This should be reason enough not to use stock imagery as your logo .
If you do this , other people will have access to your logo design and can and will use it in places that will potentially devalue your business .
Ensure your logo design is original .
Do it yourself logo design
Closely linked to the stock imagery scenario above , business owners or those wanting a logo will try to do it themselves .
I highly recommend against this and suggest you leave the design to a professional , much as you would leave your dental work to a dentist .
Free logo makers
You will find many free online logo makers on the web .
Not only do these logos look unprofessional , hundreds of other people could have the same logo as you and what is the point of that ?
These logos have no thought , concept or memorability about them , they are merely symbols .
They say nothing about your business and do nothing that a logo is supposed to do …
I repeat , stay away from free logo makers .
Getting a design without feedback
Before approving and implementing a design , ensure you get feedback from your clients , peers , and stakeholders .
Getting feedback on a design is a crucial part of the logo design process as it ensures that your logo is going to be successful .
Take these poor phallic logo designs above .
I wonder if they realized their logos had such hidden meaning ?
Ensure you do n’t turn out like this by getting a professionally designed logo .
What is the cost of a professional logo design ?
The cost of a professional logo design is a question that cannot be easily answered as every company has different needs , however , the best way to approach this problem is to draw up a customized quote for each individual .
A number of factors have to be taken into consideration when designing a logo , such as how many logo concepts need to be presented , how many revisions are required , how much research is needed , the size of the business and so on .
To wrap up , I ’d like to quote a comparison by David Airey : Comparing the design industry to any other is by no means exact , but the , “ How much for a logo ? ” question is kind of like asking an estate agent , “ How much for a house ? ” .

Крутые кадры .
Но эталонным про охоту на мигрирующих сардин я считаю кадр , снятый Дагом Перрином .
По -моему с ним он победил на Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2004 .
Насколько я помню он тоже снимал у восточного побережья ЮАР , а кадр назывался Bronze Whalers Charging a Bailtball .
Я думаю вы знаете эту работу .
Идеальная !
И чувство опасности передается и композиция интересная , с перспективой , и сюжет , и , конечно , удача сопутствовала ...
В общем , что там говорить ...
Надеюсь и вам когда - нибудь выпадет удача снять уникальнейший кадр .
Мастерство у вас есть ! :)
Да , кадр Sailfish in the bait ball - самый сильный в вашей серии .
ИМХО .
И самый офигенный в принципе .
ИМХО - ИМХО . :)
Я бы себе отпечаток такого кадра в хорошем размере - повесил бы на стену на видном месте .
Прям с большим удовольствием ! :)
Это как -то можно осуществить ?
Our intuition , going back forever , is that to move , say , a rock , one has to touch that rock , or touch a stick that touches the rock , or give an order that travels via vibrations through the air to the ear of a man with a stick that can then push the rock — or some such sequence .
This intuition , more generally , is that things can only directly affect other things that are right next to them .
If A affects B without being right next to it , then the effect in question must be indirect — the effect in question must be something that gets transmitted by means of a chain of events in which each event brings about the next one directly , in a manner that smoothly spans the distance from A to B .
Every time we think we can come up with an exception to this intuition — say , flipping a switch that turns on city street lights ( but then we realize that this happens through wires ) or listening to a BBC radio broadcast ( but then we realize that radio waves propagate through the air ) — it turns out that we have not , in fact , thought of an exception .
Not , that is , in our everyday experience of the world .
[ Our dear friend and colleague Thomas Peters has offered us these reflections on his injury and recovery process , and asked that we share them with our readers .
We 're only too happy to do so .
Please continue to pray with us for Thomas , his wife , and all his family and friends .
- Eds . ]
On a Friday in July I awoke in the early morning hours to someone beating on my back with their fists .
I was lying on a bed in a place I did not recognize and I was in excruciating pain .
It was a kind of pain I had never experienced before and did not understand .
There was a tube down my throat and my body felt incomplete , as if much of it was missing .
I came to realize in the hours that followed , the man beating on my back with his fists was a nurse , and he was trying to dislodge some of the fluid that was filling up my lungs as the result of the diving accident I had sustained three days previously , an accident that had fractured my fifth vertebrae and had given me a severe spinal cord injury , an injury that has changed the course of my life forever .
I have no memory of the accident itself .
By God 's grace , someone spotted me floating face - down in the water and started dragging me to the shore .
Had I not been seen , I would have surely died .
By God 's grace , I was injured on one of the only two days of the year when a group of EMTs gathered less than a mile away for training , so I received prompt medical care for my drowning damage .
Had it not been that particular day , help would have been about twenty minutes away and I would have sustained brain damage .
And by God 's grace there was a field nearby large enough for a rescue helicopter to land and transport me to the University of Maryland Medical Center 's Shock Trauma Center , the best unit of its kind in North America .
Had I not received the benefit of the best possible care so soon , my recovery would have been unalterably impaired .
Recovery was , and is , hard .
It took six weeks to patch me up to a medically stable position suitable enough to transfer me to a rehabilitation center in Washington , D.C.
For six weeks in Baltimore , nurses and doctors battled infections and secretions to heal the damage my lungs had suffered from ingesting filthy water .
I was placed in a metal halo in an effort to save my fractured vertebrae .
And when that effort ultimately failed , I underwent a two - day surgery to replace the damaged vertebrae with a titanium cage .
The surgeons also fused my fourth and sixth vertebrates to strengthen my neck .
I was intubated , given a tracheotomy , re-intubated , and put back on the tracheotomy .
A steady stream of friends and family visited me during this time to lift my spirits and to share tears and smiles .
But no one was more faithful than my wife Natalie ; she did not leave my side my entire time in the Intensive Care Unit .
A major accident is an invitation to both physical and spiritual recovery .
I have never felt God 's presence as much as I do since the accident .
People will say that accidents like mine should call into question God 's mercy or even His existence .
But for me , the fact that I survived my injury is the greatest evidence I have ever experienced of God 's mercy and providence .
I believe God allowed my accident to happen and that He chose to help me survive that accident and every day gives me the opportunity to be blessed through it .
The accident has taught me the essential value defended by the principle of subsidiarity : the value of family and friends as the first line of defense when things go badly .
My family and friends have come forward to help my wife and I in ways that have taken our breadth away .
They brought us meals , helped pack and move our home , loaned us their cars , contributed their professional advice like how to plan our financial future and cover medical expenses , they have organized prayer groups for us , designed wristbands to help remind people to pray for us and offered us gifts so generous I have had to firmly say no because they are simply too much .
The man is never poor or alone who has good friends .
My wife and I simply could not gave survived this were it not for our dear family and friends .
The accident has taught me more about the incredible gift of marriage .
My father , during his speech at my wedding reception , said the sacrament of marriage gives us the grace to do the impossible .
I have met people during these months who think it is incredible , even impossible , that my wife and I survived a trauma like this having been married only three months .
I tell them it helps to marry the right woman and get married the right way , the way the Church taught the two of us what marriage is and why it should be honored .
People have told us that they are inspired and receive hope from the witness of our marriage – it inspires us too , I respond !
We feel it is possible to face anything , even a future of me paralyzed , so long as we cling to each other , to God , and to our marriage vows .
The accident has taught me to be more humble and realistic about my own efforts and contributions .
Before my accident I took pride in my self - reliance , and my ability to contribute to the causes I care about , and I still do , but since the accident I have gained a far greater appreciation for the fact that everything I do and am is because of the Lord .
I certainly did n't bring myself back from the brink of death and , as a wise priest told me , my prayers and sacrifices these weeks and months have done more to aid the causes of life , marriage and religious freedom than anything I wrote , said or did to promote these prior to the accident .
But make no mistake , as soon as I am able , I am coming back to fight harder than ever for all of these things because I know now that it is prayer that makes the warrior his strongest .
The accident has taught me that I am a work still in progress and anything I do achieve is for God 's glory .
I completed my term of inpatient rehabilitation this week and the hard work of learning to live on my own again ( with the tremendous help of my wife ) has just begun , as has grueling outpatient therapy to regain more of the strength and muscle systems I have lost .
The vast , vast majority of individuals with my injury never walk again , but there remain signs that I could beat these long odds , and I have been praying to St. Jude for such a miracle .
The majority of individuals with an injury like mine never regain the use of their hands - I have had to write these reflections using a knuckle of my right pinky on a touchscreen , if you can believe it .
But through the intercession of St. Francis , I am recovering some finger function in my left hand .
There are troubling signs that my life will forever be plagued with neuropathic pain , but as I have learned , pain can be offered up and need not inhibit living a good and worthy life .
In the coming months , I will be focusing on prayer , reflection and recovery , and then we will know more about what the future holds .
I do n't quite remember how it began , but during one of the many sleepless nights spent in the Baltimore ICU , unsure of what that night and the next day would hold , I was inspired by the example of Samuel in the Old Testament , and began quietly saying to God , " Speak , Lord , your servant is listening . "
This remains my prayer .
I do not know what the future holds .
But I do know that as long as I have breadth , and with whatever limbs and muscles I can move , I will strive to serve the Lord and do His will .
What else is a life for ?

With the recent release of new torture memos , and the news that Obama is n’t entirely ruling out prosecutions , it ’s important to remember just how widespread America ’s use of torture has been .
This video footage was taken of Abu Ghraib during its final days in 2006 , after the prisoners left but before it was torn down , and evidence of the camp was buried and burned .
While not as dramatic as hundreds of rounds of waterboarding , the abuse outside interrogation rooms was another cog in the torture machine .
The thousands of detainees living in the sprawling tents were kept in squalid conditions , exposed to the elements and mortar fire .
The soldiers who filmed this tape point out the outdoor segregation cells where detainees were kept and deprived of sleep — even years after the Bush administration said the camp had been cleaned of any abusive practices .
Abu Ghraib has closed , but these two matter - of - fact video tours remind us what it was like .
That chapter in American history is not over .
A Journal front - pager recently noted an Arizona man charged with attacking a freeway speed camera with a pick ax .
Here 's the rest of the story :
He was fined $ 3,500 , not given a parade .
But do n't despair .
We still live in a democracy .
One Arizona sheriff recently proved you could get elected by opposing speed cameras .
Meanwhile , the state legislature is considering bills to dismantle the system created by Gov. Janet Napolitano when she faced a gaping budget deficit , before she escaped to the Obama Department of Homeland Security .
Petitioners in Arizona are also gathering signatures to put the question directly before voters -- speed cameras have never won when submitted to voters .
Even the Scottsdale City Council recently voted not to oppose the anti-camera bills in the state legislature .
Why is this important ?
Because Arizona , specifically Scottsdale , is home to the two biggest companies , American Traffic Solutions and Redflex Traffic Systems , in the incestuous world of promoting and operating traffic cameras for revenue - hungry governments .
Laid to rest long ago should have been the pretense that the goal is " safety , " not chasing cash .
New York State , sinking under budget shortfalls , last week authorized a batch of new red - light cameras around the state .
A recent investigation by the Detroit News showed that even conventional ticket - writing is driven by revenue needs .
Said one cop : " When you 're being told how many tickets you need to write , to me that 's a quota . "
President Barack Obama will seek $ 83.4 billion in additional “ emergency ” funding for the American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , which if approved would bring the 2009 funding to around $ 150 billion and the overall costs of the two wars to nearly $ 1 trillion .
The use of emergency funding requests to avoid putting the war ’s costs in the overall military budget was a tactic which Obama was a harsh critic of when the Bush Administration practiced it , and already some Congressmen are criticizing the new president for adopting the same “ off the books ” tactic as he continues to fight the same wars .
The request is in addition to the $ 534 billion military budget the administration unveiled earlier in the week .
That budget was for fiscal 2010 , and was an increase over 2009 .
In February the first Obama budget proposal was made public , and he made a point of the importance of putting the war funding “ on the books ” at the time .
Despite today ’s request and the seemingly low - ball estimates in the proposed budgets , spokesman Robert Gibbs insists “ this will be the last supplemental ” the administration will bring forward to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Rep. Lynn Woolsey , among the critics of the request , says it “ will deepen and expand our military presence in Afghanistan indefinitely , ” and that “ it will prolong our occupation of Iraq through at least the end of 2011 . ”
The Obama Administration intends to keep up to 50,000 troops in Iraq indefinitely .
Is there an opportunity for a MVNO in Africa ?
In the last 3 months , it ’s been twice that I have been made this question .
As written previously in the post “ Want to become an MVNO ? ” , anyone willing to penetrate the mobile market space can become ( theoretically speaking ) a virtual operator closing agreements at a technical and regulatory levels to start utilizing the existing networks of incumbent operators .
Anywhere ?
What about Africa ?
That is the question .
Worldwide , MVNOs have come across as the new breed of operators which are expected to solve all of the problems faced by traditional network operators :
Slowing subscriber growth , lack of consumer segmentation , and excess network capacity .
However , in Africa , network operators face a different set of problems .
Most markets are experiencing pent - up demand , customer segmentation has only started to be a buzz word , and capacity is scarce .
So seemingly , there is little need for MVNO in this region , since major network operators have yet to lose their dominant position and “ make room ” for any operator , let alone a virtual one .
Nonetheless , the sheer scale of demand for mobile telephony is a healthy indicator that MVNOs in Africa may not be too far behind .
Western European and North American markets were the first to welcome MVNOs in 2002 .
The reason for their success in these markets stems from the fact that traditional network operators , with their homogenous marketing campaigns , began to falter in 2002 –2003 , resulting in single - digit growth rates for the country as a whole .
Recognizing this , regulators in these markets have sought to introduce alternative players in order to spur growth , infuse competition , and increase the level of choice available to consumers .
Besides the regulatory push , network operators are also willing to embrace virtual competition to ( a ) utilize spare capacity available on their networks and ( b ) generate an additional revenue stream for their shareholders in times of slowing growth .
As postulated by Pyramid research , the dynamics of telecoms markets in Africa pose a completely different proposition .
First , subscriber growth in the region is at record levels , with individual countries recording triple - digit growth in many instances ( e.g. , Algeria and Nigeria ) .
At YE2004 , Africa ’s total mobile subscriptions stood at about 84 m ; this corresponds to a 54 percent growth over 2003 .
Pyramid Research estimates operators in the region to have closed out 2005 with 142 m subscriptions ( a 68 percent increase over 2004 ) .
Secondly , with less foreign investment flowing into the region ’s telecoms markets ( compared to investments made in the markets of Western Europe and North America ) , network operator capacity is generally stretched to the limit , resulting quite frequently in poor call quality , high drop call rates , and poor call completion rates .
Thirdly , and more importantly , prepaid ARPS are dropping fast , with most markets showcasing prepaid ARPS below US$ 10 and some even below US $ 6 per month .
At such ARPS levels , MVNOs cease to become a viable option for growth , as the marginal subscribers they are expected to add will showcase an even weaker tendency to spend on mobile telephony than existing subscribers .
Despite all the hurdles and obstacles currently impeding the entry of MVNOs in the region , we believe virtual operators in Africa can potentially play a substantial role in fostering uptake and usage in the market while co-existing with traditional network operators .
Please take a look at the following presentation to understand why .
Best regards .

Carl Richards of the Behavior Gap blog paddles the bad ideas of " average returns " in an enlightening post on investing .
He also explains why it 's a great time to jump in , if you 're young .

In companion posts at the Get Rich Slowly and I Will Teach You To Be Rich blogs , Richards explains how relying on the glossy brochures and short - hand financial language of " average returns " can lead anyone astray .
It 's obvious to anyone living in the U.S. right now that the market has some pretty off years , of course , but Richards ' explanations help really kill off the idea that one can time a graceful cash - out at a pre-determined point , and show how getting in now , if you 're young and have years to contribute , could really help .
The walk - away points from his I Will Teach You post :
9 ) Because every person has unique savings and withdrawal goals , real financial planning can not be done as a one - size - fits - all solution .
10 ) Understanding that average is not normal should result in the realization that real financial planning is a process of setting a course and then making the small course corrections as we deal with the random nature of returns .

Do n’t Suspect a Friend , Report Him !
As most of us know , Kansas City , Missouri is a haven for international and domestic terrorists .
Pakistan and Afghanistan are small potatoes compared to this insurgency stomping ground .
The kooks who tend to flourish in Missouri are young , law - abiding liberty - seekers who advocate Ron Paul ’s limited - government ideas ; third - party proponents who supported Bob Barr ’s presidential bid ; and constitutionalists who stand behind Chuck Baldwin ’s push to inform the masses of the menace posed by our unconstitutional government .
Recently , a Freeman in Missouri pointed out a website to me that he saw advertised on the local tube : PrepareMetro KC .
The purpose of the website - courtesy of the Metropolitan Emergency Managers Committee - is to convince the comfortably numb among the masses that they can “ help detect and prevent terrorism . ” 
The website reports :
Terrorist operations begin with extensive planning .
You can help prevent and detect terrorism — and other types of crime — by watching out for suspicious activities and reporting them to the proper authorities .
Watch for the Seven Signs of Terrorism :
* Surveillance
* Seeking Information
* Testing Security
* Acquiring Supplies
* Suspicious Behavior
* Trial Runs
* Getting into Position
The Metropolitan Emergency Managers Committee is kind enough to include a video version of “  Identifying Terrorists for Dummies . ” 
In the video , actors play out the seven signs so you can learn what a terrorist looks like .
Accordingly , “ anything out of the ordinary ”  is deemed a “ possible terrorist plot or threat , ”  and it is stressed that such abnormal behavior must be seriously assessed and investigated .
At 3:55 of the propaganda production , a jogger runs by a man on a park bench writing in his notepad .
I looked for signs of grenades , big ole bombs ‘ neath the bench , or an assemblage of scary - looking darkies toting box cutters in the background , but no such thing is apparent .
However , since spending time alone to write in a notepad outdoors is a highly suspicious , deviant , and subversive activity , the jogger , disturbed by the sinister notebook , stops to pull out her cell phone and call the police .
She ’s being a good girl , executing the kind of response the chief fearmongers desire from a model citizen .
This stuff is like chicken soup for the loyalist soul .
We ’re all Soviet snitches now .

Whenever my father would see this sort of thing cropping up , on TV , in ads , or in the general attitude of the populace , he would remark , in a tone of repugnance , “ We are a nation of helpless idiots . ”
Thus I developed the ability to discern the sensible from the absurd while growing up .
The propagandists who dream up these lame security alerts circulate the idea that none of us are ever safe because there are terrorists everywhere , and thus we , the loyal citizenry , must be aptly trained so that we may detect the telltale signs of the guerrillas among us .
And the perception that these propaganda campaigns attempt to implant is that our greatest threat is domestic terrorism .
They may be our friends , neighbors , the plumber - a lone guy on a park bench - or the church member who insists on homeschooling his kids .
Either way , we need to learn how to ferret out those seditious types and report them to the Proper Authorities .
Among my favorite disinformation campaigns are the interminable announcements that blare from the foghorns in government airport terminals .
“ REPORT ANY SUSPICIOUS PERSONS OR ACTIVITY …REPORT ANY UNATTENDED BAGS…REPORT ANY STARBUCKS CUP OR SLICE OF PIZZA CRUST LEFT UNATTENDED … ”  Report , report , report .
Tell , tell , tell .
So why airports ?
Since airplanes have become flying Greyhound buses , and airports have become ground zero for the dumbed - down lumpen proletariat , the listenership at airports is ripe for inane propaganda .
In a place where people are herded like cattle and searched like criminals , it ’s not hard to break down their already unenlightened state and further melt their mindset toward a helpless condition .
Similar to the military recipe for breaking down individuality , Homeland Security ’s TSA aims to break down any resistance they may face from any individual .
Because you have to be somewhere and have little or no alternative to flying on a quasi - governmental Greyhound bus , and because you must pass
Go before you collect your $ 200 , you have no choice but to enter through the TSA ’s turnstiles of terror .
At this point , people are intimidated and uncertain , which leads them to look for something that provides comfort .
So the TSA goons ensure you they are working to help you , protect you , and keep you safe .
They scare you , make small talk with you , and then pretend to secure you .
So suddenly , people feel better and the feelings move from being intimidated to granting approval and thanks .
The psychology of the process is quite simple and rather perverted , but it works on the majority of the herd .
The government ’s anti-terrorist propaganda seeks not to dumb down the populace , but to convince people that they are already dumb , helpless , and uninformed , and so its purpose to “ pull them up ”  through its awareness campaigns that enlighten one from the level of boob to educated informant .
Moving to such heights does wonders for the self - esteem of idiots .
As much as the state perpetuates this nonsense and the scaremongering in order to keep the masses in favor of its “ protection ” ( thus paving the way for the funding and expansion of government ) , remember that whenever the government - either federal , state , or local - plants the ideas of “ everywhere and always there are terrorists , ” there are willing citizens who voluntarily latch on to these ideas and take great pleasure in promoting and spreading that mentality .
Behind the federalized Homeland Security operation there lies an abundance of state , county , and local autocrats who are more than happy to adopt and spread the message of fear and the necessity of state security .
Their rewards are power , position , and monetary gain .
On top of that , the majority of the masses who are being sold the security message are willingly - and often enthusiastically - buying the government ’s prescription .
The tyranny of the masses is , and has been , a significant apparatus for serving the government in its crusade toward a totalitarian agenda .
As long as the majority of the people are so passive as to welcome the government ’s false sense of security , it will have an audience to which it can market its duplicitous spin .
And when those same people accept the propaganda as meaningful and necessary , they grant it legitimacy and engender its growth .

This man published " Principles of Political Economy and Taxation " in 1817 .
In it , he justified low pay and proposed the " iron law of wages , " which said that if wages were left to the laws of supply and demand , they would fall to near subsistence level .

This man was a factory owner that believed a person 's character was formed by the effects of their environment .
As a result , he refused to mistreat his employees like many of his colleagues .
He published " The Formation of Character " and " A New View of Society " and his cooperative philosophy influenced several worker 's movements and played an important role in establishing the Grand National Conslidated Trade Union in 1834 .

This political theory was a backlash to laissez faire capitalism .
In it the government owns and operates the major means of production and distribution , determines the needs of the people , and plans the economy .

The Civil Union Bill ( HB 2234 ) has been scheduled for a hearing in the Youth and Family Committee this week on Thursday , March 5 , 2009 at 9:00 a.m. in Springfield .
If the bill is voted out of committee , it becomes eligible for a vote before the full Illinois House of Representatives .
This bill will legalize civil unions in the state of Illinois , and will treat such civil unions with the same legal obligations , responsibilities , protections and benefits as are afforded within marriage .
In other words , civil unions will be different in name only from marriage .
As has already been seen in Massachusetts , this will empower the public schools to begin teaching this lifestyle to our young children regardless of parental requests otherwise .
It will also create grounds for rewriting all social mores ; the current push in Massachusetts is to recognize and legalize all transgender rights ( An individual in Massachusetts can now change their drivers license to the gender they believe themselves to be , regardless of actual gender , which means that confused men and women are now legally entering one another 's bathrooms and locker rooms .
What kind of a safety issue is this for our children ? ) .
Furthermore , while the bill legalizes civil unions , it will be used in the courts to show discrimination and will ultimately lead to court mandated same - sex marriages .
To help defeat this bill , please call your state representative and state senator and ask that they support traditional marriage and vote against the civil unions bill .
If you are unsure who your legislators are , please see the link at the end of this email .
Also , please take a moment and call the following members of the Youth and Family Committee to encourage them to vote no on this bill .
We need 4 votes to keep it from passing out of the committee .
And - as always , please pass this on to all who believe in protecting our families and our children .
If you are interested in attending the hearing , it will be held on Thursday , March 5th at 9:00 a.m. in Springfield in Room 122B of the Capitol Building ( I can give you directions to the Capitol Building if needed ) .

According to Time Warner Cable 's most recent annual report , the company has largely rolled out DOCSIS 2.0 across its hybrid fiber - coax network and " plans to deploy DOCSIS 3.0 selectively in its systems during 2009 , which will enable TWC to deliver speeds significantly faster than currently achievable . "
But will it ?
Alex Dudley , the company 's vice president of public relations , has been tweeting like a madman recently , most of his tweets naturally concerning the data cap issue .
When Stacey Higginbotham of GigaOm asked Dudley if the DOCSIS 3.0 rollouts were going ahead apart from the data cap trials , the response was surprisingly pointed — " it was scheduled as part of cbb [ consumption - based billing ] trial , but we all know how you feel about that . "
Ooh , snarktastic !
( Also , it 's not the shrewdest thing a top PR man could say about an issue that has , over the last few weeks , attracted the attention of the grassroots , the press , the city of Rochester , and members of both houses of Congress .
One thinks of disgraced Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich , who asked the court for permission to jet off to Costa Rica so that he could take part in a reality show called I'm a Celebrity , Get Me Out of Here !.
The judge overseeing the case said , " I do n't think this defendant in all honesty ... fully understands the position he finds himself in . " )
So is TWC threatening to take its DOCSIS 3.0 upgrades and go home without consumption - based billing ?
Who knows .
In later messages , Dudley referenced his " flip but true " response and clarified a bit , saying that DOCSIS 3.0 has n't necessarily been scrapped .
The issue is " just that the rollout was scheduled with the trial and now all of it is on hold . "
No DOCSIS 3.0 for now , then , while TWC comes up with some other deployment plan .
He asserts over and over again that this is about money , and that the company needs more cash to upgrade its networks .
When commentators pointed out that the company 's broadband profits are going up even as expenses drop , the response was simply , " For now it is a very nice business ... what we 're saying is that we 're seeing changes in it , and we want to make sure we keep up . "
Luckily for TWC , one of the big expenses of " keeping up " — the actual DOCSIS 3.0 headend cards and new cable modems — are relatively cheap .
We 've seen estimates of $ 20 - 100 per customer , an easy expense to amortize , especially when pulling in " triple play " revenue ( cable , phone , Internet ) from subscribers .
TWC 's main argument appears to be that , as bandwidth use rises , its costs go up — hence the fairness of consumption - based billing .
But the DOCSIS 3.0 upgrades are generally fixed costs , and the internal TWC network is assuredly fiber optic already , so where do the extra fees come in ?
One obvious place to look is in TWC 's connections to other networks , necessary to pass its customers ' traffic along the Internet .
Because of TWC 's size , much of this traffic is likely to be peered with other large ISPs , costing the companies nothing ( once the link is set up ) .
But TWC also pays " transit " costs to other networks with which it does not have peering arrangements , and these links do cost money .
How much ?
The company 's 2008 annual report appears to contain the answer .
Page 83 has a chart showing TWC 's contractual arrangements for 2009 , and what the chart makes clear is just how little the company pays for bandwidth .
" Programming purchases , " which makes up the bulk of the contracted expenses , refers to cable TV programming .
Although TWC had to build an entire infrastructure to make cable TV work , pay these massive yearly fees for content , hire technicians , and do truck rolls , it still makes money on cable service .
With that infrastructure in place , offering data services like VoIP and Internet access is relatively cheap .
And both are getting cheaper — as the company says in its annual report , " High - speed data costs decreased primarily due to a decrease in per- subscriber connectivity costs , partially offset by growth in subscribers and usage per subscriber . "
VoIP costs for TWC 's digital phone service dropped ( per person ) due to a " decline in per- subscriber connectivity costs due to volume discounts received in 2008 . "
When we look at the breakdown on the chart , TWC Internet bandwidth contracts in 2009 are actually 10 times less than those for its digital phone service , and are one of the smallest expenses on the chart .
TWC keeps saying that it needs to do a better job educating customers about the need for the new billing system , and that educational initiative appears to have begun with advocacy by faux consumer groups .
Not an auspicious start .
TWC officials have been reluctant to speak plainly with the press , content to keep asserting huge future expenses and uncontrollable costs .
But the company 's own numbers show that broadband costs are dropping even as traffic surges 40 - 50 percent a year .
Internet bandwidth costs are miniscule .
DOCSIS 3.0 upgrades are cheap .
Something does n't add up .
( New York ) - Rwandan rebel forces , government army soldiers , and their allies have raped at least 90 women and girls since late January 2009 in the volatile North and South Kivu provinces of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo , Human Rights Watch said today .
The Rwandan rebel forces have also been implicated in the deaths of most of the 180 civilians killed during this period .
The United Nations Security Council will discuss on April 9 the latest report by the UN secretary - general on the peacekeeping force in Congo .
Human Rights
Watch called on the UN Security Council to press the Congolese government to remove human rights abusers from its armed forces and end rights violations , including attacks against women and girls .
The Rwandan Hutu militia called the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda ( FDLR ) attacked and burned dozens of villages and towns in Masisi and Lubero territories ( North Kivu ) as well as in Kalehe territory ( South Kivu ) in recent weeks , committing numerous deliberate killings , rapes , and acts of looting .
Blaming government military operations , the FDLR deliberately targeted civilians , used them as human shields , and accused civilians of having betrayed them .
According to witnesses and victims interviewed by Human Rights Watch , the FDLR have been implicated in the killings of at least 154 civilians since January 23 .
" The FDLR are deliberately killing and raping Congolese civilians as apparent punishment for the military operations against them , " said Anneke Van Woudenberg , senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch .
" Both the fighters who commit such horrific acts and the rebel commanders who permit them are responsible for war crimes . "
The FDLR were temporarily pushed out of their military positions in January and February 2009 following the start of a joint military operation against them by Congolese and Rwandan troops on January 20 .
Following the withdrawal of Rwandan forces on February 24 , military action diminished and the FDLR reoccupied many of their previous positions .
Most recently , at least seven civilians were killed and 24 others wounded during FDLR attacks in Lubero and Walikale in early April .
On March 20 , 2009 , the FDLR attacked Buhuli , North Kivu , and four other nearby villages , killing at least five civilians , including two women , an elderly man , a 7 - year - old girl and 9 - year - old boy .
On February 13 , the FDLR attacked the village of Kipopo , killing at least 13 people , who were burned to death in their homes .
In late February , the FDLR abducted at least a dozen women and girls from Remeka , in Masisi territory , North Kivu .
Two women who escaped reported that FDLR combatants brutally killed nine of the women and girls when they resisted attempts to rape them .
The fate of the others is unknown .
The Congolese army has also been implicated in numerous rapes .
In March , Congolese soldiers raped at least 21 women and girls in southern Masisi and northern Kalehe territories .
Many of the victims were violently gang raped while the soldiers were on looting sprees .
On March 24 , four women from Ziralo , South Kivu , were returning from the market when they were stopped by a group of army soldiers at a makeshift barricade .
The soldiers took the sacks of food the women were carrying and then said they were going to examine the women 's vaginas for any hidden money .
The soldiers took the women into the nearby forest and gang raped each of them for hours .
One woman was six - months pregnant and was raped so brutally that she lost her unborn child .
The recent killings by the rebel group are in addition to those perpetrated by its forces on January 27 , when FDLR combatants hacked to death dozens of civilians used as human shields at their military position in Kibua .
One witness at Kibua interviewed by Human Rights Watch saw an FDLR combatant batter a 10 - year - old girl to death against a brick wall .
According to the United Nations , an estimated 250,000 people have fled their homes since January , adding to hundreds of thousands of others who fled earlier waves of violence .
The Congolese army says it is preparing for the next phase of operations against the FDLR , this time expanding the operations to South Kivu .
The army has added over 10,000 additional soldiers from former Congolese rebel groups , including the National Congress for the Defence of the People ( CNDP ) , the Coalition of Congolese Patriotic Resistance ( PARECO ) , and other local militia groups .
The rapidly mixed brigades of former enemies have been sent to the front lines with no salaries , rations , or any formal training , increasing the likelihood of future human rights violations .
Serious abuses against civilians by government soldiers have already been reported .
Army soldiers killed at least five civilians in Lubero territory in March , some while on looting sprees .
In Ziralo , an elderly man was killed by soldiers while they raped his wife and looted his home .
The rapid integration process has included no formal vetting mechanism to stop those with serious records of past human rights abuses from being promoted and integrated into the Congolese army .
Bosco Ntaganda , wanted on an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) for the war crime of enlisting child soldiers and using them in hostilities , was promoted to the position of general in the Congolese army in January 2009 .
In addition to the ICC charges , Ntaganda has been accused of commanding troops that massacred 150 civilians at Kiwanja in North Kivu province in November 2008 .
Jean - Pierre Biyoyo was recently appointed a colonel in the Congolese army despite being found guilty by a Congolese military court in March 2006 of recruiting child soldiers .
He later escaped from prison .
Both Ntaganda and Biyoyo play an important role in current military operations .
The Congolese army will be supported by the UN peacekeeping mission in Congo , MONUC , in its military operations against the FDLR .
MONUC says that its top priority is to protect civilians , but it is not clear how civilians will be protected against further attacks by either FDLR or Congolese army soldiers .
" Protection of civilians can only be taken seriously if known human rights abusers are removed from the ranks of the Congolese army , " said Van Woudenberg .
" The Security Council should seek an immediate answer from the Congolese government on when it will carry out such arrests and what it will do to stop further rape and killing by its troops before it gives any support to the military operations . "
24 7.16 : It ’s a rat trap , Judy , and we ’ve been caught
Tonight ’s episode of “ 24 ” is the first one I can remember that did n’t have a ‘ B ’ story .
I guess the ‘ B ’ story was Madame Prez ’s boneheaded decision to appoint First Succubus Hillary Clinton as her temporary Chief of Staff until they find a replacement , but since that move wo n’t yield any ( rotten ) fruit until next week , it hardly counts as a subplot .
Nope , tonight was all about the Feds getting their ducks in a row so they can keep Starkwood Country Club from committing the country ’s most heinous act of treason since “ 24 ” parent company Fox released “ From Justin to Kelly ” in 2003 .
And it was all going so smoothly , too .
Hey , the good guys are gonna win this time !
Uh , not quite .
You have to admit , though , the amateur one - act play between Jonas Brother and Jonas Jr. was good for a laugh , right ?
Come on , there is no way Jonas Jr. — who looks like he could be the son of President Charles “ Buck Buck Brawwwwwwk ! ” Logan — is going to speak of destroying the weapons in front of Tony , nuh -uh .
And in any other episode in the history of “ 24 , ” Tony does n’t fall for that ruse .
Instead , he waits until the President is about to sign the immunity agreement and says , “ Stop , ” then beats the shit out of Jonas Jr. for an hour and a half .
You know that Carlos Bernard read the script for this week ’s episode and said , “ Noooooooooooooooooooooo ! ”
And to make matters worse , he ’s probably going to die before the season ’s over ( just a hunch , that ’s not based on any gossip ) , and for this to be one of his last acts would just be wrong .
Tony should go out like Bill Buchanan , only bigger .
AK - 47 in one hand , flamethrower in the other , while snorting coke off a stripper ’s ass .
Make it happen , guys .
“ Everything ’s in place , boss . ”
“ Thanks , lackey .
You know I crap bigger than you , right ? ”
On the plus side , my wish to see Kiefer Sutherland do some Serious Acting is about to come true .
It turns out that , shocker , Jack ’s tested positive for the Starkwood bioweapon , which sounds like an accelerated strain of Mad Cow Disease .
And there ’s no cure , dunt dunt duuuuunh .
Why was I tempted to laugh at Jacqueline ’s single solitary tear when she heard the news ?
I believe that she is truly broken up about this , but she needs to remember that this is Jack freaking Bauer we ’re talking about here .
He ’s not going to let some stinking virus take him down .
Instead , he ’ll go undercover as a smaller virus , infiltrate the Mad Cow virus , and roundhouse kick it until it leaves his body .
And anyway , Sutherland begins shooting the next season of “ 24 ” in April , and I do n’t think they ’re pulling a Patrick Duffy to make that work .
Man , does anyone under 30 even get that reference ?
God , I ’m old .
I have to admit , even though I knew full well that the warehouse Dudley Do-Right and his merry men raided at episode ’s end would be empty , I liked the Americans vs. Americans standoff , a la “ The Rock . ” I saw the guys on the roof , and immediately heard Ed Harris ’ voice in my head .
“ Your unit is covered from an elevated position , Commander . ”
Still , the fact that Starkwood set up the Feds like this — is Jonas Jr. ’s immunity agreement still binding if he lied through his teeth in order to get it ? — has to be a dead giveaway that the real bioweapon is on the complete opposite end of the compound , right ?
Hell , I did that move in Stratego 30 years ago .
Build a wall of bombs , take out a bunch of my opponent ’s highest ranking men , and then when he came in with the miner ( he was the 8 then ; he ’s the 3 now ) to capture my flag , he ’d realize that I was protecting …a 7 , pow .
Meanwhile , my flag would be in the opposite corner , guarded by one bomb and my 1 .
It was dangerous , but it was incredibly effective .
Just sayin’ , guys .
If the Feds do n’t know where the mad cows are with Starkwood ’s bait - and - switch , then God help us all .
Next week ( Mr. Paulsen , you may turn your eyes away now if you do not wish to see my “ spoilers ” ) : Hillary Clinton sleeps with her TV contact in order to get him to bury a story ?
In what universe is that the right play ?
Even if she gets her comeuppance at season ’s end and goes to jail , it wo n’t be enough .
She needs to die a slow death .
I ’m thinking flesh - eating beetles .

Find out how the GOCE mission will map Earth ’s gravity in unprecedented detail ( Courtesy of ESA )
GOCE , which launched on Tuesday , is set to offer 100 - kilometre - resolution maps of Earth ’s entire gravity field , the most detailed yet .
Its maps could help refine climate change projections and illuminate features beneath the planet ’s surface ( Illustration : ESA / AOES Medialab ) GOCE will help build a high - resolution picture of the geoid , an idealised model of the Earth ’s surface where gravitational potential is equal everywhere .
The geoid , which is bumpy because matter is not distributed uniformly in the Earth , is an important reference for surveying , studies of the Earth ’s interior , and measurements of ocean changes ( Illustration : ESA )
A sleek satellite that is set to make the most detailed map of the Earth ’s gravity took to the skies on Tuesday .
The probe is expected to make important contributions to ocean current measurements and climate models .
After a day ’s delay to work out problems with the probe ’s launch tower , the Gravity field and steady - state Ocean Circulation Explorer ( GOCE ) , launched on Tuesday from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Russia , which lies some 800 km north of Moscow .
If all goes well , the satellite will assume an orbit some 285 km above the Earth , gradually falling to an altitude of 268 km , where the probe will take much of its science data .
It will remain in orbit for at least two years , beginning science operations in late August or early September when the probe will have sufficient solar power to do its observations .

The Earth ’s mass is not uniformly distributed .
By flying low , GOCE will be able to map these variations in unprecedented detail .
Aerodynamic shape
But this orbit will also subject GOCE to the drag of tenuous gas at the edge of Earth ’s atmosphere .
If its orbit were uncorrected , the probe might only last a few months before falling back to Earth , says mission manager Rune Floberghagen .
To counteract this drag , the satellite has an aerodynamic shape and an ion-propulsion engine that continuously jettisons charged xenon atoms to keep its orbit stable .
Stability is important for the probe , which was built to have no moving parts that could interfere with the measurements of the satellite ’s three pairs of accelerometers .
Unprecedented detail
The team hopes GOCE will measure deviations in the Earth ’s gravity field at a spatial resolution higher than 100 km .
That is a factor of three better than NASA ’s GRACE satellites , a pair of probes that launched in 2002 to measure how Earth ’s gravity field changes in time , largely as water is transported around the globe .
GOCE will map the Earth ’s average gravity field to build up a picture of the geoid , an idealised model of the Earth ’s surface where the gravitational potential is identical at every point ( see this illustration ) .
If the Earth were covered with a perfectly still ocean , not subject to winds or ocean currents , the water would naturally take this shape .
The lack of a high - resolution geoid has hampered measurements of ocean currents , says Lee-Lueng Fu , chief scientist for the US - European Jason - 1 and Jason - 2 satellites , which are used to map ocean levels .
Ocean currents
Over the last 15 years , satellites have been using sea level changes to measure ocean currents .
Currents may cause swells or troughs on the order of metres high , but spatial variations in Earth ’s gravity mean some points on the ocean are naturally 100 or more metres higher than others , Fu says .
“ We cannot really compute the current [ ocean current ] speed because this sea surface shape is primarily determined by gravity , ” Fu told New Scientist .
By measuring this background shape , GOCE could refine measurements of ocean current , which could be used to get a better estimate of how heat is transported by the oceans .
Since oceans absorb most of the Earth ’s excess heat , the gravity map will ultimately help refine climate models .
“ This mission is an important step forward to allow us to make more reliable projections , ” Fu says .
“ We ’ve been waiting for such a mission for a long time . ”
The British star of TV medical drama House has captivated Gallic audiences , and now his almost forgotten novel is taking over the bestseller lists
The French have long had a soft spot for the most illustrious of British exports .
They devoured Shakespeare , adored Thomas Paine , and so admired Bertrand Russell that they baptised him " the English Voltaire " .
Now they have fallen for another rosbif , a colossus of the contemporary cultural scene best known for starting bun fights at the Drones club and knocking back Vicodin in hospital corners .
In awe of a man whose charm is " irresistible " and talent " unstoppable " , France has lost its heart to Hugh Laurie .
The actor , who until the launch of the US medical drama
House two years ago was an almost unknown name across the Channel , has found himself catapulted into the Parisian media spotlight after the translation of a novel he wrote more than a decade ago proved a runaway success .
Industry figures last week showed that , in March , the Jeeves and Wooster star shifted more copies of his ageing spoof spy thriller than any other writer in France .
Tout Est Sous Contrôle , whose original title was The Gun Seller , has sold more than 100,000 copies since its release in February by a little - known new publishing house .
" This was a real scoop , " said François Verdoux , the triumphant head of Sonatine books , whose editorial director stumbled across the novel on Amazon after watching an episode of House .
" You have to realise Dr House [ its French title ] is a phenomenon here , " he added .
" But , despite his incredible popularity , no one had the faintest idea Laurie had written a book .
There was no risk involved here ; it was a no - brainer . "
Since launching in February 2007 on France 's leading private network , TF1 , the series has become a hit , seducing prime - time viewers with its fast - moving storylines and quick - fire repartee .
But if there is one factor to thank for its cult - like following and sky - high ratings - it passed the 10 million mark in March - it is undoubtedly Laurie himself .
Enamoured of his character , whose truculence they adore , and infatuated by his " innately British " charm , French viewers have taken him to their hearts .
The celebrity magazine Voici declared him " the greatest seducer in the world " .
Another gushed : " With Hugh Laurie , you do n't sleep , you laugh .
With Hugh Laurie ... you are moved ...
It 's the year of Hugh Laurie or it 's no one 's year at all .
And , for now , there is n't the slightest sign of France overdosing . "
The surprise success of The Gun Seller , first published in English in 1996 , has transported Laurie from the realm of mere celebrity to the stratosphere of multi-talented superstar .
True to its historic appreciation of writers , France has bowed before the altar of its new favourite petit Anglais now that he has proved his prowess with a pen .
" It is a thriller that plays with the codes of the genre , " said Philippe Besson , reviewing the book for Europe 1 radio and praising its " caustic wit " and " well - mastered suspense " .
Seeing in Thomas Lang , the whisky - swilling , responsibility - dodging protagonist , the embryo of the mercurial Gregory House , he said : " Both the series and the book are laced with black humour .
If you like Dr House you 'll love The Gun Seller . "
It is this quality of anti-heroism - rare for mainstream French series - which has the country hooked , said Jean - Michel Maire , chief television critic for Le Figaro .
Both Lang - " 36 , penniless and achingly single " - and House are refreshingly flawed as human beings .
" He 's a change from the kind of smooth guy we 're used to - the George Clooney types , " said Maire of the US character .
" He 's rude .
He 's cynical .
He 's acid .
But it 's his spiciness which has made the ratings go through the roof . "
For others it is Laurie 's embodiment of a specific kind of anti-hero that appeals .
House , in particular , is an awkward , arrogant misfit with a distaste for authority and a need to do things his own way .
No wonder France adores him , said Valérie Hurier , television editor at Télérama magazine .
" He is so cynical and politically incorrect .
He 's misanthropic and he breaks with the orthodox rules , has no time for following protocol and plays with laws , but all for a noble aim .
For all that , we absolutely love him . "
Hurier - a " huge fan " of Laurie - is one of a growing legion of female devotees keen to label him the next Hugh Grant .
" In the UK you have some excellent actors who manage to play their parts with great charm , yet remain distant , " she said .
" He [ Laurie ] has a charm that is very British , even when he 's playing a character who is very American . "
Virginie de Clausade , a television presenter , agreed .
" I am such a fan .
He is so sexy .
He has that English charm , that class . "
Macho male viewers , too , have fallen under Laurie 's spell .
Yannick Clareton declared on Facebook that he should be " promoted to master of the world " .
Heroes abroad
David Hasselhoff
Germany was improbably receptive to the Baywatch star 's attempts at a musical career .
His short - lived success peaked with a performance atop the crumbling Berlin Wall in November 1989 and a number one hit entitled ' Looking For Freedom ' .
Sir Norman Wisdom
The comic was mobbed by fans whenever he visited Albania , where he is a cult figure , thanks to dictator Enver Hoxha 's decree that his slapstick films should be shown to entertain the masses .
Chris de Burgh
It 's not every pop star whose lyrics are translated into Farsi , but to Iran Chris de Burgh is not every pop star .
In 2007 the ' Lady in Red ' singer was invited to become the first western pop act to play in the country since 1979 .
Nigella Lawson
The domestic goddess seduced the US with her culinary talents .
In 2006 she launched Nigella Feasts on TV's Food Network .
During our time at the Winter Founders Program , all of the startup groups pitched their idea to about 40 angels and venture capitalists at an event put on by Y Combinator called Angel Day .
In addition to Angel Day , we also pitched Wufoo to about 5 - 10 investors in follow - up presentations .
After a few meetings , we started to notice the same questions being asked over and over again .
If you ’ve never met with angels or VCs and are curious as to what they might want to know , here is a list of the more common questions we fielded .
1 ) Who else have you spoken to ?
I believe every single investor asked this early on and I ’m not completely sure why they cared so much since they should be basing their judgment and strategy on the strength of the idea and not on its popularity .
I think it ’s because Silicon Valley is a lot like high school in that you ’re basically as cool as the people who talk to you .
Being funded by Sequoia , is not unlike dating the hottest cheerleader in the squad .
Then again , maybe it ’s just natural human curiosity .
Either way , it ’s a good idea to keep at the top of your head who you ’ve talked to and their appropriate place in the pecking order .
2 ) How will you make money ?
If Adsense is your stratetgy , you might want to start thinking of some alternate revenue models .
After one investor asked us this question , he quickly said under his breath in a little prayer , “ Please do n’t say Adsense.â€ 
If you already have a million users , then the investors are going to listen to you no matter what you have planned .
That said , investors are getting hip to the notion that funding a Web 2.0 startup that ’s obsessed more with the technology than the revenue is just asking for trouble .
If you need help thinking of alternative revenue models , I highly recommend checking out Startup Pricing Models and Giving Your Software Away For Free for some good reading on the subject .
3 ) How will your company grow ?
Investors want a return on their investment , and they naturally want to see you grow your market .
I believe going over this question with your co-founders is a great exercise , because your company in three years is going to be very different from what it is right now .
Always good to have everyone on the same page about how things should pan out .
It does n’t have to be detailed , just think about whether your growth strategy is going to be achieved by creating new product lines , reaching foreign markets , or adding some nifty features .
4 ) What technologies do you use ?
We ’ve noticed that a lot of the investors are ex-programmers and enjoy showing off a little programming speak , but why they all care about this just stumps me .
Basically , we ’ve seen every kind of language being gobbled up by the big boys .
When it comes down to it , it does n’t seem to matter whether you write your application in Ruby , PHP , Python , ColdFusion or even .
NET .
Users pay attention to the ends , not the means .
Instead of asking whether we think MySQL can really handle a large set of users , they should be asking us is how we ’re planning to keep our interface intuitive and responsive .
On a related note , mentioning buzzwords like AJAX or standards does n’t seem to matter all that much to anyone out there .
5 ) How easily can you be copied ?
If you ’re writing a web app , chances are there are a lot of other teams who could create a similar program ( if you ’ve got no competitors you might be working on the wrong thing ) .
We tried to be as honest as possible when answering people , so our standard response to this one went something like this : “ Um , not to toot our own horns , but we ’re pretty good at what we do , but nothing changes the fact that Wufoo is a computer program written by three guys in a couple of months .
We believe completely in our team and our implementation and know it wo n’t be easy to duplicate what we ’ve done , but if another quality team comes along and wants to copy us , there ’s nothing we can do to stop them .
Our plan is to win by being more innovative , more dedicated , faster and more customer - savvy than anyone else out there . ”
6 ) Can we see the demo ?
Everyone in Silicon Valley has an idea , and many of them are similar .
Investors want to see the goods .
We had one investor invite us out to a casual dinner , and when we did n’t have our laptops with us , we ended up taking him to our messy apartment full of pizza boxes and soda cans because he wanted to see the demo then and there .
We got a follow - up meeting and an offer out of it , so it ’s good to know that a working demo is more important than cleanliness .
Basically , always assume they have n’t seen your online public demo and have that localhost version on your laptop ready to go .
7 ) Who are your competitors and how are you better / different ?
Unless you just invented a teleportation system , research your competitors and be ready to answer what you can do better than everyone else out there .
Do n’t even try and avoid this question because about two days after any meeting , you ’re going to receive an email asking you to detail how you ’re better than 20 other companies the investor just Googled .
8 ) Who are your customers ?
The trick to this question is to be specific .
You ’ll want to have examples of who is using , who will use , and who wants to use your product .
At Startup School , Ann Winblad from Hummer Winblad said they will even contact companies you mention as potential customers during the due diligence period to verify their legitimacy as a customer .
9 ) How will you spread the word about your product ?
This was my favorite question , because we could usually nail it .
Investors understand the power of word of mouth marketing , and you win bonus points if you can demonstrate the ability to quickly spread the word .
One of our biggest selling points was the fact that we have a decent blog , we belong to the 9rules network , and we were able to reach over 50,000 unique people in a matter of days when we released our public interface demo .
10 ) What will your market penetration be ?
This was actually only asked of us once , but I had to add it to emphasize that you do n’t need to spew out a bunch of BS to impress investors .
We could have made up something you probably heard in an MBA class , but instead just said , “ We honestly do n’t know .â€ 
And that ’s the truth , because I ca n’t even begin to guess what percentage of the available form building market we are going to get .
The investor was a little bit shocked with the answer , but it definitely was n’t a deal breaker .
