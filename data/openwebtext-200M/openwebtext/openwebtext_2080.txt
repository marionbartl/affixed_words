Alright , let ’s get this out of the way first : kicking down a door is not the best option for opening a locked door .
It will damage the door and cost you lots of money to fix it .
It is better to call a locksmith , pick the lock , or attempt to crawl in a window .
But let ’s say it ’s an emergency .
You ’re in a burning house and you need to escape and the door is on fire .
Or your loved ones are in a burning house and you ’re locked out .
You ca n’t stand there fiddling with the lock , you ’ve got to break it down !
Or perhaps a loved one is stricken with a medical emergency and is locked inside a room or in their house .
What to do ?
Be a man , dammit !
Break down that door !
You know you ’ve always wanted to .
How to break down a door
If you have watched enough movies , your next move is a no brainer ….run at the door shoulder first , right ?
Wrong .
This technique may be uber - manly , but it will probably dislocate your shoulder .
It is better to employ a more forceful and well placed kick .
Check to see which way the door opens by checking the hinges .
If the door opens towards you , kicking it down is going to be next to impossible .
Kicking a door down is best employed on a door that swings away from you .
Kick to the side of where the lock is mounted ( near the keyhole ) .
This is typically the weakest part of the door .
Using a front kick , drive the heel of your foot into the door .
Give the kick forward momentum and keep your balance by driving the heel of your standing foot into the ground .
Do n’t kick the lock itself ; this could break your foot .
The wood should begin to splinter .
Today most doors are made of soft wood and are hollow .
They should give way fairly easily , especially since the lock ’s deadlock bolt extends only an inch or less into the door frame .
Older , completely solid doors will prove more resistant .
Just keep on kicking until the door gives way and you can save the day .
Avoid jump kicks .
While you may be tempted to employ this manly move , jumping diminishes your stability which causes you to lose power .
1895 : German physicist Wilhelm Roentgen is working in his laboratory in Würzburg when he accidentally discovers the X-ray .
Roentgen was conducting experiments with a Crookes tube – basically a glass gas bulb that gives off fluorescent light when a high voltage current is passed through it – when he noticed that that the beam cast a greenish fluorescent light on a screen nine feet away , despite the tube being shielded by heavy black cardboard .
Roentgen concluded , correctly , that he was dealing with a new kind of ray , one that cast the shadow of a solid object when passed through an opaque covering from its point of origin .
Not knowing what kind of ray he was dealing with , exactly , led him to call it an X -ray .
The name stuck .
To test his discovery , Roentgen made an X - ray image of his wife Bertha 's hand , clearly showing the bones of her hand and a pretty hefty wedding ring .
In the next couple of months Roentgen published a paper ( " On a New Kind of Rays " ) about his discovery , made a presentation before the Würzburg Medical Society and X - rayed the hand of a prominent anatomist , who proposed naming the new ray after Roentgen .
You do n't hear them called Roentgen rays much these days , but the term roentgenology is still current , and the roentgen is a radiological unit of measure .
X -rays are no longer a mystery , but a major tool of medical diagnosis .

Researchers have discovered a protein that appears to halt the growth of the deadly skin cancer melanoma .
In examining what makes ordinary moles different from melanomas on a genetic level , scientists at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Maryland discovered a series of genes , along with a genetically secreted protein , that seem to play an integral role in shutting down melanoma cells .
Melanomas develop from pigment - producing cells called melanocytes .
One oncogene , BRAF , regulates the melanocytes ' development into cancer through the support of other genes .
BRAF is part of a signalling system that shows the cell is proliferating or dividing .
If BRAF 's regulation mechanism is somehow blocked , cancer occurs .
In lab tests , the researchers identified seventeen genes that were needed by the BRAF protein to cause cell suicide .
They also discovered a secreted protein , insulin - like growth factor binding protein 7 ( IGFBP7 ) , which seemed to be released when a melanocyte began expressing BRAF .
The protein seemed to cause the cancer cell to begin hibernating or to die .
When researchers exposed melanoma cells in the lab to IGFBP7 , they all died .
As well , when mice with melanoma tumours were administered IGFBP7 , the growth of their tumour cells was halted .
" It 's an extremely powerful anti-cancer mechanism , " said Michael Green , an investigator with Howard Hughes Medical Institute , in a release .
The study is published in the Feb. 8 issue of the journal Cell .
According to the Canadian Cancer Society , it 's estimated that 4,600 Canadians developed melanoma in 2007 .
His latest report , however , said that “ political plotting and games are not in the best interest of New York State . ”
Republicans assailed the district attorney on Friday for not pressing forward with a criminal case now and for his handling of the case .
“ The report confirms what I have been saying all along , that former Gov. Eliot Spitzer lied to the people of this state about his direct knowledge and involvement in the Troopergate scandal , ” Mr. Bruno said in a statement .
“ I feel it was a serious mistake not to present this information to a grand jury and proceed with a prosecution , ” he added .
A spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer declined to comment Friday night .
Mr. Soares , who declined to comment , had sought to release a more detailed report but was deterred by grand jury secrecy rules .
The district attorney had asked the administration of Gov. David A. Paterson to allow it to release material collected in response to a grand jury subpoena , but Mr. Cuomo ’s office , representing the executive branch , released an opinion on Friday saying such a move was not permissible .
The report , which is built largely around Mr. Dopp ’s testimony , portrays the former governor as heavily involved in the entire Bruno effort , e-mailing Mr. Dopp frequently after the report was released , keeping close tabs on the progress of the story and analyzing how it played in the press .
The governor had his staff arrange for a former top State Police official to talk to The New York Times to keep the story alive , according to the report , in an attempt to show that concerns about Mr. Bruno ’s use of the state plane extended back several years .
The latest report is not the end of the matter .
The Commission on Public Integrity and the Republican - led Senate Investigations Committee are also conducting inquiries .
Mr. Soares ’s second investigation started after the integrity commission referred to his office a potential perjury case against Mr. Dopp late last year .
Unlike the last one , Mr. Soares ’s new report appeared to vindicate Mr. Cuomo ’s findings , which said the administration had tried to discredit Mr. Bruno .
Dildoes Going to the Supreme Court ?
The Texas ban on dildoes -- yes , it expressly mentions " dildo " -- has just been struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit .
The law , the court held , violates Lawrence v. Texas right of " adult consensual sexual intimacy in the home . "
On this , the Fifth Circuit disagrees with the Eleventh Circuit , which upheld a similar Alabama law last year .
Sounds like there 's a solid split , so there 's a decent chance that the U.S. Supreme Court will step in to resolve this ( though there 's of course no guarantee ) .

FOR years , anti-poverty campaigners railed against low commodity prices , which depressed farmers ' incomes in developing countries .
In recent months , the world price of virtually all staples has shot up , but the activists are still not cheering .
They worry that this boom ( intensified by “ green ” subsidies for biofuel crops ) may worsen poverty even more than low agricultural prices did .
High food prices do help poor farmers , but they also hurt the more numerous category of people ( poor city - dwellers as well as landless rural folk ) who must buy food to survive .
That “ unintended consequence ” — in the words of Gawain Kripke of Oxfam International , a British charity — has caused serious problems for the organisations that bring food aid to the poorest .
The World Food Programme ( WFP ) , a UN agency , has just issued an urgent appeal for $ 500 m , to cover higher food costs .
America 's Agency for International Development ( USAID ) , a huge financer of food aid , is asking for $ 350m .
The short - term outlook seems grim , both for the poor and the agencies that supposedly help them .
Even before the current price boom started two years ago , food aid was running at historically low levels , perhaps half the real - terms total of two decades earlier .
And the WFP says hunger is on the rise in the countries it watches .
It classifies as “ hotspots ” the places — most of central Africa , plus Afghanistan — where more than a third of the people do not get as much food as is needed .
A second tier , where between a fifth and a third lack adequate food , includes much of West Africa , the Indian sub - continent and Bolivia .
David Kauck of CARE , an American charity , says that pockets of real hunger also exist in many rich countries .
Dismal as all this sounds , there are some grounds for hope .
Today 's woes may lead to fundamental changes for the better in the world 's approach to hunger and food shortages .
And not before time , in the view of experts who see something crazy about the way many food - aid efforts are now conceived and executed .
One mistake , arguably , is the very idea of defining the main problem as massive hunger , and hence the solution as providing food by any means necessary .
“ There is simply no shortage of food , ” insists Rachel Nugent of America 's Centre for Global Development .
Of course , there are places — like North Korea or Darfur — where political ( and in some cases ecological ) factors cause an intense local shortage of food .
In those cases , insists Josette Sheeran , head of the WFP , food aid is the only option .
She also fears that the world is getting less resilient in its ability to respond to a growing number of food emergencies .
But leaving aside those extraordinary events , most pundits , including Ms Sheeran , agree that the world now has plenty of food : last year saw a record cereal harvest .
And the investments spurred by today 's high prices promise even more food in future .
Even if one allows for rising demand from Asia 's middle classes , the real challenge is not the volume of food available ; it is the problem of food being in the wrong place and at a price the poorest cannot afford .
Michael
Hess of USAID adds that famines are made inevitable by poor governance , not natural disasters .
After all , “ America has droughts , but not famine . ”
Moreover , hunger as such is the wrong target , says Meera Shekar of the World Bank .
Hunger is transient and hard to measure , but malnutrition , she notes , is a pernicious killer ( with lack of food as only one contributing variable ) .
She points out that South Asia , which has plentiful food , suffers from twice the level of malnutrition as crisis - prone sub-Saharan Africa .
The snag is that tackling malnutrition is harder than sending bags of grain .
It means fixing health systems , improving the delivery of nutrients in the food chain , educating people about hygiene and other unpopular and unprofitable jobs .
Small wonder , then , that this burdensome task has fewer political cheerleaders .
Oxfam's Mr Kripke holds out hope that today 's price shock may yet “ help fix a broken system ” .
The United States , in particular , monetises food aid in a bizarre way .
Tax dollars are used to buy food in America , which is then sold by charities in poor - country markets to fund development .
Christopher Barrett , an economist at Cornell University , calls this “ a clever way to turn a dollar of taxpayer money into 50 cents for a non-governmental organisation to spend . ”
The requirement that most food aid must be sent on American ships raises costs , and benefits just a few shippers .
Change may be coming .
Over the objections of some tough lobbies , George Bush has proposed fixing some of the distorting aspects of America 's food policies .
The president has called for more emphasis on procuring produce from local farmers in poor countries .
And in a bold gesture , CARE has said it will no longer accept any American government donations using the monetisation approach .
Most encouraging are some proposed changes at the WFP .
Ms Sheeran hopes to persuade her board at a meeting in June to shift her agency 's focus away from emergency food aid and towards a wider remit .
She wants to expand its role in surveillance , stockpiling and risk - insurance .
She also speaks of targeting subsidies or vouchers “ in ways that complement markets rather than distort them ” , as current subsidies often do .
If this sort of clarity prevails , it would be a silver lining on the dark cloud that now looms over the poor .
Today has been the anniversary of Bush 's surge in Iraq .
Clearly there is no political reconciliation in Iraq so the surge is and always will be a failure no matter how many times Joe Lieberman and John McCain proclaim it so .
This has been an immoral war started by neocon warmongers and the end result at this point is that the Iraqi people have suffered dearly for our sins .
They cut deals with the Sunnis , but soon those same Sunnis will be targeting the Shia government .
That 's just grand .
clammyc at DKos breaks down Bush 's big speech on 01/10/07 and all it 's failures .
NSN also writes about what has not happened there in the last year that McCain is so proud of .
I have to tell you that I 'm not happy about the " it 's time for the Iraqis to do their part " bit .
We invaded them .
We have no right to complain about how they are handling this situation .
I might have said the same thing myself a few times and on further reflection realize that it 's just a talking point to point the blame on them for not getting with the Democracy program when we have no right to say that .
Juan Cole writes about the nine US soldiers just killed there and the tremendous amount of civilian deaths that we 've brought to the Iraqis as some sort of sick gift basket :
A new World Health Organization study estimates the excess numbers of civilians killed in violence in Iraq from April 2003 through June 2006 at between 101,000 and 224,000 .
They settled on 151,000 or so as the most likely number .
And Juan 's most compelling quote is :
How many orphans have we created ?
How many widows ?
How many people who weep and cry every night while trying to fall asleep on straw mats ?.. read on .
Who cries for them except us ?
Not Cheney .
And let 's not forget all the Iraqi people that have fled their country .
Oh , what about troop morale ?
Iraq war veterans now stationed at a base here say that morale among U.S. soldiers in the country is so poor , many are simply parking their Humvees and pretending to be on patrol , a practice dubbed " search and avoid " missions .
And yet the PNACers live in in utter prosperity , getting jobs at the NY Times to flaunt their destructive ideas .
Negroponte urged Musharraf to quit his army post swiftly
US envoy 's warning
" Emergency rule is not compatible with free , fair and credible elections , " said John Negroponte , a day after meeting the Pakistani leader .
Gen Musharraf imposed emergency rule two weeks ago following growing opposition and unrest .
He has insisted it can only be lifted once the security situation improves .
Mr Negroponte , the US deputy secretary of state , said he had urged Gen Musharraf to stick to his pledge to step down as head of the army , and encouraged him to release political prisoners .
" Recent political actions against protesters , suppression of the media and the arrests of political and human rights leaders , runs directly counter to reforms that have been undertaken in recent years , " he said .
However , the US envoy praised Gen Musharraf as a valued ally in the war on terror and welcomed the Pakistani leader 's promise to hold elections on 9 January .
' Fight against extremism '
On Saturday an aide to Gen Musharraf said he had told Mr Negroponte that the constitution could only be restored when law and order had been re-imposed .
[ Talks can help ] pull the political actors back from the atmosphere of brinksmanship and confrontation
John Negroponte
Washington 's man ?
" He told the envoy that the emergency is meant to reinforce and strengthen the law enforcement apparatus in the fight against militancy and extremism , " the aide told AFP news agency .
The BBC's Barbara Plett in Islamabad says Mr Negroponte made it clear that the US did not accept Mr Musharraf 's arguments for emergency rule .
He did not signal what kind of pressure might be brought to bear on the Pakistani leader , although American officials said he had raised the issue of cuts in aid to Pakistan .
Mr Negroponte is the most senior US official to have met Gen Musharraf since the imposition of emergency rule on 3 November .
He also met other high - ranking Pakistani officials and spoke to opposition leader Benazir Bhutto by phone .
Mr Negroponte said he had encouraged Gen Musharraf to resume power - sharing talks with Ms Bhutto .
Those talks broke down as Ms Bhutto threatened to lead mass protests against emergency rule , and was then placed under house arrest .
She has now been released , but has appeared to rule out re-starting negotiations .
" If steps were taken by both sides to move back towards the kind of reconciliation discussions they had been having previously , we think that could be very positive , " Mr Negroponte said .
Talks could help " pull the political actors back from the atmosphere of brinksmanship and confrontation " , he said .
Clean Energy Intro : Top 10 Alternative Solar Uses
February 25th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
Powering your home with big solar panels is expensive .
Despite the long - term benefits , not all of us can fork over the cash for the initial investment .
Fortunately , since the sun is such a tantalizing and constant source of energy , innovative minds have made lots of ways to harness sol ’s rays .
Here ’s a top - 10 list ( and introduction ) to other forms of solar power that might fit your budget and your practical needs .
For less practical needs , a few are just plain cool .
# 1 : Solar Water Heater
Solar water heaters come in a variety of types and designs which means they ’re a versatile and practical option for everyone who enjoys a hot shower .
How do they work ?
Most use the heat of the sun to warm water , which means your hot water tank expends less natural gas or electricity to do the same job .
The benefits of this technology : price , investment return , and size .
You can upgrade an existing water heater into a solar water heater for $ 4,000 - $ 6,000 .
Typically you ’ll spend less if you ’re building a new home .
According to the U.S. Department of Energy , “ your water heating bills should drop 50 % –80 % ” after installation .
That means you ’ll regain your investment in savings more quickly than other solar systems .
And let ’s not forget size – these are smaller systems that wo n’t clutter your roof .
Check out this site for diagrams about regional climate , maintenance fees , and more .
# 2 : Skylights and Tubular Daylighting Devices ( Solatube Daylighting Devices )
Most homes were not built with windows in the ceiling and installing a skylight can be expensive .
Instead , consider installing a tubular daylighting device ( aka Solatube Daylighting System ) – a clever reflective tube that directs sunlight into interior windowless spaces .
Solatube Daylighting Devices provide natural light without electricity , are versatile and inexpensive , and they do n’t have to take up any more space than a normal light fixture .
Accessories like dimmer switches and lightbulb fixtures allow you to control the brightness and use the tube at night .
You can DIY for a few hundred dollars or hire a professional .
Fiber optic solar lighting uses the same idea , but it ’s more complex ( and expensive ) .
# 3 : Solar Battery Chargers
This is my personal favorite , and the source of much envy : Portable solar panels that charge your cell phone , ipod , or even your laptop .
They tend to appear as messenger bags , backpacks or roll - outs and are perfect for outdoor excursions , off - grid applications , or emergencies .
Your GPS or cell phone do n’t do you much good if their batteries die , and you could take all those pictures on your next vacation with a fully charged camera .
This is definitely a luxury item , but we ’ve all known the frustration of a dead battery in one or more gadgets .
# 4 : Solar Lights
These are perhaps the most recognizable and accessible solar products on the market .
We ’ve all seen the little garden lights poking up out of the ground , their little solar - tops staring back up at us .
But these garden lights , in their endless varieties , do not represent the end of solar lighting .
There are also portable solar lights and lanterns for camping or emergencies .
On a larger scale , some cities have invested in solar street lights or solar trees .
If you need to illuminate something but ca n’t plug it in , solar lights are the perfect solution .
# 5 : Solar Screens ( also known as curtains )
Oh I can just see you rolling your eyes , but let ’s face it – as much as we love the sun , sometimes we need a break in the shade .
“ Passive solar energy ” is a fancy way of saying “ sunshine warm , shade cool ” .
Put that principle to work in your home by regulating when and where you let the sun in .
If you let the southern sun shine during the winter it will help keep your house warm .
( Just remember that sunshine can’t compete with a cold draft from poorly - insulated windows . )
Conversely , if you lower the shades during the summer it will lighten your air conditioner ’s burden , especially during the hottest part of the day .
Putting passive solar energy to your advantage can reduce your energy bills .
If you have the opportunity to build , “ incorporating passive solar design elements into buildings and homes can reduce heating bills by as much as 50 % . ”
# 6 : Solar Oven
If you ’ve ever ignited anything with a magnifying glass , you know the heat potential of the sun .
Put this idea to work for your next cooking adventure – solar ovens !
This technology directs sunlight towards a focal point to raise the temperature and cook whatever finds itself in the way .
Designs range from the most basic tin-foil box to complex permanent appliances .
These ovens easily reach temperatures high enough to cook meat or boil water and come in many designs .
They ’re great for outdoor cooking , especially in areas without fuel to burn or where burn - bans are in effect ; it ’s also safe ( no burnt food ) , making an easy educational activity for kids .
Cool factor : in many designs you can watch the food cook before your very eyes !
# 7 : Solar - Heated Pool or Pond
This one borrows the same principles of the Solar Water Heater , but at a much larger scale and with different equipment .
If you ’re dead set on owning and heating a swimming pool you ’ll save a lot of oil by using a solar pool cover and / or a solar pool heater to regulate the temperature .
The pool cover is n’t a floating solar panel .
It ’s an insulated pool sheet designed to keep in the heat , thus reducing the amount of energy required to maintain water temperature .
The solar pool heater acts like a radiator in reverse : water is pumped out into a lattice of tubes where it ’s heated by solar panels , then it ’s pumped back into the pool .
Circulating water through this system keeps it warm , even in cold climates .
And just so you know , water has a “ large heat capacity , high thermal conductivity “ .
That means it takes a lot of energy to heat up water and it will transfer that heat into other materials , like the ground .
Lots of energy means lots of money , even if you harness free and abundant sunlight .
# 8 : Solar Decor
There are a plethora of garden and home ornaments that make the most out of solar power .
Solar fountains and bird baths are just the beginning .
While these may seem a bit frivolous , I think it just goes to show that you do n’t have to give up everything you own to go green .
You can indulge a little and find gifts for the least eco-inclined people in your life .
There are even educational kits that you assemble into trinkets or toys .
Who does n’t want a solar - powered frog ?
# 9 : Solar Signs
This is a practical solar panel application that we tend to overlook , but is already widespread .
Use the sun to power signs along the road .
Billboards aside , real estate , traffic , and construction signs are hot solar sites .
Let ’s not forget the urge to stand out from the crowd !
This usage of solar power expands our ability to communicate , whether to warn motorists of construction or an accident ahead or to broadcast a product .
Whatever your message , lighting a sign with solar makes more than a statement – it expands the application of a powerful modern tool .
# 10 : Solar Gadgets
Sometimes you just find something so cool or different that you wonder how someone could even imagine it .
Solar gadgets are no exception .
Here are a few that tickled my wallet or just made me laugh : solar tents for your next camping adventure , solar lighters to impress your friends , solar “ personal massage ” for someone special , solar tombstones for the dearly departed , and more !
How about the “ 9 most unusual solar gadgets “ ?
It just goes to show that you do n’t have to buy big solar panels for your home to benefit from the energy of the sun .
Some techniques , like passive solar energy , do n’t require any money at all .
Solar means more than silicon wafers or fancy gadgets – it ’s any application that puts our nearest star to work .
Many of these applications can save you money , and all of them encourage a powerful and practical energy technology .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Martin Lee Anderson was beaten on his first day at the camp
The 14 - year - old boy collapsed after running laps on his first day at the camp for juvenile offenders in 2007 .
The boy was beaten by guards for 30 minutes and made to inhale ammonia in what they said was an attempt to revive him .
He died in hospital a day later .
The jury took about 90 minutes to find the guards not guilty .
Defence lawyers argued that the guards properly handled what they thought was a juvenile offender faking illness to avoid exercising .
They argued that Martin Lee Anderson died from complications linked to an undiagnosed sickle cell trait - a usually harmless blood disorder which can hinder the blood cells ' ability to carry oxygen during physical stress .
Camps shut down
But a medical examiner said the " forced inhalation " of ammonia caused the teenager 's vocal cords to spasm and block his upper airways , and he died of suffocation .
The boy 's mother , Gina Jones , left the courtroom after the verdict was read .
" I can not see my son no more .
Everybody see their family members .
It 's wrong , " she said .
Anderson was sent to the boot camp for probation violations , after he was charged with stealing his grandmother 's car from a church car park .
His death led Florida lawmakers to order that all such camps be shut down .
Anderson 's family sought a trial after accusing state authorities of trying to cover up the case .
Earlier this year the state legislature paid them $ 5 m ( £ 2.5 m ) to settle civil claims .
The defendants would have faced up to 30 years in jail if convicted of manslaughter .
The jury could have convicted them of lesser charges , including child neglect and culpable negligence .
To capture both the " mirth and matter " that we encounter each day , from the solemn to the silly .
A controlled flood of the Grand Canyon due to start today has caused a row within the federal government 's department of the interior , pitting environmentalists and officials of the national park service against their colleagues in the bureau of reclamation and the geological survey .
The flood , the third in the last 12 years , will see 40,000 cubic feet per second released from the Glen Canyon dam down the Colorado river , instead of the customary 13,000 feet .
The " blowout " is intended to clear accumulated sand and sediment from the riverbed and encourage the restoration of sandy beaches and side pools critical to the survival of native species .
The construction of the dam in 1963 , and the resulting creation of the 186 - mile long Lake Powell upriver of the Grand Canyon , put an end to the cycle of spring floods that would naturally flush out the river .
It encouraged non-native fish to thrive while accelerating the extinction of four native fish species .
But the flood , which has been promoted by interior secretary Dirk Kempthorne , has run into opposition .
Opponents argue that the one - off flood will cause more damage than benefit , and that the decision to allow just one flood fails to mimic natural conditions and could leave endangered fish and sandbars diminished .
Officials with the parks service have accused the bureau of trying to push through the plan without allowing sufficient time for review .
Grand Canyon national park superintendent Steve Martin said he was given just one day in mid-February to submit comments on the plan .
His submission blasted the plan for being out of touch with the latest scientific information .
" It is not apparent where the 80 million dollars in research , conducted over the last 10 years has been used in this decision - making process , " he wrote .
" Our analysis shows that this document is not consistent with current best information . "
He concluded that the lack of additional high flows floods after this week " could lead to impairment of the resources " of the canyon .
In comments to the Los Angeles Times on Monday , Martin suggested that the manner and timing of the flooding was intended to benefit the hydroelectric power companies that use the lake , and need to satisfy peak demand during the summer .
" The best time to get the most money for your hydropower is during peak energy demands , which is generally daytime hours and generally in the summer , " he said .
Lawyers with the department of the interior battled to make Martin withdraw his comments to the review , fearing that a finding of " significant impairment " would lead to additional reviews , effectively blocking the plan .
But a geological survey official told the paper that the flushing would go ahead , pointing out that the agency had to take into account the entire economic profile of the dam .
Jeff Ruch of the environmental pressure group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility said that the Bush administration was trying to protect its legacy .
" In its last months , the Bush administration is trying to extend its control through the term of its successor - a dead man 's hand throttling Colorado River management , " he said .
" When engineers and lawyers wrap themselves in ecological rationales , it is time to watch out . "
The group also criticised an exclusive deal offered by the interior department to the NBC network to cover the flooding .
" This week 's high - flow stunt is nothing but a green wash to mask another betrayal of the Grand Canyon by its political custodians , " said Ruch .
I expect that anyone reading this blog has had hundreds , if not thousands , of emails like this :
NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION
CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS , LAGOS
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL .
FROM THE DESK OF : DR WALI AHMED .
LAGOS -NIGERIA
Dear Sir / Madam ,
After due deliberation with my colleagues , I decided to forward this proposal .
We want a reliable person who could assist us to transfer the sum of Thirty Million United States Dollars ( US$ 30,000,000.00 ) into his / her account .
..etc
Or
My father ( Late ) DR EDWARD HOSANNA the former Deputy Minister of Finance under the executive civilian president of Liberia , but was assasinated by the rebels during the civil war and properties destroyed , but I narrowly escaped with some very important documents of ( US $ 7.5 M )
Seven Point Five Million U.S
Dollars deposited by my late father in a high financial company here in Dakar - Senegal under my name as next of kin.
..etc
( picking two at random from my inbox ) .
Needless to say , it is a scam .
Basically , they ask for a sum of money ( e.g. to bribe an official ) with the promise that you will get a much larger sum once the transaction is complete .
But each payment results in a request for a larger payment , until you run out of money .
It is often known as the ‘ Nigerian 419 scam ’ , as many of these emails originate from Nigeria and they are an offence under article 419 of the Nigerian criminal code .
It is a variant on the spanish prisoner scam , which dates back to the early 1900s .
It is hard to believe anyone would fall for this scam , but they do in their thousands .
Advance fee fraud ( e.g. 419 scams ) was estimated to cost at least £ 275 million in 2005 in the UK alone , with average individual loss to victims over £ 31,000 .
Greed and stupidity are indeed a dangerous combination .
So what can we do to hit back ?
Not a great deal .
The governments of poor and corrupt countries probably do n’t care that much about gullible and greedy westerners being cheated .
In fact , the scam may be in their interests .
We can report the scammer ’s email to their ISP , in the hope that it will be shut down before they can con anyone .
But they can easily get another .
We can play along a bit and waste the scammer ’s time ( perhaps with highly entertaining results ) .
But it wastes our time as well .
However another idea occurred to me while listening to a BBC radio report from Nigeria .
Apparently many Nigerians are incredibly superstitious , even the highly educated ones .
Rumours of penis stealing witches and killer phone numbers are taken very seriously .
So now I occasionally respond to 419 emails with a curse email from a little used email account .
My email starts with some impressive looking pig Latin .
It then tells them that reading the above has activated a curse and that they will suffer increasingly bad headaches until they renounce their wicked ways .
If they are sufficiently superstitious I figure this might be enough to start a headache , which will get worse the more they worry about it .
Hopefully they will either find an honest way to make a living or a psychosomatic feedback loop will cause their head to explode like a scene from the film Scanners ( warning : very gory ) .
I have no idea if it works – but I think it is worth a try .

A new thesis from he Swedish medical university Karolinska Institutet shows that the brain ’s serotonin system differs between men and women .
The scientists who conducted the study think that they have found one of the reasons why depression and chronic anxiety are more common in women than in men .
Serotonin is a brain neurotransmitter that is critical to the development and treatment of depression and chronic anxiety , conditions that , for reasons still unknown , are much more common in women than in men .
A research group at Karolinska Institutet has now shown using a PET scanner that women and men differ in terms of the number of binding sites for serotonin in certain parts of the brain .
Their results , which are to be presented in a doctoral thesis by Hristina Jovanovic at the end of February , show that women have a greater number of the most common serotonin receptors than men .
They also show that women have lower levels of the protein that transports serotonin back into the nerve cells that secrete it .
It is this protein that the most common antidepressants ( SSRIs ) block .
“ We do n’t know exactly what this means , but the results can help us understand why the occurrence of depression differs between the sexes and why men and women sometimes respond differently to treatment with antidepressant drugs , ” says associate professor Anna -Lena Nordström , who led the study .
The group has also shown that the serotonin system in healthy women differs from that in women with serious premenstrual mental symptoms .
These results suggest that the serotonin system in such women does not respond as flexibly to the hormone swings of the menstrual cycle as that in symptom - free women .
“ These findings indicate that when developing antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs , scientists should evaluate their effect on men and women separately , as well as their effects before and after menopause , ” says Ms Nordström .

Editor 's note : " Glenn Beck " is on Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
What do these stories all have in common ?
Glenn Beck : Florida and Michigan leaders have only themselves to blame if their delegates are n't seated .
A woman who says she lost more $ 1 million gambling in Atlantic City sues some casinos for $ 20 million , claiming they should 've stopped her compulsive gambling .
People who bought houses they could n't afford with loans they did n't understand want their lenders to change the terms .
Congress authorizes a war and then tries everything it can think of to get out of it .
Our country gets addicted to oil and then blames OPEC when it does n't like the price .
These stories prove how personal responsibility has all but vanished in America , and our government is leading the way .
Remember the kid from that interminable 1980s commercial whose father caught him using drugs ?
The father incredulously asked , " Who taught you how to do this stuff ? " and the kid responded , " You , alright ?
I learned it by watching you . "
Well , we are that kid and our government is that drug - using father who does n't think that anyone notices his bad habits .
Our government is leading us by example , and I do n't mean that in a good way .
For years , it has spent us into oblivion , mortgaging our future for programs we can't afford , and Americans have happily followed suit , running up credit card bills and home equity loans for things they never should 've bought .
Unfortunately , we 're also learning something else from our government : how to avoid taking responsibility for our actions .
From Eliot Spitzer 's alleged hooker craze to the revelation that Arnold Schwarzenegger commutes to work in a large private jet even as he preaches the dangers of carbon dioxide emissions , there 's never been a shortage of " do what I say , not what I do " hypocrites in politics .
But that same attitude has seemingly spread from individual politicians to an entire party .
Democrats are n't happy that delegates from Florida and Michigan wo n't be seated at the national convention because those states broke clear party rules .
Well you know what ?
Too bad .
We do n't say that enough anymore .
Too bad .
You agreed to the rules ; you broke them .
Now you 've got to deal with the consequences .
" But Glenn . ... Neither Hillary Clinton nor Barack Obama will have enough delegates to win the nomination .
We do n't want this to be decided in some backroom by superdelegates . "
Too bad .
" But Glenn . ...
You do n't understand .
If we do n't seat delegates from those states now , then we might lose their votes in the general election . "
Too bad .
" But Glenn . ....
The voters in these states are going to be disenfranchised if we do n't let their voices be heard . "
Too bad .
If you want to talk about disenfranchised voters , then let 's talk about why just 17 percent of Americans have a positive view of Congress .
Let 's talk about why we still have wide open borders despite most Americans wanting them sealed .
Let 's talk about why we keep selling out our sovereignty and our security by borrowing billions of dollars from - less - than friendly countries , such as China .
Americans are n't disenfranchised because our leaders wo n't count votes in a couple of states .
They 're disenfranchised because our leaders are n't doing their jobs .
They 're disenfranchised because after working hard to support their families and to raise kids who understand the difference between right and wrong , their leaders do exactly the opposite .
In the cases of Florida and Michigan , I 've patiently listened to all the moving arguments about why there should be a " do - over , " but quite honestly , they 're not arguments at all .
They 're excuses .
If this race was n't so close , or if these states offered a combined 36 delegates instead of 366 , do you really think anyone would care ?
Of course not .
But no matter what you think should happen , you have to admit that Clinton 's idea that we should simply count her " wins " in Florida and Michigan is completely ridiculous .
In fact , if you played a rimshot and a laugh track behind her every time she recited that line , people might actually agree to a two - drink minimum to see her speak .
How could you possibly count the results from an election when your main opponent was n't even on the ballot ( at least in Michigan ) ?
You can't -- unless you think the rules are simply there for your own amusement .
Last year , when the punishment against Florida was first approved , Donna Brazile , a member of the Democratic National Committee rules panel , said she hoped that the harsh consequences would " send a message to everybody in Florida that we are going to follow the rules . "
And Brazile knows a little something about that ... she ran Vice President Al Gore 's presidential campaign in 2000 .
Voters in Florida and Michigan should ask themselves one important question before they blindly follow their party :
Why did no one seem to care about " alienating " them last year when the rules were intentionally broken ?
It 's only now , when their vote really matters , that everyone is suddenly so concerned about " enfranchising " them .
Florida and Michigan have a golden opportunity to stand up and say enough is enough , to send a message that it 's time to not only take responsibility for their actions but for those of our leaders as well .
After all , what would it say about personal responsibility in this country if we allow the two states that broke all the rules to end up having the biggest say of all ?
E-mail to a friend
JOHNSTOWN , Pa.  Senator Barack Obama had a few words of advice Saturday for his rival , Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton :
Do not drop out on my account .
“ My attitude is that Senator Clinton can run as long as she wants , ” Mr. Obama , of Illinois , said at a news conference in a high school gymnasium here .
“ Her name is on the ballot .
She is a fierce and formidable opponent , and she obviously believes she would make the best nominee and the best president . ”
A few prominent Obama supporters have recently suggested that the time has come for Mrs. Clinton , of New York , to consider withdrawing from the race for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont , for one , said last week that Mrs. Clinton could not win the race and that her attacks on Mr. Obama were hurting “ more than anything that John McCain has said . ”
Mrs. Clinton ’s forces have mounted a vigorous counterattack , saying she trails by a fairly narrow margin in the overall popular vote and in the delegate count .
She has suggested to two allies that party leaders are trying to bully her .
Top U.S. Banks " Worse Than Nigeria "
Vlad Kalashnikov ( Email ) on March 21 , 2008
VLAD'S DAILY GLOAT
If you still do not understand how far America fell , and where it really is in comparison to Russia , then I want to leave you this weekend with this .
Bear Stearns , fifth largest American investment bank , voted " Most Admired " investment bank by Fortune magazine from 2005 - 2007 , was sold off for just $ 237 million to J.P. Morgan .
Now , compare this to a fifth - biggest Russian investment bank , UralSib .
It 's a bank that is not even four years old , has maybe 60 - 70 guys working there , some of them know English okay , some even know mathematics .
Guess how much UralSib is worth ?
At least $ 12.4 billion dollars , based on prices that investors willing to pay for UralSib shares .
That 's right , a fifth - biggest Russian investment bank is worth 50 times the equivalent in America .
Arrogant triumphalist Americans were always fond of the statement , " Russia is Upper Volta with nukes . "
Really made you guys feel so superior , laughing at people who poorer that you are .
So , who is the Upper Volta with nuclear missiles now , fuckers ?
Do n't just ask me , I 'm a Russian patriot who is biased , so read your own Reuters , in the article " Some Wall St Banks Seen Riskier Than Poor Countries " :
" You could say Lehman is riskier than Nigeria , " one trader said , asking not to be named .
" But it 's not a trade or a comparison people often try to make . "
Hey man , I make that comparison every day !
Anyone with a working brain or understanding of financial markets understand today 's American financial system is not even at the level of Nigeria .
It 's an insult to a Nigerian economy , because Nigeria has real products to sell that rest of the world wants , whereas America is completely broke and produces nothing but worthless financial instruments , which turn out to be as worthless as the collapsing American empire .
Hey man , I make that comparison every day !

A GROUP OF UPPER VOLTA INVESTORS PREPARES TO BUY OUT LEHMAN BROS .
It 's incredible to me that the trader quoted begs the Reuters reporter to be anonymous , like he is a scared Soviet refusnik in Stalin 's time .
In fact the trader is afraid of getting killed for telling the hard truth .
Ca n't blame him , anyone who tells the hard truth in crazy fanatical loser America can be killed by a mob of dumbfuck retards .
Only a British trader can speak openly about the hard reality :
" I think with Africa people feel they know what they are dealing with , " said Razia Khan , head of Africa economics at Standard Chartered in London .
" In contrast , everything else [ i.e. American financial system ] is a great unknown . "
No , America your are not even Upper Volta with nukes .
America is only nukes and that is it , nukes controlled by a mob of crazy bankrupt losers who know how to blow up the world but cannot do real work and make a real economy , that even Nigeria can do .
Maybe that is why Americans are voting for this black guy Barack Obama .
They hope that Africa will treat America well when homeless broke losers beg Nigeria for a credit line , and some oil .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Monday March 3 2008
In the report below ( regarding new interpretations of forensic evidence relating to the assassination of Robert Kennedy ) we stated that he was hit by four shots .
However , only three bullets entered his body ; the fourth was lodged in a shoulder pad .
One of the pistols referred to was a Harrington & Richardson and not , as we had it , a Harrison & Richardson .
This has been corrected .
The official record states that senator Robert F Kennedy , like his brother before him , was killed by a crazed lone gunman .
But the assassination of a man who seemed to embody so much hope for a bitterly divided country embroiled in an unpopular war still troubles this nation .
Little about the official explanation of the events at the Ambassador Hotel on June 5 1968 makes sense .
Now a new forensic analysis of the only audio recording of the fatal shots has given new weight to a controversial theory that there were in fact two shooters , and that the man convicted of Kennedy 's killing — Sirhan Sirhan - did not fire the fatal shots .
Following his victory speech to supporters after clinching a tight democratic primary victory in California , Kennedy left the podium in the Embassy ballroom to address a press conference .
Bloody mayhem
But the shortcut he and his entourage took through the hotel 's pantry quickly descended into bloody mayhem .
As Kennedy turned from shaking hands with two of the kitchen staff , a gunman stepped forward and began firing .
Kennedy was hit by four shots including one which lodged in the vertebrae in his neck and another which entered his brain from below his right ear .
He died in hospital the following day .
Five other people were injured but survived .
Sirhan - a Palestinian refugee who said he wanted to " sacrifice " Kennedy " for the cause of the poor exploited people " - was quickly apprehended .
He was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment .
" Sirhan was apprehended at the scene with literally a smoking gun , " said acoustic forensic expert Philip Van Praag of PVP Designs , who has carried out the new analysis .
" At the beginning many people looked upon this as an open - and - shut case .
It was one man , Sirhan Sirhan , who was observed by a number of people , who aimed and fired a gun in the direction of Kennedy 's entourage . "
Close range
But the lone gunman explanation has always looked shaky .
The autopsy of Kennedy 's body suggested that all four shots that hit him came from behind , and powder marks on his skin showed they must have been from close range .
But Sirhan was in front of Kennedy when he fired , and after shooting two shots was overcome by hotel staff , who pinned him to a table .
Also , Sirhan fired eight shots in total , yet 14 were found lodged around the room and in the victims .
" There is no doubt in our minds that no fewer than 14 shots were fired in the pantry on that evening and that Sirhan did not in fact kill Senator Kennedy , " said Robert Joling , a forensic scientist who has been involved with the Kennedy case for nearly 40 years .
He and Van Praag have published a book on the killing this week entitled " An Open and Shut Case " .
The inconsistencies in the case have bred numerous conspiracy theories , including the involvement of the CIA and the idea that Sirhan - who claims not to remember the shooting and pleaded insanity at his trial - was a " Manchurian Candidate " assassin who was hypnotically programmed to kill the senator .
Audio recording
Now Van Praag has added new weight to the ' two shooters ' theory .
He reanalysed the only audio recording of the shooting , which was made by an independent journalist , Stanislaw Pruszynski .
" At the time Pruszynski was not even aware that his recorder was still on , " said Van Praag .
The recording quality is poor , but it is possible to make out 13 shots over the course of just over 5 seconds , before what Van Praag describes as " blood - curdling screams " obscure the sound .
That is more than the eight rounds that Sirhan 's cheap Iver Johnson Cadet 55 revolver carried .
Also , there are two pairs of double shots that occurred so close together it is inconceivable that Sirhan could have fired them all .
The third and fourth shots and the seventh and eighth were separated by 122 and 149 milliseconds respectively .
In tests , a trained firearms expert firing under ideal conditions could only manage 366 milliseconds between shots using the same weapon .
And he was not being pinned to a table at the time .
Frequency anomalies
Lastly , five of the shots - 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 and 12 in the sequence - were found to have odd acoustic characteristics when specific frequencies were analysed separately .
Van Praag thinks this is because they came from a different gun pointing away from Pruszynski's microphone .
To recreate this he recorded the sounds made by firing the Iver Johnson and another revolver , a Harrington and Richardson 922 .
At least one member of Kennedy 's entourage was carrying this weapon when the killing happened .
In the acoustic tests it produced the same frequency anomalies Van Praag had seen in the original recording but only when fired away from the microphone .
He presented his results on Thursday at the American Academy of Forensic Sciences annual meeting in Washington DC .
Paul Schrade , a close associate of Kennedy 's who was director of the United Auto Workers union , was at the senator 's side in the pantry and was shot in the head .
He told the meeting that America lost an outstanding leader and potentially great president that day .
Lost hope
" I think we were in a position of really changing this country , " he said .
" What we lost was a real hope and possibility of having a better country and having better relations around the world . "
He wants to see the case reopened and properly investigated .
" We 're going to go ahead and do our best to find out who the second gunman was and that 's going to take a lot of work , " he said .
Van Praag also wants the case reexamined .
" We would hope that the evidence that we have uncovered ... would make a strong enough case to get serious consideration once again by the authorities , " he said .

The area holds huge reserves in oil and gas
The federal Minerals Management Service said it would take bids next month for concessions in the Chukchi Sea , which separates Alaska from Siberia .
But environmental groups fear the effects on wildlife in the region , including the polar bear population .
There have been no lease sales for over 15 years and the groups fear further exploration could damage marine life .
Rich reserves
Energy exploration in Alaska has always been a tough choice between preserving one of the planet 's last great areas of pristine wilderness and the potential for huge profits to be made from its development .
The American sectors of the Chukchi Sea are believed to hold 15bn barrels of recoverable oil and over two trillion cubic metres of natural gas .
But the authorities had not held a lease sale in the sea since 1991 , both due to the difficulties and cost involved in extraction from the Arctic continental shelf and concerns over the environment .
There are fears for the polar bear population
The Minerals Management Service says exploration will not be allowed to take place any closer than 80 km ( 50 miles ) from the shoreline , therefore striking a balance between development and protection of coastal resources .
But ecologists say any further exploration could have a major impact on marine life , with polar bears one of the hardest - hit species .
The Chukchi Sea is home to one of two populations of polar bears in the US , and their numbers have already been depleted by loss of habitat due to global warming .
Many protestors are angry at the timing of the announcement , which comes days before the US Fish and Wildlife Service decides whether to list the polar bear as a threatened species .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The mom and pop businesses that make up the bulk of America ’s employers , key players in scuttling health reform during the Clinton years , say years of crushing costs have them backing major changes this time around .

The National Federation of Independent Business helped derail President Bill Clinton ’s effort to overhaul the health insurance system during the 1990s , with a massive direct mail and telephone campaign , and a blitz of lawmaker lobbying .
Now , small companies with an average of 10 workers are bearing the greatest burden of insurance premium increases , which have grown twice as fast as inflation for several years .
They ’ve started lobbying the presidential candidates early and are pushing for changes to taxes and state laws .
“ The situation for small business is much worse than it was in 1994 in terms of cost , ” said Todd Stottlemyer , the group ’s president .
“ We ca n’t just say ‘ no ’ today . ”
It is much cheaper per employee for large companies to provide health insurance , with more employees to balance risk and spread administrative costs .
And workers pay 18 percent more for premiums than their counterparts at larger firms , according to a study by the Commonwealth Fund , a nonprofit research group .
“ The NFIB is starting to listen to its members , ” said Peter Harbage , a Democratic health strategist who has worked for former presidential candidate John Edwards .
“ The whole health - care system seems designed to work against small business . ”
These companies represent 80 percent of total U.S. employment .
The influence lies in these hard numbers , but also their ubiquitousness in grass - roots politics .
“ These are the business people that go to the Rotary Club lunches their congressman speaks at , ” said Robert Laszewski , president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates , a consulting firm .
“ They have the numbers , and the personal relationships with the congressmen . ”
The group launched its multimillion - dollar campaign earlier this month , including letters to the candidates and town hall meetings with members nationwide .
Polls among its members have found one in three small - business owners say their No. 1 voting issue in the 2008 presidential election will be fixing health care .
EARLY INFLUENCE
And they ’ve already influenced the debate .
Democratic presidential hopeful Senator Hillary Clinton of New York , who led the overhaul effort for Bill Clinton , makes an exception for small businesses in her proposal to require employers to provide insurance or pay into a fund that does .
That is a direct result of NFIB ’s opposition to her earlier efforts , experts said .
The group has not taken a position on mandates that individuals buy insurance and held a briefing to explore the issue this week .
Stottlemyer said the group backs proposals letting small businesses pool together for greater leverage with insurers .
“ All three ( candidates ) are talking about it , but they are not at a deep detail level right now , ” he said .
“ We ’re urging them for more details . ”
In general , the Democrats seek universal coverage by building on the current employment - based insurance system , while McCain wants to encourage individuals to buy insurance outside of work by revising the tax system .
McCain proposes eliminating the tax breaks employees receive by getting insurance through work .
Individual buyers of insurance do n’t get those tax benefits .
In the small - business community , about half are forced to buy their insurance individually , which is far more expensive than group plans , Stottlemyer said .
“ There is some equalization that we think needs to take place , ” he said .
Experts say that taking away the employer tax incentives could encourage employers to abandon health insurance altogether .
Critics also worry that more flexibility in state insurance regulations may dilute consumer protections .
Either way , small business will take a lead in influencing the debate .
“ They were a major player in dumping the Clinton plan .
They do n’t want to be the enemy this time , ” Henry Aaron , a health - care economist at the Brookings Institution , said .
“ They know it ’s a national problem . ”

The Clinton campaign confirms Geraldine Ferraro has stepped down from her role on the finance committee of Sen. Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign after making racially charged remarks about Sen. Barack Obama .
Ferraro notified Clinton by letter Wednesday that she would no longer serve on Clinton 's finance committee as " Honorary New York Leadership Council Chair , " reported the Associated Press .
Ferraro notified Clinton by letter Wednesday that she would no longer serve on Clinton 's finance committee as " Honorary New York Leadership Council Chair . "
The AP reported Ferraro wrote a letter to Clinton , saying : " Dear Hillary , I am stepping down from your finance committee so I can speak for myself and you can continue to speak for yourself about what 's at stake in this campaign .
The Obama campaign is attacking me to hurt you .
I wo n't let that happen .
Thank you for everything you 've done and continue to do to make this a better world for my children and grandchildren .
You have my deep admiration and respect , Gerry , " read the letter , first reported by CNN .
Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson told the AP it was Ferraro 's decision to leave the campaign .
Ferraro could not be immediately reached by ABC News for comment .
Just this morning , Ferraro stood by her controversial comments suggesting Obama would n't be succeeding in the Democratic nomination battle if he were n't black .
" I am sorry that people think this was a racist comment , " Ferraro said in an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer on " Good Morning America " Wednesday .
She declined to apologize directly for the firestorm she created when she told a local California newspaper that " if Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position . "
Ferraro , the 1984 Democratic vice presidential candidate , told Sawyer she was " absolutely not " sorry for what she 'd said , suggesting she had tried to pay Obama a compliment .
Ferraro said she was saying that " the black community came out with ... pride in [ Obama 's ] candidacy .
You would think he would say ' thank you ' for doing that .
Instead , I 'm charged with being a racist . "
Ferraro told " GMA " she was drawing a comparison to her own history , contending that if she had not been a woman Walter Mondale would not have chosen her as his running mate in 1984 -- a point she also made in the newspaper interview .

Obama Speaks
Obama also appeared on " GMA , " fresh from his victory in Tuesday 's Mississippi primary .
Today he declined to say whether he believed Ferraro should be fired .
" I 'll leave that to the Clinton campaign , " he said , but added when people associated with his campaign have made objectionable comments , they were fired .
Obama scoffed at the notion that being black " is a huge advantage " for him .
" The quickest path to the presidency [ is not ] I want to be an African - American man named Barack Obama , " he said .
A fundraiser and outspoken supporter for Clinton , Ferraro was the first woman chosen by a major political party to be its vice presidential candidate .
In an interview Tuesday with ABC News affiliate WHTM , Clinton ignored calls from the Obama campaign to remove Ferraro from her campaign , saying , " Well , I do n't agree with that , and I think it 's important that we try to stay focused on issues that matter to the American people . "
In a relatively mild response , Clinton continued , " And both of us have had supporters and staff members who 've gone over the line , and we have to rein them in and try to keep this on the issues .
There are big differences between us on the issues — let 's stay focused on that . "
Obama chided Clinton for Ferraro 's comment to a Pennsylvania newspaper .
" I do n't think Geraldine Ferraro 's comments have any place in our politics or in the Democratic Party , " Obama told Pennsylvania 's Allentown Morning Call newspaper .
" They are divisive .
I think anybody who understands the history of this country knows they are patently absurd .
And I would expect that the same way those comments do n't have a place in my campaign they should n't have a place in Sen. Clinton 's either . "
Ferraro , a 72 - year - old lawyer and former congresswoman , told a California newspaper that this campaign has been " very emotional " for her and suggested Clinton has been a victim of a " very sexist media . "
" I think what America feels about a woman becoming president takes a very secondary place to Obama 's campaign — to a kind of campaign that it would be hard for anyone to run against , " Ferraro told California 's Daily Breeze local paper .
" For one thing , you have the press , which has been uniquely hard on her , " she said .
" It 's been a very sexist media .
Some just do n't like her .
The others have gotten caught up in the Obama campaign . "
Obama Aide Resigned After ' Monster ' Remark
Ferraro 's controversial comments made news less than a week after Obama 's senior foreign policy adviser Samantha Power resigned from the Illinois senator 's campaign for calling Clinton " a monster . ''
The Obama campaign held a conference call with reporters Tuesday with Obama supporter Rep. Jan Schakowsky , D - Ill. , arguing that Ferraro 's words " undermine " Democrats ' " ability to win in November . "
" It 's disappointing that Clinton supporters have sought to somehow diminish Sen .
Obama 's candidacy and his support by suggesting he's in some way being given preferential treatment because of his race , " Schakowsky said .
" Any and all remarks that diminish Sen .
Obama 's candidacy because of his race are completely out of line . "
Schakowsky urged Clinton to call on all of her advisers and supporters to change the tone of the campaign .
Obama campaign manager David Axelrod added the comment was " part of an insidious pattern that needs to be addressed " within the Clinton campaign , pointing to Clinton 's remark on " 60 Minutes " that rumors of Obama being a Muslim are n't true , " as far as I know , " she said .
" When you wink and nod at offensive statements , you 're really sending a signal to your supporters that anything goes , " Axelrod said , arguing that Clinton is seen as a " divisive and polarizing force . "
The Obama campaign pounced Tuesday afternoon on Clinton 's mild statement about Ferraro 's remark , referring to language Clinton used when she urged Obama to denounce and reject anti-Semitic comments by Nation of Islam head Louis Farrakhan .
" With Sen . Clinton 's refusal to denounce or reject Ms. Ferraro , she has once again proven that her campaign gets to live by its own rules and its own double standard , and will only decry offensive comments when it 's politically advantageous to Sen.
Clinton , " Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said .
" Her refusal to take responsibility for her own supporter 's remarks is exactly the kind of tactic that feeds the American people 's cynicism about politics today , and it's why Barack Obama 's message of change has resonated so strongly in every corner of the country , " Burton said .
Ferraro is currently a lobbyist in New York with Blank Rome Government Relations .
Campaign Surrogates Go Off - Message
It 's not the first time a Democratic surrogate has made controversial remarks .
Obama 's senior economic adviser Austan Goolsbee told Canadian diplomats the candidate 's anti-NAFTA rhetoric should be interpreted as political positioning and not an articulation of policy , according to a Canadian government memo .
Obama foreign policy adviser Susan Rice was part of a mini firestorm last week when she appeared to go off message and said that neither Obama nor Clinton is ready to answer the proverbial 3 a.m. phone call in the White House .
" Clinton has n't had to answer the phone at three o'clock in the morning and yet she attacked Barack Obama for not being ready .
They 're both not ready to have that 3 a.m. phone call , " Rice told MSNBC last week .
At the time , the Clinton campaign e-mailed a YouTube video of the interview to reporters .
Earlier in the campaign , Bill Shaheen , a Clinton campaign co-chairman in New Hampshire , stepped aside after making remarks about Obama 's past drug use .
The Clinton campaign also fired Iowa staffers who forwarded e-mails with false rumors that Obama is a Muslim .
Ferraro 's comments appeared to highlight her frustration with Obama 's campaign .
The Illinois senator is leading Clinton in popular support and pledged delegates , according to ABC News ' delegate scorecard .
In the interview with the newspaper , Ferraro also rejected the notion that Obama will bring together Republicans and Democrats .
" I was reading an article that said young Republicans are out there campaigning for Obama because they believe he 's going to be able to put an end to partisanship , " Ferraro said .
" Dear God !
Anyone that has worked in the Congress knows that for over 200 years this country has had partisanship — that 's the way our country is . "
In February , Ferraro made similarly racially - charged remarks on Fox News Radio's John Gibson show .
When asked about the decision of Rep. John Lewis , D - Ga. , to abandon his endorsement of Clinton in favor of Obama , Ferraro said : " I 'm very disappointed .
When I see John Lewis .
He 's turning around — this is a civil rights leader .
Why in God 's name did he change his vote from Hillary to Barack Obama ?
I 'll tell you why .
He 's not going to lose a Democratic primary in his district in two years , but he sure as hell will face one if he sticks it to Barack Obama when he has a greater majority of blacks in his district .
He 's not going to lose .
I 'm so disappointed in him , I could die .
" John , between me and you and your millions of listeners , if Barack Obama were a white man , would we be talking about this as a potential real problem for Hillary Clinton ? ?
If he were a woman of any color , would he be in this position that he 's in ?
Absolutely not , " Ferraro said .
" Geraldine , are you playing the race card ? " the host asked .
" No , and that 's the problem .
Every time you say the truth —
I 'm the first person , John , and you know how honest I am — I am the first person who will say in 1984 , if my name were Gerard instead of Geraldine , I would never have been picked as the vice presidential candidate . "
In a follow - up interview with the local California paper that broke the story , Ferraro defended her remarks .
" Any time anybody does anything that in any way pulls this campaign down and says let 's address reality and the problems we 're facing in this world , you 're accused of being racist , so you have to shut up , " Ferraro told the Daily Breeze .
" Racism works in two different directions .
I really think they 're attacking me because I 'm white .
How 's that ? "
It was n't immediately clear Wednesday what persuaded Ferraro to step aside from her role as a fundraiser and Clinton campaign finance committee member ; however the Obama campaign had pounced extraordinarily hard on the comment , suggesting it was indicative of Clinton 's " kitchen sink " strategy .
ABC News ' Eloise Harper , Steven Portnoy , Sunlen Miller and David Wright and the Associated Press contributed reporting .
Sen . Barack Obama 's remarks
Ten months ago , I stood on the steps of the Old State Capitol in Springfield , Ill. , and began an unlikely journey to change America .
I did not run for the presidency to fulfill some long - held ambition or because I believed it was somehow owed to me .
I chose to run in this election — at this moment — because of what Dr. King called “ the fierce urgency of now . ”
Because we are at a defining moment in our history .
Our nation is at war .
Our planet is in peril .
Our health care system is broken , our economy is out of balance , our education system fails too many of our children , and our retirement system is in tatters .
Advertisement
At this defining moment , we cannot wait any longer for universal health care .
We can not wait to fix our schools .
We cannot wait for good jobs , and living wages , and pensions we can count on .
We cannot wait to halt global warming , and we cannot wait to end this war in Iraq .
I chose to run because I believed that the size of these challenges had outgrown the capacity of our broken and divided politics to solve them ; because I believed that Americans of every political stripe were hungry for a new kind of politics , a politics that focused not just on how to win but why we should , a politics that focused on those values and ideals that we held in common as Americans ; a politics that favored common sense over ideology , straight talk over spin .
Most of all , I believed in the power of the American people to be the real agents of change in this country — because we are not as divided as our politics suggests ; because we are a decent , generous people willing to work hard and sacrifice for future generations ; and I was certain that if we could just mobilize our voices to challenge the special interests that dominate Washington and challenge ourselves to reach for something better , there was no problem we could n’t solve — no destiny we could n’t fulfill .
Ten months later , Iowa , you have vindicated that faith .
You ’ve come out in the blistering heat and the bitter cold not just to cheer , but to challenge — to ask the tough questions ; to lift the hood and kick the tires ; to serve as one place in America where someone who has n’t spent their life in the Washington spotlight can get a fair hearing .
You ’ve earned the role you play in our democracy because no one takes it more seriously .
And I believe that ’s true this year more than ever because , like me , you feel that same sense of urgency .
All across this state , you ’ve shared with me your stories .
And all too often they ’ve been stories of struggle and hardship .
I ’ve heard from seniors who were betrayed by CEOs who dumped their pensions while pocketing bonuses , and from those who still ca n’t afford their prescriptions because Congress refused to negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price .
I ’ve met Maytag workers who labored all their lives only to see their jobs shipped overseas ; who now compete with their teenagers for $ 7 - an - hour jobs at Wal - Mart .
I ’ve spoken with teachers who are working at doughnut shops after school just to make ends meet , who are still digging into their own pockets to pay for school supplies .
Just two weeks ago , I heard a young woman in Cedar Rapids who told me she only gets three hours of sleep because she works the night shift after a full day of college and still ca n’t afford health care for a sister with cerebral palsy .
She spoke not with self - pity but with determination , and wonders why the government is n’t doing more to help her afford the education that will allow her to live out her dreams .
I ’ve spoken to veterans who talk with pride about what they ’ve accomplished in Afghanistan and Iraq , but who nevertheless think of those they ’ve left behind and question the wisdom of our mission in Iraq ; the mothers weeping in my arms over the memories of their sons ; the disabled or homeless vets who wonder why their service has been forgotten .
And I ’ve spoken to Americans in every corner of the state , patriots all , who wonder why we have allowed our standing in the world to decline so badly , so quickly .
They know this has not made us safer .
They know that we must never negotiate out of fear , but that we must never fear to negotiate with our enemies as well as our friends .
They are ashamed of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and warrantless wiretaps and ambiguity on torture .
They love their country and want its cherished values and ideals restored .
It is precisely because you ’ve experienced these frustrations , and seen the cost of inaction in your own lives , that you understand why we ca n’t afford to settle for the same old politics .
You know that we ca n’t afford to allow the insurance lobbyists to kill health care reform one more time , and the oil lobbyists to keep us addicted to fossil fuels because no one stood up and took their power away when they had the chance .
You know that we ca n’t afford four more years of the same divisive food fight in Washington that ’s about scoring political points instead of solving problems ; that ’s about tearing your opponents down instead of lifting this country up .
We ca n’t afford the same politics of fear that tells Democrats that the only way to look tough on national security is to talk , act and vote like George Bush Republicans ; that invokes 9/11 as a way to scare up votes instead of a challenge that should unite all Americans to defeat our real enemies .
We ca n’t afford to be so worried about losing the next election that we lose the battles we owe to the next generation .
The real gamble in this election is playing the same Washington game with the same Washington players and expecting a different result .
And that ’s a risk we ca n’t take .
Not this year .
Not when the stakes are this high .
In this election , it is time to turn the page .
In seven days , it is time to stand for change .
This has been our message since the beginning of this campaign .
It was our message when we were down , and our message when we were up .
And it must be catching on , because in these last few weeks , everyone is talking about change .
But you ca n’t at once argue that you ’re the master of a broken system in Washington and offer yourself as the person to change it .
You ca n’t fall in line behind the conventional thinking on issues as profound as war and offer yourself as the leader who is best prepared to chart a new and better course for America .
The truth is , you can have the right kind of experience and the wrong kind of experience .
Mine is rooted in the real lives of real people and it will bring real results if we have the courage to change .
I believe deeply in those words .
But they are not mine .
They were Bill Clinton ’s in 1992 , when Washington insiders questioned his readiness to lead .
My experience is rooted in the lives of the men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I fought for as an organizer when the local steel plant closed .
It ’s rooted in the lives of the people I stood up for as a civil rights lawyer when they were denied opportunity on the job or justice at the voting booth because of what they looked like or where they came from .
It ’s rooted in an understanding of how the world sees America that I gained from living , traveling and having family beyond our shores — an understanding that led me to oppose this war in Iraq from the start .
It ’s experience rooted in the real lives of real people , and it ’s the kind of experience Washington needs right now .
There are others in this race who say that this kind of change sounds good , but that I ’m not angry or confrontational enough to get it done .
Well , let me tell you something , Iowa .
I do n’t need any lectures on how to bring about change , because I have n’t just talked about it on the campaign trail .
I ’ve fought for change all my life .
I walked away from a job on Wall Street to bring job training to the jobless and after - school programs to kids on the streets of Chicago .
I turned down the big - money law firms to win justice for the powerless as a civil rights lawyer .
I took on the lobbyists in Illinois and brought Democrats and Republicans together to expand health care to 150,000 people and pass the first major campaign finance reform in 25 years ; and I did the same thing in Washington when we passed the toughest lobbying reform since Watergate .
I ’m the only candidate in this race who has n’t just talked about taking power away from lobbyists , I ’ve actually done it .
So if you want to know what kind of choices we ’ll make as president , you should take a look at the choices we made when we had the chance to bring about change that was n’t easy or convenient .
That ’s the kind of change that ’s more than just rhetoric — that ’s change you can believe in .
It ’s change that wo n’t just come from more anger at Washington or turning up the heat on Republicans .
There ’s no shortage of anger and bluster and bitter partisanship out there .
We do n’t need more heat .
We need more light .
I ’ve learned in my life that you can stand firm in your principles while still reaching out to those who might not always agree with you .
And although the Republican operatives in Washington might not be interested in hearing what we have to say , I think Republican and independent voters outside of Washington are .
That ’s the once - in - a - generation opportunity we have in this election .
For the first time in a long time , we have the chance to build a new majority of not just Democrats , but independents and Republicans who ’ve lost faith in their Washington leaders but want to believe again — who desperately want something new .
We can change the electoral math that ’s been all about division and make it about addition — about building a coalition for change and progress that stretches through blue states and red states .
That ’s how I won some of the reddest , most Republican counties in Illinois .
That ’s why the polls show that I do best against the Republicans running for president — because we ’re attracting more support from independents and Republicans than any other candidate .
That ’s how we ’ll win in November and that ’s how we ’ll change this country over the next four years .
In the end , the argument we are having between the candidates in the last seven days is not just about the meaning of change .
It ’s about the meaning of hope .
Some of my opponents appear scornful of the word ; they think it speaks of naiveté , passivity and wishful thinking .
But that ’s not what hope is .
Hope is not blind optimism .
It ’s not ignoring the enormity of the task before us or the roadblocks that stand in our path .
Yes , the lobbyists will fight us .
Yes , the Republican attack dogs will go after us in the general election .
Yes , the problems of poverty and climate change and failing schools will resist easy repair .
I know —
I ’ve been on the streets ; I ’ve been in the courts .
I ’ve watched legislation die because the powerful held sway and good intentions were n’t fortified by political will , and I ’ve watched a nation get misled into war because no one had the judgment or the courage to ask the hard questions before we sent our troops to fight .
But I also know this .
I know that hope has been the guiding force behind the most improbable changes this country has ever made .
In the face of tyranny , it ’s what led a band of colonists to rise up against an Empire .
In the face of slavery , it ’s what fueled the resistance of the slave and the abolitionist , and what allowed a president to chart a treacherous course to ensure that the nation would not continue half slave and half free .
In the face of war and Depression , it ’s what led the greatest of generations to free a continent and heal a nation .
In the face of oppression , it ’s what led young men and women to sit at lunch counters and brave fire hoses and march through the streets of Selma and Montgomery for freedom ’s cause .
That ’s the power of hope — to imagine , and then work for , what had seemed impossible before .
That ’s the change we seek .
And that ’s the change you can stand for in seven days .
We ’ve already beaten odds that the cynics said could n’t be beaten .
When we started 10 months ago , they said we could n’t run a different kind of campaign .
They said we could n’t compete without taking money from Washington lobbyists .
But you proved them wrong when we raised more small donations from more Americans than any other campaign in history .
They said we could n’t be successful if we did n’t have the full support of the establishment in Washington .
But you proved them wrong when we built a grass - roots movement that could forever change the face of American politics .
They said we would n’t have a chance in this campaign unless we resorted to the same old negative attacks .
But we resisted , even when we were written off , and ran a positive campaign that pointed out real differences and rejected the politics of slash and burn .
And now , in seven days , you have a chance once again to prove the cynics wrong .
In seven days , what was improbable has the chance to beat what Washington said was inevitable .
And that ’s why in these last weeks , Washington is fighting back with everything it has — with attack ads and insults ; with distractions and dishonesty ; with millions of dollars from outside groups and undisclosed donors to try and block our path .
We ’ve seen this script many times before .
But I know that this time can be different .
Because I know that when the American people believe in something , it happens .
If you believe , then we can tell the lobbyists that their days of setting the agenda in Washington are over .
If you believe , then we can stop making promises to America ’s workers and start delivering — jobs that pay , health care that ’s affordable , pensions you can count on , and a tax cut for working Americans instead of the companies who send their jobs overseas .
If you believe , we can offer a world - class education to every child , and pay our teachers more , and make college dreams a reality for every American .
If you believe , we can save this planet and end our dependence on foreign oil .
If you believe , we can end this war , close Guantanamo , restore our standing , renew our diplomacy and once again respect the Constitution of the United States of America .
That ’s the future within our reach .
That ’s what hope is — that thing inside us that insists , despite all evidence to the contrary , that something better is waiting for us around the corner .
But only if we ’re willing to work for it and fight for it .
To shed our fears and our doubts and our cynicism .
To glory in the task before us of remaking this country block by block , precinct by precinct , county by county , state by state .
There is a moment in the life of every generation when , if we are to make our mark on history , this spirit must break through .
This is the moment .
This is our time .
And if you will stand with me in seven days — if you will stand for change so that our children have the same chance that somebody gave us ; if you ’ll stand to keep the American dream alive for those who still hunger for opportunity and thirst for justice ; if you ’re ready to stop settling for what the cynics tell you you must accept , and finally reach for what you know is possible , then we will win this caucus , we will win this election , we will change the course of history , and the real journey — to heal a nation and repair the world — will have truly begun .
Thank you .

French President Nicolas Sarkozy has spoken out in defence of his country 's financial standards , in the wake of the rogue trader scandal that cost one of its biggest banks $ 8.2 billion .
Mr Sarkozy moved to shore up his country 's reputation in the financial world , saying the scandal did not affect the " solidity and reliability of France 's financial system " .
Yesterday Societe Generale filed a legal complaint against 31 - year - old trader Jerome Kerviel , accusing him of a massive fraud .
The Paris prosecutor 's office has also opened a preliminary investigation .
There has still been no public sighting of Mr Kerviel , but his lawyer says he has not left the country and is willing to talk to police .
French police have visited his home but his whereabouts remain a mystery .
It has been claimed that the value of Mr Kerviel 's dealings was much higher than the actual losses , running into tens of billions of dollars .
Some financial experts are sceptical that he could have concealed such activities successfully .
Some stock market traders believe that the bank 's problems contributed to the plunge in world stock markets earlier this week .
Societe General sold huge amounts of shares as it tried to unwind what the French trader had done .
Stock markets across Europe have bounced back partly because of positive signs from the US , but also because many believe the panic selling at the start of the week was made worse by the French bank untangling its dodgy deals .
Financial watchdogs in London and Paris now want to know if anyone knew about the scandal before it became public knowledge , making money as the bank sorted out its problems .
The pulp is a fiber - rich byproduct of sucrose extraction procedures used by sugar beet processors .
Most of the 40 million tons of U.S. sugar beet pulp generated each year is used as an inexpensive livestock feed or pet - food ingredient .
But ARS chemists Victoria Finkenstadt and LinShu Liu aim to breathe new economic life into the pulp .
Finkenstadt is with the ARS National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research ( NCAUR ) in Peoria , Ill .
Liu is with the ARS Eastern Regional Research Center in Wyndmoor , Pa. Since 2004 , they 've collaborated on a project to convert sugar beet pulp into a specialized filler material for polylactic - acid - based plastics .

Polylactic acid ( PLA ) is considered a promising natural alternative to petroleum - based thermoplastics like polypropylene because PLA has comparable tensile strength and other mechanical properties , but is biodegradable .
But PLA is costlier because of the complex processes required to derive it from fermented corn sugars , according to Finkenstandt , in NCAUR 's Plant Polymer Research Unit .
Working with Liu's team at Wyndmoor , Finkenstadt and her Peoria colleagues showed that glycerol can be used to plasticize the pulp and reshape its particulate matter into tendrils .
Early tests have been promising , but showed that the PLA 's tensile strength decreased in relation to the amount of sugar beet pulp or plasticizer that was added .
To get around the problem , Liu's group plans on chemically modifying the pulp so that its tendrils and the PLA matrix form a stronger bond .
Potential uses for pulp - based PLA composites range from nondurable goods such as water bottles , cups and packaging , to lightweight indoor - construction materials such as wallboard , tabletops and pressed furniture .

On behalf of this tiny , privileged base , the CIA has placed itself above all law and supervision .
The CIA 's war on the world has claimed an estimated 12 million to 20 million victims , far more than the best estimates attributed to Adolph Hitler 's ' Holocaust ' of World War II .
A war of plunder waged by the CIA on much of the world has been called the Third World War because many of its victims are chauvinistically , imperialistically , termed " third world " .
Given the magnitude of these CIA atrocities , we may , indeed , consider this panoply of terrorist acts a world war waged by privilege upon those who are less privileged , a war waged by the rich on the poor , a war of aggression by those who have against those who are without .
The official history of the CIA is dull reading .
But one would not expect an official document of the US government to reveal the early connections between the CIA and Yale 's notorious Skull and Bones society ; one would not expect the US government to reveal the nature of CIA backed coups in Chile to its role in the notorious Bay of Pigs debacle .
One would not expect an official document to detail the role played by the CIA in the Iran / Contra affair .
One would not expect a sanitized government version of the CIA to reveal how the CIA creates and support death squads that have resulted in a holocaust not seen since the Third Reich .
The passage of the National Security Act in July 1947 legislated the changes in the Executive branch that had been under discussion since 1945 .
The Act established an independent Air Force , provided for coordination by a committee of service chiefs , the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS ) , and a Secretary of Defense , and created the National Security Council ( NSC ) .
The CIG became an independent department and was renamed the Central Intelligence Agency .
Under the Act , the CIA 's mission was only loosely defined , since efforts to thrash out the CIA 's duties in specific terms would have contributed to the tension surrounding the unification of the services .
The four general tasks assigned to the Agency were to advise the NSC on matters related to national security ; to make recommendations to the NSC regarding the coordination of intelligence activities of the Departments ; to correlate and evaluate intelligence and provide for its appropriate dissemination and " to perform such other functions ... as the NSC will from time to time direct .... "
-- CIA Organizational Development , [ Adapted from : United States Senate Select Committee on Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities , Foreign and Military Intelligence -- Book I , 94th Congress , 2nd Session , 26 April 1976 , pages 102 - 118 . ]
The numbers do n't lie !
At the end of a detailed statistical study , the CIA will be found , like a spider in its web , at the bump on a bell curve , at the very nexus of murder , mayhem and heinous acts of terrorism that it has exported across the globe and behind the deaths of US citizens in America .
CIA atrocities may be categorized .
Secret Wars
Assassinations
Subversions of targeted regimes
Overt terrorism
Support of other terrorist organizations
Exploitation and / or creation of terrorist organizations like 'al Qaeda ' .
Drug sales , primarily cocaine and its derivative -- crack .
Domestic Assassinations and acts of terrorism
The US government , especially under the GOP regimes of Ronald Reagan , Bush Sr , and now the shrub , have given up the dream of peace .
The result is an Orwellian nightmare , a state of perpetual war put into effect by the CIA , the Praetorian Guard to America 's privileged elite .
The nightmares -- domestic and foreign -- are of our own making .
Worse than " mutually assured destruction " , this thug government within a government may very well spell the end of humankind , at least the end of those dreams that make life worth living .
It was an avoidable choice forced upon us by incompetent , cowardly and corrupt right wing inspired ' leadership ' .
CIA Mission : Prop Up Right Wing Extremists and Elites ; Suppress Everyone Else In Latin America , Central America , this same system is working .
If the people do n't like it , you organize the police into death squads , as we 've done in many countries , including , conspicuously , El Salvador , and you kill enough of them that they are emasculated .
They can't do anything about it .
They are crippled .
They are repressed , suppressed and oppressed , and you can get by with this system of milking the countries to your will and to your way .
The [ Sen. Frank ] Church Committee of 1975 .....
Again this is not a lecture about the Secret Wars of the CIA .
That 's a separate lecture .
I could give it again , but it takes a full hour in its own right .
But you must know how the CIA weaves into this war complex - this war machinery of ours .
-- John Stockwell , The CIA and the Gulf War According to Stockwell , the Church Committee of 1975 discovered over thirteen thousand covert operations since World War II .
Late in 1974 , investigative reporter Seymour Hersh revealed that the CIA was not only destabilizing foreign governments , but was also conducting illegal intelligence operations against thousands of American citizens .
On January 27 , 1975 , an aroused Senate voted overwhelmingly to establish a special 11 - member investigating body along the lines of the recently concluded Watergate Committee .
Under the chairmanship of Idaho Senator Frank Church , with Texas Senator John Tower as vice - chairman , the select committee was given nine months and 150 staffers to complete its work .
The so - called Church Committee ran into immediate resistance from the Ford administration , concerned about exposing American intelligence operations and suspicious of Church 's budding presidential ambitions .
The committee interviewed 800 individuals , and conducted 250 executive and 21 public hearings .
At the first televised hearing , staged in the Senate Caucus Room , Chairman Church dramatically displayed a CIA poison dart gun to highlight the committee 's discovery that the CIA directly violated a presidential order by maintaining stocks of shellfish toxin sufficient to kill thousands .
Church Committee Created Stockwell maintains that many of these ' covert operations ' were violent and led to wars .
Examples include the propaganda campaign that led directly to the Korean and Viet Nam wars .
... we have so many of them in the public record that it 's obviously very difficult to know exactly how many people died in Vietnam or in Korea or in Nicaragua or in the Congo - but still , working with conservative figures we come up with a minimum figure of SIX MILLION PEOPLE killed in the Secret Wars of the CIA through its de-stabilizations over these past forty years :
One million people killed in the Korean War ;
Two million people killed in Vietnam ;
One to two million people killed in Cambodia ;
Eight hundred thousand people killed in Indonesia ;
Fifty thousand people killed in Angola .

While no woman has been president of the United States  yet  the world does have several thousand years ’ worth of experience with female leaders .
And I have to acknowledge it :
Their historical record puts men’s to shame .
A notable share of the great leaders in history have been women : Queen Hatshepsut and Cleopatra of Egypt , Empress Wu Zetian of China , Isabella of Castile , Queen Elizabeth I of England , Catherine the Great of Russia , and Maria Theresa of Austria .
Granted , I ’m neglecting the likes of Bloody Mary , but it ’s still true that those women who climbed to power in monarchies had an astonishingly high success rate .
Research by political psychologists points to possible explanations .
Scholars find that women , compared with men , tend to excel in consensus - building and certain other skills useful in leadership .
If so , why have female political leaders been so much less impressive in the democratic era ?
Margaret
Thatcher was a transformative figure , but women have been mediocre prime ministers or presidents in countries like Sri Lanka , India , Bangladesh , Pakistan , the Philippines and Indonesia .
Often , they have n’t even addressed the urgent needs of women in those countries .
I have a pet theory about what ’s going on .
In monarchies , women who rose to the top dealt mostly with a narrow elite , so they could prove themselves and get on with governing .
But in democracies in the television age , female leaders also have to navigate public prejudices  and these make democratic politics far more challenging for a woman than for a man .
A fragment of a bangle made of a shell found only at the Red Sea suggests possible trade links with the cradle of agriculture in the Near East .
Credit : UCLA
Archaeologists from UCLA and the University of Groningen ( RUG ) in the Netherlands have found the earliest evidence ever discovered of an ancient Egyptian agricultural settlement , including farmed grains , remains of domesticated animals , pits for cooking and even floors for what appear to be dwellings , the National Geographic Society announced today .
The findings , which were unearthed in 2006 and are still being analyzed , also suggest possible trade links with the Red Sea , including a thoroughfare from Mesopotamia , which is known to have practiced agriculture 2,000 years before ancient Egypt .
" By the time of the Pharaohs , everything in ancient Egypt centered around agriculture , " said Willeke Wendrich , the excavation 's co-director and an associate professor of Near Eastern languages and cultures at UCLA .
" What we 've found here is a window into the development of agriculture some 2,000 years earlier .
We hope this work will help us answer basic questions about how , why and when ancient Egypt adopted agriculture . "
Just centimeters below the surface of a fertile oasis located about 50 miles southwest of Cairo , the UCLA - RUG team excavated domestic wheat and barley and found the remains of domesticated animals — pigs , goats and sheep — along with evidence of fishing and hunting .
None of the varieties of domesticated animals or grains are indigenous to the area , so they would have to have been introduced .
The archaeological team also found a bracelet made of a type of shell only found along the Red Sea , suggesting a possible trade link with the cradle of agriculture in the Near East .
In addition , they unearthed clay floors of what may have been simple structures — possibly posts with some kind of matting overhead .
In the 1920s , British archaeologist Gertrude Caton Thompson found traces of the same domesticated grains in storage pits less than a mile from the current site .
After the advent of carbon - dating technology , the grain was dated to 5,200 B.C. , making the discovery the earliest evidence of agriculture in ancient Egypt .
To this day , no earlier evidence of agriculture has been found in Egypt .
But because no surrounding settlement was ever excavated , all kinds of questions remained about the context in which agriculture began to unfold in ancient Egypt .
" We had evidence that there was agriculture by 5,200 B.C. but not how it was used in a domestic context , " said excavation co-leader René Cappers , a professor of paleobotany at the University of Groningen , the second - oldest university in the Netherlands .
" Now , for the first time , we have domesticated plants and animals in a village context . "
The latest findings date to the Neolithic period , a stage of human development that occurred at various times around world , beginning in 8,600 B.C. Sometimes called the New Stone Age , the period is characterized by the introduction of farming , animal husbandry and a movement away from hunting and gathering and toward a less nomadic way of life , with pots , tools and settlements .
Few clues have been found of Egypt's Neolithic past in the Nile Valley , possibly because they were either buried under silt from the Nile or wiped away when the river changed its course , the archaeologists said .
The UCLA - RUG excavation site is located just outside the river valley in what is now a desert region .
With more than three feet of undisturbed strata at the site , the team expects to be able to piece together the evolution of domestication in the area between 5,200 B.C. and about 4,200 B.C .
" The arrival of the entire Neolithic package in ancient Egypt has always been treated as a moment in time , but we 're finding stratified layers that will allow us to tease out the development of agriculture in this area as it developed over the course of hundreds of years , " said Wendrich , who is one of the core faculty members at UCLA 's Cotsen Institute of Archaeology .
Called the Fayum , the oasis where the team is working was surrounded by prehistoric sites , most of which were excavated in the 1920s .
Generations of archaeologists had written off the area , until the UCLA - RUG team decided to re-explore the site .
" We knew that the settlement existed , but the site had been under cultivation since the 1960s , so archaeologists assumed it had been destroyed , " Wendrich said .
" We got to this site in the nick of time . "
Modern laser - leveling farming techniques were about to annihilate the site in 2006 , but the archaeological team succeed in rescuing the six - acre plot for future research by renting it for a year while they conducted their initial fieldwork .
In the meantime , Egypt 's Supreme Council of Antiquities has taken steps to permanently protect the site .

WEEKEND EDITION : Video - game Wars Heat Up With Explosive 2008 Titles
SAN FRANCISCO ( Dow Jones ) - Video - game players who are accustomed to waiting for the holiday season to see the hottest new releases will get an early dose of yuletide joy this year -- in late April , to be exact .
That 's when " Grand Theft Auto IV " will hit store shelves -- likely on its way to racking up sales of 10 million units or more by the end of the year , according to most estimates .
But game fanatics worried about spoiling their Christmas by mid-spring need n't worry .
Compared to last year , 2008 will see a large slate of popular video game franchises spread throughout the year , along with some highly anticipated new properties that are designed to finally showcase the full capabilities of next - generation consoles such as the PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii .
The strong slate of releases should cool worries that the video game sector set its own bar too high in 2007 , which racked up a record $ 8.6 billion in game software sales in the U.S. alone -- a 34 % gain from the previous year , according to data from the NPD Group .
Strong demand for video games is also fueling a surge of deal making in the sector .
Activision ( ATVI ) is in the process of merging with Blizzard Entertainment -- the video game arm of Vivendi and maker of the mega- popular " World of Warcraft " online game .
Electronic Arts ( ERTS ) has unveiled a $ 2 billion cash tender offer for " Grand Theft Auto " publisher Take - Two Interactive ( TTWO ) , which has rejected the offer under the belief that it is worth much more .
Cutting - edge games slated for release this year are also expected to fuel the long - running war between next - generation consoles -- primarily between Sony 's PS3 and Microsoft 's Xbox 360 .
These companies are competing heavily for the hearts of hardcore gamers , who will sometimes spend large portions of their incomes on the latest shoot - ' em-ups and fantasy titles .
" I think we 're going to see 20 % sales growth this year .
But more important than software [ game ] sales is that we have n't really seen big hardware sales yet , " said Michael Pachter , video game analyst with the brokerage Wedbush Morgan Securities .
Pachter says that this year is still relatively early in the next - generation console cycle .
The PlayStation 3 and Nintendo
Wii hit the market in November 2006 , while the Xbox 360 arrived the year before .
" This year is going to be huge , but not as big as 2009 , and probably not as big as 2010 , " he said .
Higher quality , lower prices ?
Though the next - generation consoles deliver the highest quality gaming experience yet , pressure continues on hardware makers to lower their prices .
Sony has felt this in particular .
The PlayStation 3 launched with a $ 600 price tag and has already shaved off $ 200 .
But at $ 399 , the console is still the most expensive on the market , though the Xbox 360 is not far behind at $ 350 for its mid-range unit .
The Wii still carries its original $ 250 price tag .
Analysts widely expect console makers to cut their prices again this year , at least on the PS3 and 360 .
Pachter said consoles will have to get closer to the $ 199 price point to really gain mass market adoption .
But Sony ( SNE ) is already seeing sales accelerate .
After being outsold by all the next - generation consoles since its launch , the PlayStation 3 has seen significant pickup , selling more than half a million units in the first two months of 2008 and overtaking the Xbox 360 for the time since its launch , according to NPD data .
Microsoft ( MSFT ) is not doing too badly either .
The Xbox 360 sold about 4.6 million units in the U.S. last year -- about 80 % more than the PS3 did in the same timeframe .
Last year 's star , however , was the Nintendo Wii , which sold about 6.3 million units and has moved another 706,000 in the first two months of this year .
The console remains virtually sold out at most retailers more than a year after its launch , and analysts expect the shortage will continue through much of this year .
" I anticipate the Wii hardware system will be supply constrained going into the holiday season , " said Jesse Divnich , analyst for the simExchange , an online prediction market focused on the video game business .
A Grand
Theft kick - off
March has already seen some big releases .
French game publisher Ubisoft released " Tom Clancy 's Rainbow Six : Vegas 2 " earlier this month .
A big release came from Nintendo with " Super Smash Bros. Brawl " -- an exclusive title for the Wii .
Despite a release date delayed by a month , the game sold more and 1.4 million units in the U.S. in its first week , setting a new record for Nintendo , according to the company .
However , the big kick - off title for the year will be " Grand Theft Auto IV , " developed by Take - Two 's Rockstar Games unit .
The latest version in the popular urban shooter franchise will be the first developed for next - gen consoles such as the PS3 and 360 and is expected to offer top - of - the - line effects and features that can take advantage of those systems ' capabilities .
" I do n't think there 's any question that ' Grand Theft Auto IV ' will be big , " said Doug Creutz of Cowen & Co .
Optimizing the game took longer than Take - Two expected .
GTA IV was originally slated for release during last year 's holiday season , but the company delayed the launch after finding that " certain elements of development proved to be more time - intensive than expected . "
A lot is riding on the release .
Primarily , the management of Take - Two is hoping strong sales of the game can help it squeeze a higher price out of its suitor EA .
Take - Two has rejected EA 's previous bids , stating that it will not negotiate a deal before the April 29 launch of " Grand Theft . "
The company 's stock has been trading around the $ 26 bid price for the last month -- up more than 50 % from its levels before the merger offer became public .
The game is also expected to be a major hardware seller for both the PS3 and the Xbox 360 .
No version is expected for the Nintendo Wii .
As an urban - based shooter game , it faces little direct competition until the fall release of " Saints Row 2 " from THQ Inc. ( THQI ) , though a firm release data for that title has not yet been announced .
The Force gets ' Unleashed '
Big summer titles will include a highly anticipated release from the " Star Wars " franchise .
Dubbed " Star Wars : The Force Unleashed , " the storyline of the game covers the period between the original movie trilogy and the three prequels -- a period that has so far been off limits to books , TV shows and other games controlled by creator George Lucas .
In the game , players assume the role of a secret apprentice to Darth Vader , who ends up fighting both good guys and villains from the " Star Wars " universe .
Developers at Lucas ' video game unit -- LucasArts -- say the game advances the " Star Wars " story in a far more significant way than previous game titles from the series .
Haden Blackman , head of the development team for " The Force Unleashed , " drew an overflow crowd at the recent Game Developers Conference in San Francisco last month when he oversaw what was billed as the first live demo of the game .
Among other features , " The Force Unleashed " employs an artificial intelligence system called Euphoria , which is designed to simulate a character 's central nervous system to make reactions within the game more realistic .
The game will also serve as a showcase for the capabilities of next - generation platforms like the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 , Blackman said .
" Graphically , the game looks like you 're in a Star Wars movie , " Blackman said in an interview .
" It 's the first time I think people are really going to feel immersed in a Star Wars film , and that 's really due in a lot of ways to the power of these platforms . "
See video preview of " The Force Unleashed . "
" The Force Unleashed " will also be available for the Wii as well as for hand - held devices from Nintendo and Sony , but developing for all the major platforms was a challenge .
Work on the game began before the launch of the PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii , so Blackman 's team had to begin on the Xbox 360 and then learn the new systems on the fly .
Adapting the game for the Wii was particularly tricky , as the console features a unique motion - sensor control but lacks the graphical capabilities of the PS3 and 360 .
" As the game platforms get more advanced , the development cycle is going to get tougher , " Blackman said .
Ratings from game critics may make a big difference for the game .
Several previous " Star Wars " releases have averaged scores in the low 80's from the site Metacritic , which compiles game reviews from different publications .
The highest rated Star Wars game is a title called " Knights of the Old Republic " for the original Xbox , which garnered a Metacritic score of 94 .
Besides " Star Wars , " Lucas Arts is planning an " Indiana Jones " version of its popular Lego character games timed for the release of the next " Indiana Jones " movie this summer .
Building your own game
At least two major releases this year will offer game users more than just a chance to play .
" Spore " from EA and " Little Big Planet " from Sony are both built around the concept of allowing players to design their own games and create their own environments .
EA has been working on " Spore " with Maxis , the studio behind the mega - popular " Sims " franchise .
The game allows players to create their own personal universe and populate it with creatures -- also player - created -- who then evolve to different stages of life .
The game also brings a social - networking element to gaming .
Though not a massive multi-player game like " World of Warcraft , " players of " Spore " can move through worlds created by other players .
The game has a heavy online element , which is why the first version being launched in September will be limited to the PC rather than the next - generation consoles .
" What we 've done here is we 've created a social network within a game , " said Lucy Bradshaw , executive producer for " Spore . "
The title will also be available for Nintendo's handheld DS console , and Bradshaw added that it will eventually migrate onto other platforms as well .
"
We 'll evolve it into different territories .
I would look at this as first version , " she said .
Another game aimed at the user - generated crowd is " Little Big Planet , " a title from British studio Media Molecule being developed exclusively for the PlayStation 3 .
Players can use their characters to create their environments .
Early previews of the game have generated significant buzz in the gaming community .
The title is also slated for release in early September .
" Little Big Planet to me is huge .
Hardcore gamers will like it , but it also has a big mass - market appeal , " said Billy Pidgeon , gaming analyst for International Data Group .
" This could be a big system seller . "
Shooting to win
The key category for appealing to the core gamer audience is the first - person shooter , and 2008 will see plenty of big releases -- though none may end up matching " Halo 3 " from Microsoft last year , which has sold 7.3 million units to date , according to the company .
For Sony , the console maker is banking heavy on " Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots . "
Developed by Konami exclusively for the PlayStation family , the " Metal Gear " series has been a big seller on the platform , moving more than 7 million units in its lifetime , according to Sony .
" Metal Gear Solid 4 " will be launched in mid-June .
Microsoft will answer with a sequel to it mega - popular " Gears of War " game , which saw its first iteration sell more than 6 million units .
" Gears of War 2 " is slated for a November launch .
LucasArts is also planning for an autumn launch of an original title called " Fracture , " which is set in a period in the future when the United States has broken up into two warring factions .
The game employs a technology called " terrain deformation " to allow players to alter the terrain of the environment to gain a tactical advantage over their opponents .
" Fracture " will be launched for both the PS3 and the Xbox 360 .
Wii keeping the pace
While much of the focus on game titles for the year centers around the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 , analysts caution that Nintendo will remain a major force .
The Wii has handily outsold the other next - generation consoles since its launch , and the device remains hard to find in U.S. retail outlets .
To address the shortage , Nintendo ( NTDOY ) has nearly doubled its production run of the machines since the launch .
The company now manufacturers about 1.8 million units per month , though supply remains tight .
Nintendo spokesman Marc Franklin would not comment on whether the company plans further production increases .
" We increased our production twice last year , " Franklin said .
" But never before has a system sold as much in a short period of time . "
Besides " Super Smash Bros. Brawl , " which has gotten the Wii off to s strong start for the year , a likely popular title will be a version of the racing game " Mario Kart " for the Wii .
This game will make use of the Wii Wheel , a steering wheel - shaped wireless controller that works with the Wii 's motion - sensor control system .
Analysts are particularly interested in " Wii Fit , " which hits stores in mid- May .
This game makes use of the Wii Board , a platform that hooks up to the system and allows players to control the game through running , jumping and other physical activities .
The game itself will feature activities such as yoga and skiing .
" Do n't overlook the Wii this year , " said IDC analyst Pidgeon .
" Because the graphics are lower resolution than the other systems , developers have to make games that are great to play .
It 's something you can't get from the competition . "
The writer of Robocop and the original Starship Troopers is bringing his bizarro brand of political satire to Starship Troopers III , his directorial debut .
We 'd been lukewarm about yet another direct - to - DVD sequel of Paul Verhoeven 's classic actioner , but the clips and Q&A with Ed Neumeier , plus stars Jolene Blalock and Casper Van Dien , went a long way toward changing our minds .
Details and pics after the jump .

Van Dien is back , after skipping Troopers II , as Johnny Rico .
And Blalock plays Capt. Lola Beck , a pilot .
Here 's how Blalock describes her character : " She 's a no - nonsense staraight shooter , who shoots from the hip but also has a heart of gold . "
Neumeier , who also wrote the script for Troopers II , says Sony realized it skimped on the budget for the ( fairly successful ) second movie , so there 's more money this time around .

Starship Troopers III is much truer to the original Heinlein book than the first two movies , Van Dien and Neumeier both stressed .
We might actually get to see the power suits that Heinlein talks about in the book .
" I feel a great debt to the fans of the novel , " said Neumeier .
" I adore the novel .
I read it when i was 13 . "
Neumeier sees the Troopers trilogy as a sort of history of war movies .
The first Starship Troopers is sort of a riff on World War II movies , partly motivated by Verhoeven 's desire to deal with the experience of Germans in the mid-1930s , when the Nazis were rising to power .
The second Troopers is more of a Korean war movie .
And the third one is much more of a Vietnam war film , dealing with issues of religion and politics .
It 's also about " how the state can use religion both badly , and for good . "

This time around , it 's eleven years later and the war is not going so well .
There 's much less public support for the war effort than there was in the first movie , said Van Dien .

Also , there are three new types of bugs , two of which appeared in the clips we saw at Wondercon .
One new bug is called a Bombadier , and it's a sort of ball that lands among a group of human soldiers and then explodes ( one human throws himself onto it and sacrifices himself for the others ) , then grows into a big eyestalk that shoots white fire .
Another clip showcased Neumeier 's trademark zany fake TV coverage , with a fake news segment about the new Q - bomb , which can destroy an entire planet .
Some religious fanatics say humans should n't have the right to choose which planets live and which ones die , but others say the Q - bomb may finally help destroy the bugs once and for all .
And then there 's a recruiting segment for the Fleet , which parodies all those " Army of One " spots for the U.S. Army and emphasizes that 16 - year - olds can join .
It ends with someone saying , " See you in the Cockpit ! "

Both Van Dien and Neumeier said they would like to make a Troopers TV series .
Neumeier said he got lots of advice from Verhoeven , who read the script and told him , " You look frightened , and you should be . "
He talks often to " Uncle Paul . "

Someone asked Blalock why she gravitates toward so many science fiction roles .
She said :
The reason I 've done a lot of science fiction is because my first big job was Star Trek , [ so ] a lot of the offers i get are science fiction .
The universe shines down on me , in a psychobabble way .
That 's what 's inside me , and so that 's what the universe offers me .

So there you go .
I ’ve been watching the “ Four Horsemen ” video , a two - hour conversation among four of today ’s leading atheists : Richard Dawkins , Sam Harris , Daniel Dennett , and Christopher Hitchens .
Right at the beginning , Dan Dennett brings up a point that ’s also been on my mind .
Speaking about his pre-publication editing of Breaking the Spell , in an effort not to offend religious readers :
“ …it ’s a no - win situation , it ’s a mug ’s game .
The religions have contrived to make it impossible to disagree with them critically without being rude . ”
“ They play the ‘ hurt feelings ’ card at every opportunity and you ’re faced with the choice of , well , am I going to be rude … or am I just going to button my lip ? ”
In the media , the “ New Atheists ” are regularly accused of being disrespectful , uncompromising , polarizing troublemakers who do not think twice about bashing long - held traditions or trampling on the delicate sensibilities of the religious .
I cited some examples of this denunciation last year in “ On Being Uncontroversial “ , where I also noted :
… the denunciation of atheists has nothing to do with the language or tone of their criticism , and it especially has nothing to do with the accuracy of their criticism .
On the contrary , atheists are called “ shrill ” and “ hysterical ” and “ extremist ” if they criticize religion in any way at all .
A religious reader unintentionally provided a perfect example of this , in the comments to my recent post “ Little - Known Bible Verses VIII “ .
This post pointed out that , in flat contradiction to the Catholic church ’s rule mandating priestly celibacy , the Bible not only allows but arguably mandates that clergy be married .
A comment left in response carried the by - now - familiar whiff of outrage :
This [ post ] proves the old saying , “ Scratch an atheist , uncover a fundamentalist ” .
Evidently , pointing out that a religious sect is disobeying its own holy book is now sufficient to get one labeled an “ atheist fundamentalist ” .
You could n’t ask for a better demonstration that , as far as religious apologists are concerned , atheists should be seen and not heard .
The defenders of orthodoxy , no matter what they claim , do not want us to be nicer ; they simply want us to be silent .
As further evidence , consider this approving review from the conservative Weekly Standard , of André Comte - Sponville ’s The Little Book of Atheist Spirituality .
The full review is behind a paywall , but the giveaway part is visible :
Most important , we discover that Comte - Sponville is not a cranky , cantankerous atheist .
He was born into Christendom , and raised there ; and though he eventually defected , he was never disinfected of its moral graces .
He calls himself a “ non-dogmatic atheist , ” a “ faithful atheist , ” even a “ Christian atheist . ”
Comte - Sponville might not believe in God , but he admires Him .
An atheist he is ; a heathen he is not .
As this review shows , what the religious apologists approve of is atheists who wish they were religious .
That subservient , conciliatory posture is what they like to see , since it validates their presuppositions about the importance of theistic belief .
By contrast , atheists who are proud and happy to be atheists , who have no need of superstition , and who are not afraid to say so – they will always be perceived as disrespectful and rude .
We anger and offend many in the religious majority not because of any specific criticism or tone , but merely because we do n’t wish we could share in their superstitions .
With that knowledge , let ’s not worry too much about offending the believing masses .
Those pundits and theologians who fret about how boisterous and uncivil we are , and who solemnly advise us that we should be more gentle and conciliatory if we want to succeed , in reality , are just playing a slightly more sophisticated version of the old Br’er Rabbit trick : “ Do n’t throw me into the briar patch ! ”
They do not have our best interests in mind ; they counsel us to tone down our message only as the first step of their desire to see us altogether silenced .
I ’m not saying that anything goes .
We should avoid ad hominem attacks because they are fallacious , even without considering their effect on people ’s feelings .
And we should not deliberately phrase our message with the intent of causing anger or offense .
But since some anger and offense is inevitable , we also should n’t worry too much about sparing people ’s feelings .
Let ’s be atheist firebrands .
We should boldly speak our minds at every opportunity , and never hold back out of fear of causing offense or a desire to be more popular .
Let ’s say what we believe and make our case with force and courage .
History has taught us that , in battles of public opinion , conviction and passion often carry the day ; fearful retreat and tepid compromise hardly ever do .
Let ’s ignore those who wish to silence us and let our voices be heard loud and clear .
We will attract the kind of response we are hoping for .
DIGG THIS
Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee says that if he ’s elected , you can count on him to send all illegal immigrants packing .
According to the Washington Times , the former governor has " signed a pledge to enforce immigration laws and to make all illegal aliens go home , " and he reportedly plans to accomplish this through " attrition by law enforcement . "
So let me get this straight .
The guy who as governor of Arkansas fought for welfare benefits like college tuition breaks and advocated pathways to citizenship for illegal aliens , now all of a sudden believes in sending them all back from whence they came ?
Well , at least he ’s not pandering !
Assuming Huckabee remains true to his word ( even though he ca n’t win a general election , but that ’s another story ) , rounding up at least 12 million illegals would be an extraordinary undertaking .
Ultimately , it is one that would fail — not for lack of trying , mind you , but because it would eventually alienate virtually every American citizen in the process , as well .
In no uncertain terms , an adventure of this magnitude — one relying on the use of government law enforcement agencies to accomplish desired ends — would require a near - complete militarization of our cities from coast to coast .
Police officers , ICE and border control agents , and ( most likely ) military units would be tasked with patrolling our streets night and day in order to track down these lawbreakers — we are going to remove all of them , right Mike ? — the vast majority of whom are non-violent workers who have aggressed against no one .
To say this would be a messy affair would be an understatement of magnificent proportion .
SWAT - style assaults and home invasions would be the order of the day .
Today ’s ruthless , tyrannical drug raids would actually look tame in comparison as government thugs went door to door seeking out suspected illegal aliens .
The right to privacy of citizens and non-citizens alike would consequently evaporate as property rights became a thing of the past .
Chaos would ensue .
Racial tensions would intensify as primarily brown targets would be ensnared by their primarily white captors .
Protests and riots would erupt , the merits of which would be hard to dispute .
Children born as American citizens would be seized from their parents , automatically rendered homeless and converted into wards of the state as a result of such totalitarian behavior ( Huckabee once seemed to understand the demerits of such atrocious behavior ) .
Human beings who have come to this country to make a better life for themselves and their families would be treated like animals as they were hunted , captured , incarcerated , and eventually deported .
And this would merely be the fate of those who complied .
Those who resisted , on the other hand , would not fare nearly as well .
They would end up beaten , maimed , tortured , and even killed .
If Americans can be electrocuted and shot by the roadside simply for arguing with the police nowadays , just what type of treatment would befall the illegal immigrant suddenly rendered persona non grata via this new Soviet - style diktat ?
Sadly , this issue says much less about Mike Huckabee than it does about countless American citizens , with whom the candidate simply seeks to curry favor this election year .
Huckabee is a sleazy politician and thus to an extent can be forgiven for behaving like one .
This does n't excuse his most recent stance , but it 's very telling that he can get away with it .
After all , he 's just posturing for an American electorate whose mainstream values are reflected in its president , in whose office we unfortunately place so much influence that one man can be empowered on our behalf to commit wholesale acts of violence against fellow humans .
And if we can identify enemies abroad , so too can we apparently identify local " enemies " living within our borders .
But make no mistake .
A mission literally to cleanse our land of unwanted immigrants would more or less amount to a rogue experiment in state - sanctioned domestic terrorism scarcely seen before in the United States , and one that would almost certainly result in civil war .
All in response to a hot - button political issue that essentially could be eliminated by doing little more than putting an end to those attractive welfare subsidies Mike Huckabee and so many of his fellow Americans seem to love so much in the first place .

US Fed Prepares for More Bank Failures
In Wake of Housing Market Collapse
It seems that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is getting ready for more financial institutions to fail as world credit markets convulse in the wake of the US housing collapse and a flight from SIVs ... structured investment vehicles which are highly leveraged , complicated , based on assumptions now proven to be plain wrong , and now considered “ toxic ” .
“ The FDIC is looking to bring back 25 retirees from its division of resolutions and receiverships .
Many of these agency veterans likely worked for the FDIC during the late 1980's and early 1990's , when more than 1,000 financial institutions failed amid the savings - and - loan crisis .
‘Regulators are bracing for well over 100 bank failures in the next 12 to 24 months '... ” Damian Paletta , Feb.27 , 2008 Wall Street Journal .
Who would have thought we 'd see Bear Stearns ( the fifth - largest US investment bank ) start the cleansing process off and fail after having survived the Great Depression and a dozen recessions over the past 85 years .
Bear shareholders were horrified to see their investment vaporize from $ 170 twelve months ago to the $ 2.00 offered by JP Morgan in a Fed - backed bail - out orchestrated to head off a full scale global rout .
Meanwhile , Standard & Poor 's has just downgraded Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers from “ Stable ” to “ Negative Outlook ” , and some analysts are wondering whether Citibank ( which two years ago was leveraged 22:1 and is now leveraged 42:1 ) may be a good “ short ” .
Since the early 90's the number of FDIC employees has dropped from around 15,000 to some 4.500 .
The agency will also need to seek outside help to enable it to properly oversee the 8,000 plus financial institutions for which it insures accounts .
Looks like the staff at banks making it onto the ” high risk list ” in the future might expect a visit from FDIC regulators ( some of whom just might have a kind of mothbally smell about them ) .
Asian Markets
Hit the Wall .
Many analysts were counting on Asian markets to “ decouple ” from the massive US economy and Europe should the latter stall and fall into recession .
The theory was that the Asian economies would simply switch from their reliance on exporting manufactured goods to the West to selling to their own increasingly - better - off citizens and to developing their local service industries .
If anything , it looks like the old theory that “ if the US economy catches a cold , the rest of the world catches pneumonia ” still applies .
Much of the wealth of the new Asian middle class has suddenly vanished with the Shanghai Composite down 37 % from its peak , the Shenzhen All Share down 27 % , Hong Kong 's Hang Seng down a third , Vietnam 's Ho Chi Minh Index slashed by 50 % , and India 's Sensex down 25 % .
Yet despite this crash in Asian share prices some analysts like Brett Arends ( Wall Street Journal , March 22 2008 ) are warning “ Asia still not cheap despite big falls ...
On many long - term measures like price - to - sales and price - to - book , for example , Chinese equities still look very expensive . ”
So rather than bottoming anytime soon , these markets may have a lot further to fall .
The Federation of Hong Kong Industries estimates sky - rocketing labour costs and raw materials prices will result in the closure of 10 % of the 70,000 Hong - Kong owned factories located in the nearby Pearl River Delta region of China .
Some factories will be relocated deeper into inland China where costs are lower ; others will be moved to cheaper regions like Vietnam , while some will simply shut down .
Now , with China 's house prices faltering , property developers in “ extraordinarily difficult financial straits ” , political unrest in Tibet , and their main customers sliding into recession , China will be struggling to keep itself afloat let alone take over as the new locomotive engine for the global economy .
The Big Freeze Continues .
Thornburg Mortgage became another victim of
“ the worst ( U.S. ) housing market in a century ... we are in a 100 - year storm in the housing finance industry ” ( Dick Syron , C.E. Freddie Mac ) who went on to say ...
“ We are not pretending the housing downturn has come to a bottom or anywhere near it .
To the contrary , we are assuming that house prices have only fallen a third of their peak - to - trough decline . ”
Carlyle Capital ( a fund holding “ triple - A rated paper ” and geared 32:1 ) collapsed when nervous lenders seized its assets knowing that a 3 % fall in value would wipe out the fund 's equity .
Frightened investors in other funds rushed to cash out only to become “ angry investors ” when their savings were “ frozen ” by fund managers .
“ ING freezes two Kiwi funds ...
Angry New Zealand investors are questioning why their ANZ ( Australia & New Zealand Bank ) financial advisers put them into funds now paralysed by the credit crisis ....
ING New Zealand announced it was indefinitely suspending withdrawals .
The funds were based largely on CDOs ( collateralised debt obligations ) and CLOs ( collateralised loan obligations ) . ”
Maria Slade , The Australian , March 14th 2008 .
Many of the 8,000 investors were retirees and had been assured by the bank 's financial advisers that ‘ it 's as safe as being in the bank , but you get 1 per cent higher ' .
One retired couple had put their entire life savings into the fund only to see it lose 30 % in value before being frozen .
The husband has since suffered a nervous breakdown .
“ Too late to duck out of Drake hedge fund ...
Many investors in a hedge fund run by Drake Capital Management are trying to pull their money out .
They are finding out hedge funds love to take investor 's money but cannot always give it back ...
The New York money manager ... is struggling with losses related to the credit crunch , has received withdrawal notices from about half its hedge fund investors ... ( so ) has moved to halt withdrawals ... from its $ US2.7 billion Drake Global Opportunities fund .
Drake is one of several hedge fund firms that have locked in investors as markets have soured .
Drake was also likely to stop investor withdrawals from its two other hedge funds .
On Tuesday , GO Capital Asset Management ( Amsterdam - based with $ US870 million under management ) ... told investors it would suspend redemptions until March next year .
” Cassell Bryan - Low , Gregory Zuckerman , Wall Street Journal , March 14th 2008 .
Helpless investors are now finding out that lurking amongst all the fine print of their fund 's prospectus is the power to invoke a “ gate ” or freeze on withdrawals when assets can't be disposed of in an orderly fashion for a reasonable value ( such as when too many investors want to cash out at the same time ) .
As one fund manager explained ...
“ It is a pre-emptive measure to safeguard the interests of our investors . ”
Some funds exercise the right to freeze withdrawals if more than around 20 % of investors head for the exits .
This not only protects the remaining investors but also ensures the manager and the fund 's employees keep their jobs .
However , investors who did n't quite make it out in time may find themselves in the sorry state of not only being unable to access their money , but having to pay ongoing management fees throughout the freeze .
They may also have to face seeing the asset value of the fund plunge further ; and if their luck really runs out may face the prospect of their fund going into liquidation as did the two failed Bear Stearns ' funds that folded nine months ago ( and triggered the current crisis ) .
A Quickie 2 - 3 Week Crash ?
The history books tell us that economic booms and asset bubbles can often take quite a while to unravel and deflate .
Take , for example , the Great Depression .
After peaking in October 1929 at 381 ( and not to be surpassed again until 1954 ) , the Dow Jones took more than two and a half years to bottom in July 1932 at just 41 , a loss of approximately ninety percent of its value .
Investors fought doggedly and continued to “ buy the dips ” as one “ dead cat bounce ” after another ground them lower and lower .
The “ death of a thousand cuts ” you might say .
So it is a bit bizarre to hear someone like Macquarie Bank 's division director Lucinda Chan complaining that the present stock market is “ dysfunctional ” because confidence - sapped investors are fleeing to the safety of cash ... ” Chan 's frustration in trying to explain the falling prices to clients is palpable .
“ We knew there would be a pull - back , but I 'd rather have the 1987 crash of two or three weeks and just plummeting , then clean up the mess and let 's move on ' ...( I guess she means back to the good old days of rising stock prices ) ...' But this is like six months of nonsense .
There are no margins to make money because there 's more downside than there has been up days . ”
Lisa Macnamara , The Australian March 8 , 2008 .
While Chan is fretting for her “ quickie crash ” other brokers are stressing because
“ The man in the street does n't want to buy shares anymore ... fear is feeding on itself ... There 's nothing short of a panic in leveraged financial stocks . ”
Central Banks to Monetize Debt ?
The article by Chris Giles and Krishna Guha on the Financial Times website ( March 21 , 2008 ) seems to have caused quite a stir ...
“ Central banks on both sides of the Atlantic are actively engaged in discussions about the feasibility of mass purchases of mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) as a possible solution to the credit crisis .
Such a move would involve the use of public funds to shore up the market ... and restore confidence by ending the current vicious circle of forced sales , falling prices and weakening balance sheets ... taxpayers would be assuming the credit risk . ”
The report states that the Bank of England seems
“ most enthusiastic to explore the idea .
The ( US ) Federal Reserve is open in principle to the possibility ... but only as a last resort .
The European Central Bank appears least enthusiastic . ”
Economist Adam Smith argued in his book “ The Wealth of Nations ” in 1776 that the global economy was best left to “ free markets ” and “ the invisible hand ” where all individuals pursued their own self - interest un - hobbled by too much government intervention .
The latest machinations of the Central Banks will have Adam Smith rolling over in his grave .
No “ invisible hand ” for them .
Rather they are acting out in the open , making it clear they may be prepared to buy up as much of the financial world 's malinvestments as necessary to preserve the current world order , and do n't mind if they stick taxpayers around the globe with the bill .
Interesting Quotes .
“ The scariest thing I 've read recently ... Tim Geithner ( president Federal Reserve Bank of New York ) came as close as a Fed official can to saying we 're in the midst of a financial meltdown .
The Fed 's latest plan is to turn itself into Wall Street 's pawnbroker ....
$ US200 billion may sound like a lot of money , but when you compare it with the size of the markets that are melting down – there 's $ 11 trillion in US mortgages outstanding – it's a drop in the bucket ... we can only hope that , in the end , a bail - out wo n't be necessary .
But hope is not a plan . ”
Paul Krugman , The New York Times , Tuesday 11th 2008 .
“ If you have leverage , you 're stuffed .
There are people who have been hanging on by their fingernails who can't hold on much longer . ”
Alex Allen ( CIO ) , Eddington Capital Management , Bloomberg , Wed. 12th 2008 .
A UK Labour Party official ...
“ Ordinary people have been scared by what has happened here .
One bank ( Northern Rock ) saved from collapse by nationalization ; another near thing last week ( UK's biggest home mortgage provider HBOS ) .
People are saying , ‘ What the hell is going on ?
What the hell are you going to do about these cowboys ?
We have to show them we are in charge . ”
Geoff Kitney , Australian Financial Review March 26th 2008 .
All the best , Joe .

09 Apr 08 , 07:33 Equalization of World Economies is the Reason for Planned Crash
My recent letter to editors at DailyReckoning .
Com : Pay attention , folks !
This is a conspiracy - driven dismantlement of the West 's financial underpinnings , for a certain purpose : TO EQUALIZE GLOBAL ECONOMIES , for future installation of one - world government .
I 've provided all the details in my essay , " Planned Destruction of America " ( linked below ) , which is my report on Lt. Col. Archibald Roberts ' 1968 booklet : " The Anatomy of a Revolution " .
Study my essay , then write as if we 're all being led down a path to hell on Earth by secretive , elite movers and shakers on the Left and Right ( path to hell aka “ Third - Way Global Economic Socialism ” ) .
Read and learn and teach :
The EU and the coming North America Union are products of the 1940s GATT formulations , and very few analysts are aware of it ( ( GATT , NAFTA , and CAFTA are socialistic attempts at equalizing global economies , in order to in - stall one - world government under THIRD - WAY Global Economic Socialism ) ) .
My missive to Ron Paul ’s staff , regarding my view that this financial crisis is not by happenstance nor mismanagement — but BY DESIGN !:
The Honorable Ron Paul is ignorant of an ongoing conspiracy to topple , financially , the West , in order to equalize the world ’s economies ; for building one - world government under GLOBAL ECONOMIC SOCIALISM .
//
The conspiracy began in the 1940s with the GATT formulations .
//
Ask why Greenspan had violated his chairmanship duties by advising prospective home buyers to take out an ARM .
//
Ask why Greenspan had sent out fed regulators to warn banks that they ’d be charged with RACISM if they did n’t loosen home loans for minority , HIGH RISK home buyers .
//
Ask why Greenspan recently , TRAITOROUSLY , had advised OPEC oil producers to de-link from the U.S. dollar .
// Greenspan - the FEDERAL RESERVE - has embarked on a purposeful set of monetary policies designed to destroy the West ’s financial underpinnings .
//
Read about the WHO , the HOW , and the WHY of it in my below article ( first one ) : Planned Destruction of America http://planneddestructionofamerica.blogspot.com/
Corporate America : What Went Wrong ?
http://corporateamericawhatwentwrong.blogspot.com/
This one helps to confirm efforts to PURPOSELY trash America ’s financial underpinnings : http://www.321gold.com/editorials/engdahl/engdahl031808.html
P.S. Oil is payoff for the West 's efforts at providing PROXY COMBATANTS for Israel - - for protecting Israel from expanding , encircling Islamic Arabism ; a Jewish nation - state having supporters throughout the West willing to destroy the entirety of Western civilization for Israel 's sake .
That 's the gut - wrenching truth of why Western democracies are sacrificing blood and treasury in the Middle East ; especially the U.S. , which has enough off - shore and on - land oil reserves to last 300 years at her present rate of consumption , and which reserves were PURPOSELY capped and / or not drilled because Israel 's supporters poured millions of dollars into ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT groups ' coffers , to work at keeping America from oil / energy independence and tied to Israel 's interests in the Middle East .
That 's the truth you 'll NEVER see nor hear reported in Western mainstream news media , because Israel 's supporters control what 's fit to be said or printed about why the West wars with Islamic Arabism .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
A consensus began to emerge Sunday that the best way to give Florida 's Democrats a voice in electing a candidate for president lies with the U.S. Postal Service .
The Democratic National Committee stripped Florida and Michigan of all their convention delegates — a total of 313 — for violating party rules by holding their primaries too early , making both contests meaningless .
New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton won both states , but no delegates .
Her rival , Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , did not appear on Michigan 's ballot .
But the disqualification of Florida and Michigan has created a headache for the Democratic Party due to the unexpected closeness of the race between Obama and Clinton .
Officials from both states are trying to figure out how best to resolve the issue before the national convention in late August in Denver .
DNC Chairman Howard Dean said a mail - in primary is " actually a very good process . "
" Every voter gets a ballot in the mail , " the former Vermont governor said on CBS 's " Face the Nation . "
" It 's comprehensive , you get to vote if you 're in Iraq or in a nursing home .
It 's not a bad way to do this . "
As for who pays , Dean said , " That is a problem , " reiterating that the party needs its money for the general election campaign against Republican John McCain .
He also ruled out the state of Florida , where Republican Gov. Charlie Crist has nixed the idea .
Dean suggested the state Democratic party might foot the bill .
Florida 's political parties , unlike the DNC , can accept unlimited contributions .
Sen . Bill Nelson of Florida supports the mail - in solution , comparing it to an absentee ballot process .
He also pinned his hopes on the state party to pay for it .
" Since Governor Dean has said he's not going to do it in the DNC , the Florida Democratic Party 's going to have to go out and raise the money , " he said .
" We 're looking at about $ 6 million ( euro3.89 million ) . "
Sen. Carl Levin , a Michigan Democrat , appeared to be amenable to a mail - in solution for his state , though with less enthusiasm .
Speaking on ABC's " This Week , " Levin said doing the election again would be against state law .
" That can't be changed , and that can't be paid for , " he said .
Levin also said caucuses would be difficult , with 500 potential sites .
" The one possibility would be some kind of a mail - in caucus , " he said .
" But there 's some real problems with that , too .
Not just cost , but the security issue .
How do you make sure that hundreds of thousands , perhaps a million or more ballots can be properly counted and that duplicate ballots can be avoided ? "
Obama currently has more delegates than Clinton , but that could be eclipsed if Clinton were to win a large enough portion of Florida and Michigan 's delegates .

The yield on the benchmark 10 - year Treasury has plunged in the past few months and is getting close to the 45 - year low hit in 2003 .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Bond yields have plunged in the past few weeks .
And even if you are not an active investor , you should care about what 's been going on in the bond markets lately .
Here 's why .
The yield on the benchmark U.S. 10 - year Treasury currently stands at about 3.33 % , down from nearly 4 % about a month ago .
The rate on this long - term government note is a key factor behind what happens to fixed - rate mortgages .
If rates continue to fall , they could hit not only a new low for the year - the 10 - year briefly touched 3.28 % in January - but could come close to falling below the 3.07 % level they hit in June 2003 , which was a 45 - year low at the time .
Other Treasury rates have also fallen sharply .
The yield on the U.S. 2 - year Treasury is now only 1.58 % .
The rates on these issues influence the rates for other types of consumer loans , as well as small business loans .
The fact that rates are this low is a sign of just how weak the economy is , since lower rates usually correspond with tougher economic stretches while rising rates are often a product of a robust economy .
Still , on the surface , falling longer - term yields should be a relief for consumers .
The problem is that loan rates have not fallen as far as they should considering how much yields have declined because of the problems in the credit markets from the subprime mortgage meltdown .
" Fixed - rate mortgages are around 5.8 % , substantially above a 3.3 % 10 - year note .
What 's happened is while Treasury yields are falling , private sector rates have not moved much .
Mortgage brokers and consumers might be surprised rates are n't lower .
But the mortgage market is gummed up , " said Steve Van Order , chief fixed income strategist with Calvert Funds .
But Van
Order thinks that some of the actions the Fed has taken in the past few months - including six interest rate cuts since September as well as the introduction of several loan facilities to provide much - needed cash to struggling banks - could eventually get banks to turn on the lending spigot again .
Several other bond experts agreed that there is some good news to be found , but that it will take time before banks are comfortable lending even to high - quality borrowers again .
" Treasury yields coming down are good for consumers , " said Stephen Cooke , director of credit research SMH Capital Advisors , Inc , a firm that primarily invests in high - yield bonds .
" And certainly in this environment , it makes borrowing more affordable for all sorts of things . "
" However , in this credit crunch , companies still are n't lending , " he added .
" It will take a while for credit to loosen up and for low rates to flow through and help the economy . "
There 's another good sign that can be gleaned from the low yields .
Despite all the doom and gloom forecasts about the U.S. economy , many foreign investors still find the Treasury market to be a safe haven .
That 's contributing to the drop in yields since bond prices and rates move in opposite directions - in other words , more buying leads to lower yields .
So at risk of sounding Pollyannish , it is encouraging to note that big central banks in Asia and Europe are not bailing on the U.S. economy .
According to a report released by the Department of the Treasury on Monday , foreign central banks bought a net $ 36.1 billion in Treasury bonds and notes in January .
That was a record .
And they did that even though the dollar had continued to weaken - which , in theory , should make Treasurys less attractive .
" Treasurys are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government .
And even with the dollar weakening , global markets are convinced , as well they should be , that they will be paid back , " said John Canavan , an analyst with Stone & McCarthy , fixed income and economic research firm .
" There is a remarkable safety factor and even in troubled times , Treasurys remain the safest most liquid asset for many investors , " Canavan added .
Van Order pointed out that another factor pushing Treasury prices up and yields down this week that could be good news for consumers .
It seems some speculative investors may have been dumping oil , gold and other commodities whose prices have surged in recent weeks in order to purchase Treasurys .
The price of oil has dipped to about $ 102 after hitting a trading record of nearly $ 112 earlier in the week , while gold prices , which surged to above $ 1,000 , fell back to $ 920 Thursday .
If this trend continues , inflation concerns could diminish , which would make it a lot easier for the Fed to deal with the weakening economy since inflation would be less of a worry .
Of course , low rates have also hurt consumers .
As I wrote earlier this week , there is a lot of frustration about the fact that the rates for savings accounts , money - market accounts and certificates of deposit ( CDs ) have fallen along with interest rates .
Still , it 's undeniable that continued interest in the U.S.
Treasury market from overseas investors - even with our economy in a funk - combined with signs of inflation pressure ebbing could mean that the markets and economy may not get much worse .
" There is a case to be made - cautiously - that the panic wave may have crested , " Van Order said .
" This does n't mean the economy is out of the woods .
But people I 've been talking to are feeling a little more relieved and optimistic .
It just feels better this week . "

Whenever the regular expression topic comes up , I unashamedly recommend the best tool on the market for parsing and building regular expressions -- RegexBuddy .
But there 's one tiny problem .
RegexBuddy costs money .
I 've always encountered vague resistance when recommending commercial tools that I considered best of breed .
The source of that resistance was spelled out for me by Henrik Sarvell in this comment he left on Rob Conery 's blog :
Yes , I also have to brush up on the regex from time to time .
We do n't use software that costs money here , and last time I checked regexbuddy was n't free .
People usually do n't state their preferences this boldly .
I , for one , applaud the honesty .
I 've recommend Beyond Compare before ; it 's a fantastic file and directory comparison tool .
It 's not expensive , but it 's not free , either .
Which means many programmers I recommend it to will beg off and go install the free WinMerge comparison tool instead .
It 's tempting to ascribe this to the " cult of no - pay " , programmers and users who simply wo n't pay for software no matter how good it is , or how inexpensive it may be .
These people used to be called pirates .
Now they 're open source enthusiasts .
( Update :
This paragraph was intended to be tongue in cheek , but has been widely misinterpreted .
Dan summarized my opinion in the comments : " in the past , if someone told you they used software and did n't pay for it , the only plausible interpretation was that they were a pirate , because all good PC software cost money .
Now there 's also good software available for free , so that assumption is no longer correct . " )
But there 's something else going on here , too : the free software alternatives keep getting better every year .
Consider how immature Linux development tools were in 2000 compared to what 's available today : Eclipse , Subversion , MySQL , Firefox .
These tools either did n't exist , or have come astounding distances in closing the gap between their commercial counterparts in eight years .
PHP was dangerously close to a joke language in 2000 , but you can barely go anywhere on the web today without running into something huge built on PHP .
I could say the same thing about MySQL -- a toy database in 2000 , but a totally credible free alternative to Oracle and SQL Server today for most uses .
The competitive pressure of free products on commercial tools intensifies every year .
It 's relentless .
And to be honest , I feel many of the commercial alternatives are n't evolving fast enough to stay ahead of their free competition .
The onus is on the commercial tool vendors to prove that they provide enough value to warrant spending money .
In the case of Beyond Compare , the vendor has taken so long to ship version 3.x of their software that some of the free comparison tools have matched and even exceeded its feature set in the meantime -- as you can see in this amusingly titled comparison of file comparison tools .
Resting on their laurels is a luxury they no longer have .
It 's entirely possible for commercial development tools to survive alongside the strong , vibrant -- and now firmly established -- ecosystem of free tools .
But it wo n't be easy , as Steven Frank points out in The First , The Free , and The Best :
A free program need not be glamorous or even completely bug - free .
It can garner a respectable following simply by not costing anything .
I 've seen many times people struggle and struggle on with a clunky freeware app just because they 're not willing to pay $ 20 for a significantly better alternative .
There 's nothing wrong with that particular brand of masochism .
People prioritize differently , and money is more valuable than time to a whole lot of people .
It 's Capitalism in action .
The people who are most tenacious about exclusively using freeware whenever possible are usually incredulous that anyone would buy a commercial product when a free alternative is available .
I 've heard many times , " how can you guys make a living when free command line file transfer clients are included with the OS ? "
Beyond Compare was the best compare tool by far in 2005 -- an easy justification for spending thirty bucks on a compare tool .
But no longer .
They have to claw their way back to the top and become the best again in the face of endless free competition .
If you 're neither first nor free , there is still a way to carve out a niche for yourself : have a better application than everyone else .
Quality is the third leg of the axis .
A free app may not be worth what you paid if it does n't work right , or works so clumsily that you have to re-read the help file every time you use it .
The first app may be OK , but resting on its laurels of first - ness and not moving forward .
This phenomenon is n't limited to development software , although I think it 's particularly vicious there due to the peculiarities of the audience : the type of people who would buy development tools are also exactly the same people who could potentially build them .
You may wonder how anything survives online in the face of free competition .
Don MacAskill of SmugMug -- a pay photo sharing website -- offers this advice :
It turns out that people are happy to pay [ for web photo sharing ] , and have been happy to pay for the last four years .
The reason is that our pay service eliminates a lot of the baggage and a lot of headaches that at least some percentage of the population does n't want .
Quite of a few of the big brands have shut their free sites down .
They shut them down without notice .
It turns out that it 's sort of like a death spiral .
When you offer accounts for free , some garbage comes in with the good stuff .
People will upload porn or whatever .
So you end up hiring people to work at your company to filter out the bad stuff .
I know Photobucket and Webshots and some of the other guys have an entire room full of people who , all they do all day is watch the photos that are coming in and say yes or no , this photo is OK or not .
But inevitably , some of the junk slips through , and then the people who are using your service who do n't have any junk see their photos side by side with the junk , and get up set and leave .
Or even worse yet , some of your advertisers ( because if you 're free you 're likely ad supported ) see their ad right next to something disgusting or that damages their brand or something like that .
So they bail .
So eventually , your customers and your advertisers tend to run away screaming .
Or you 're left with a demographic which is n't a very important demographic for advertisers , or who would n't be likely to upgrade .
So it gets kind of nasty .
I knew Don from his days in the gaming industry at Ritual Entertainment .
I finally got to meet him at last year 's MIX conference , and I thoroughly enjoy reading his blog .
It 's a case study in how you can beat ' free ' by understanding the weaknesses of your free competition .
It wo n't be easy for commercial software or subscription websites .
If past history is any indication , beating the free alternatives is going to get progressively more difficult every year .
Kevin Kelly offers eight generative qualities that are better than free .
I 'm not sure it has to be that complicated .
Free is indeed a competitive advantage .
But free is also a weakness : it is cheap , mass - produced , and the same for everyone .
Don and Steven make a compelling argument that some people are willing to pay for a premium experience .
So the salient question , then , is this : do you understand what it takes to build the premium experience that trumps your free competition ?
And can you deliver it ?
Those beautiful snowflakes drifting out of the sky may have a surprise inside -- bacteria .
Atmospheric scientists have long known that under most conditions moisture needs something to cling to in order to condense into snow and rain .
A study published Friday in the journal Science shows a large share of those so - called nucleators turn out to be bacteria that can affect plants .
“ Bacteria are by far the most active ice nuclei in nature , ” said Brent C. Christner , an assistant professor of biological sciences at Louisiana State University .
Christner and colleagues sampled snow from Antarctica , France , Montana and Canada ’s Yukon and found that as much as 85 % of the nuclei were bacteria , he said .
The bacteria finding was most common in France , followed by Montana and the Yukon , and was even present in Antarctica .

The most common bacteria found were Pseudomonas syringae , which can cause disease in several types of plants including tomatoes and beans .
In the past , scientists have tried to eliminate Pseudomonas , Christner said , but now that it turns out to be a major factor in encouraging snow and rain , he wonders if that is a good idea .
Eliminating the bacteria might result in less rain or snow , or it might be replaced by other nuclei such as soot and dust .
Minnesota smokers become " actors " to get around the ban Bars in Minnesota have found a dramatic way to get around the US state 's recently introduced smoking ban .
The law grants an exception from the ban to performers in theatrical productions .
So the bars have become theatres , and their customers , actors .
Now some bars print bills listing the " cast " of bartenders , and ashtrays become " props " .
Drinkers don costumes and attempt strange accents .
But a health official said it was time for the curtain to fall on the ploy .
' Before the Ban '
At the Rock , a heavy - metal bar in Maplewood , owner Brian Bauman explained why his clientele were doing little more than sitting around , smoking and drinking to a soundtrack of deafening music .
It 's turned into the most fun thing I can imagine
Lisa Anderson
Bar owner " They 're playing themselves before 1 October - you know , before there was a smoking ban , " he said , according to the Associated Press .
" We call the production , Before the Ban ! "
Other bars have taken to the scheme with greater gusto , with customers dressing up in costume , the entrance labelled " stage door " and promising productions such as the Tobacco Monologues .
Up to 100 bars across the state are relying on the legal loophole to allow smokers to continue lighting up .
Health warning
But the state 's health department says they are indeed breaking the law , and has threatened to hit them with fines of up to $ 10,000 ( £ 5,000 ) .
" The law was enacted to protect Minnesotans from the serious health effects of second - hand smoke , " said Sanne Magnan , the Minnesota health commissioner .
She said the " theatrics " would have to end .
But bar owners fear their takings will fall once the ban is reimposed , while others will miss the antics .
" It 's turned into the most fun thing I can imagine , " said Lisa Anderson , owner of a bar in Hall City .
Read a selection of your comments on this story :
If bars would simply put in air purifiers like many bars here ( it is still legal to smoke in bars here ) , and in Europe , there would really be no problem .
A bar equipped with a good air purification system is probably healthier than breathing city smog .

The ban is nice when I 'm getting coffee in a coffee shop , but it destroys what little night life Minnesota has .
Nick , Minneapolis , Mn Bars in New Zealand allow customers to drink AND smoke on a smoking deck or porch outside ( clearly sectioned off as a part of the bar ) .
The ban has not really affected bar attendance at all .
However , just after the ban took effect , one smoker decided to install a private " club , " allowing smoking , in his garage .
He was fined with serving alcohol without a license .
Mel , Christchurch , New Zealand Ontario has been one of the first provinces to implement a complete smoking ban a few years back .
Smokers are not even allowed to light up on roof covered patios ( strangely enough , umbrella covered patios are exempt ) .
In principle I am not against the ban , but it has had an effect on the entertainment industry .
I 've spoken to many restaurant owners and staff , the general opinion is that fewer people go to restaurants and bars , and when they do , they consume and tip less .
I understand that this is just anecdotal evidence , but interestingly statistical evidence to the contrary is very difficult to find .
Cosmin , Toronto , Canada
In Los Angeles they are banning people from having fires in their fireplaces during certain nights in the winter because of the excessive green house gasses they produce .
One can only imagine how long it will take before all smoking is banned because of its effects on the greenhouse effect !
Michael , Los Angeles , California , USA
Call them feel good socialist control freaks , but when I go to the pub , why should I have to suck in someone elses dirty cigarette smoke ?
You smoke , not me .
Do n't be a baby , go out in the cold to enjoy your right to smoke .
Mike , London , Uk Maybe implement a modern day speakeasy where all can get together for a drink and a smoke ?
Go underground .
It was done once and I hope the american people still have the balls to stand up for what they believe in .
Our rights are taken away one piece at a time , never all at once .
Be aware !
lisa , hayden usa I miss my clothes not smelling from smoke when I wake up on a Sunday morning after a good Saturday night 's lash - up .
I miss my lungs feeling this good on a day - to - day basis .
I miss my friends who dont go to the pub anymore because they can't involuntarily kill people by smoking in the pub anymore .
Oh , I could go on .....
Rory Byrne , Dublin People try to get around the smoking ban because it 's extremely cold in Minnesota -- just like it is here in Chicago .
I still think the bars should 've been able to decide whether to allow smoking , and just post signs outside that say whether it 's allowed or not .
That way no one that does n't want to be around smoke has to be .
They can simply choose to go elsewhere .
Alex , Chicago , USA A seedy bar in my town got around the state 's smoking ban by declaring itself a cigar bar .
The state tried to shut it down , but the bar fought the state in court and won .
Chris , Durango , Colorado , USA I think it is time for the government to step out of our personal lives .
It should be up to the owner of the bar / restaurant / or whatever to decided if it is a smoking place or not .
They are the ones who pay the bills on the place , not the government .
Jack Stefani , Indianapolis , USA
Good on the bar owners and patrons !
The new trend of banning smoking in ' public ' places ( private business ) is inappropriate .
Smoking is unhealthy but instead of taking away property rights of the business owners we should consider banning cigarettes .
Jess , Wisconsin , USA Lumpini Park has a smoking ban , despite the traffic around the park which makes it one of the most polluted areas in Bangkok .
I hate these facists that believe they can ban consensual smoking .
It tempts me to take up cigarettes again just to blow smoke in their faces .
Andy Canfield , Roiet , Thailand Ireland was the first place to introduce workplace smoking ban and it has worked brilliantly .
Pubs are have a better environment , food in restaurants tastes better and people in general , will eventually reap the benefits of the policy through health effects .
There will always be resistance to such a move , but there was also resistance to the abolition of slavery .
Ian Breslin , Dublin , Ireland
Our state imposed a smoking ban in bars that serve food after a ballot resolution in November 2006 .
Some taverns are trying to get around it by serving food in polystyrene containers with plastic cutlery !
I think what they are trying to do is say that the customer has simply bought " take out " food that they have chosen to eat at the bar !!!
I 'd love to meet the lawyer who first dreamed that one up
Chris Bell , Las Vegas , USA
At a pub near me they put in a miniature hotel room in the bar which could be used for smoking .
DH , Reading , UK I 've come across bars that quietly do n't observe whether their customers are smoking .
I 've seen them cut holes in the wall that customers can smoke through etc .
In all honesty , smoking is bad and smokers are not only killing themselves - they 're killing everybody else too .
I hope the ban takes proper effect as soon as possible .
George Cowley , Columbia , USA Minnesota is the state where absolutely NOTHING is allowed .
It is filled with feel - good , socialist control freaks .
They spend their days inventing methods to impose their will on the public .

Edgar Bronfman Jr.'s Warner Music Group has tapped industry veteran Jim Griffin to spearhead a controversial plan to bundle a monthly fee into consumers '
Internet service bills for unlimited access to music .
The plan — the boldest move yet to keep the wounded entertainment industry giants afloat — is simple : Consumers will pay a monthly fee , bundled into an internet service bill in exchange for unfettered access to a database of all known music .
Bronfman 's decision to hire Griffin , a respected industry critic , demonstrates the desperation of the recording industry .
It has shrunk to a $ 10 billion business from $ 15 billion in almost a decade .
Compact disc sales are plummeting as online music downloads skyrocket .
" Today , it has become purely voluntary to pay for music , " Griffin told Portfolio.com in an exclusive sitdown this week .
" If I tell you to go listen to this band , you could pay , or you might not .
It 's pretty much up to you .
So the music business has become a big tip jar . "
Warner Music Share Price
Nothing provokes sheer terror in the recording industry more than the rise of peer - to - peer file sharing networks .
For years , digital music seers have argued the rise of such networks has made copyright law obsolete and free music distribution universal .
Bronfman has asked Griffin , formerly Geffen Music 's digital chief , to develop a model that would create a pool of money from user fees to be distributed to artists and copyright holders .
Warner has given Griffin a three - year contract to form a new organization to spearhead the plan .
Griffin says he hopes to move beyond the years of acrimonious record industry litigation against illegal file - swappers , college students in particular .
" We 're still clinging to the vine of music as a product , " Griffin says , calling the industry ’s plight " Tarzan " economics .
" But we 're swinging toward the vine of music as a service .
We need to get ready to let go and grab the next vine , which is a pool of money and a fair way to split it up , rather than controlling the quantity and destiny of sound recordings . "
In the last year , the Recording Association of America , the industry group that represents the major labels , has sent 5,400 threatening letters to students at more than 150 schools , and reached settlements with more than 2,300 them .
It has filed formal lawsuits against 2,465 others , who did not respond .
" I do n't think we should be suing students and I do n't think we should be suing people in their homes , " says Griffin .
" We want to monetize the anarchy of the internet . "
Griffin says Warner Music is " totally committed to this . "
The fundamental issue , he says , is whether music consumers will buy songs and albums individually , or whether they will subscribe monthly to access a " universal " database of songs .
Will Tanous , Warner Music 's communications chief , said Griffin 's initiative is part of Warner 's " ongoing effort to explore new business models in the music industry . "
In recent weeks , major music industry players have signaled their interest in the " music as a service " model .
Sony BMG
Music
Entertainment is said to be developing an online music subscription service that would give users unlimited access to its catalog .
Apple is reportedly negotiating with the major record labels to offer consumers free access to the entire iTunes library in exchange for paying a premium for Apple hardware .
Warner 's plan would have consumers pay an additional fee — maybe $ 5 a month — bundled into their monthly Internet access bill in exchange for the right to freely download , upload , copy , and share music without restrictions .
Griffin says those fees could create a pool as large as $ 20 billion annually to pay artists and copyright holders .
Eventually , advertising could subsidize the entire system , so that users who do n't want to receive ads could pay the fee , and those who do n't mind advertising would n't pay a dime .
" Ideally , music will feel free , " says Griffin .
" Even if you pay a flat fee for it , at the moment you use it there are no financial considerations .
It 's already been paid for . "
While few of the plan 's details have emerged , critics have begun their attacks .
David Barrett , engineering manager for peer - to - peer networks at web content delivery giant Akamai , says he 's opposed to it on principle .
Griffin 's plan , he says , is tantamount to extortion , because it forces everyone to join .
" It 's too late to charge people for what they 're already getting for free , " says Barrett .
" This is just taxation of a basic , universal service that already exists , for the benefit a distant power that actively harasses the people being taxed without offering them any meaningful representation . "
Griffin , who in 1994 was part of the team that made Aerosmith 's " Head First " the first song available on the internet , goes to great pains to emphasize that the collective licensing plan is not " his " plan .
" This is n't my idea , " says Griffin .
" While I would gladly take the credit , blanket licensing has over 150 years of history behind it . "
" Collective licensing is what people do when they lose control , or when control is no longer practical or efficient , " Griffin says .
" A pool of money and a fair way to split it up replaces control . "
Griffin was quick to point out that the $ 5 figure is arbitrary .
" We negotiate in every place , " Griffin says .
" Clearly $ 5 per month would be an insane number in China or India .
If you could get a nickel a month you could grow the business tenfold in those countries .
In another country that had a high GDP , a nickel per month would be ridiculously cheap .
So you negotiate .
Fair is whatever you agree upon . "
An unidentified entity is backing a new lawsuit to expose America 's secret defense pact with the Emirate of Kuwait .
The suit , filed in federal court in Washington last week by the law firm of Hogan & Hartson , seeks the declassification of a military cooperation agreement that America signed with Kuwait after the Gulf War in 1991 and which it renewed in 2001 .
Hogan & Hartson brought the case in its own name and did not disclose the identity of the mystery client pursuing the information .
The lawyers who filed the suit , Thomas McGovern III and Steven Williams , did not respond to phone messages seeking comment for this article .
The law firm said it sought the agreement from the Pentagon in May 2006 under the Freedom of Information Act .
The Defense Department responded that the pact is entirely classified , but the lawsuit alleges that some part of it should be public , since public officials and a variety of government publications have made statements discussing provisions in the deal .
The suit also claims that " similar agreements " with Egypt , Jordan , and countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are public .
According to a Congressional Research Service report , the deal with the Kuwaitis " is said to provide for joint military exercises , " as well as American arms sales to Kuwait and training for Kuwaiti military personnel .
" These agreements were done with a bunch of Gulf states , Kuwait , Qatar , and all of these places " after the Gulf War in 1991 , an adjunct professor at the National Defense University , Sami Hajjar , said .
" They 're very short and very simplistic and have something to do with the pre-positioning of materiel . "
Mr. Hajjar said the secrecy is driven by the desire of Kuwait 's leaders to minimize the discussion about American involvement in the country .
" They do n't want to reveal to their people that they have agreements which might detract from their sovereignty , " the professor said .
" In particular for Muslim extremists , that 's where the sensitivity is and is why those things are classified and in my judgment perhaps should continue to be . "
Mr. Hajjar said another potential flash point is a so - called status of forces agreement , which reportedly guarantees that American military personnel will be immune from action in Kuwaiti courts .
The Kuwaiti government publicly opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , but it closed off 60 % of its territory to permit a force of 250,000 American personnel to stage the attack .
A 2006 congressional report said the American military has about 10,000 people officially based in Kuwait , though as many as 90,000 are present at any given time as troops rotate in and out of Iraq .
There are hints in the lawsuit that Hogan & Hartson 's client may be a company that does business with the American military in Kuwait and is involved in some litigation relating to an accident there .
In addition , Mr. McGovern , one of the lawyers who brought the case , is an expert in government contracting law who has written about the legal perils for companies working in hazardous areas like Iraq .
The Embassy of Kuwait in Washington did not reply to an interview request .
A spokesman for the Justice Department , Charles Miller , said he had no record of the suit being served on the government yet .
" We classify information we feel could be a threat to the safety of the U.S. government , our soldiers , citizens , or to our allies , " a Pentagon spokesman , Lieutenant Colonel Mark Wright , said , stressing that he was speaking in general terms and was not familiar with the Kuwait pact .
An attorney who specializes in Freedom of Information Act cases , Scott Hodes , said the law firm faces an uphill battle in trying to persuade a judge to reverse the Defense Department 's position on classification .
" When the only issue is classified information , it 's really hard to defeat the government , " the former FBI lawyer said .
" That 's not to say it 's impossible , but it 's very hard . "

How Blu-ray won the war Q&A : Format wars
Following a review of its business , Toshiba said it would stop production of HD DVD players and recorders .
The HD DVD format has suffered as major US film studios backed the Blu-ray format , which is being developed by electronics firm Sony and partners .
Analysts said the move would allow Toshiba to focus on other products .
" It was an agonising decision for me , but I thought if we kept running this business it would have grave ramifications for the management of our company , " Toshiba president Atsutoshi Nishida said .
" We made a quick decision , judging that there is no way of winning the competition , " he said .
Tipping point
Toshiba said the tipping point came last month when Warner Bros ' followed a number of other film studios in deciding to release its movies only in the Blu-ray format .
" It shows what a highly competitive market it is .
When it comes to video , it is the person with the most content that wins , " Gartner analyst Paul O'Donovan said .
FOR BLU - RAY Sony Matsushita ( Panasonic ) Warner Bros Wal - Mart Walt Disney 20th Century Fox Blockbuster Netflix
Warner Bros ' decision means an estimated three quarters of new film releases will be available on Blu-ray discs .
Other major studios backing Blu-ray include 20th Century Fox , Walt Disney and MGM .
Last week , Wal - Mart , the world 's largest retailer , announced it would sell high - definition discs only in the Blu-ray format at its 4,000 US stores .
In the UK , DSGI , which owns the Currys chain , said it would stop selling HD DVD players after Toshiba 's announcement .
Video rental firms Blockbusters and Netflix will also offer customers only Blu-ray .
Universal , Paramount and DreamWorks studios signed up to produce movies in HD DVD , but Toshiba 's withdrawal is expected to significantly reduce the number of films available in the format .
Industry boost
The end of the battle is expected to give the industry a boost , as it removes uncertainty for consumers over which format to buy .
" The industry can now focus on getting the right product to the consumer , at the right price and in the volumes required , " Paul O'Donovan said .
FOR HD DVD Universal Studios Paramount Pictures DreamWorks Animation Intel Microsoft HP
Toshiba will continue to supply retailers with HD DVD machines until the end of March this year .
After that , Toshiba will provide technical support to the estimated one million people worldwide who own HD DVD devices .
Microsoft offers an HD DVD drive with the Xbox 360 games console .
The company told the BBC it did not believe the apparent end of the format would have an impact on Xbox sales .
" It is games that sell the consoles and the Xbox has the largest next - gen games library , " a Microsoft spokesperson said .
Toshiba also makes HD DVD drives for PCs and laptop computers .
The HD DVD versus Blu-ray battle has been likened to the VHS versus Betamax war of the 1980s .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Anti-Semitism , including government - promoted hatred toward Jews and prejudice couched as criticism of Israel , has risen globally over the last decade , the State Department said on Thursday .

“ Today , more than 60 years after the Holocaust , anti-Semitism is not just a fact of history , it is a current event , ” it said in a report to Congress .
U.S. embassies have noted an increase in attacks on Jewish people , property , institutions , and religious facilities in the last decade , the report said .
The report , titled “ Contemporary Global Anti-Semitism , ” did not give comprehensive statistics , and said that in any case such statistics were skewed against Western democratic countries more likely to report the incidents .
But it said other governments and institutions had documented similar trends .
For example , Tel Aviv University ’s Stephen Roth Institute listed 593 cases of major anti-Semitic incidents in 2006 , the highest number since 2000 , the report said .
Of these , 277 were physical attacks on Jews ; 105 synagogues were damaged .
Over half the incidents took place in Western Europe .
One attack in 2006 took the life of a young French Jew , Ilan Halimi .
The 23 - year - old was found naked , handcuffed and covered with burns near railway tracks outside Paris in February 2006 , and died of his injuries soon afterward .
While traditional anti-Jewish prejudice , a centuries - old phenomenon , persists , new forms have evolved , the report said .
“ The distinguishing feature of the new anti-Semitism is criticism of Zionism or Israeli policy that -- whether intentionally or unintentionally -- has the effect of promoting prejudice against all Jews by demonizing Israel and Israelis and attributing Israel ’s perceived faults to its Jewish character , ” it said .
This was common throughout the Middle East and in Muslim communities in Europe , but was even encouraged by some activity at the United Nations , the report said .
Various U.N. agencies are asked each year to investigate what are often “ sensationalized reports of alleged atrocities and other violations of human rights by Israel , ” the document said .
Such unremitting criticism of Israel “ intentionally or not encourages anti-Semitism . ”
This hostility can translate into physical violence , as in the surge in anti-Semitic incidents worldwide during the 2006 war between Israel and the Shi’ite Muslim group Hezbollah , the report said .
The report , released by the State Department ’s Office of the Special Envoy for Monitoring and Combating Anti-Semitism , follows up on a 2005 document .
It was dedicated to the memory of U.S. Rep .
Tom Lantos of California , the only Holocaust survivor to have served in Congress .
The Hungarian - born Lantos died last month of cancer at age 80 .
The State Department document also listed examples of some governments and leaders it said “ fan the flames of anti-Semitic hatred within their own societies and even beyond their borders . ”
It cited Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , who has questioned whether the murder of millions of Jews by the Nazis took place , and Venezuela ’s president , Hugo Chavez , who the State Department said had “ publicly demonized ” Israel .
Syria ’s government “ routinely demonizes Jews through public statements and official propaganda , ” while in Belarus , “ state enterprises freely produce and distribute anti-Semitic material . ”
State - sponsored media were vehicles for anti-Semitic discourse in Saudi Arabia and Egypt .
There were also blatantly anti-Semitic private media venues such as the conservative Catholic radio station Radio Maryja in Poland , the report said .
Traditional anti-Semitism remained a problem in Central and Eastern European countries such as Russia and Ukraine .
Anti-Semitic violence was a significant concern in France , Germany and the United Kingdom , and the report noted increases in anti-Semitic incidents in Argentina , Australia , Canada , and South Africa .
by Zora Neale Hurston
Letter to the Editor , Orlando Sentinel , August , 1955
After writing about Zora Neale Hurston ’s politics for LRC in February of 2002 and later for The American Conservative , I have gotten a great deal of correspondence asking where her political writings were available .
Several articles are available in her book Folklore , Memoirs , and Other Writings ; and she discusses politics a bit in Zora Neale Hurston : A Life in Letters .
Unfortunately , little of her political writings have been published on the Web , so in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Brown Decision , we reprint her famous letter to the editor denouncing the decision .
~ Marcus Epstein
Editor : I promised God and some other responsible characters , including a bench of bishops that I was not going to part my lips concerning the U.S. Supreme Court decision on ending segregation in public schools of the South .
But since a lot of time has passed and no one seems to touch on what to me appears to be the most important point in the hassle , I break my silence just this once .
Consider me as just thinking out loud .
The whole matter revolves around the self - respect of my people .
How much satisfaction can I get from a court order for somebody to associate with me who does not wish me near them ?
The American Indian has never been spoken of as a minority and chiefly because there is no whine in the Indian .
Certainly he fought , and valiantly for his lands , and rightfully so , but it is inconceivable of an Indian to seek forcible association with anyone .
His well known pride and self - respect would save him from that .
I take the Indian position .
Now a great clamor will arise in certain quarters that I seek to deny the Negro children of the South their rights , and therefore I am one of those " handkerchief - head niggers " who bow low before the white man and sell out my own people out of cowardice .
However an analytical glance will show that that is not the case .
If there are not adequate Negro schools in Florida , and there is some residual , some inherent and unchangeable quality in white schools , impossible to duplicate anywhere else , then I am the first to insist that Negro Children of Florida be allowed to share this boon .
But if there are adequate Negro schools and prepared instructors and instruction , then there is nothing different except the presence of white people .
For this reason , I regard the ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court as insulting rather than honoring my race .
Since the days of the never - to - be - sufficiently - deplored Reconstruction , there has been current the belief that there is no greater delight to Negroes than the physical association with whites .
The doctrine of the white mare .
Those familiar with the habits of mules are aware that any mule , if not restrained , will automatically follow a white mare .
Dishonest mule - traders made money out of this knowledge in the old days .
Lead a white mare along a country road and slyly open the gate and the mules in the lot would run out and follow this mare .
This ruling being conceived and brought forth in a sly political medium with eyes on ' 56 , and brought forth in same spirit and for the same purpose , it is clear that they have taken the old notion to heart and acted upon it .
It is cunning opening of the barnyard gate with the white mare ambling past .
We are expected to hasten pell - mell after her .
It is most astonishing that this should be tried just when the nation is exerting itself to shake off the evils of Communist penetration .
It is to be recalled that Moscow , being made aware of this folk belief , made it the main plank in their campaign to win the American Negro from the 1920s on .
It was the come - on stuff .
Join the party and get yourself a white wife or husband .
To supply the expected demand , the party had scraped up this - and - that off of park benches and skid rows were held to be just panting to get hold of one of these objects .
Seeing how flat that program fell , it is astonishing that it would be so soon revived .
Politics does indeed make strange bedfellows .
But the South had better beware in another direction .
While it is being frantic over the segregation ruling , it better keep its eyes open for more important things .
One instance of Govt by fiat has been rammed down its throat .
It is possible that the end of segregation is not here and never meant to be here at present , but the attention of the South directed on what was calculated to keep us busy while more ominous things were brought to pass .
The stubborn South and the Midwest kept this nation from being dragged farther to the left than it was during the New Deal .
But what if it is contemplated to do away with the two party system and arrive at Govt by administrative decree ?
No questions allowed and no information given out from the administrative dept .
We could get more rulings on the same subject and more far - reaching any day .
It pays to weight every saving and action , however trivial as indicating a trend .
In the ruling on segregation , the unsuspecting nation might have witnessed a trial - balloon .
A relatively safe one , since it is sectional and on a matter not likely to arouse other sections of the nation to support of the South .
If it goes off fairly well , a precedent has been established .
Govt by fiat can replace the constitution .
You do n't have to credit me with too much intelligence and penetration , just so you watch carefully and think .
Meanwhile , personally , I am not delighted .
I am not persuaded and elevated by the white mare technique .
Negro schools in the sate are in very good shape and on the improve .
We are fortunate in having Dr. D.E. Williams as head and driving force of Negro instruction .
Dr. Williams is relentless in his drive to improve both physical equipment and teacher - quality .
He has accomplished wonders in the 20 years past and it is to be expected that he will double that in the future .
It is well known that I have no sympathy nor respect for the " Tragedy of color " school of thought among us , whose fountain - head is the pressure group concerned in this court ruling .
I can see no tragedy in being too dark to be invited to a white school social affair .
The Supreme Court would have pleased me more if they had concerned themselves about enforcing the compulsory education provisions for Negroes in the South as is done for white children .
The next 10 years would be spent in appointing truant officers and looking after conditions in the home from which the children come .
Use to the limit what we already have .
Thems my sentiments and I am sticking by them .
Growth from within .
Ethical and cultural desegregation .
It is a contradiction in terms to scream race pride and equality while at the same time spurning Negro teachers and self - association .
That old white mare business can go racking down the road for all I care .

Smashing Pumpkins will shortly play eight dates in Australia
The dispute arises from the label 's use of the band in Pepsi Stuff , a promotion with the cola giant and website Amazon .
According to breach of contract papers filed in Los Angeles Superior Court , the band claims the deal threatens their " artistic integrity " .
It also claims Virgin has no right to use the band in promotional campaigns .
The group would never grant such authority to Virgin " or any other entity " , the Associated Press reports .
Downloads
The alternative rock band had been signed to Virgin prior to its break - up in 2000 .
Since it reformed in 2005 , the Smashing Pumpkins - fronted by singer Billy Corgan - has been with Reprise Records , a division of Warner Music Group .
Virgin , the band claims , only has the right to sell digital downloads of their songs - a deal it says does not extend to promotional campaigns for outside products .
The action demands Virgin pay the band profits earned in the promotion , and requests an injunction preventing the use of the group 's name or music in future .
The group are currently preparing for a series of concerts in Australia promoting their most recent record , Zeitgeist .
It is hard to pick a place to start in terms of talking about the most outrageous lies that the Bush administration and the 9/11 Commission have presented to the people in this country as a reason to attack Afghanistan and Iraq and to launch a “ fake war on terror ” .
The reason I say this is that I have been reading articles and watching videos about the lies and deceptions surrounding 9/11 for the past three years .
If anything , there are so many obvious unanswered questions about 9/11 .
However , not only has no one answered any of these questions but in fact no one in the mainstream media nor anyone in the United States Congress except for Representative Kucinich and Cynthia McKinney have even asked these questions .
Some of these questions are : 1 . How is it that at the crash site of Flight 93 , NBC and Fox News on September 11 , 2001 reported on the scene with video coverage that there was no sign of a jetliner , engines , bodies or luggage ?
You can go to my website which is www.911insidejob.net and watch this video report which is on my home page .
It has never been shown again on the mainstream media .
2 .
How is it that three steel framed buildings on September 11 , 2001 fell in freefall time on their footprint ?
If you watch the two Towers collapse , it is obvious that they are being blown up .
No steel framed building prior to this date or after this date has ever collapsed due to fire .
Many steel framed buildings have experienced burning infernos for many hours and never collapsed .
WTC 7 , a 50 story steel framed building , had two small fires in it with no noticeable structural damage when it collapsed on his footprint in freefall time at about 5:40 pm on September 11 .
You can watch this building collapse on the homepage my website .3 .
How is it that the most protected building in the world , the Pentagon , was hit by a commercial jetliner that was being tracked by Vice President Cheney in the basement of the White House for over one hour ?
Transportation Secretary Mineta testified under oath that he witnessed a member of the United States military ask Vice President Cheney several times whether the order still stood relative to not shooting down the oncoming plane .
Vice President Cheney ’s answer was that the order still stands .
You can watch Secretary Mineta ’s testimony on the home page of my website .
The Pentagon is protected by a battery of antiaircraft guns that would automatically shoot down any plane that does not have a United States military transponder on it .
4 .
How is it that only five frames have been presented by this government to show supposedly what hit the Pentagon on that date .
The Pentagon has surveillance cameras ringing the top exterior ring of the building .
The FBI within 10 minutes of the attack were confiscating surveillance films from local businesses around the Pentagon .
None of these confiscated surveillance films have been released .
I would bet that a satellite sits above Washington , DC 24 hours every day and would have very good video images showing what hit the Pentagon .5 .
How is it that a large commercial jetliner was able to crash into the first floor of the Pentagon and punch a round hole through three rings of the Pentagon which is constructed of steel reinforced concrete ?
The nose of a commercial jetliner is made of aluminum .
6 .
Why is it that Jamie McIntyre of CNN reported on the front lawn of the Pentagon on September 11 that from his vantage point it did not look like a commercial jetliner had crashed into the Pentagon ?
Why is it that this report has never been shown on mainstream media but can be seen on my website ?
Why is it that we have not heard another word from Jamie McIntyre or CNN regarding this report ?
7 .
How was it that four commercial airliners were able to roam at will the northeastern sector of the United States without being intercepted ?
Of course , Flight 93 was intercepted and shot down by the U.S. military .
The northeastern sector of the United States is the most protected airspace in the world .
There are several Air Force bases very close to Washington , DC and no jets from these Air Force bases came close to intercepting the plane that hit the Pentagon , despite the fact that Vice President Cheney knew the plane was heading towards Washington , DC for almost an hour .
I could go on and on but I will leave that to those who consider the truth about what happened on 9/11 to be important .
You can go to my website or many other 9/11 websites and start reading about how outrageous the official 9/11 story is .
You can go to www.youtube.com and watch five videos that I have produced under my call name which is “ bushguiltyof911 ” .
Vice President Cheney met with the heads of the various oil companies right after Bush took office .
When the public wanted to know who was there and what they were talking about , Vice President Cheney fought this request to the United States Supreme Court ( the same court that elected George Bush in 2000 ) where he won .
They were talking about attacking Iraq in order to gain control of their oil fields .
They were talking about attacking Afghanistan to take over the construction of a gas pipeline through Afghanistan .
The Taliban , prior to September 11 , 2001 , had already said no to the Bush administration ’s request that an American company , Unical , construct the gas pipeline and in response President Bush said to the Taliban that the United States would attack them in October 2001 .
We did .
The Bush administration ’s purpose in planning and orchestrating 9/11 was to create an atmosphere of fear in this country so that the military / industrial / oil / private central banking complex could start their fake war on terror which included attacking Afghanistan and Iraq and probably … in the near future .
None of this would have been possible without the United States Congress and the corporately owned mainstream media being complicit in so far as not questioning the official 9/11 conspiracy theory but in fact labeling anyone who does question the official 9/11 conspiracy theory as a “ conspiracy nut ” .
Why is it that neither the United States Congress nor the mainstream media question the counting of our votes by electronic voting machines made by companies owned and controlled by neoconservative Republicans ?
It has been shown extensively and publicly that these electronic voting machines are completely hackable , even remotely , by a high school student .
Nevertheless , these machines count approximately 80 % of our votes .
Why is it that the United States Congress does not require the manufacturers of these machines to make the internal software available for inspection by us before and after these machines count our votes .
Why is it that only Ron Paul speaks out about the scam of the Federal Reserve Bank ?
Go to my website where I have several streaming videos on my homepage that simply and clearly explain the scam that the Federal Reserve Bank perpetrates on all of us and has done so since its creation .
What they call a “ business cycle ” is actually an intentional manipulation of the money supply for the sole benefit of the cartel of private banks that own the Federal Reserve Bank .
The Federal Reserve Bank prints money and then lends it to this government at interest .
Much of our income tax payments go to paying the interest on this loan of paper money that has no backing .
We must not vote for anyone who does not speak out about the lies and deceptions regarding 9/11 , the removal of all electronic voting machines from the election process and the termination of the Federal Reserve Bank .
Of course , there must be term limits and only public financing of national elections .

India has been warned it faces a smoking - related health crisis
Nearly one in five school children in India use some form of tobacco , according to a survey conducted by the World Health Organisation .
A national smoking ban has meanwhile cut passive smoking by almost 10 % .
The figures are part of the second - ever Global Youth Tobacco Survey , carried out in 140 countries .
The Indian report , released by Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss , polled 12,000 students and 3,000 school staff in the first half of 2006 .
Steady sales
The survey has thrown up some alarming results .
It says nearly 17 % of students aged 15 and under use some form of tobacco , most of them cigarettes .
Significantly , there is no difference in consumption levels among girls and boys , except in central India .
" Indication of increasing use among girls in some region is a matter of concern , " the report says .
What has alarmed administrators is that more than a third of school personnel , including teaching staff , use tobacco .
As role models , they should play an influential role in preventing tobacco use among their students rather than encouraging the practice , the report says .
And despite a countrywide ban , sale of tobacco and tobacco products to minors have shown no decline over the past three years .
' Positive impact '
There is some encouraging news for the government .
A ban on public smoking has seen a significant decline in exposure to second - hand smoke ( passive smoking ) from 49 % to 40 % .
The percentage of those who light their first cigarette below the age of 10 has also come down from 49 % to 37 % .
The report praises the government for creating a " positive impact " by enforcing a ban on smoking in public places and raising awareness among young people .
But , the report says , more must be done to control tobacco advertisement and teachers appropriate training and material to discourage smoking .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Federal employees charged millions of dollars to government credit or debit cards , according to a Government Accountability Office study released Wednesday .
Those charges include Internet dating services , iPods , expensive clothing , a $ 13,500 dinner and lingerie to be worn during jungle training in Ecuador , the study said .
The audit also found that government agencies could not account for nearly $ 2 million worth of items , which included computer servers , laptop computers , iPods and digital cameras .
Nearly half of transactions made in the 2006 fiscal year with government credit or debit cards -- referred to as " purchase cards " -- were improper , the study found , and the audit condemned the government - wide " rate of failure " as " unacceptably high . "
The improper purchases were either not authorized or did not meet the government 's requirements for using purchase cards , the study said .
Sens. Norm Coleman , R- Minnesota , and Carl Levin , D - Michigan , initiated the investigation into the use of government cards .
" Too many government employees have viewed purchases cards as their personal line of credit .
It 's time to cut up their cards and start over , " Coleman said in a news release about the GAO study .
" The basic rules for authorizing purchases and accounting for goods and services are not that difficult :
Use the card for legitimate purchases , not to cover the costs of buying yourself an iPod , " he added .
The study used scientific sampling to examine spending across federal agencies , and mined data from purchases made from July 1 , 2005 , through September 30 , 2006 .
The study categorizes the inappropriate purchases as " fraudulent , " " abusive , " or " improper . "
In the fraudulent category , the most egregious case involved a Forest Service employee writing about 180 credit - card - linked checks worth $ 642,000 to an individual with whom the employee shared living quarters and a bank account .
" All transactions were undetected by the agency , " the report said .
After an investigation initiated by a tip from a whistle - blower , the employee was indicted and pleaded guilty in June 2007 to embezzlement and tax fraud , the study said .
The employee was sentenced to 21 months of prison and was required to pay over $ 642,000 in restitution .
In another fraudulent case , a postmaster used a government credit card to subscribe to two Internet dating sites , the study said , and the employee also used a government computer to access pornographic sites .
The postmaster racked up $ 1,100 in charges for the dating services , it said , and " the activity went unnoticed " by U.S. Postal Service for a full year .
After an investigation , the employee paid back the $ 1,100 , the study said .
He was also removed from his position .
In a case characterized as abusive , four Department of Defense employees purchased $ 77,000 in clothing and accessories for service members from high - end clothing and sporting goods stores , including stores such as Brooks Brothers , Talbots and Johnston Murphy , the study said .
The DOD purchased the items to provide service members with civilian clothing while they worked at American embassies , the cardholders said , according to the study .
However , the purchases far exceeded the maximum allowance of $ 860 per person for civilian attire , the study noted .
In another case , USPS spent $ 13,500 on a dinner at Ruth Chris Steakhouse for employees who were attending a national postal forum in Orlando , Florida .
The dinner included more than 200 appetizers and the agency paid for about $ 3,000 of alcoholic drinks , including more than 40 bottles of wine and top - shelf liquor , the study said .
It deemed the dinner as an " excessive cost . "
Another case , described as a " questionable government need , " involved a State Department employee who spent $ 360 on women 's underwear and lingerie to wear during jungle training by " trainees of a drug enforcement program in Ecuador . "
A State Department official agreed that the charge , for items purchased from Seduccion Boutique , was " questionable " and said it should not have been approved .
About 300,000 government employees use purchase cards , the study said .
The purchase card system , which was established in the late 1980s , was designed to streamline federal purchasing , and the cards are typically are intended for purchases of $ 2,500 or less .
All purchases are to follow federal guidelines , which include proper authorization and independent receipt and acceptance .

All About GAO • U.S. Government
In 2000 , it took a decision of the Supreme Court to declare George W. Bush the winner over Al Gore in Florida , and recipient of the state 's electoral votes .
In anticipation of a close primary race this year ( 2008 ) , involving ballot stuffing , voter fraud , and more hanging chads , the Supreme Court declared George W. Bush the winner again .
This time , he beat out Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , and John Edwards .
Bush was also declared the winner of the Republican Primary over McCain , Romney , Huckabee , and Guiliani .
When it was pointed out that Bush was not on the ballot for either party , state election official Bertha Bumble said that " it does n't matter .
We know the will of the people and we are listening to that . "
" Most of our citizens are not able to vote anyway .
We 've got lots of old , retired Jews from up north who sit around all day playing shuffleboard and crowd the lines at the buffets .
We 've also got lots of Cubans who do n't speak English and spend all of their time using drugs and trying to kill each other .
The rest of our citizens are running around on the beach half naked trying to get a cameo on CSI Miami or are getting ready to serve lots of beer to alcoholic teens for spring break . "
" Since none of those people have the time to vote , we just did it for them . "
In Washington , President Bush graciously accepted his victory and announced that he would " do Jeb and the rest of them proud " in the upcoming November elections .
Since then , we 've grown and changed our routines , and now we do n't really think of ourselves as a print graphics department .
We think of ourselves as a desk that can produce graphics for whichever platform makes sense .
Here are some of the results :
 An interactive piece assessing the " surge " in Baghdad .
 A look at Barry Bonds 's home run record .
 A critique of the New York Times tower .
In this endeavor , we 're not alone .
Developing deep interactive features often means joining hands with a couple of other departments whose staff members have extensive specialized skills .
One new group in the newsroom , the interactive news technology department , is a group of talented software developers who sit nearby and focus their efforts on projects that require significant programming expertise .
Two recent collaborative projects with this group were our guide to where presidential candidates stand on the issues and our election results pages .
On other kinds of projects , we get together with the multimedia department .
Andrew Devigal manages the group , and I asked him if he could talk a little bit about what they do .
Here 's Andrew :
The multimedia department , like graphics , has staff members with a variety of experience that ranges from advanced degrees in computer science to several years ' worth of work in public radio .
By collaborating with many departments in the newsroom , especially the graphics department , we 've been able to produce media - rich narratives and experiences .
For example , Gabriel Dance worked with the graphics and video departments to produce The Met 's New Greek and Roman Galleries .
The package offers an immersive experience that includes photographic panoramas and a tour of the galleries with Michael Kimmelman , a Times art critic .
Our department also develops tools to help readers visualize complex sets of information .
Senior multimedia producer Tom Jackson collaborated with Archie Tse to design the " Is It Better to Buy or Rent ? " interactive .
Guidelines for Visual Communication
Q. Could you summarize what you consider the most important guidelines in effective visual communication ?
And could you provide us a gallery of diagrams / maps / charts that illustrate your guidelines ?
 Dick Purcell , Boulder , Colo .
A. I mentioned earlier that I 'd try to assemble a list of New York Times graphics that we 're mostly happy with .
I say mostly because we have n't created any perfect graphics , but this assemblage represents many of the strengths of the department .
To gather the list , I asked my colleagues in the department ( and other departments ) to contribute graphics they liked as well as a description of the process .
Here goes :
Erin Aigner , a graphics editor and cartographer , talks about an interactive trip up Mt. Kilimanjaro :
For our animation of Tom Bissell 's climb up Mt. Kilimanjaro , we wanted to give the reader a panoramic view of the mountain and a sense of the scale of his weeklong journey .
To make an accurate model of the mountain , I used digital elevation data to create a 3 - D model .
Then I traced the climbers ' route onto a satellite image of the mountain , which I draped over the model so that the different types of land cover looked realistic .
After the model was created , I used software that allows you to control environmental elements like light and clouds to create a fly - though movie .
My colleague , Vu Nguyen , designed the interface and integrated all the elements in Flash .
Jonathan Corum , science graphics editor , describes his graphic ( print version and Web version ) covering the presidential debates :
One recent example of a graphic that used a range of tools as part of the creative process was the " String of Debates " graphic , part of which was expanded online as the " Naming Names " interactive feature .
The graphic showed word usage among major presidential candidates across a series of debates , and used a set of circles to indicate when candidates spoke the last name of another candidate .
Work on the project ranged from extremely tedious ( hours of scripting and combing through debate transcripts to separate the different candidates ) to extremely interesting ( learning a new software package to produce the desired chart ) .
The circle design was created with an impressive piece of software called Circos , which was originally built to visualize genomic data .
To make it work I had to encode the entire series of debates as if it was a genome .
So each presidential candidate was a chromosome , and each debate was a chromosome band , and each spoken word was a nucleotide .
It sounds a bit ridiculous , but that was all behind the scenes .
The end result is a fairly simple interactive graphic , but hopefully one that caught the eye and allowed readers to find patterns across the long series of debates .
Amanda Cox , a graphics editor , describes interactive graphics she worked on that show box office revenues and the price of oil :
Two of my favorite graphics so far this year involve borrowing visual forms .
The first shows the box office revenue and timing of individual films .
In preparation for the Oscars a year ago , I did a quick Google Scholar search , and one thread was about how more people go to see films that are nominated for awards .
I gathered enough data so we could look at this empirically , but we ended up pursuing a different idea and I moved the box office data to an " ideas " folder in the depths of my computer .
A few weeks ago , I met Lee Byron , an undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon , and he showed me work that he had done using a somewhat novel form to look at his personal music listenening history .
It seemed like a fun way to go this year , especially online , where we were able to let readers discover patterns about films they had seen since the late 1980's .
The other graphic looks at oil prices and consumption in a way that 's a little odd , but also very informative .
I had seen a chart like this in an oil industry journal from the 1980's , and also in a publication by the Rocky Mountain Institute , a nonprofit energy research group .
I thought it was brilliant , but the tricky part for us was making it accessible for a broader audience .
Jad Mouawad , a business reporter who covers the energy industry , graciously helped out with the audio tour .
Gabriel Dance , a senior producer in the multimedia department , describes his development of a piece that displays the photos of the American soldiers who have been killed in Iraq :
" Faces of the Dead " was a design challenge on several fronts .
The interface needed to be simple , but readers needed to be able see the faces , and they needed to be able to search for individual soldiers , either by name or location .
On top of that , I really wanted to encourage readers to stay with the piece for a few minutes , so they could fully absorb both the images and the detailed information .
I went through several revisions and felt it was important that the faces and a count of the total number of casualties be present on the screen at the same time , and it was difficult to determine how to do that .
While working on the project , I picked up a design magazine for inspiration , and I saw an illustration with a scantron sheet  like the ones we filled out in grade school for standardized tests  that had an image of a face made up of the little , filled - in bubbles .
Something clicked .
The scantron bubbles turned into pixels , and each pixel would represent one soldier .
This made it possible to get all 3,000 soldiers on the screen at one time .
It also made it possible for people to see a new image simply by clicking on any pixel , which encouraged further interaction .
Shan Carter , a graphics editor and interactive designer , talks about how breaking news graphics come together :
Producing in - depth , explanatory graphics in response to breaking news is nearly impossible for one person .
When news breaks , our entire team comes together , and each person focuses on one aspect of the graphic .
Six people are credited for the crash graphic .
Some are reporters who can track down floorplans or talk to witnesses ; others are skilled illustrators who can accurately render an entire building in a few hours ; my job is usually to bring all the information and illustrations together into an animated narrative for the Web .
Matthew Ericson , the deputy graphics director , talks about a graphic that sorts out court rulings on detainee cases :
It 's not the sexiest graphic , but one of my favorite graphics from 2006 was a large timeline we did when the Supreme Court ruled for the fourth time on the issue of Guantánamo Bay detainees .
The four cases had a pretty long legal history , with cases filed , and appeals filed , and more appeals filed .
I had a hard time keeping the cases straight myself , so I figured there had to be a few readers out there who were confused .
Farhana Hossain , our graphics editor in the Washington bureau , started researching the history of the cases and compiling a chronology not only of court decisions in the cases , but also of actions the Bush administration had taken in response to them .
The court announced the Hamdan v. Rumsfeld decision the next day , and we quickly began sketching out how we wanted to arrange the graphic .
Over the course of the day , we edited the text to fit the space available , filled in some missing pieces of information , ran it by our terrific legal correspondents , and we had it on the page by about 9 p.m. , in time for our first edition .
Dylan McClain , a business graphics editor , on a two - page print graphic describing the declining dollar , in 1995 :
The basic idea was pretty straightforward , but producing the graphic itself was difficult .
The data was captured on a Friday evening , and then I went in early Sunday morning to begin plotting it .
I had to sift through each and every data point ( there were more than 2,000 for both the mark and the yen ) and space them out according to when each trade occurred .
It took me the entire day .
The other charts had already been produced and put onto the pages .
I recall that I finished up the mark and yen charts about an hour before deadline .
Now , of course , it would be much easier .
Amy Schoenfeld , a business graphics editor describes a feature about Super Bowl advertising :
With several weeks to go before the 2007 Super Bowl , we started thinking  has anyone kept track of Super Bowl ads over the years ?
We found a research group that had and used their historical database to look at trends .
Did Budweiser really advertise every year ?
Was humor always a strategy ?
We plotted and re-plotted the charts for the print version , but felt they lacked what we were most excited about  the actual ads .
So we set up the page like a playbook , organizing strategies on either side of the main chart to highlight some of the most popular and unusual ads .
For the Web version , we used the charts to link to the actual commercials .
We collected these from ad agencies over a couple of weeks ( the research group had the ads only on VHS tapes ) .
We set up the interactive with a timeline slider that allowed users to scroll through two decades of data and ads .
This design allows us to update the project each year .
Archie
Tse , a senior graphics editor , talks about a print graphic he researched while he was in Iraq :
I was interviewing a Sunni family in their Baghdad apartment when Saddam Hussein 's capture was announced on the television .
Almost immediately the sound of gunfire erupted across the city as Iraqis reacted to the news .
I went to the Green Zone to cover the news conference where they provided details on how Saddam had been found .
That evening , we found out that the military would give a tour of the site to the press the next morning .
So after just a couple of hours of sleep , five members of the Times Baghdad bureau , two reporters , a photographer , a translator and I woke up early to make the drive to a military base in Tikrit .
From there , we were flown in helicopters to Ad - Dawr , a small village along the Tigris .
We walked a short distance to a farmer 's shack .
The spider hole was off to the side of the courtyard in front of the shack .
I paced out the dimensions of the courtyard and the interior of the shack and made numerous sketches of the spatial relationships between the structures .
They let each of us go down into the spider hole .
The layout of the hole , which I thought was one of the most important details , was more like a " T " than an " L. " I transmitted my sketches back to the graphics department in New York , where two of my colleagues created a 3 - D diagram of the compound for the next day 's paper .
Joe Ward , sports graphics editor , talks about his analysis of the technique employed by the United States sprinter Lauren Williams :
One of the things I find most satisfying about sports graphics is the opportunity to dissect seemingly simple athletic movements .
Lauren Williams is simply running 100 meters .
But when her stride , her pace , her body angle and her leg angles are all broken down by the scientists who study them , the difference between these athletes and the rest of us becomes really clear .
Karl Russell , a business graphics editor , talks about a 12 - column , print graphic about two days of global market turmoil :
Early in the day we had a meeting , and the news justified going big .
We decided to show market performance in 10 countries and have the charts stretch across two pages .
We wanted to chart intra-day stock movement ( which would walk readers through the events minute by minute ) and a long - term trend for context .
Also , since we work closely with photo editors , we knew there were lots of good pictures of trading floors , a perfect fit .
This graphic was a group effort  a team of four people downloaded data , created charts , reported the descriptions and chose photos .
I was responsible for the overall composition .
Mika Gröndahl , a graphics editor and illustrator , talks about his diagram of a centrifuge for the print version of Science Times :
ABC's John McWethy Dies in Skiing Accident 1947-2008
Retired ABC News Reporter , 61 , died on Wednesday morning after a skiing accident in Keystone , Colorado .
The accident occurred at Keystone Resort where it is reported McWethy lost control and crashed into a tree .
Cause of death , according to Summit County coroner , was blunt force trauma to the chest .
McWethy began his career as a print journalist in 1972 , writing for U.S. News & World Report for seven years .
He became the magazine 's White House correspondent in 1977 .
McWethy joined ABC News in 1979 .
He was the network 's National Security Correspondent from 1985 until his retirement in 2003 .
He covered military , terrorism , diplomacy and intelligence .
He was in the Pentagon when it was struck by a hijacked passenger plane , American Airlines Flight 77 , during the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
McWethy received several awards for his body of work , including five Emmy Awards , the Alfred I. duPont - Columbia University Award , and an Overseas Press Club award in 1987 .
We was granted an honorary doctorate degree from DePauw in 2003 ( see photo below ) .
After retiring in 2003 , McWethy continued to serve as a Special Correspondent for ABC News until 2006 .
McWethy died on February 6 , 2008 .
Witnesses say he was skiing fast , missed a turn , and struck a tree , suffering blunt force trauma to his chest .
He is survived by a wife and two adult children .
The most comprehensive examination of the UK 's asylum system ever conducted has found it " marred by inhumanity " and " not yet fit for purpose " .
The report , published by the Independent Asylum Commission , is a damning indictment of the Home Office 's failure to deal fairly with those applying for sanctuary in this country .
The commission found that Britain 's treatment of asylum - seekers " falls seriously below the standards to be expected of a humane and civilised society " .
Its interim report will be delivered to the Home Office today by a delegation of asylum - seekers .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The report details how the " adversarial " system is failing applicants from the very first point of interview , with officials accused of stacking the odds against genuine claimants .
" A ' culture of disbelief ' persists among decision - makers , " it said .
" Along with lack of access to legal advice for applicants this is leading to perverse and unjust decisions . "
The findings are the result of the most thorough look at the system in history , with testimonies from every sphere of society , including three former home secretaries , more than 100 NGOs , 90 asylum - seekers , the police , local authorities , and hundreds of citizens .
All - day hearings were held in seven major cities , where hundreds of people gave evidence , from those who brand the system too lenient to those who think it is a blot on the country 's human rights record .
As well as this current information , an independent academic body was tasked to gather all documents already published on the issue in the past five years , from both sides of the political spectrum .
Three areas of the system came under particular fire .
The use of detention centres – especially to lock up children , pregnant women and torture victims – was condemned , as was the often brutal handling of removals , and the use of destitution as a tool to drive claimants out of the country .
Sir John Waite , co-chair of the commission said : " The overuse of detention , the scale of destitution and the severity of removals are all areas which need attention before the system can be described as fit for purpose " .
The commissioners found that locking up those seeking asylum was costly and often completely needless .
" The detention of asylum - seekers is overused , oppressive and an unnecessary burden on the taxpayer , " they said .
The detention of children was in turn branded " wholly unjustified " .

Sir John called for " a thorough re-examination " of the detention and bail system , which he said treated asylum - seekers like criminals .
" The justification for such a system is the fear of absconding , and that fear is , in our opinion , grossly exaggerated , " he said .
According to the commission , factors such as post - traumatic stress were not considered enough when asylum - seekers had their initial interviews with border officials .
Victims of rape and torture who might initially find it difficult to describe their experiences sometimes had their cases overlooked because they only described these incidents in later conversations .
" Some of those seeking sanctuary , particularly women , children and torture survivors , have additional vulnerabilities that are not being appropriately addressed , " it found .
Cuts in the legal aid budget have also made it more difficult for those with complex cases to find lawyers to take them on , resulting in many genuine claims being overlooked .
Removals by private security firms were described by the commission as being carried out with " unnecessary violence and carelessness " .
The commission said it had heard testimony of the " very severe handling " of claimants , and criticised the absence of any monitoring system to follow - up on the fate of those removed .
The Liberal Democrats ' home affairs spokesman , Chris Huhne , said : " The whole system is fundamentally a mess and broken , and this report makes a pretty good job of summarising that .
The asylum system combines incredible complexity with systematic incompetence , and thousands wait for a decision year after year " .
Donna Covey , chief executive of the Refugee Council , said : " This is an important set of findings from an independent commission , which presents overwhelming evidence that the asylum system is still not fit for purpose .
" It is surely now time for the Government to take a long hard look at the way it treats people seeking sanctuary on our shores .
We must treat people with basic decency , and the system must get asylum decisions right – they are a matter of life and death . "
While the report disclosed the initial findings of the commission , further publications in May , June and July will also include recommendations on how to deliver reform and rectify problems in the system .
Yeukai Taruvinga , 25 : ' I found the treatment very brutal .
I was expecting to receive sanctuary '
Yeukai Taruvinga , has seen first hand the iniquities of the asylum system .
A student activist from Zimbabwe , she fled to the UK in 2001 , after persecution for her support of the opposition party Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
When she arrived in Britain she thought things would improve , but life was not as she 'd hoped .
" I was expecting to receive sanctuary , but when I came to the UK it was a completely different scenario .
I found the treatment of asylum - seekers was very brutal and inhumane " .
" I was detained several times without committing any crime – just because I was an asylum - seeker , " she said .
" My treatment by officers was very rough , and in one centre I was put into a cell with no windows and a dirty bed .
If you needed help there was no way of calling because the reception was so far away .
All we could do was bang on the door . "
She has been transported around the country between three different detention centres , never knowing if they were sending her home or moving her on .
" It was very traumatic and they never explained why they were moving me " , she said .
" I kept thinking they were about to take me back to Zimbabwe " .
Ms Taruvinga has not been in detention now since 2005 , but when she was first released she was left with nowhere to go and nothing to eat .
After being told she was not entitled to any support , she was forced to beg from churches to find food to eat .
An Indian physicist puts a PC with a high speed internet connection in a wall in the slums and watches what happens .
Based on the results , he talks about issues of digital divide , computer education and kids , the dynamics of the third world getting online .
New Delhi physicist Sugata Mitra has a radical proposal for bringing his country 's next generation into the Info Age from a Businessweek Online Daily Briefing ,
March 2 , 2000 .
Edited by Paul Judge Sugata Mitra has a PhD in physics and heads research efforts at New Delhi's NIIT , a fast - growing software and education company with sales of more than $ 200 million and a market cap over $ 2 billion .
But Mitra 's passion is computer - based education , specifically for India 's poor .
He believes that children , even terribly poor kids with little education , can quickly teach themselves the rudiments of computer literacy .
The key , he contends , is for teachers and other adults to give them free rein , so their natural curiosity takes over and they teach themselves .
He calls the concept " minimally invasive education . "
To test his ideas , Mitra 13 months ago launched something he calls " the hole in the wall experiment . "
He took a PC connected to a high - speed data connection and imbedded it in a concrete wall next to NIIT 's headquarters in the south end of New Delhi .
The wall separates the company 's grounds from a garbage - strewn empty lot used by the poor as a public bathroom .
Mitra simply left the computer on , connected to the Internet , and allowed any passerby to play with it .
He monitored activity on the PC using a remote computer and a video camera mounted in a nearby tree .
What he discovered was that the most avid users of the machine were ghetto kids aged 6 to 12 , most of whom have only the most rudimentary education and little knowledge of English .
Yet within days , the kids had taught themselves to draw on the computer and to browse the Net .
Some of the other things they learned , Mitra says , astonished him .
The physicist has since installed a computer in a rural neighborhood with similar results .
He 's convinced that 500 million children could achieve basic computer literacy over the next five years , if the Indian government put 100,000 Net - connected PCs in schools and trained teachers in some basic " noninvasive " teaching techniques for guiding children in using them .
Total investment required , he figures : Around $ 2 billion .
On Feb. 25 , BW Online Contributing Editor Thane Peterson sat down with Mitra , a stocky 48 - year - old with a mustache and a mop of graying black hair , in his tiny , triangular office at NIIT 's R&D center on the campus of the Indian Institute of Technology in the south part of New Delhi .
Here are edited excerpts of their conversation .
Q : What gave you the idea of giving slum kids access to the Internet ?
A : It was a social observation rather than a scientific one .
Any parent who had given his child a computer would invariably remark to me about it .
I could hardly ever find an exception .
Within a very short period of time , the parent would be claiming that the child was a genius with a computer .
When I poked a little further , I invariably found that the child was doing things with the computer that the parent did n't understand .
I asked myself whether the child was really doing something exceptional or if what we were seeing was adult incomprehension .
If the adult was simply underestimating the child 's ability to cope with a computer , then that should happen with any child .
And I asked myself , " Why then would we want to use the same teaching methods for children as we use for teaching adults ? "
At first , I tested my ideas with children who were easily available -- children at the company here , whose parents are in our executive group ..
Then we tried this " hole in the wall " concept , where we put a high - powered Pentium computer with a fast Internet connection into a wall and let [ slum ] children have access to it with no explanation whatsoever .
To be very brief on what happened , the results have been uniform every time we 've done this experiment .
You get base level computer literacy almost instantly .
By computer literacy , I mean what we adults define as computer literacy :
The ability to use the mouse , to point , to drag , to drop , to copy , and to browse the Internet .
The children create their own metaphors to do this .
To give you an idea of what I mean , a journalist came up to one of these kids and asked him , " How do you know so much about computers ? "
The answer seemed very strange to her because the kid said , " What 's a computer ? "
The terminology is not as important as the metaphor .
If they 've got the idea of how a mouse works and that the Internet is [ like a wall they can paint on ] , who cares if they know that a computer is called a computer and a mouse is called a mouse ?
In most of our classes here at NIIT , we spend time teaching people the terminology and such .
That seems irrelevant to me with these children .
But we also found that they would tend to plateau out .
They would surf the Web -- Disney.com is very popular with them because they like games .
And they would use [ Microsoft ] Paint .
It 's very , very popular with all of them .
Because these are deprived children who do not have easy access to paper and paint .
Every child likes to paint , so they would do it with that program .
However , that 's all they could do .
So I intervened , and I played an MP3 [ digital - music file ] for them .
They were astonished to hear music come out of the computer for the first time .
They said , " Oh , does it work like a TV or radio ? "
I said , in keeping with my approach , " Well , I know how to get there but I do n't know how it works . "
Then I [ left ] .
As I would have expected , seven days later they could have taught me a few things about MP3 .
They had discovered what MP3 was , downloaded free players , and were playing their favorite songs .
As usual , they did n't know what any of it was called .
But they would say , " if you take this little box , and you drag this file into this box , it plays music . "
They had found out where all the Hindi music was on the Web and had pulled it out .
Q : What does it mean ?
What does it say for the potential of these slum kids ?
After all , being able to download music is n't enough to get them a job .
A : I do n't wish to claim that this shows anything more or less than what it has shown , which is that curious kids in groups can train themselves to operate a computer at a basic level .
In doing so , they also can get a generally good idea about the nature of browsing and the nature of the Internet ...
And , therefore , if they view these things as worth learning , no formal infrastructure is needed [ to teach them ] .
Now , that 's a big deal , because everyone agrees that today 's children must be computer - literate .
If computer literacy is defined as turning a computer on and off and doing the basic functions , then this method allows that kind of computer literacy to be achieved with no formal instruction .
Therefore any formal instruction for that kind of education is a waste of time and money .
You can use that time and money to have a teacher teach something else that children cannot learn on their own .
Q : What else have you learned ?
A : Well , I tried another experiment .
I went to a middle - class school and chose some ninth graders , two girls and two boys .
I called their physics teacher in and asked him , " What are you going to teach these children next year at this time ? "
He mentioned viscosity .
I asked him to write down five possible exam questions on the subject .
I then took the four children and said , " Look here guys .
I have a little problem for you . "
They read the questions and said they did n't understand them , it was Greek to them .
So I said , " Here 's a terminal .
I 'll give you two hours to find the answers . "
Then I did my usual thing : I closed the door and went off somewhere else .
They answered all five questions in two hours .
The physics teacher checked the answers , and they were correct .
That , of itself , does n't mean much .
But I said to him , " Talk to the children and find out if they really learned something about this subject . "
So he spent half an hour talking to them .
He came out and said , " They do n't know everything about this subject or everything I would teach them .
But they do know one hell of a lot about it .
And they know a couple of things about it I did n't know . "
That 's not a wow for the children , it 's a wow for the Internet .
It shows you what it 's capable of .
The slum children do n't have physics teachers .
But if I could make them curious enough , then all the content they need is out there .
The greatest expert on earth on viscosity probably has his papers up there on the Web somewhere .
Creating content is not what 's important .
What is important is infrastructure and access ...
The teacher 's job is very simple .
It 's to help the children ask the right questions .
Q : Are you saying that if we put computers in all the slums , slum kids could become literate on their own ?
A : I 'm saying that , in situations where we cannot intervene very frequently , you can multiply the effectiveness of 10 teachers by 100 - or 1,000 - fold if you give children access to the Internet .
Q : This is your concept of minimally invasive education ?
A : Yes .
It started out as a joke but I 've kept using the term ...
This is a system of education where you assume that children know how to put two and two together on their own .
So you stand aside and intervene only if you see them going in a direction that might lead into a blind alley .
That 's just so that you do n't waste time ...
That would create teachers who are experts at composing questions .
Q : What are the business applications of all this ?
A : I get asked this question all the time .
It 's kind of ironic that a company that makes [ a big chunk of its sales from running computer - training institutes ] should invent a method where no teacher is required .
The answer is that just because a method is economically viable , does n't mean you should n't look for alternatives .
A good business is one which provides more and more for less and less .
The cost of your goods and services should spiral downwards .
The second point is that we are going to have an e-commerce boom .
But what happens when an Indian businessman puts his shop up on the Web ?
Where 's he going to get customers from ?
If someone lets me do this experiment for five years , with 100,000 kiosks , I reckon that I could get 500 million children computer - literate .
It would cost $ 2 billion .
But if you had to pay to educate the same children using traditional methods , it would cost twice as much .
Q : If this were to become a business , would it require government funding ?
A : Advertisers like Coca - Cola might be interested .
But it would absolutely have to have government funding .
I can't think of a company that would put $ 2 billion into this .
The governments will have to realize that the problem of the haves and have - nots is about to [ become ] the problem of the knows and knows - not .
Do we want to create another great big divide where the problem of illiteracy will come back in another context ?
In a very short period of time , adults who do not know how to deal with a [ computer ] mouse will have a very difficult time dealing with almost everything in life .
Q : But most of the information on the Internet is in English and the people you 're talking about do n't speak English .
A : We had some very surprising results there .
We all have great misconceptions about what these children know and do n't know .
At first , I made a Hindi interface for the kids , which gave them links for hooking up with Web sites in their own language .
I thought it would be a great hit .
Guess what they did with it ?
They shut it down and went back to Internet Explorer .
I realized that they may not understand the dictionary meaning of [ English ] words , but they have an operational understanding .
They know what that word does .
They do n't know how to pronounce F - I - L - E , but they know that within it are options of saving and opening up files ...
The fact that the Internet is in English will not stop them from accessing it .
They invent their own terminology for what 's going on .
For example , they call the pointer of the mouse sui , which is Hindi for needle .
More interesting is the hourglass that appears when something is happening .
Most Indians have never heard of an hourglass .
I asked them , " What does that mean ? "
They said , " It 's a damru , " which is Hindi for Shiva 's drum .
[ The God ]
Shiva holds an hourglass - shaped drum in his hand that you can shake from side to side .
So they said the sui became a damru when the " thing " [ the computer ] was doing something .
Q : Of all the things the children did and learned , what did you find the most surprising ?
A : One day there was a document file on the desktop of the computer .
It was called " untitled.doc " and it said in big colorful letters , " I Love India . "
I could n't believe it for the simple reason that there was no keyboard on the computer [ only a touch screen ] .
I asked my main assistant -- a young boy , eight years old , the son of a local betel - nut seller -- and I asked him , " How on earth did you do this ? "
He showed me the character map inside [ Microsoft ]
Word .
So he had gotten into the character map inside Word , and dragged and dropped the letters onto the screen , then increased the point size and painted the letters .
I was stunned because I did n't know that the character map existed -- and I have a PhD. Q : So what you 're talking about is a different sort of literacy , a sort of functional literacy ...
A : Yes , it 's functional literacy .
There are two examples I 'd like to give you from the recent past .
It 's already happened in cable TV in India .
There are 50 or 60 million cable - TV connections in India at this point in time .
The guys who set up the meters , splice the coaxial cables , make the connection to the house , etc. , are very similar to these kids .
They do n't know what they 're doing .
They only know that if you do these things , you 'll get the cable channel .
And they 've managed to [ install ] 60 million cable connections so far .
Example No. 2 is the bicycle .
I think we have the biggest bicycle - manufacturing industry in the world .
The bicycle is ubiquitous here , and it's much the same in Malaysia , China , Africa .
But you do n't ask how the population became bicycle - literate .
They just use it .
So what I 'd like to see is an India in which a large part [ of the population ] treats the computer that way .
The other thing is [ how the Internet will change when most Indians gain access to it ] .
We have the analogy of cable TV in India .
Originally , it was all in English .
It took exactly four years for all the programming to become Hindi .
Star TV is now almost all in Hindi .
If you go to Bangkok , they hate it .
Q : You 're saying that a lot of Hindi content will appear as more Indians surf the Net ?
A : Exactly .
Let me go on record as saying it's not a question of what the Internet will do to India .
It 's a question of what India will do to the Internet ...
If rural India goes onto the Internet , there will be an absolute flood of Indian - language content from people trying to sell to them .
Q : Has the Indian or any other government expressed interest in funding such a project ?
A : Several government agencies , several state governments , and several world agencies have expressed an interest .
Unfortunately , I do n't want to name them because I need to get the funds first .
Q : You say that only the children used the computer , not adults .
What does this mean for adult education ?
A : I 'm not even going to suggest that we use this [ technique ] for adults .
The only reaction we got from adults was , " What on earth is this for ?
Why is there no one here to teach us something ?
How are we ever going to use this ? "
I contend that by the time we are 16 , we are taught to want teachers , taught that we cannot learn anything without teachers .
There are two points I 'd like to make about the adults .
One is that the adults asked the children to do things for them .
For example , to read their horoscopes on the Hindi news sites .
The second thing is the reaction of the women .
I would ask them why they did n't use [ the computer ] , and they would say , " I do n't have enough brains to understand all this . "
I would say , " What about your daughters ? "
And the answer was , " They have lots of brains . "
So I said , " Do you think I should just remove this thing ? "
The answer was always , " No , no , no . " I asked why not .
And they said , " Because it 's very good for the children . "
Now , if the mothers have realized that , I 'm happy .
I do n't care if they do n't come [ to use the computer ] .
Because all we have to do is wait one generation .
Not even that .
In five years , a 13 - year - old is going to be 18 and be an adult .
Q : Where do you go from here ?
A : There is one experiment that scares me .
These children do n't know what e-mail is .
If I gave them e-mail , I do n't know what would happen .
I 'll probably try it anyway .
But remember the stories one used to hear about people finding lost tribes and introducing them to Coca - Cola ?
I 'm really seriously scared about what would happen if suddenly the whole wide world had access to these kids .
I do n't know who would talk to them for what purpose .
Racial healer Lou Dobbs explains how he ’s sick of “ cotton pickin ' ” black leaders telling him how he can and ca n’t talk about race ( he catches himself at the last minute — sorta ) …
Special thanks to TPM Reader AR for the catch .
Late Update :
Whenever we do posts like this , we ’ll have a certain amount of readers who write in and say , ‘ hey , what he said was n’t racist ’ .
So just so we ’re clear : we ’re not saying it was .
Many of the videos we publish , like the Rep. Sestak one on Friday , or this earlier one about the Obama surrogate from Texas who could n’t come up with a single Obama accomplishment when asked , are just funny moments on TV that we share for a mix of news and entertainment value .
As someone who ’s done some TV I certainly know that all sorts of things can come out of your mouth when you ’re ad - libbing .
But in this case , when Lou Dobbs is railing against African - Americans like Condi Rice and Barack Obama for having the temerity to say that race is still an issue in America and the first adjective that pops into his head to describe them is “ cotton - pickin ' ” , we think it deserves a little tweak .
HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - Scientists in Finland said they had replaced a 65 - year - old patient ’s upper jaw with a bone transplant cultivated from stem cells isolated from his own fatty tissue and grown inside his abdomen .

Researchers said on Friday the breakthrough opened up new ways to treat severe tissue damage and made the prospect of custom - made living spares parts for humans a step closer to reality .
“ There have been a couple of similar - sounding procedures before , but these did n’t use the patient ’s own stem cells that were first cultured and expanded in laboratory and differentiated into bone tissue , ” said Riitta Suuronen of the Regea Institute of Regenerative Medicine , part of the University of Tampere .
She told a news conference the patient was recovering more quickly than he would have if he had received a bone graft from his leg .
“ From the outside nobody would be able to tell he has been through such a procedure , ” she said .
She added , the team used no materials from animals -- preventing the risk of transmitting viruses than can be hidden in an animal ’s DNA , and followed European Union guidelines .
Stem cells are the body ’s master cells and they can be found throughout the blood and tissues .
Researchers have recently found that fat contains stem cells which can be directed to form a variety of different tissues .
Using a patient ’s own stem cells provides a tailor - made transplant that the body should not reject .
Suuronen and her colleagues -- the project was run jointly with the Helsinki University Central Hospital -- isolated stem cells from the patient ’s fat and grew them for two weeks in a specially formulated nutritious soup that included the patient ’s own blood serum .
In this case they identified and pulled out cells called mesenchymal stem cells -- immature cells than can give rise to bone , muscle or blood vessels .
When they had enough cells to work with , they attached them to a scaffold made out of a calcium phosphate biomaterial and then put it inside the patient ’s abdomen to grow for nine months .
The cells turned into a variety of tissues and even produced blood vessels , the researchers said .
The block was later transplanted into the patient ’s head and connected to the skull bone using screws and microsurgery to connect arteries and veins to the vessels of the neck .
The patient ’s upper jaw had previously been removed due to a benign tumor and he was unable to eat or speak without the use of a removable prosthesis .
Suuronen said her team had submitted a report on the procedure to a medical journal to be reviewed .

Sadly , Borders Group , Inc. is in trouble and it's up for sale .
More and more of these companies continue to drop as consumers pinch pennies on wanna - have but do n't - need items .
I listened to analysts talking about this on Bloomberg yesterday , and they do n't seem to really get it .
There was a discussion of ways in which Borders can improve sales , and one of them was new book club memberships to be offered by Borders .
" New " book club memberships ( whatever that means ) wo n't save this business .
People do n't want to buy memberships when they can shop online and have greater selection , better prices , and enjoy the surfing experience .
Borders is also going to " face out " more of its books , but that 's not a long - term solution either .
Borders problems go beyond the looming economic pickle , however .
As book lovers know , surfing for books online leads to you discovering many other books that were n't formerly on your radar map .
Soon the wish list grows and grows , but it 's a fun way to relax .
Plus you come across great reviews and interesting people with fabulous book lists that lead you unto even more discoveries .
Book shopping online is a better and cheaper experience for most people .
Then there 's those great deals on used books —
I even find good books at .01 plus $ 3.99 shipping .
As much as I love bookstores , two big book chains can't survive in this era .
It 's too costly for them to operate , and people just do n't read anymore .

Rose Bowl Parade 2008 –
On January 1st 2008 a coalition of groups gathered at the Tournament of Roses Parade to attract world wide attention to the need to impeach George W. Bush and Dick Cheney .
DALLAS ( AP )  American Airlines canceled 850 more flights on Wednesday as it reinspected the wiring on its MD - 80 jets .
An American spokesman , Tim Wagner , says 208 of those flights canceled Wednesday are at the carrier ’s main hub at Dallas - Fort Worth International Airport .
The nation ’s largest carrier canceled nearly 500 flights on Tuesday .
It is the second wave of cancellations at American over the same issue .
American is inspecting and  if necessary  reworking wiring bundles on its MD - 80 aircraft to comply with federal safety rules .
The airline operates about 2,300 daily flights .
Airline officials say passenger safety was never compromised .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Thousands of Okinawans rallied on Sunday to protest crimes by U.S. troops and demand a smaller U.S. military presence on the southern Japanese island after last month ’s arrest of a Marine on suspicion of raping a schoolgirl .
Thousands of Okinawans rally in Chatan town to protest against crimes committed by U.S. troops and to demand a smaller U.S. military presence on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa March 23 , 2008 , after last month 's arrest of a Marine on suspicion of raping a schoolgirl .

“ Crimes and accidents due to the bases have happened over and over and Okinawa has protested with intense anger to both the U.S. and Japanese governments , ” Kyodo quoted Okinawa City Mayor Mitsuko Tomon as telling a crowd gathered in heavy rain in the town of Chatan , where the February incident occurred .
“ But each time , our voices have been trampled and there has been no end to the heinous crimes , ” the mayor added .
Organisers estimated about 6,000 people took part in the rally , Kyodo news agency said .
Police declined to give an estimate .
The arrest of U.S. Marine Tyrone Hadnott , 38 , on suspicion of raping a 14 - year - old girl sparked outrage on Okinawa , host to a big chunk of the nearly 50,000 U.S. troops in Japan , and stirred memories of the 1995 rape of a 12 - year - old girl that prompted huge anti-base protests and jolted the U.S. - Japan alliance .
The girl , who came under heavy criticism on the Internet , later dropped charges and Hadnott was released to the custody of U.S. military authorities , who have been investigating the case .
Participants in Sunday ’s rally adopted a resolution demanding consolidation of the U.S. bases and revisions to a pact governing the status of U.S. military personnel in Japan to give Japanese authorities greater legal jurisdiction .
Both Tokyo and Washington have so far rejected demands to revise the Status of Forces Agreement .
BROADER PLANS
“ The rights of the people of Okinawa continue to be violated by the base - related damage , and we call on both the U.S. and Japanese governments to fundamentally revise the Status of Forces Agreement , ” Kyodo quoted the resolution as saying .
The pact was not an issue in the Hadnott case since the Marine was arrested off - base by Japanese police .
Organisers , including women ’s groups , had hoped for a turnout of around 10,000 people but squabbling between conservative politicians and leftist opposition groups undercut their efforts .
The rally comes as Tokyo is trying to persuade local residents to accept a plan to shift key functions of the U.S. Marine ’s Futenma air station from the crowded central city of Ginowan to the lightly populated coastal town of Nago .
Relocating Futenma is key to a broader plan to shift some 8,000 of the 13,000 Marines now on Okinawa to the U.S. territory of Guam to lighten the presence of the U.S. military on the Japanese island .
Nago authorities have agreed to the move but sticky details remain to be worked out .
Anti-base critics argue the consolidation plans will only slightly reduce Okinawa ’s burden for the U.S. - Japan security alliance , a pillar of Japan ’s post - World War Two diplomacy .
Friction with local communities near U.S. bases often occurs because of concern about crime , accidents and noise , although sensitivities are greater in Okinawa because of the heavy U.S. presence and the island ’s long tense relations with the mainland .
On Sunday , the U.S. military said it would cooperate with Japanese police in their investigation of the killing of a taxi driver found stabbed in his cab in Yokosuka , south of Tokyo .
A U.S. credit card apparently belonging to a U.S. sailor who has been charged with desertion was found in the cab .
The sailor , who has been taken into U.S. military custody , has not been named as a suspect but may have information regarding the murder case , the U.S. Navy said in a statement on Saturday .
Japanese media said the sailor had denied involvement .
From ALLAN HALL in Berlin
Last updated at 23:49 02 March 2008
A year ago , he was a cute and cuddly ball of white fur who captured the hearts of millions worldwide .
But Knut the polar bear has grown up fast - as this startled young visitor to Berlin Zoo discovered .
Knut now weighs 22 stone and has six - inch claws and a fearsome set of fangs to match .
And he seemed to be particularly keen to test them on the three - year - old boy lying on the ground next to his enclosure .
Scroll down for more ...
Fangs for the memories :
Knut is separated from this little boy by six inches of glass
Fortunately for the youngster , six inches of glass capable of withstanding a mortar attack separated him from the jaws of the world 's most famous captive bear .
Knut was rejected by his mother at birth in December 2006 .
Some animal rights activists said it would be better for him to die than to be weaned by mankind .
Scroll down for more ...
Harmless :
Knut when he hit the headlines as a cute cub
The zoo directors decided to let him live , however , and he went on to become a major attraction , pulling in £ 5 million in revenue in a year .
But his days of being picked up and cuddled are long gone .
He is , after all , a wild animal and now not even the keeper who raised him by hand dares to get close .
In a speech at Cooper Union in New York , Senator Barack Obama proposed relief for homeowners and an additional $ 30 billion stimulus package to address the nation ’s economic woes .
Mr. Obama outlined six principles that he said “ should guide the legal reforms needed to establish a 21st century regulatory system . ”
But he cautioned that the “ change we need goes beyond laws and regulation – we need a shift in the cultures of our financial institutions and our regulatory agencies . ”
He also criticized John McCain ’s economic plan as something that “ amounts to little more than watching this crisis happen .
“ While this is consistent with Senator McCain ’s determination to run for George Bush ’s third term , it wo n’t help families who are suffering , and it wo n’t help lift our economy out of recession , ” he said .
Video
Michael Powell and Jeff Zeleny have this report .
Mr. Obama was introduced by New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg , who said that while he was not endorsing the Democratic candidate , he was happy to introduce Obama and “ not just because he picked up the check when we had breakfast together . ”
Here is the full transcript of his speech .
Update | 10:13 a.m. : Tucker Bounds , McCain campaign spokesman issued the following statement on Mr. Obama ’s speech :
“ No amount of rhetoric can hide Senator Obama ’s clear record of embracing the liberal tax and spend , big government policies that hit hardworking American families at a time when they ’re most vulnerable , and are certain to move America backward . ”
Update | 11:55 a.m. : Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is giving her second economic address of the week on Thursday in North Carolina .
She announced a plan to commit $ 2.5 billion a year “ to help workers train for new jobs and improve their skills for their existing jobs as well . ”
She also took a swipe at Mr. McCain ’s proposals .
“ Sometimes the phone rings at 3 a.m. in the White House and it ’s an economic crisis , ” Mrs. Clinton said .
“ And we need a president who is ready and willing to answer that call .
But I read Senator McCain ’s plan which does virtually nothing to ease the credit crisis or the housing crisis .
The phone is ringing and he would just let it ring and ring . ”

Do you sure ?
And just how sure do you ?
Thom P. sure does !
More broken English from G. W. :
Jared 's at a crossroads .
Evan would be happy to provide a driver for his ATM .
If ( as is often the case ) talking about sex makes people more interested in having it , does that mean that the current talk about a recession could actually be creating one ?
Well , maybe .
Or so one general finding of behavioral economics would have us believe .
With all this chatter about a recession , consumers might , for example , hold off on buying that new dishwasher because of the “ bad economy , ” or pass up the more expensive restaurant because “ we ’re in a recession . ”
Without any discussion about recession , we ’re unlikely to change our pattern of behavior .
But talking about it can be a force that affects our decisions and alters our consumption habits .
Let ’s look at the following experiment :
What if I asked you for the last two digits of your Social Security number ( mine are 79 ) , then asked you whether you would pay that number in dollars ( for me this would be $ 79 ) for a particular bottle of 1998 Cotes du Rhone .
Would the mere suggestion of that number influence how much you would be willing to spend on wine ?
Sounds preposterous , does n’t it ?
Well , here ’s what happened to a group of MBA students at MIT a few years ago .
“ Now here we have a nice 1998 Cotes du Rhone Jaboulet Parallel , ” said Drazen Prelec , a professor at MIT ’s Sloan School of Management , as he lifted a bottle admiringly .
Sitting before him were the 55 students from his marketing research class .
On this day , Prelec , Professor George Loewenstein of Carnegie Mellon University and I had an unusual request for this group of future marketing pros .
We asked them to jot down the last two digits of their Social Security numbers and tell us whether they would pay that amount for a number of products , including the wine .
Then we asked them to actually bid on these items in an auction .
What were we trying to prove ?
The existence of what we called arbitrary coherence .
The basic idea of arbitrary coherence is this :
Although initial prices can be “ arbitrary , ” once those prices are established in our minds , they will shape not only present prices but also future ones ( thus making them “ coherent ” ) .
So would thinking about one ’s Social Security number be enough to create an anchor ?
And would that initial anchor have a long - term influence ?
“ For those of you who do n’t know much about wines , ” Prelec continued , “ this bottle received 86 points from Wine Spectator .
He held up another bottle , a Jaboulet Hermitage La Chapelle , 1996 , with a 92 - point rating from the Wine Advocate magazine .
“ The finest La Chapelle since 1990 , ” he intoned .
Prelec held up four other items one by one : a cordless trackball , a cordless keyboard and mouse , a design book , and a one - pound box of Belgian chocolates .
He passed out forms that listed all the items .
“ Now I want you to write the last two digits of your Social Security number at the top of the page , ” he instructed .
“ And then write them again next to each of the items in the form of a price .
In other words , if the last two digits are 23 , write $ 23 . ”
“ Now when you ’re finished with that , ” he added , “ I want you to indicate on your sheets whether you would pay that amount for each of the products . ”
When the students had finished , Prelec asked them to write down the maximum amount they were willing to pay for each of the products ( their bids ) .
Then they passed the sheets up to me , and I announced the winners .
The students enjoyed this exercise , but when I asked them whether they felt that writing down the last two digits of their Social Security numbers had influenced their final bids , they dismissed my suggestion .
No way !
When I got back to my office , I analyzed the data .
Did the digits from the Social Security numbers serve as anchors ?
Remarkably , they did :
The students with the highest - ending Social Security digits bid highest , while those with the lowest - ending numbers bid lowest .
The top 20 percent , for instance , bid an average of $ 56 for the cordless keyboard ; the bottom 20 percent bid an average of $ 16 .
Does that seem rational ?
Of course not .
But when we make one decision , even when it ’s about an arbitrary number , we bring this history into our future decisions , and continue to make the same decisions over and over without going back and questioning their wisdom .
This suggests that if we just ignored the talk about recession , we would repeat our past behaviors and not deviate much from our pre-recession pattern of purchasing decisions .
But when everyone is talking about recession , it ’s likely to make us stop , rethink our past decisions and feel that something needs to change .
On the whole , it might be better if we just talked about sex instead .
Clouds are gathering over Silicon Valley ’s consumer internet companies .
The sale of social networking company Bebo ( our coverage ) comes at a time when private investors are changing their tune .
They ’re no longer pumping money into start - ups at the same huge valuations they were doing last year .
Until January , life was groovy as an internet start - up .
Over the past 18 months , hedge funds and other large investors eagerly swooped in and invest hordes of cash into consumer internet companies that showed growth in users — start - ups like Slide , Ning and Zillow .
Many of these start - ups were making next to no real revenue at all .
But the hedge funds were so flush with cash , they aggressively set the pricing of deals , bidding up the valuations of private companies — expecting revenues would come later .
They effectively shut out venture capitalists from investing .
For example , companies like Slide and Ning drew backers like T Rowe Price and Legg Mason , which injected tens of millions of dollars at valuations in the several hundreds of millions ( our coverage of Slide and coverage of Ning , respectively ) , far outbidding more cost - conscious venture firms .
However , since January , interest from a key group of investors , the hedge funds , has evaporated — almost overnight .
With the economy tottering and the credit crunch hitting home , hedge funds such as Artis ( which set off the hedge fund binge in the first place , when it backed YouTube , showing hedge funds could make money from start - ups ) , Galleon and Integral , have shut their faucets .
These firms have many of their assets in public stocks , and with stocks declining , they ’re reluctant to look at anything that is more than a year way from having a clear shot at going public — meaning few Internet companies in Silicon Valley .
Case in point : Meebo , the site that lets people use a single sign - on to IM across different platforms .
It ’s got user traction , but its no where close to going public , and has minimal revenues .
That company has been on the road trying to raise $ 20 million , we ’ve been told , but it has n’t drawn the inflated valuation offers of yesterday .
( By the way , we reported earlier about the rush by other start - ups to go out and raise cash before things got ugly ; turns out , they were smart . )
Meantime , other large investors , such as T Rowe Price , AllianceBernstein and Legg Mason , which place huge amounts of money ( some of the manage hundred of billions of dollars , if not trillions ) in the initial public offerings , have also tightened their habits .
They have n’t turned away from private companies , but they ’re only backing companies close to going public , two years out or less .
They backed Slide and Ning because those companies are run by seasoned entrepreneurs .
Going forward , with markets the way they are , they wo n’t be backing any more Slides or Nings , as those companies are still very early .
Allen & Co , the New York investment bank , initially acted as a broker for some of these bigger investment companies , hooking them up to Silicon Valley deals , but we ’re being told it is having trouble drumming up interest these days .
That ’s not to say that a company like Meebo is in trouble .
Venture capitalists are still eager to back companies with traction , and some of them learned that downturns are the best time to invest in private companies — precisely because valuations come down , and they know they ’ll get a better return when markets improve .
Meebo raised money last year , and it is still seeing solid growth in its userbase , with some 29 million unique visitors last month across its networks .
It will likely raise cash soon , but it probably wo n’t be at the stratospheric levels of 2007 .
Meebo ’s Seth Sternberg declined to comment on his fund - raising plans .
A new GNOME
The latest release of the GNOME desktop environment includes a number of significant architectural enhancements and new applications that offer increased power and usability .
Released after six months of intensive development , GNOME 2.22 will be included in Ubuntu 8.04 and Fedora 9 , which are scheduled for release in April .
GNOME is an open - source desktop environment that emphasizes freedom , reliability , and ease of use .
It is developed collaboratively by a global community of volunteer contributors and professional programmers who aim to create a cohesive platform for computer interaction and third - party application development .
It is distributed under the GNU 's General Public License and Lesser General Public License which broadly protect users ' rights to modify , adapt , and redistribute software .
This article will examine many of the new features and programs included in GNOME 2.22 and illuminate how the changes and improvements impact the overall user experience .
We will also provide some insight into some of the new architectural features and demonstrate how they can be leveraged by third - party software developers .
We did most of our testing with Foresight 2.0 , which was released two weeks ago shortly after the official release of GNOME 2.22 .
The Foresight Linux distribution is our preferred distro for GNOME reviews because it is very closely aligned with the upstream release and deviates very little from a standard GNOME installation .
We have also tested GNOME 2.22 in prereleases of Fedora 9 and Ubuntu 8.04 .
In this review , we 'll look at some of the new applications included in GNOME 2.22 .
We 'll then touch on some of the new features in the latest release , followed by a look under the hood at some of the architectural improvements .
We 'll conclude with a look ahead at what we can expect in the next version of GNOME .
The Big Word Project is a website created by Paddy Donnelly and Lee Munroe , two Masters students from the University of Ulster , Belfast , Northern Ireland . [ 2 ]
Launched on February 25 , 2008 , the project is aimed at redefining the English dictionary with websites .
Users can buy a word from a list of over 170,000 at $ 1 a letter and that word is then permanently linked to a URL of their choice .
In its first week , the project saw thousands of visitors and added more than 2,000 words , thanks largely to a glowing review by the popular blog Daring Fireball . [ 3 ] [ 4 ]
But growth cooled ; seven weeks after launch , the site stood at 2,345 words .
[ 5 ]
However , an April 21 article in WIRED magazine [ 6 ] renewed interest , and on May 22 , the word count passed 5,000 .
[ 7 ]
As of 29 January 2010 , the count was 7,025 . [ 8 ]
Origin [ edit ]
The collaborative project was set up as part of Paddy and Lee ’s Masters course in Multi-Disciplinary Design and drew upon Paddy ’s viral marketing experience and Lee ’s knowledge of Ruby on Rails applications and web usability .
The creators , who are web designers , created a simplistic web 2.0 - style website with few colours and no advertisements . [ 9 ]
Paddy is currently researching Viral Marketing , looking at how information is spread through word of mouth and the internet and how certain things can become phenomena overnight .
Lee has been freelancing in web design and development for several years and is now concentrating his studies on web usability and web applications . [ 10 ]
The students wanted to create a mass collaboration project where a global movement could be made by combining a small effort from thousands of people and research what words mean to different people .
The project made use of a viral marketing campaign and relied on other people , primarily bloggers , spreading the word throughout the internet .
The project has been featured in newspapers and magazines in Northern Ireland and beyond . [ 11 ]
Website [ edit ]
Once a word is purchased , that word is then ' redefined ' on The Big Word Project , no longer having a traditional meaning but linking to a URL of the owners ’ choice .
The homepage consists of a random selection of 100 bought words and users can click a word to visit the new ‘ definition ’ .
Users can search for a word from the list of 170,000 or view them alphabetically .
Since January 2010 there is a German version online Das grosse Wort Projekt for the German speaking area .
The site contains a blog following the creators ’ studies , press for the project and interesting websites submitted to the project .
The money gained from the site has gone towards paying their student fees .
A former high school basketball star , Mr. Bailey said he had to turn down several college scholarships when he graduated so he could find a job and support his mother , who was ill , along with his younger brother .
Later , he enrolled several times in various college programs , but the demands of being the family ’s primary breadwinner left too few hours for schoolwork .
The biotech training program was to be a way to jump ahead , putting him in position to earn $ 17 to $ 18 an hour , as well as health benefits , as a warehouse or maintenance worker in an industry that offered other chances for advancement .
But despite applying for about 100 jobs over the last six months , he says , he has never been invited to an interview .
Last summer , a month after the course ended , he went to a job center in East Oakland and was surprised to bump into six of his classmates .
“ I was like , ‘ Oh man , you ’re all here too ? ’ ” Mr. Bailey said .
“ We all started looking at anything at that point .
It was kind of depressing . ”
RECENTLY , he began applying for the same types of jobs from which he had hoped to escape .
Now , even those jobs seem beyond reach .
He did take one warehouse job that started at 5 a.m. and required him to walk two miles to and from work , but he quit in disgust after two weeks .
It paid $ 10 an hour  two - thirds of what he used to make as a truck driver .
He applied for a minimum - wage job at Wal - Mart , but after two interviews the person doing the hiring was fired , he said , and Mr. Bailey was told that he had to start all over  this for a night shift at a store in an area plagued by crime .
Disenchanted , he stopped pursuing a career at Wal - Mart .
“ I ’ll just look for anything now ; it does n’t matter , ” he confided on a recent afternoon .
The next day , he accepted a job at a warehouse for $ 9 an hour .
“ It ’s just picking up boxes , ” he says .
“ That ’s all right .
I ’ve got to do something . ”
“ This is like any other cover - up , ” Mr. Remes said .
“ We ’ve only scratched the surface . ”
Plans for the possible prosecution of another prisoner , Ali al - Marri , who has been held since 2003 in a naval brig in Charleston , S.C. , could be in jeopardy after the Pentagon recently revealed that it had destroyed some tapes of Mr. Marri ’s interrogation .
Other tapes showing rough treatment of Mr. Marri , which were discovered in a Pentagon review ordered after the C.I.A. revelations and have been preserved , could prove embarrassing if presented at his trial .
The destruction of tapes has also prompted challenges from lawyers for Zacharias Moussaoui , the convicted Qaeda operative who had unsuccessfully sought testimony at his trial from Abu Zubaydah , one of the two Qaeda suspects whose interrogation videotapes were destroyed in November 2005 .
At that time , a defense motion seeking records of Abu Zubaydah ’s interrogation was pending before a federal court in Virginia .
This motion in the Moussaoui case , among other legal challenges , has raised questions about a statement in December by the C.I.A. director , Gen. Michael V. Hayden , that he understood the tapes were destroyed only after it was determined that they were “ not relevant to any internal , legislative , or judicial inquiries . ”
A C.I.A. spokesman , Paul Gimigliano , said General Hayden “ certainly stands by his statement . ”
He added : “ The C.I.A. has been cooperating with the Department of Justice , the courts and the Congress .
The reviews of this matter are not complete , and it is only fair to let them conclude before trying to draw conclusions from them or about them . ”
Officially , the C.I.A. has said that the tapes were destroyed primarily because of concerns that their public exposure could endanger the safety of C.I.A. officers .
But in interviews in recent months with several officers involved in the decision , they said that a primary factor was the legal risks that officers shown on the tape might face .

Sure , the Times has a reputation for tending to offer jobs to young writers with the right pedigree , but the paper 's NFL writer Karen Crouse proves that a reporting job at the highfalutin ' paper can still be earned the hard way .
Crouse said that , prior to a surprise call from the Times in 2005 , she felt " as if I was flying so far under the radar I was practically invisible .
I 've never been a shouter or a self - promoter , and in a profession rife with both , I thought that being conscientious and doing good work would only get me so far , that to ascend any higher required politicking or some secret handshake or both . "
Crazytalk !
Here 's the list of all but one Crouse 's nine different newspaper gigs over the course of nearly 20 years , cribbed from a very good interview with the writer on the Big Lead :
Through 1988 : " part - time job ... at an afternoon paper in northern California "
1988 : Hired over the phone to a paper in Florida , but job disappears in the two and a half days in which Crouse is driving out from California .
" I 'll never forget the subsequent meeting I had with this editor and his boss , who said it was my problem that I drove all the way to Florida ' in the hopes ' of being offered a job . "
( Count this as one of the nine gigs , though it 's not clear if Crouse included it in her own tally . )
Crouse is unemployed for four months .
The journalism dean at USC gives her career advice : " He told me my ' problem ' was that I had ' wasted ' all my summers in college swimming when I could have been doing internships . "

Officials monitor thousands of letters without warrants John Byrne

The US postal service approves more than 10,000 requests from US law enforcement each year to record names , addresses and other information from the outside of packages , according to information released through a Freedom of Information Act request .
The warrantless surveillance mail program -- as it is known -- requires only the approval of the US Postal Inspection Service Director , and not a judge .
Since 1998 , the inspector has approved more than 97 % of requests during criminal inquiries , new documents show .
According to USA Today , which filed the request , " In 2004 , 2005 and 2006 , the most recent year provided , officials granted at least 99.5 % of requests . "
" The idea of the government tracking that amount of mail is quite alarming , " Director of the American Civil Liberties Union 's national security project Jameel Jaffer told the paper .
" When you realize that ( the figure ) does not include national security matters , the numbers are even more alarming . "
Officials would not disclose how much mail was monitored in national security or " terror " - related investigations .
Under the PATRIOT ACT , those who received letters notifying them that they were being investigated often were gagged from even reporting their being targeted .
Responding to a USA Today request for the national security - related data , " inspection service counsel Anthony Alverno wrote that even revealing the frequency of the surveillance would undermine its effectiveness " to the detriment of the government 's national security interests . "
Signing statement may have allowed mail to be opened
There 's reason to believe more mail may be being opened , as well .
In late 2006 , a signing statement issued by President Bush suggested that his office had expanded executive branch power to open mail without a warrant .
The signing statement accompanied H.R. 6407 , the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 , which reiterated a prohibition on opening first class mail without a warrant .
" In 1996 , the postal regulations were altered to permit the opening of First Class mail without a warrant in narrowly defined cases where the Postal Inspector believes there is a credible threat that the package contains dangerous material like bombs , " the ACLU said in a press release at the time .
" Instead of referencing the narrow exception in the postal regulations , the presidents signing statement suggests that he is assuming broader authority to open mail without a warrant . "
In January 2007 , the ACLU and Center for National Security Studies filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking information regarding any additional warrantless mail surveillance .
男の脳は無数の箱。女性の脳は高速ネットワーク？
Understanding How Different Genders Think | Productivity 501
同じタスクを与えられていても、男性と女性ではアプローチがちがうものです。
たとえば買い物に行ったとしても、「まず何を買うべきか決めよう」という私と、「次の棚に必要なものがないか見に行こう」という家内。あるいは最初から最後まで話を聞いてもらいたい家内に対して、それが面倒くさくて仕方がない私。
男性と女性のアプローチの仕方の違いが分かっていれば、どんな点に注意して相手にあわせればいいのか理解できるので、変な地雷を踏まずに済みそうです。
Productivity501 のクライアントがユーモラスに男性と女性の違いをコメディで紹介し、離婚するカップルを減らそうと取り組んでいる方らしいのですが、男性の脳と女性の脳の働き方の違いを紹介するショーが公開されていて、見ていて笑ってしまいました。
要約は以下の通りですが、ぜひムービーの方も見てあげてください。
男性の脳は、小さな箱がたくさん集まってできているんだ。車について一つ、お金について一つ、仕事について一つ、お母さんについての箱が（地下室のどっかに）一つ。ルールはたった一つ。箱同士は触れてはいけない。男性が話をするときは、一つの箱をとりだし、注意深くふたをあけて中身について話をして、また注意深く他の何にもふれないように元に戻すわけだ。
十字を切って（笑）から女性の脳の話へ。
女性の脳は、ワイヤーで配線されたボールのようなものだ。すべてがつながっている。車はお金に、お金は仕事に、仕事は母さんに。インターネットのよう。そしてこの配線に乗って「感情」が高速にいったりきたりしているんだ。
女性がたいていのことをなんでも覚えているのは、このネットワークがあるからだ。男性にもときどきこういうネットワークが起こるけれども、正直な話、男性にはたいていのことはどうだっていいんだ。逆に、女性はすべてのことが気になって仕方がない。
ところで、女性があまり知らない特別な箱が男性の頭の中にある。それが「何も入ってない箱」だ。この箱は僕らの一番のお気に入り。放っておけば、男はこの箱の中にいつでも戻っていく。この箱を開いている限り、男性は「何も考えていない」状態になれる。実際、男性は何にも考えていない状態でいられるんだ。それが、男性が釣りのようなことでも趣味にできる理由だ。
反面、女性にはこの箱がない。女性の頭は決して止まる事がない。だから**「なんにも考えていない」男を見ることほどイライラすることもない**わけなんだ。

Ancient sea level superimposed on today 's continents
This is what the modern world might look like if it had to contend with the sort of sea levels that existed 80 million years ago , at the time of the dinosaurs .
The dark blue areas show regions of land on today 's continents that would be under water .
Back in the Cretaceous Period , when the climate was very hot , the Earth 's ice sheets had melted and sea levels were 120 m above what they are today .
In new research , Dr Dietmar Muller of the University of Sydney , Australia , and colleagues have reconstructed the vanished ocean basins of that time , and have used their model to assess how they will evolve in the future .
The team looked at data on ocean crust production , ocean sediment build - up and tectonic plate boundaries .
The researchers were able to demonstrate that over the long - term , sea level will fall - despite the current rises being experienced due to global warming .
This is being driven by geological processes that are working to deepen the basins .
The model is described as the first to comprehensively map the planet 's oceans from the Cretaceous Period , when Gondwana - the supercontinent that later broke up into Australia , Antarctica , South America and Africa - was intact .
The Indian and Atlantic oceans were formed in this period .
" To give an idea of the time - scale that our ocean basin model covers , it starts at the time when dinosaurs were at their most diverse , mammals were small and a minor component of animal life on Earth , and flowering plants were just spreading over the Earth , " says Dr Muller .
" If we project our model 80 million years into the future , we can predict that the sea level will continue falling by about 120 m in the long run , through mid-ocean ridge destruction and the continuing ageing and deepening of the ocean basins , " he explains .
The study is published in the journal Science .
According to the Museum : " It was Giger ’s popular art book , Necronomicon , that caught the eye of director Ridley Scott as he was searching for the right look for a creature in his upcoming film .
That creature , of course , turned out to be the Alien , and Giger ’s masterful designs for the film of the same name garnered him a much - deserved Academy Award . "

He 's had many an unkind comment about his looks when set against the radiant beauty of girlfriend Sienna Miller .
But Rhys
Ifans seems likely to have the last laugh because psychologists reckon that happier marriages result from attractive women who wed uglier men .
And women who marry handsome men had better watch out .
Men who saw themselves as better looking than their wives were more likely to be disgruntled and have negative feelings about their marriage , experts found .

Rhys Ifans has it made with beautiful fiancée Sienna Miller
The University of Tennessee study leaves 40 - year - old Ifans set fair if , as expected , he marries 26 - year - old Sienna this year , and it might also explain a few other couples such as Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas and Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller .
The Tennessee team tested 82 newly - wed couples for facial attractiveness and the quality of their marriage .
Their results , in the Journal of Family Psychology , suggested most men who married attractive women were happy to bask in the glory of their partner 's beauty .

Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller had what it takes to be a perfect match according to scientists
But Professor Jim McNulty reported : " Men who were more attractive than their partner demonstrated a tendency to offer less emotional and practical support to their wives . "
He said " evolutionary perspectives " offered an explanation .
" Attractive men have available to them more short - term mating opportunities .
" This may make them less satisfied and less committed to the marital relationship . "
Strathclyde University psychologist Alastair Ross said many men enjoyed the prestige of having a beautiful wife .
" Men are rated as more likeable and friendly when they have a wife who is very attractive , " he added .
Abu - Jamal has been on death row for 25 years A US federal appeals court has overturned the death sentence imposed on former Black Panthers member Mumia Abu - Jamal .
The court said Abu - Jamal 's conviction for murdering a Philadelphia police officer should stand , but that he should have a new sentencing hearing .
The former radio journalist and activist was sentenced to death for the murder in 1982 .
While in jail he became a leading campaigner against the death penalty .
He appealed against the sentence , on the grounds that racism on the part of the judge and the prosecutors had corrupted his conviction , which was by a jury of 10 white and two black people .
Mitigating circumstances
The Third US Circuit Court of Appeals found on Thursday that the jury had been given flawed instructions over how to consider mitigating circumstances to the crime .
" The jury instructions and the verdict form created a reasonable likelihood that the jury believed it was precluded from finding a mitigating circumstance that had not been unanimously agreed upon , " the court wrote .
Abu - Jamal 's lawyer says the case has been marked by racial prejudice The Free Mumia Abu - Jamal Coalition , which has campaigned for a fresh trial , described the ruling as a " devastating decision " , and called for mass protests on Friday .
A federal judge in 2001 also came to the conclusion that Abu - Jamal should be given a new sentencing hearing because of the jury instructions - but this decision was appealed against by prosecutors .
Thursday 's decision upheld the 2001 judgement .
The police officer killed , Daniel Faulkner , pulled over Abu - Jamal 's brother one night in December 1981 for driving the wrong way down a one - way street .
Abu - Jamal denied killing the officer , and says he himself was shot while running away .
The officer 's widow , Maureen Faulkner , recently co-wrote a book about the case , called " Murdered by Mumia : A life sentence of loss , pain and injustice " .

Earlier this week Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made this rather absurd comment in the debate of earmarks :
“ As we look back in history , the Founding Fathers would be cringing to hear people talking about eliminating earmarks , ” Reid said , noting that the Founders dictated in the Constitution that all spending should originate in Congress , not the executive branch .
Senator Tom Coburn has this response today :
Although our Founding Fathers disagreed on many matters large and small , they were united in their skepticism of a secretive , backroom process to allocate taxpayer funding .
George Washington noted in 1792 that no mischief is “ so afflicting and fatal to every honest hope , as the corruption of the legislature . ”
Congressional approval ratings are now at record lows because taxpayers do not believe that we are being honest or open about how we spend their money .
Instead of offering dubious defenses of the propriety of earmarking , congressional leaders should seek to restore the confidence of the American public in their ability to govern by reacquainting themselves with the very document upon which our system is based .
According to the Senate ’s own website , the first bill ever passed by the United States Senate created a simple 14 - word oath of office for all federal lawmakers and civil servants : “ I do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States . ”
Conspicuously absent from that oath is any mention of the so - called duty of members of Congress to send taxpayer - funded projects to their hometowns .
The revisionist history justifying today ’s earmark favor factory is hardly the fault of the Senate Majority Leader or even his party .
Sadly , this idea has currency in the party of limited government in which members should know that the effective legislator is not one who sends money back to his or her state through pork , but the one who prevents money from leaving their state in the first place .
Greenspan : US 'in the throes of a recession '
Reuters
Published : Wednesday April 9 , 2008

This video is from NBC's Today Show , broadcast April 9 , 2008 .
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Tuesday the U.S. economy was in recession , and said it would be appropriate to tap public funds to resolve the mortgage - related crisis that has helped pull the economy under .
In an interview with CNBC television in which he defended his chairmanship of the U.S. central bank against charges that his policy missteps had laid the groundwork for the current crisis , Greenspan said Fed decisions on his watch were rationally constructed based on evidence at the time .
" I have no regrets on any of the Federal Reserve policies that we initiated back then because I think they were very professionally done , " Greenspan said .
It is unfair to hold his Fed to task for the housing bubble or the current crisis in credit markets , because global market forces were at work to keep long - term interest rates low , not just Fed policies that brought short - term U.S. interest rates down to multi- decade lows , he said .
" Clearly , certain of our anticipations of what would happen as a consequence of those policies were off but there 's no way of avoiding that , " he said .
Greenspan went farther than the Fed has by saying outright that the economy is in a recession , although he said it is too soon to say how deep or prolonged the downturn will be .
" Consumers are beginning to shrink in , the automobile markets are beginning to contract , production is beginning to ease , and we are in the throes of recession , " he said .
The U.S. economy will not stabilize until housing markets recover , Greenspan said .
To speed that process , the Bush administration should look to the 1980s savings and loan crisis for lessons on settling the crisis by committing taxpayers ' money to the project .
" I think if you 're going to deal with a situation like this it's an issue for appropriated funds of the Treasury to set up something like the Resolution Trust Corporation , which as you remember was very successful in resolving the S&L crisis , " Greenspan said .
The RTC was set up to liquidate assets of troubled savings and loan associations that had been declared insolvent by the Office of Thrift Supervision .
It operated between 1989 and 1995 and closed or helped resolve hundreds of thrifts , many of which had gotten into trouble through sloppy lending practices .
The Bush administration so far has adamantly refused to commit public money to help settle a housing crisis in which millions of Americans are expected to lose their homes through foreclosure .
Greenspan has in recent days made a series of public statements defending his record at the Fed in light of criticism that a long period of low interest rates and a laissez - faire oversight approach led to reckless market behavior that resulted in the sharp housing correction and the ongoing credit freeze .
The Financial Times this week published an article of his entitled , " The Fed is blameless on the property bubble . "
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal , Greenspan said , " I was praised for things I did n't do .
I am now being blamed for things I did n't do . "
Greenspan 's office did not respond to a request for an interview on Tuesday .
HAMMOND , Indiana ( Reuters ) - Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on Friday vowed to stay in the White House race , rejecting a fellow senator ’s suggestion that she pull out to improve their party ’s chances in November .
“ There are millions of reasons to continue this race , ” New York Sen. Clinton told reporters after Vermont Democratic Sen.
Patrick Leahy , a backer of Clinton rival Barack Obama , said it might be time for her to withdraw .
Many political experts believe Clinton will have a hard time defeating Illinois Sen. Obama for the Democratic nomination to run against Republican Sen. John McCain in November ’s election .
Embarking on a six - day bus tour of Pennsylvania , which holds the next primary on April 22 , Obama said the race for the Democratic nomination was “ a good movie that lasted about a half an hour too long . ”
Clinton pounced on the comment .
“ I like long movies , ” she said .
Polls show Clinton leading by a wide margin in Pennsylvania but Obama picked up a valuable endorsement from popular Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Robert Casey .
The endorsement could help Obama with Catholics and blue - collar white voters who may otherwise be attracted to Clinton .
Casey said the campaign was a chance for change , new politics and healing .
“ I believe in my heart that there is one person who is uniquely qualified to lead us in that direction and that is Barack Obama , ” Casey said in Pittsburgh as Obama stood on stage next to him .

Many Democrats are worried that the increasingly bitter battle between Clinton and Obama can only help McCain who has clinched the Republican nomination .
The Arizona senator on Friday aired the first TV ad for the November election .
Leahy said in a statement McCain was getting a free ride in the news media “ because the Democratic candidates have to focus not on him but on each other . ”
“ Sen . Clinton has every right , but not a very good reason , to remain a candidate for as long as she wants to , ” he said .
Clinton is behind Obama in the race for 2,024 nominating delegates but still thinks she can win and all Democrats should get a chance to vote .
CONTEST IS GOOD
“ A spirited contest is good for the Democratic Party and will strengthen our eventual nominee , ” she said .
Slideshow ( 7 images )
Democratic chairman Howard Dean appeared on morning news shows to warn that the Clinton - Obama battle risked demoralizing Democrats .
He urged them both to tone down personal attacks but did not call on Clinton to withdraw .
Dean said he hoped the battle did not drag into the party ’s nominating convention in late August in Denver , which Clinton has said was possible .
He said he hoped the nomination would be wrapped up by July 1 .
“ The candidates have got to understand that they have an obligation to our country to unify .
Somebody ’s going to lose this race with 49.8 percent of the vote , and that person has got to pull their supporters in behind the nominee , ” Dean told CBS ’ “ Early Show . ”
Obama has a narrow lead in nominating delegates but is hundreds short of the 2,024 needed .
Dean said Democrats need to stay focused on taking the White House from Republicans in November .
“ We do need to keep in mind that personal attacks now often do have the seeds of demoralization later on .
So I want to make sure this campaign stays on the high ground , ” he said .
McCain ’s new ad was entitled “ 624787 , ” which was his Navy serial number .
The video shows him repeating that number to an interviewer as he lay in a prison bed in Vietnam .

What Mr. Bush wants is to be able to listen to your international telephone calls and read your international e-mail whenever he wants , without a court being able to prevent it or judge the legality of his actions .
Mr. Bush said the House bill would “ cause us to lose vital intelligence on terrorist threats . ”
But he has never offered credible evidence of any operation that was hobbled because officials had to request a warrant .
The law already allows the government to eavesdrop first and then seek a warrant .
As for that technology gap , Congress fixed it last year .
The authority has expired , but wiretapping operations started under it can continue .
Finally , Mr. Bush said it was vital to national security to give amnesty to any company that turned over data on Americans without a court order .
The purpose of this amnesty is not to protect national secrets  that could be done during a trial  but to make sure that the full damage to Americans ’ civil liberties is never revealed .
Mr. Bush also objects to a provision that would create a committee to examine his warrantless spying program .
Mr. Bush wanted the House to approve the Senate ’s version of the bill , which includes Mr. Bush ’s amnesty and does not do nearly as good a job of preserving Americans ’ rights .
We were glad the House ignored his bluster .
If the Senate cannot summon the courage and good sense to follow suit , there is no rush to pass a law .
The president will continue to claim the country is in grave danger over this issue , but it is not .
The real danger is for Mr. Bush .
A good law  like the House bill  would allow Americans to finally see the breathtaking extent of his lawless behavior .
“ I used to fill it up pretty regularly , but now I drive it until the tank is almost empty , looking for the cheapest place to buy gas , ” said Ms. Berry , who drives a beat - up Dodge Caravan .
She said that she used to take her four children to the movies four or five times a month .
But with the cost of gas , tickets , popcorn and soda adding up to $ 70 , they now go only once a month .
Still , things are not quite as bad as during the 1970s and 1980s oil shocks .
In the early 1980s , at the height of the last energy crisis , energy accounted for more than 8 percent of household spending .
As prices fell and the economy became less energy intensive , energy costs fell under 4 percent of household spending in the early 1990s .
With the run-up in prices in recent years , economists say energy ’s share of disposable income is slowly creeping up again .
Last December , that figure reached 6.1 percent , the highest level since 1985 .
The increase of two percentage points  amounting to $ 200 billion  is a huge sum , a little less than half what Americans spend each year on new cars and automobile parts .
“ You ’re adding an oil shock on top of a crunch on credit and a housing collapse , ” said Nigel Gault , an economist at Global Insight .
“ Even the U.S. economy cannot withstand all of that at the same time . ”
American consumers have responded belatedly by cutting back on their energy use .
Oil demand in the United States grew by just 0.4 percent in 2007 and is expected to be flat in 2008 .
But global oil demand , the relentless driver behind higher prices , is still expected to increase by 1.4 million barrels a day this year , analysts estimate .
That growth , from China and the Middle East , may help keep prices up , whatever happens to the American economy .
According to the Energy Department ’s latest forecast , gasoline prices should peak near $ 3.40 a gallon this spring .
That figure would match the inflation - adjusted record price for gasoline that was reached in early 1981 .
But many outside analysts consider the government ’s forecast conservative , foreseeing a sharper spike as refiners come out of the seasonal maintenance period and start producing summer - grade gasoline in March and April .
New Zealand digital artist Julian Oliver is working on a cool game that blends the electronic universe with the real world .
His work - in - progress game called levelHead uses a series of cubes placed on a table top .
Digital cameras and custom software sense the movements of the cubes and superimpose digital images of a tiny little 3 - dimensional gameplay universe .
As you tilt each cube , the player climbs through the environment , moving in concert with the angles of the physical cube .
The objective of the game is to move the cubes to help guide the digital player to the exit of each cube ’s virtual environment .
Some of the doorways lead to another cube , while other are dead ends that make you start all over .
The whole interaction looks like a Michel Gondry video to me .
Oliver developed the game to run under Debian or Ubuntu Linux , and plans on releasing it as an open source project soon .

Rios was the youngest member of the Farc 's seven - man secretariat
Defence Minister Juan Manuel Santos said Ivan Rios had been killed by his own men .
Earlier the army had claimed he had died in combat with its troops .
The reported death comes less than a week after another top commander Farc leader , Raul Reyes , was killed by troops in a raid just inside Ecuador .
That killing sparked a diplomatic row , with Ecuador denouncing the incursion .
Ivan Rios - whose real name was Manuel Munoz Ortiz - was the youngest member of the seven - man secretariat of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or Farc .
He is said to have been killed in a mountainous area of the western province of Caldas .
Mr Santos said the Farc 's chief of security gave Colombian troops the leader 's severed hand as proof of his death .
It is unclear why he was killed .
Recriminations
The death came as Latin American leaders exchanged accusations at a regional summit over Saturday 's cross - border raid .
Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa condemned Colombian " aggression " in his opening speech in the Dominican Republic .
His Colombian counterpart , Alvaro Uribe , responded with claims that Mr Correa had links to Farc rebels and had not co-operated in fighting terrorism .
Mr Uribe , who is backed by Washington , has made the military defeat of the Farc a priority .
This loss of senior commanders are the latest in a series of blows for the rebels .
But the BBC's Jeremy McDermott in Colombia says there is a growing call , both internationally and domestically , for negotiations as the only sure way to end the four - decade conflict .
Bush hits lowest approval rating yet in ABC poll
President George W. Bush hit his lowest rating ever in an ABC / Washington Post poll released Tuesday , showing him for the first time below 33 percent approval .
" Just 32 percent of Americans now approve of the way Bush is handling his job , while 66 percent disapprove , " the poll says .
" Bush 's work on the economy has likewise reached a new low .
And he shows no gain on Iraq ; despite reduced violence there , 64 percent say the war was not worth fighting , 2 points from its high . "
The poll further shows that 77 percent of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track , topping a record high in early 1996 , when Republican congressmen shut down the federal government in a dispute with Democrats over funding .
Bush 's approval ratings have been consistent for the past nine ABC / Post polls , staying between 33 and 36 percent in 2007 .
While this new poll is not statistically significant , it represents Bush 's first rating below the one - third mark .
Presidents Carter , Nixon , and Truman each endured a low water mark of approval lower than Bush 's ( at 28 percent , 24 percent , and 22 percent , respectively ) , but the length of Bush 's slide , with three years below majority approval , has him approaching Truman 's record of 38 months underneath the polls .
The depth of public sentiment , as well , weighs very heavily against Bush , with disapproval weighing in over approval at more than a 3 - 1 ratio .
Fifty - one percent of those surveyed strongly disapprove of his presidency , while only 16 percent strongly approve .

Daniel Pipes : Destroying Sculptures of Muhammad
[ Mr. Pipes is the director of the Middle East Forum .
His website address is http://www.danielpipes.org
Click here for his blog . ]
This month , Denmark 's police foiled a terrorist plot to murder Kurt Westergaard , the artist who drew the strongest of the twelve Muhammad images , prompting most of the country 's newspapers to reprint his cartoon as an act of solidarity and a signal to Islamists that their threats and violence will not succeed .
This incident points to the Islamists ' mixed success in curbing Western freedom of speech about Muhammad – think of Salman Rushdie 's Satanic Verses or the Deutsche Oper 's production of Mozart 's Idomeneo .
If threats of violence sometimes do work , they as often provoke , anger , and inspire resistance .
A polite demarche can achieve more .
Illustrating this , note two parallel efforts , dating from 1955 and 1997 , to remove nearly - identical American courthouse sculptures of Muhammad .
In 1997 , the Council on American - Islamic Relations demanded that part of a 1930s frieze in the main chamber of the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington , D.C. be sandblasted into oblivion , on the grounds that Islam prohibits representations of its prophet .
The seven - foot high marble relief by Adolph Weinman depicts Muhammad as one of 18 historic lawgivers .
His left hand holds the Koran in book form ( a jarring historical inaccuracy from the Muslim point of view ) and his right holds a sword .
Chief Justice William Rehnquist , however , rejected CAIR 's pressure campaign , finding that the depiction " was intended only to recognize [ Muhammad ] … as an important figure in the history of law ; it is not intended as a form of idol worship . "
Rehnquist only conceded that court literature should mention that the representation offends Muslim sensibilities .
His decision met with riots and injuries in India .
In contrast , back in 1955 , a campaign to censor a representation of Muhammad in another American court building did succeed .
That would be the New York City - based courthouse of the Appellate Division , First Department of the New York State Supreme Court .
Built in 1902 , it featured on its roof balustrade an eight - foot marble statue of " Mohammed " by Charles Albert Lopez as one of ten historic lawgivers .
This Muhammad statue also held a Koran in his left hand and a scimitar in the right .
Though visible from the street , the identities of the lawgivers high atop the building were difficult to discern .
Only with a general overhaul of the building in February 1953 , including its statues , did the public become aware of their identities .
The Egyptian , Indonesian , and Pakistani ambassadors to the United Nations responded by asking the U.S. Department of State to use its influence to have the Muhammad statue not renovated but removed .
Characteristically , the State Department dispatched two employees to convince New York City 's public works commissioner , Frederick H. Zurmuhlen , to accommodate the ambassadors .
The court , Chief Clerk George T. Campbell , reported , " also got a number of letters from Mohammedans about that time , all asking the court to get rid of the statue . "
All seven appellate justices recommended to Zurmuhlen that he take down the statue .
Even though , as Time magazine put it , " the danger that any large number of New Yorkers would take to worshiping the statue was , admittedly , minimal , " the ambassadors got their way .
Zurmuhlen had the offending statue carted off to a storehouse in Newark , New Jersey .
As Zurmuhlen figured out what to do with it , the Times reported in 1955 , the statue " has lain on its back in a crate for several months . "
Its ultimate disposition is unknown .
Then , rather than replace the empty pedestal on the court building roof , Zurmuhlen had the nine remaining statues shifted around to disguise the empty space , with Zoroaster replacing Muhammad at the westerly corner spot .
Over a half - century later , that is where matters remain .
Recalling these events of 1955 suggests several points .
First , pressure by Muslims on the West to conform to Islamic customs predates the current Islamist era .
Second , even when minimal numbers of Muslims lived in the West , such pressures could succeed .
Finally , contrasting the parallel 1955 and 1997 episodes suggests that the earlier approach of ambassadors making polite representations – not high - handed demands backed up by angry mobs , much less terrorist plots – can be the more effective route .
This conclusion confirms my general argument – and the premise of the Islamist Watch project – that Islamists working quietly within the system achieve more than those relying on ferocity and bellicosity .
Ultimately , soft Islamism presents dangers at least as great as does violent Islamism .

I support a woman 's right to leave Islam without being killed -- How about you ?
Oh wait , we had this discussion , did n't we , and you said my position was " genocide " .
As you must be against genocide , then you must be against a woman 's right to choose her religion ( unless it be Islam ) .
I 'm done with you .
Sally Gee - 3/6/2008
What a perverse little fellow you are , Mr Hamilton .
Can I take it you are a bit flaky on women 's rights , then ?
R.R. Hamilton - 3/6/2008
Considering the source , this is high praise indeed .
Seriously , I took an intelligence test the other day -- one linked from History News Network ( http://www.americancivicliteracy.org/)-- and made a perfect score , but your assessment gives me more satisfaction and confidence that the test result did .
It should make you feel better about my moral compass to know that if I learned that YOU were kidnapped by jihadis and were being raped and scheduled for beheading , I would n't torture anyone to facilitate a rescue .
Oh , and you 'd probably like the Karakawas ; true , they were cannibals , but they did n't eat you all at once .
Sally Gee - 3/6/2008
And yours must have been the 51st , my overly literal , Mr Bolton .

I think you add a special distinction to the term " moral midget " , Mr Hamilton , when you apply your ameoba - like intelligence to any problem .
But , simply as a matter of logic and to take account of the nature of the Gulag , as well as to keep out thinking tidy , should n't we also throw in all employees , shareholders , bondholders and sub- contractors ( incuding public relations consultancies ) of the Correctional Corporation of America and Wackenhut , its nearest contemporary comparators , as well ?
R.R. Hamilton - 3/6/2008
Where I grew up , we had " genocided " ( exterminated ) the Kawakawa Indians .
We were proud to do it .
Further west of us , we genocided the Comanches -- again , we were happy to do it .
So genocide is not a " bad thing " .
It depends on whose being genocided .
I 'm sure the question will be asked of me : " So , you approve of the Nazi extermination of the Jews ? "
Well , no , while I understand the roots of the German antipathy for Jews ( who dominated the Communist movement in Central and Eastern Europe ) , I cannot justify the genocide of the Jews on that basis .
Just as there are " war crimes tribunals " for the Nazis , there should be similar tribunals for Communists .
Guards in the Gulag should be treated no differently than guards at Dachau .
N. Friedman - 3/4/2008 Ms. Gee ,
The problem here is that you act as if you really do not know what genocide is about .
So , when many of us read what you write , we think that you are consciously - since this has been brought to your attention repeatedly - spitting in the face of Armenians , Jews , Gypsies , Sudanese , Rwandans and others who really have experienced genocide .
Which is to say , what you are doing is not only wrong , it is despicable - the work of a Klu Klux Klan allied person of no moral worth .
And , at this point , you are a confirmed liar , having now cited a letter by a number of people you evidently respect who think " shoah " was used to mean " disaster . "
Funny that lying tends to blow up in your face .
Explain this one away , Ms. Gee .
N. Friedman - 3/4/2008 Ms. Gee ,
Gazans cannot go to Israel so long as they are shooting rockets at Israel .
That is the price of Hamas ' war .
It is up to Egypt to decide whether or not to let Gazans into Egypt .
Or , does Israel also rule Egypt ?
Sally Gee - 3/4/2008
You mean there 's no wall around Gaza and the inhabitants are n't all penned in ?
I guess someone somewhere must be making fools of us all , heh ?
Sally Gee - 3/4/2008 Well , Mr Halderman , I get the sense that I 'm a lot brighter and better read than you , so I 'm not in the least embarrassed when I am obviously right in my judgement that the use of the word Sho'ah , in context , meant Holocaust in plain English ( as it were ) .
On the other hand , I do have a responsibility to people as intellectually disadvantaged as you seem to be .
Language gains meaning in use and not by some archaic formula which genocidal Zionist PR apologists come up with when it suits them .
Genocide is threatened ; genocide is taking place ; and the world can watch and do nothing - and betray the trust of those sacrificed in earlier genocides - or it must intervene and stop it .
Clear enough ?
A. M. Eckstein - 3/4/2008
How about facts and logic ?
That would be an improvement over mere self - esteem , ideological certainty , ignorance , and hatred .
Sally Gee - 3/4/2008
And assertive , too !
Whatever next ?
A. M. Eckstein - 3/4/2008
The situation can best be described as one in which , Hamas having fired 800 missiles into Israel since January , all 800 aimed at Israeli civilians , the Israelis are finally retaliating .
N. Friedman - 3/4/2008 Ms. Gee ,
But , what you describe simply is not genocide .
What you describe is called war .
And , I should add , Palestinian Arabs are not , to quote you , " rounded up " in Gaza .
Rather , that is where they live .
Would you prefer they not live there so that they would not be " rounded up " ?
What is actually happening in Gaza is that it is ruled by religious fanatics who , to quote their founding covenant , do not believe in peace conferences or peace negotiations but , instead , believe that only war can solve their problems .
And , as they say in that covenant , the highest duty is to die fighting in that war .
People that take such an attitude can expect others to defend themselves .
That is the custom on Earth , after all .
I should add , the Christians who live in Gaza are being systematically oppressed by the Muslim population .
That is what the Hamas party wants for non-Muslims over whom they may or hope to rule .
Church bells can no longer even be played so as to be heard outside of a church .
Sally Gee - 3/4/2008
So genocide does n't mean genocide unless we use the primitive technology of gassing , Mr Halderman .
Well , the Palestinian's are pretty well rounded up in Gaza and Israel is going for a hi-tech solution with bombs , artillery shell and bullets .
But your 's is a point of view , I suppose .
So that we can meet some middle ground , maybe the only word to describe what is actually happening on the ground is a Holocaust .
Sally Gee - 3/4/2008
Oh , now I see .
You 've got an award for Incoherent Rambling as well .
Sorry not to have mentioned it before .
Craig J. Bolton - 3/4/2008
This must be a new record .
What is that , around 50 posts having exactly nothing to do with the blog entry purportedly being commented upon ?
I guess some people are just so obscessed by their hatred of Israel that they can't think of anything else to talk about .
art eckstein - 3/3/2008
She can't answer you , Mr. Halderman .
art eckstein - 3/3/2008
Incoherent rambling is no substitute for logic and evidence .
N. Friedman - 3/3/2008 Ms. Gee ,
What is it that you want me to look at in the convention ?
What nonsense argument are you planning to make ?
I have a suggestion : show me an expert legal opinion that supports your position - whatever it may be .
Then I can consider it .
A legal opinion coming from you , who knows exactly zero about law or , so far as I can tell , anything else , is meaningless garbage from an idiot .
Sally Gee - 3/3/2008
Do n't tell me that you 've also been multi-awarded for the impoverishment of your logic and the weakness of your evidence , and for your outstanding record for deploying personal insult ineffectively .
No wonder Mr Friedman thinks you 've got that star quality he so obviously yearns for !
A. M. Eckstein - 3/3/2008 Personal insults are no substitute for logic and evidence .
A. M. Eckstein - 3/3/2008
" I can just imagine the jolly , if brutalizing , conversations he must have had in his day job as deputy defence minister planning genocide . "
It 's hard to imagine anything more vile than this , especially on the basis of a mistranslation .
I 'm sure , however , that Gee has lower to go .
I challenge Gee to provide specific examples of the intentional Israeli murder of civilians in Gaza as a matter of state policy .
EVIDENCE ( other than intentional mistranslations ) .
As for Hamas or Fateh , I can cite their * intentional * murder of ( literally ) a thousand Israeli civilians since 2001 .
That is EVIDENCE .
Sally Gee - 3/3/2008
Once a pantaloon , always a pantaloon , heh , Mr Eckstein ?
And why not , I ask ?
You do it so well and there must be a demand for it somewhere , and do n't worry abut the embarrassment you cause the more sensitve of us who have to repeatedly observe your petulant displays .
Sally Gee - 3/3/2008
It makes the intention plain , Mr Friedman , it make the intention plain and after the past couple of days , it 's not going away .
I can just imagine the jolly , if brutalizing , conversations he must have had in his day job as deputy defence minister planning genocide and it probably seemed quite natural to him to share the prospect of the Palestinian Sho'ah with the rest of the world .
Many politicians have made the mistake of publicly telling the truth too early before , and many will no doubt do it in future .
I do n't think he'd get away on your argument about a linguistic confusion in a jury trial even in Israel , though , let alone the ICC .
Sally Gee -
3/3/2008 Mr Friedman , why not take the trouble to remind yourself of the precise terms of Article 2 of the Genocide Convention 1948 ?
N. Friedman - 3/3/2008
And again , Ms. Gee , you are falsely asserting what the speaker said .
N. Friedman - 3/3/2008 Ms. Gee ,
Even assuming - just to make you happy ( but , so that it is clearly , without agreeing with you ) - that the Israeli in question said what you falsely claim , that does not make the operation into genocide .
It , instead , makes the speaker wrong .
A. M. Eckstein - 3/3/2008
That 's not what Vilnai said .
N.F. and I have proven that , to the satisfaction of people who have never previously posted on this topic .
Der Spiegel translated Vilnai correctly , but Gee insists on her mistranslation because the translation suits her ideology even if it is untrue .
Gee never gives up her insanity , her ignorance , or her malevolence .
A. M. Eckstein - 3/3/2008
The Economist is not saying what Gee wants to believe it is saying .
But then , careful reading is not her strong suit .
Keith Halderman - 3/3/2008 Ms
Gee
Genocide is not tricky at all in order for the term to contain any truth at all there has to be mass killing of people based on religion , ethnicity , or race with the intent to eliminate all of the said group .
In your own post you use the words " a few Palestinians . "
Keith Halderman - 3/3/2008
If the Israelis were systematically exterminating the people living in Gaza by rounding them up putting them in concentration camps and gassing them to death then I would call genocide but that is not what is happening .
It is your careless and inflammatory use of the term that devalues the experience .
Sally Gee -
3/3/2008 Mr Multi-Awarded Eckstein , your problems seem to be deeper and more intransigent than I first imagined .
As The Economist says , Vilani warned " ... Palestinians publicly that they were bringing a shoah on themselves , a biblical Hebrew word that means “ catastrophe ” but these days almost invariably refers to the Nazi Holocaust " .
Why would The Economist seek to mislead us about the contemporary common usage of " a biblical Hebrew word " ?
What 's in it for them ?
Sally Gee - 3/3/2008
But having the deputy defense minister say that 's the intention does give it a pretty strong gloss would n't you say , Mr Friedman ?
N. Friedman - 3/3/2008 Ms. Gee ,
Again , a military campaign , even a very violent one , does not make that campaign into genocide , no matter how many times you yoke together words expressing your " thoughts . "
A. M. Eckstein - 3/3/2008
The Economist does not say that Vilnai threatened to create The Shoah , or to bring a genocide ; he just meant the Palestinians would bring a catastrophe ( " shoah " in that sense ) on themselves if they kept shooting hundreds of rockets a month at Israeli civilians .
Vilnai may have to resign , but if he does , it will not be because he was threatening genocide ; rather , the case is somewhat parallel to what happened in Washington DC a few years ago : a City official described the City budget as " niggardly " .
There was a huge uproar , and though this word has absolutely no relationship to the N - word , absolutely none , that City official was indeed forced to resign .
Such a capitulation to Gee - like ignorance was a day of shame for DC .
Sally Gee - 3/3/2008
Do you determine genocide by who it may be possible for you to blame , Mr Halderman ?
Is n't that the ultimate way of devaluing the experience of those who have lived through the event ?
Sally Gee -
3/3/2008
Oh , so sorry .
How right you are , Mr Halderman .
Killing a few Palestinians does n't really count as anything very much does it ?
Certainly not genocide .
Why , that might imply they are people after all and they might have human rights .
But then , what can we be expected to make of it all when The Economist reports , " It did not help that Israel ’s deputy defence minister , Matan Vilnai , was stupid enough to warn Palestinians publicly that they were bringing a shoah on themselves , a biblical Hebrew word that means “ catastrophe ” but these days almost invariably refers to the Nazi Holocaust .
Mr Vilnai should , surely , now be sacked " .
http://www.economist.com/world/africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10792645
Very tricky stuff this genocide business , heh , Mr Halderman ?
Keith Halderman - 3/3/2008
I think you are being unfair to Friedman , Eckstein and even Baker to place them on the same level as Gee .
To call what is going on in Gaza genocide is to devalue the experience of those who have lived though one .
Also , her linguistic argument displays stubborn stupidity and nothing else .
Keith Halderman - 3/3/2008
Ignorant people have taken to throwing around the word genocide so cavalierly that it really has lost all meaning .
But let us accept your definition , Ms Gee , for the purpose of a question .
Do you assign equal blame to Egypt ?
After all , the suffering of the people of Gaza could easily be alleviated if the border with Egypt were open .
Also , when the border was breached by the Gazans themselves did food , medicine and other essentials cross , no longer range rockets did .
Keith Halderman - 3/3/2008 Ms
Gee
After reading your posts in this second string it has become even clearer to me that you have way too much self esteem .
Keith Halderman - 3/3/2008 Ms. Gee
I was planning on putting up a link to the article but I believe I will do you a favor and not broadcast your astounding display of ignorance any further .
They speak Hebrew , you do not , so where do you get off lecturing them on the meaning of a word spoken in that language .
Secondly , if the Israelis were inclined towards a genocide ( which by the way is a very much over used word these days ) do you not think would have happened already , there has certainly been enough provocation .
I suspect you would not have nearly as much of a problem with genocide if it were the Jews who were ONCE AGAIN on the receiving end of it .
You realy should be embarrassed by the lame arguments you have made in this string .
R.R. Hamilton - 3/3/2008
Watching the four of you fight is like watching Hamas , CAIR , the IDF , and AIPAC all together .
The only way to determine the dumbest here is to see who posts last .
That may sound unfair .
Maybe it 's just my personal view , but I ( nearly ) always let an idiot 's response to my posts go unanswered .
An intelligent response deserves a reply , does it not ?
N. Friedman - 3/2/2008 Ms. Gee ,
Genocide and HaShoah are two different words with two different meanings .
And , to a Hebrew speaking Israeli , HaShoah and Shoah have two different meanings and , in either event , neither word means genocide .
art eckstein - 3/2/2008
Gee continues , intentionally now , to fail to distinguish in Hebrew , a language she does n't speak but which was what Vilnai was speaking , between HaShoah ( the Holocaust ) and shoah ( a disaster in general ) .
Der Spiegel ( a journal that does not love Israel ) did NOT make this mistake when translating Vilnai into German .
We are talking about something that was said in Hebrew that was mistranslated into English , but was NOT mistranslated into German ( for instance ) in Der Spiegel , but which Gee insists on mistranslating for reasons of her own vicious hatred - ideology , even when faced with rational and evidentiary arguments .
Sally Gee -
3/2/2008
" No one said anything that could be translated as " genocide . "
When Ms. Gee says that , she is simply lying . "
But is n't the word Sho 'ah used day to day to describe genocide or not ?
And if you deny Sho'ah are you not denying the Holocaust ?
And if the deputy defense minister of Israeli threatens Sho'ah on another people is he not threatening genocide ?
And have Israel 's actions in Gaza during the course of today demonstrated the truth of those genocidal threats quite precisely ?
art eckstein - 3/2/2008 Again , General Vilnai said nothing about genocide , a fact which Ms. Gee -- in her indomitable refusal to listen to facts -- refuses to accept .
Vilnai said nothing about planning genocide .
Nothing .
We are talking about something that was said in Hebrew that was MISTRANSLATED into English , but was NOT mistranslated into German ( for instance ) in Der Spiegel ( not a journal that loves Israel ) , but which Gee INSISTS on mistranslating for reasons of her own vicious hatred - ideology , even when faced with rational and evidentiary arguments .
Case closed .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008 Mr Friedman , when you say " contrary to fact " do you mean a " lie " ?
If so , do you mean a deliberate lie or , you distinguish between intentional lies , you know , the sort of display we 've seen put on by you and Mr Multi - Award Eckstein about the form the relationship takes between the Sho'ah , the Holocaust and the well planned genocide campaign in Gaza , and unintentional or inadvertent lies arising out of and honest misunderstanding or lack of simple ignorance or an inability to understand the question that is being asked ?
It may just be a self indulgent impulse on my part , but I really would like to understand both your mind - sets and how your thought processes operate to help me get to know just what to look for in those men I will be well advised to avoid coming into contact with in future .
N. Friedman - 3/2/2008 Ms. Gee ,
Not to understand that words have different meanings in different language is , frankly , to be a brute .
N. Friedman - 3/2/2008 Ms. Gee ,
Again , what you write is not only contrary to fact but it is a lie .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008 Mr Freidman , far too complicated a plot even for the late Mr Alfred Hitchcock .
Sho 'ah is as Sho'ah does , and what it does do when General Vilnai , the Israeli Deputy Minister of Defense uses the term is make it absolutley clear that Israelis are planning genocide in Gaza , no more , and no less .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008
Sorry you find me hateful , Mr Friedman , but no , to deny what has been said and to deny what we are seeing reported by the BBC from Gaza is to trivialise the sacrifice may by so many innocents at the hands of the Third Reich .
And to deny the horrors Gaza has experienced , continues to experience , and those which will soon follow if we are to believe the Israeli Deputy Minister of Defence warning of the Palestinian Sho'ah spits in face of all those , that long ist of the dead , subjected by organised military forces to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity .
Smoke and mirrors , Mr Friedman , but the Gaza genocide has begun and the question is , will the world let it continue as long as it did the fate of the Jews under the Third Reich without bringing Israel 's racist fantasists to heel , with whatever weapons it might take and whatever it may cost , including nuclear bombs .
And when the law finally reasserts itself , it will be my duty to stand witness for the people of Gaza against chicken hearted apologists like you when you are indicted for aiding and abetting crimes against humanity .
art eckstein - 3/2/2008
We are talking about something that was said in Hebrew that was mistranslated into English , but was NOT mistranslated into German ( for instance ) in Der Spiegel , but which Gee insists on mistranslating for her own vicious hatred - ideology reasons even when faced with rational and evidentiary arguments
art eckstein - 3/2/2008 Yes , N.F. : as with Omar , we are dealing with an anti-Israel propagandist who is so ignorant and ridiculous that it is a reasonable hypothesis that the person is actually an Israeli agent .
N. Friedman - 3/2/2008 Art ,
Ms . Gee must be in Israel 's straw man brigade .
art eckstein - 3/2/2008 N.F. is not denying the Holocaust !
He 's denying that Mr. Valpai was threatening to recreate it -- the latter is a fabrication , and the difference is obvious to anyone who can read .
We are talking about something that was said in Hebrew that was mistranslated into English , but was NOT mistranslated into German ( for instance ) in Der Spiegel , but which Gee insists on mistranslating for her own vicious hatred - ideology reasons even when faced with rational and evidentiary arguments
Gee is becoming ever more irresponsible and out of control .
I 'd say with her later ridiculous accusation she was undermining her credibility , except that would imply she had some .
N. Friedman - 3/2/2008 Ms. Gee ,
I gather that you have never heard of the term " borrow word . "
In English , " Shoah " is a borrow word , meaning that it is derived from another language , not that it is identical to a seemingly identical word in another language .
In fact , when an Englishing speaking person of Jewish - American background uses the word " Shoah " in English while in the US , that speaker likely does mean the horrible events that affected Jews during WWII .
However , to a Hebrew speaking Israeli speaking in Hebrew in Israel to Israelis , the word " shoah " can have many meanings while " HaShoah " likely refers to the events that affected Jews during WWII .
Incidentally , are you on the payroll of Israel ?
You must be part of Israel 's straw man brigade .
You are , by far , the best propagandist for Israel I have ever seen .
art eckstein - 3/2/2008 Right .
Yes , not for the first time ( or even the first time on this thread ) , we 've caught Gee in an outright lie .
As you say , she knows what she 's doing , she 's just not very good at it .
Or rather , to her dismay , she 's met two people who know what they are talking about and can take her to the woodshed every time .
No wonder she 's furious .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008 Mr Friedman , are you also a Holocaust denier now ?
This is just too , too Alice in Wonderland for words .
My mind boggleth over , as they say in Britspeak .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008 Mr
Friedman , keep this up and you 'll have me to pity you as much as you do yourself .
But , on the bright side , you 'll probably just continue to make me squirm with embarrassment for you .
If the same word is not the same word , when might a different word mean the same as the same word ?
Is this some sort of elaborate Wittgensteinian logic game you are playing ?
Or are you just confused because you are aware of the crushing sense of emptiness at the very center of your being ?
Why not seek out a trained counsellor ?
I 'm sure there are lots and lots who can throw in Hebrew as a second language and you can tease out all the different meanings of the same word together .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008 Sometimes
I think you two only exist keep each other company while you whimper in self pity .
Losers .
N. Friedman - 3/2/2008 Professor ,
You need to go one step further .
No one said anything that could be translated as " genocide . "
When Ms. Gee says that , she is simply lying .
art eckstein - 3/2/2008
Gee persists in her craziness : " So why did the Israeli Defense Minister , Mr. Matan Vilnai , say it is ? "
He did n't .
This fact has now been pointed out to Gee repeatedly .
We are talking about something that was said in Hebrew that was mistranslated into English , but was NOT mistranslated into German ( for instance ) in Der Spiegel , but which Gee insists on mistranslating for her own vicious hatred - ideology reasons even when faced with rational and evidentiary arguments
art eckstein - 3/2/2008

N. Friedman - 3/2/2008 Ms. Gee ,
Actually no .
The word is not the same in both languages .
" Shoah " is a borrow word in English , meaning that it is based on a word in a foreign language , not that it is the same word .
In Hebrew as used in Israel , " shoah " has a number of meanings .
However , normally the Hebrew word used in Israel to express the events during WWII that affected Jews is " HaShoah , " not " shoah . "
So , that fact suggests that what appeared in The Guardian is erroneous .
i>
The Guardian 's translation does not suggest itself either from the word " shoah " or by the sentence in which it appeared or even in the entire statement made .
N. Friedman - 3/2/2008 Professor ,
You are being too kind to her .
I think she knows exactly what she is doing .
She is just not that great at it .
art eckstein - 3/2/2008

art eckstein - 3/2/2008
I notice too that when Gee is caught and confronted with having committed outright mistakes -- such as her false accusation that we did n't answer the issue of " soft Islamism " -- instead of apologizing for the gross error and perhaps learning to be more careful , she just responds with even more of her vicious personal vituperation .
A pitiable performance .
N. Friedman - 3/2/2008 Ms. Gee ,
Again , Ms. Gee. Mr Vilnai never said anything about genocide .
That , frankly , is a lie .
And , I can assure you , nothing is being done in your name .
N. Friedman - 3/2/2008 Ms. Gee ,
Genocide has nothing to do with Gaza .
It does , however , have something to do with Darfur , where hundreds of thousands of people have died and are continuing to die .
Is it now your intention , Ms. Gee , to interpret the word " genocide " so that its meaning is trivialized ?
Or , are you just a brute , who wants to yoke together words without the slightest care of what they mean ?
There is no genocide in Gaza .
And , to suggest so is to spit at Armenians , Jews , Sudanese Christians , Congolese and others who really have been subject to genocide .
That is pretty hateful of you .
N. Friedman - 3/2/2008 Ms. Gee ,
That 's ok .
I am sure he hopes you stay in Europe .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008
So why did the Israeli Deputy Defense Minister , Mr Matan Vilnai , say that it is ?
Oh , and the Sudanese are not killing in my name so far as I am aware .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008
I 'm just hoping he avoids the whole of Europe while I 'm here .
art eckstein - 3/2/2008
Israel is not plotting nor carrying out genocide in Gaza .
Gee is not concerned with genocide in any case .
If she were , she would be focused on Darfur .
She 's just a crude propagandist .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008
What has the tragedy in Darfur got to do with the Israeli genocide in Gaza , Mr Eckstein , other than emphasise the fact that the pitiless consequences of half - assed imperial adventures may take decades , even centuries , to unfold ?
N. Friedman - 3/2/2008 Ms. Gee ,
Perhaps it is your allergy to the Professor , a man who , according to you , would be a reason for you to take a different taxicab if you learned that he was ever in that taxicab .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008
Now you 're catching on , Mr Friedman .
There my be hope for you yet .
The word is the same in both languages ; the meaning is the same ; only the frame of reference , or as you term it , the Galaxies differ .
So genocide it is , then .
Perhaps the multi-awarded Mr Eckstein may profit from your example .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008
You mean to tell me that it is all just an elaborate illusion , Mr Eckstein , and Israel is at peace with its neighbours and its Defense Ministry is not plotting and implementing genocide in Gaza ?
Maybe not so ridiculous after all , heh ?
N. Friedman - 3/2/2008 Ms. Gee ,
We cannot talk about the same thing being said in two different languages .
We can talk about similar thoughts being expressed but , quite obviously , each language is its own little Galaxy .
N. Friedman - 3/2/2008 Ms. Gee ,
I have to say that your comment above has to be the least thoughtful thing you have written thus far .
On your book , all languages work the same .
And , in your book , they work the same even in different countries .
That is a nutso theory .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008
Well , if we 're being very Freudian , I may well not understand what I myself are saying , but I do understand what Israel 's Deputy Defense Minister said all too well , oh Man Of Many Awards But So Little Insight Into Anything .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008
Maybe it 's something to do with the way you write Mr Multi - Awarded Eckstein .
art eckstein - 3/2/2008
The NY Times has a frontpage story today about the horrors being inflicted on the innocent people of Darfur by the Islamofascist government in Khartoum -- actions which * dwarf * anything Israel is doing in response to thousands of rockets shot from Gaza aimed at Israeli civilians .
Oh well , maybe the NY Times story is just another one of Gee 's Jewish conspiracies .
art eckstein - 3/2/2008 Exactly : " THE Shoah " -- HaShoah .
Not " shoah " in general .
You do n't understand what you yourself are saying .
We are talking about something that was said in Hebrew that was mistranslated into English , but was not mistranslated into German ( for instance ) in Der Spiegel , but which Gee insists on mistranslating for her own vicious hatred - ideology reasons even when faced with rational and evidentiary arguments
art eckstein - 3/2/2008
I have no idea what Gee is talking about .
She should concentrate her attention on the horrors visited upon the Sudan by her hero the Mahdi , and the horrors visited upon Darfur by the current Sudanese Islamofascist government : 400,000 civilian dead in three years according to the UN .
Or else she should stop her masquerade posing as a general humanitarian , and accept her role as hate - the - Jews girl .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008
They are arguments which have only been deployed by the US - Israel lobby since it dawned on you that only in Israel is the prospect ( and , sadly , according to footage on the BBC , today 's reality ) of committing genocide in Gaza taken so lightly .
What is known in Britspeak as a bit of a faux , y'know , Mr Multi - Awarded Eckstein .
As a result of this exchange , I have been told that my father 's grandfather always referred to the Sho'ah and he lived it and he knew precisely what to call it .
art eckstein - 3/2/2008 1 . Gee wanted a discussion of soft Islamism , from both me and N.F .
Now she objects that the discussion which was on the thread above , and which she failed , to read is too long .
She continues to make herself look ridiculous .
Omar can't read , either .
The distinction is drawn VERY sharply by me , and still distinctly but less sharply by N.F. , between Islam in general and the Islamofascist movement of which Omar is
unfortunately a good example .
It is OMAR , not N.F. or myself , who insists on equating Islamicist jihadism ( Islamofascism ) with Islam in general .
That equation by Omar is a disservice to Islam , and especially to those progressive Muslims who are working hard for reform -- just as other progressives work hard for reform in other religions .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008
Sounds like a cross between Bush 's America and Gaza under the Israeli cosh , Mr Eckstein .
Thanks for reminding me once again why I chose to study abroad in a country where the notion of academic responsibility is taken seriously .
omar ibrahim baker - 3/2/2008 Prof
All that boils down to is that your real enemy is Islam ; exactly my point !
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008
All very relevant I 'm sure .
But to what purpose , I ask myself ?
Perhaps Mr Eckstein will come to regard this verbose post as the epitome of his mighty contribution to the sum total of human ignorance in the years to come .
Maybe we should nominate him for the Bernard Lewis Award for Partial Understanding and Misleading Distortions , 2008 , to show him our appreciation .
art eckstein - 3/2/2008
That 's just totally ridiculous .
art eckstein - 3/2/2008 Both Omar and Gee are factually wrong again .
Neither one of them evidently have not read this exchange on the thread above , from yesterday .
What ?
Omar and Gee factually WRONG ?
What a surprise !
1. Re : an extraordinarily mild and well reasoned post ( # 119787 )
by N. Friedman on March 1 , 2008 at 2:44 PM
Ms. Gee ,
Where have I tried here to create any confusion here ?
That is in your head .
What I said is that Omar can answer to his comment that equates Islamism and Islam .
I would be interested in his views since he , unlike me , is Muslim .
And , as I have said before , Omar is familiar with his religion and is capable of explaining himself .
If you want my view , Islam and Islamism are not two wholly different things .
They are related and interwoven .
As I understand it , Islamism is a word used for the revival movement among Muslims and an Islamist is one who is part of that revival movement .
Islamists tend , to varying degrees , to emphasize politics that will advance the religio- political aims of Islam that most Muslims understand Islam to have .
2. Re : an extraordinarily mild and well reasoned post ( # 119789 )
by art eckstein on March 1 , 2008 at 2:50 PM
N.F. and I have had this debate before .
He sees Islamism as more integral and natural to Islam than I do .
As here :
" Reply to N.F. ( #105216 )
by art eckstein on February 9 , 2007 at 8:19 AM
N.F. , I find myself in the odd position of having to defend Islam .
Given my frequent clashes with that ignorant , paranoid , dishonest and self - deceptive fool Omar , this is not pleasant for me to do .
But I do think that Islam as a religion is not static but is both hugely complex AND existing in a historicized context .
Hence trends within it are capable of development in any number of directions , some of which are good .
Even Ibn Warraq ( no friend of Islam , as you know ) acknowledges that many passages in the Koran are simply ignored by many Muslims , including the most offensive and aggressive passages : he cites the example of doctors in Pakistan who refused to amputate the limbs of thieves .
But this act by the doctors in itself changes " really - existing Islam . "
Even more pertinent , some Muslims , including prominent ones , interpret Sura 9.5 to mean that Muslims have the right to abrogate at will any peace treaty made with non-Muslims , whereas others say that 9.5 deals with a very specific case , and point to verse 48.26 which says one must keep the terms of treaties with those who have kept their terms with you .
The Koran is a complex and often self - contradictory text , and some verses will be more influential than others of a contrary trend , depending on the historical context and the influence of certain thinkers .
Of course , we should not be worried about those Muslims who go with 48:26 but about those who DO believe in the above interpretation of Sura 9:5 .
And if they are the vast majority of Muslims now , we should be very worried indeed , because it means effective diplomacy between such Muslims and non-Muslims is impossible because such Muslims are totally untrustworthy .
But even if this latter bad situatiion were the case , that does not mean that such a situation is " the real and only Islam , " past , present , future , forever .
Historical change over time is the primary perception and focus of historians .
( Of course , the changes need NOT be in what we would call a positive direction !
That 's what I 've said is the difference between trends in 19th c Islam , as far as I understand them , and trends today . )
The jihadists have a strong , indeed , unanswerable case for being AN authentic and indeed ONE major Muslim tradition .
And as you say , N.F. , you and I are in strong agreement on the nature of the current crisis , and on much else , including how to help Muslim " moderates " by treating the jihadists as the barbarians they are , and treating ignorant fools and liars such as Omar as one should treat such people ; and we 're in agreement on much else too .
I am not optimistic nor naive about Islam .
But I do not see a picture of total bleakness either .
The current situation is a historical situation caused by specific historical forces , and we are in agreement again that mostly those destructive forces come from within Islam itself .
Where we differ is in our understanding of whether those terribly destructive and aggressive forces MUST go unanswered in Islam on THEOLOGICAL grounds . "
The only " hate - head " around here is Gee the Jew - hater .

The previous post does not mean that I disrespect N.F. 's position , let alone N.F. , a person I respect highly .
We just disagree somewhat on the issue of how integral political Islamism has to be to Islam in general .
N.F. sees it as more integral than I do , and I admit he has a case ; but I side somewhat more with Pipes on this .

4. Re : an extraordinarily mild and well reasoned post ( #119792 )

Professor ,
We certainly have discussed the subject before .
Please note that I do not claim that Islamists have made no innovations .
Rather , my position is that the principle , albeit not the only , source of Islamism is Islam .
The innovations including , for example , those which derive from Nazism .
Innovations include , for example , recasting certain Hadith as referring to a current political program rather than , for example , to describe events associated with the return of the Mahdi .
[ See the Hamas Covenant for a good example , where this Hadith - " The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews ( killing the Jews ) , when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees .
The stones and trees will say O Moslems , O Abdulla , there is a Jew behind me , come and kill him .
Only the Gharkad tree , ( evidently a certain kind of tree ) would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews . " ( related by al - Bukhari and Moslem ) . ]
On the other hand , the millennial goal of bringing the entire world under Islamic rule is not remotely an innovation .
It is the dominant view during most of the history of Islam .
Such was described by Muslim writers at great length .
As explained around 1906 or 1907 , by the greatest non-Muslim Islamicist of all time , Ignaz Goldhizer ( d. 1921 ) :
In addition to the religious duties imposed upon each individual professing Islam , the collective duty of the " jihad " (= " fighting against infidels " ) is imposed on the community , as represented by the commander of the faithful .
Mohammed claimed for his religion that it was to be the common property of all mankind , just as he himself , who at first appeared as a prophet of the Arabs , ended by proclaiming himself the prophet of a universal religion , the messenger of God to all humanity , or , as tradition has it , " ila al - a ? mar wal - aswad " ( to the red and the black ) .
For this reason unbelief must be fought with the force of weapons , in order that " God 's word may be raised to the highest place . "
Through the refusal to accept Islam , idolaters have forfeited their lives .
Those " who possess Scriptures " ( " ahl al - kitab " ) , in which category are included Jews , Christians , Magians , and Sabians , may be tolerated on their paying tribute ( " jizyah " ) and recognizing the political supremacy of Islam ( sura ix . 29 ) .
The state law of Islam has accordingly divided the world into two categories : the territory of Islam ( " dar al - Islam " ) and the territory of war .
( " dar al - ? arb " ) , i.e. , territory against which it is the duty of the commander of the faithful ( " amir al - mu' minin " ) to lead the community in the jihad .
As further explained by scholar M.J. Akbar , a Muslim of India background , in his excellent introductory book , Shade of Swords ( pp 's xv - xvi ) :
...
There are Muslims today , for instance , who will convert jihad into a holy bath rather than a holy war , as if it is nothing more than an injunction to cleanse yourself within .
It is true that the Prophet insisted that a greater jihad was the struggle to cleanse impurity within , but that does not take away from the fact that the lesser jihad inspired the spirit that once made Muslim armies all - conquering , enabled Muslims to protect their holy places , and ensured that most of the community lived with the protection of Muslim power despite formidable challenge from Christian alliances in a world war that was virtually coterminous with the birth of Islam .
So often did Muslim armies , whether in the west or the east , triumph against odds that it conjured up a sense of a self - replicating miracle .
Faith in Allah 's bargain was reinforced by each victory , particularly against Christian armies who mobilized repeatedly not only to destroy Muslim empires but also Islam , which they called a heresy against Christ .
Jihad is the signature tune of Islamic history .
If today 's Muslim rulers are reluctant to sound that note , it is often because they are concerned about the consequences of failure .
As in every bargain , there are two sides .
Allah promised victory to the Muslim , but only if the believer kept faith with him .
Defeat becomes an indictment of the ruler , and is therefore risky , particularly as Muslims have a long tradition of holding their rulers accountable .
They are enjoined to do so .
( Emphasis added ) .
Jihad , I should add , is mentioned on a number of occasions in the Koran in the context of making war .
That is not just my view .
It is the view of every major Muslim scholar I know of .
But , I do not see that it matters .
To nearly ALL of the Muslim theologians from the early times , the calls to make war to expand the realm of Islamic rule were typically taken as calls for Jihad .
A rather good examination of Jihad in Islam is set forth in David Cook 's rather brilliant book , Understanding Jihad .
The first chapter of the book can be found online here .
My only criticism of this book , which focuses at length on Jihad in the context of the ascetic idea , is its focus on the Hadith which reads , " there is no asceticism in Islam ; the asceticism in Islam is the holy war . "
While Cook may be correct this Hadith played a substantial role in how Jihad fighters saw themselves through the ages , the origin of the Hadith involved objection to ascetic movements such as the Sufi .
Be that as it may , I would highly recommend Cook 's book because it is written by a first rate scholar and historian and , so far as I am concerned , settles this question definitively .
While traditional doctrine held that Jihad was , other than for defense , a doctrine of state , there has always been dissent on this point , with many Muslims through the ages viewing Jihad as an individual endeavor .
In Patricia Crone 's brilliant book , God 's Rule - Government and Islam : Six Centuries of Medieval Islamic Political
Thought , she shows rather clearly that terrorism - i.e. NGO or private Jihad - was a problem from the very beginning and remained a problem throughout the period covered by her book - six hundred years !!!
She chronicles the difficulties that such terrorists caused rulers since the Jihadis did not always act in accordance with state policy and sometimes frustrated it .
In any event , these Jihadis would live on the outskirts of the Muslim regions and raid into non-Muslim territory , spreading terror and death as they raided .
The cult of the Assassins , chronicled rather well in Bernard Lewis ' book on the subject , discusses sleeper cells in countries which , on signal from the old man of the mountain , would assassinate political leaders and , in the process , kill themselves .
I realize they were neither Sunni or Shi'a but they are still within the Muslim tradition , with branches both in what would be today 's Iran and Lebanon .
Likewise , in his book about slavery and race in Islamic history , Lewis notes raiding into Europe for slaves and also into Africa and Asia for slaves .
Today , raiding for slaves in Africa continues in places like Eritrea and Sudan .
In fact , the principle issue of concern to the Mahdi pretender who fought with your country 's Mr. Gordon was protecting the right to take slaves in raids into Christian and animist territory .
Bat Ye'or , in her contraversial but brilliant book The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam chronicles raids - razzias - into Christian portions of Spain and into France from Andalusia for purposes of pillaging Christian regions and capturing girls to bring back for the harems .
Moreover , she notes that such raids would include the burning down of villages and churches , etc. , etc. .
She further notes that such raids occurred numerous times a year and had the approval of both religious and political leaders .
This behavior continued over the course of hundreds of years - in fact , throughout the time of Muslim rule in Spain - , and more than once a year .
The achievements of Islam are great .
However , the theme of expanding the region of the world governed by Islamic rule , today 's Islamists are not all that far out of step with tradition .

It is telling that you have nothing to say !
Absolutely nothing or , at least , to say publicly !
Why NOt come out with something relevant , substantial and meaningful and unburden your soul ??
art eckstein - 3/2/2008 Gordon disobeyed orders , acted irresponsibly in a vain effort to prevent the Sudan from falling to the Mahdi , and paid for his misjudgment with his life and the lives of hundreds of his supporters .
The Mahdi reimposed slavery , imposed a vicious Islamofascist regime , and engaged in aggressive jihadist wars which cost tens of thousands of lives , while the economy of the Sudan collapsed .
Muhammad Ahmad himself , however , had a fine time .
art eckstein - 3/2/2008
We are talking about something that was said in Hebrew that was mistranslated into English , but was not mistranslated into German ( for instance ) in Der Spiegel , but which Gee insists on mistranslating for her own vicious hatred - ideology reasons even when faced with rational and evidentiary arguments .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008
Are we talking about the same thing that is said or a different thing or something else altogether ?
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008
Not when you consider their mind - sets , Omar .
Sadly , and it's a regrettable fact , they are fairly typical run -of - the - mill paranoid Zionist religio-ethnic hateheads who have a special down on Islam and Muslims .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008
So you 're saying that Hebrew speakers live in a world of mysterious smoke and mirrors using unfamiliar words with meanings freed from commonsense and any notion of reality , including the basic reality of the actual use of language by the vast majority of English speaking Jews ?
Wow !
And here 's me thinking that genocide is just genocide but you 're saying that Hebrew is as subtle and differentiating an istrument as Inuit , which is reputed to have 40 plus different words for snow .
Again , wow !
Tells you a lot about colonising Hebrew speakers and the way they see the rest of the world though .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008 God , the Sudan then sounds just like Israel now , Mr Eckstein .
Maybe that 's the most likely - nay , the inevitable = outcome of any kind of imperialist intervention .
Sally Gee - 3/2/2008
Without the support of the British government , Gordon 's motives were an irrelevance .
By disobeying his lawful orders ( we may well be justified in thinking that his behviour is best regarded as treasonable ) , he chose to play poker with the lives of his men and Sudanese civilians , his bluff was called , and they all lost .
omar ibrahim baker - 3/2/2008
The fact of the matter is that out of , hitherto , some 50 plus or minus posts of the herd , by both the " gentleman " and the " multi awarded Prof " , re Pipes post , none touches on the question of " soft Islamism " as distinct from " hard Islamism " !
" Soft Islamism " is supposed to be the antonym of " hard Islamism " with its , presumably , concurrent " violence " , " extremism " , " fanaticism " etc etc that , the latter , is supposed to be their grounds for opposing it !!
That is a highly intriguing phenomenon !
omar ibrahim baker - 3/2/2008 Mr Friedman
I note with interest your belittling of the other " motives " in Gordon 's mission with the use of " whatever " in your :
" Whatever Gordon 's motives , .... "
Do you contend that Gordon 's SOLE motive was :" to combat slavery " ??
OR
is it that " combating slavery " is the only one you deem noteworthy ?
N. Friedman - 3/2/2008 Omar ,
Whatever Gordon 's motives , the fact is that the motive of the Mahdi pretender included , rather prominently , support for the slave trade .
History is a cunning thing and Gordon 's role included undermining that peculiar institution .
omar ibrahim baker - 3/2/2008 Gordon went into the Sudan to combat slavery to spread education and culture , to raise the standard of living , to improve life in general , but mainly , aside from teaching the ladies piano playing and flower arrangement :
**** to spread democracy ,
&
**** to teach the Sudanese about the respect due human rights .
( It is blasphemy and libel to entertain the notion of , or even suspect the word " colonialism " with which historically the UK , then Great Britain , never ever had absolutely anything to do !)
Just as Bush went into Iraq and with the same mission !
And we have highly awarded
" scholarly " fools ( with the academic equivalent of Oscars for the role of " best supporting actor " of course ) who spread the " word " :
- out of sincere , heart felt conviction ?
- service to the ulterior cause ?
- ingrained racist psychological build up ?
- congenital perverted mental formation ?
- all of the above ??
- none of the above ??
- name other causes , maladies , symptoms
N. Friedman - 3/1/2008 Ms. Gee ,
Do you know the difference between something said in Hebrew and something said English .
Evidently not .
art eckstein - 3/1/2008
Gee , the association of the word in your circles of English - speakers has no relevance to how General Vilnai used it in Hebrew .
Der Spiegel ( no lover of Israel ) translated Vilnai 's words and meaning correctly .
You refuse to accept that fact for reasons of your own hatreds .
art eckstein - 3/1/2008
That 's an extraordinarily distorted version of events .
As for local leaders , Gordon worked with what there was .
No one 's hands were clean in the Sudan except his on the slavery issue .
The Madhi's Islamic jihadist expansionism after Gordon 's defeat and death got the Sudanese involved in wars with neighbors that cost tens of thousands of lives .
Under his regime , slavery was reimposed , thousands of books of Islamic theology were burned as heretical , while military jihad replaced the hajj as the primary duty of Muslims .
This is Gee 's hero .
Sally Gee - 3/1/2008
This is kind of basic , but if we wish to understand what a word means as a tool of communication , it is well to look to its more general use .
And Shoah , in my family and other families I mix with , always use the term Shoah to mean the Jewish genocide to distinguish it from the more general Holocaust .
Maybe you and Friedman belong a some sort of cult which attaches special meaning to special words for whatever reason - in this case , to cover the ass of a minister in the Israeli government who signalled the coming genocide in Gaza .
Just think if the Iranians and Syrians , or a free Iraq , had a nuclear weapon with an adequate delivery system .
Think how many Palestinian lives it will save .
Maybe then , the association of the Jews with genocide will truly be a thing of the past .
Sally Gee - 3/1/2008
Mixed up confusion , indeed , Mr Eckstein .
Gordon 's plan was to maintain a British and Egyptian presence in the Sudan and rule it .
His intention was to have the Sebehr Rahma , a local leader , appointed to take govern Sudan , but the British government refused to accept Rahma because he was former slaver .
That is , Gordon wanted to cut the sort of deal that the invaders have time and again made with local leaders against the interests of the Afghani and Iraqi people .
art eckstein - 3/1/2008 No , the term HaShoah means the Holocaust .
That is different from using the term the way General Vilnai
used it .
Gee still does n't understand the difference , crude and malevolent as she is , a difference that N.F. and now myself have pointed out to her .
She calls intellectual differentiation between words " nitpicking . "
Nothing can be done with her , and her behavior is exactly as I predicted .
Her position was initially taken through sheer ignorance ; now it is maintained through hatred .
Sally Gee - 3/1/2008
So , we get there in the end : the word Shoah actually means the Jewish genocide to Jewish people .
A headline makes that perfectly clear and even Mr Eckstein should n't find that too hard to understand .
And all your nit-picking , no doubt prompted by Israel 's lobby machine in different western countries , only confirms and reinforces the the basic story : the State of Isreal is planning to intensify its genocidal policies against the inhabitants of Gaza over the next few days .
Full stop .
art eckstein - 3/1/2008
I did n't say Gordon was a hero to ME ; I said he was a Victorian hero .
He had many faults , as one can read in Lytton Strachey 's " Eminent Victorians " .
He was a " fanatical Christian " but unlike fanatical Muslims in the West he did not seek to impose his beliefs on others , for instance in the Sudan .
At Khartoum he was acting officially on behalf of the Egyptian government , which was a Muslim government .
He did attempt to end slavery in the Sudan .
Gee is now reduced to making anti-colonial heroes out of reactionary indigenous slaveholders , who reimposed slavery once he was dead .
No doubt she also sees al - Qaeda in Iraq as heroic as well .
Sally Gee - 3/1/2008 Gordon's was no hero , merely a fanatical evangelical Christian whose sin was disobeying orders and being responsible for the unnecessary loss of the lives of his soldiers and countless Sudanese civilians .
It was settled British government policy to abandon the Sudan but this did not suit Gordon who preferred to make policy by establishing facts on the ground .
The siege , which began on March 18 , 1884 , ended with the city 's capture on January 26 , 1885 .
Gordon had characteristically refused to evacuate Khartoum although it remained possible diplomatically and logistically feasible until very late in the famous siege , presumeably under the misapprehension that God was on his side .
Now , as then , The Sudan , like Afghanistan and Iraq , seems strangely resistant to imperial adventurers and , as Gladstone had cause to note , turned out to be a bit of an expensive business , as is the case , I believe , with Afghanistan and Iraq right now .
art eckstein - 3/1/2008 Readers : note that Gee depends upon the use of a headline , and in headlines the article ( " the " ) that precedes the noun is by custom dropped ; so " Shoah " in the headline refers to THE Shoah , the Holocaust ( HaShoah in Hebrew ) .
In addition , Shoah here in the headline is capitalized .
That too might be headline - eze , but in any case it makes it clear in yet a different way that this is a reference THE Shoah .
Again , that is simply not the way the word " shoah " ( general word for " disaster " ) was used by General Vilnai .
Gee 's reputation for ridiculously careless research and for grasping at straws to prove her extremist views just grows ever more enormous .
Sally Gee - 3/1/2008
This is a story from the Jewish Telegraphic Agency , where I guess nobody reads Hebrew and , despite the predoninance of Jews amongst their readership , are still unaware of the correct formulation to use when describing the Jewish response to the events of the Holocaust for they chose , no doubt in the absense of adequate consultation with Messrs Eckstein and Friedman , to go with the headline :
“ Panel to tweak French plan on Shoah ”
Published : 02/27/2008
“ Influential French Jews met with the country 's education minister about changing an unpopular approach to teaching the Holocaust to fifth - graders .
“ Holocaust survivor Simone Veil and Serge Klarsfeld , the president of the Association for Sons and Daughters of the Jewish Deportees of France , were among those who met Wednesday with Xavier Darcos in an effort to redraft President Nicolas Sarkozy 's proposal to have 10 - and 11 - year - olds adopt the name of a child killed during the Holocaust .
“ The plan has been intensely criticized .
Following Sarkozy 's announcement earlier this month , 85 percent of those surveyed in an Ifop poll " disapproved " of the proposal .
Veil had denounced it for being too heavy a burden for young children , while Klarsfeld supported the idea .
“ Though maintaining that Sarkozy " will not back down " from his plan , which is scheduled to launch in September , government officials have responded consistently to criticism by offering the alternative option of pairing an entire classroom rather than individuals with a child victim .
“ On Feb .
18 , Darcos made that option seem more like the only one available one when he said , " We 're going to move things a little bit , so that it will be a class rather that will adopt a child . "
“ The education minister 's committee is charged with coming up with a new proposal that is " admissible , educational and not traumatizing , " Darcos said . ”

There was a time when every educated person knew of John Charles Gordon .
He was killed by fanatical Islamic Madhists at Khartoum in 1885 .
Gordon 's sin was trying to end the slave trade .
No doubt Ms. Gee would defend slavery on mulicultural grounds , as long as Muslims do it .
Gordon is one of the great Victorian heroes .
The Mahdi after his victory over Gordon set up a typical Islamofascist regime in the Sudan ; though it reinstuted slavery , it was not as genocidal as the current Islamofascist regime in the Sudan , about which Ms. Gee has never had anything to say , though this regime has murdered at least 400,000 ( Muslim ) civilians since 2003 ( the 400,000 figure comes from the UN ; the number may be as high as 700,000 ) - - to nary a sound from the Muslim world .
The Muslim world also had nothing to say about the previous Islamic regime 's murder of a million Christians and Anamists in the south of the country .
But the Mahdi 's descendants do actually oppose the current regime as too extreme .
N.F. was trying to give
Gee a hint about whom he meant .
Her own lack of knowledge of history is pathetic , and when combined with her fanatical willingness to hurl personal insults at people ( i.e. , that he only knew about Gordon from " Four Feathers " ) , her conduct is appalling .
art eckstein - 3/1/2008 N.F. , we can't stop Ms. Gee from drinking the Kool - aid .
In the real world , Gee simply refuses to make the distinctions in language which N.F. rightly pointed out : that there is a gulf of difference between HaShoah ( the Holocaust ) and " shoah " as a general noun , meaning disaster .
It was in the latter sense that the Israeli general spoke , and so it was translated by , e.g. , Der Spiegel .
A world of haters such as Ms. Gee was willing to mis-translate it for political purposes , and she still is .
As I said at the beginning of this conversation ( # 119777 ) , where I knew it was going to go , Gee 's hate - filled argument here was based at first on her sheer ignorance , but when told the truth this would make no difference to her , and her position would become based on rejecting facts in favor of maintaining malicious and false propaganda .
So it has turned out .

Why is it that those who disagree with you or belong to the wrong religio-ethnic group are consigned to the status of animals ?
Is this a minor quirk , an ideological psture , or a major character flaw ?

They also manipulate the meaning of words .
Sally Gee -
3/1/2008 Mr

That would make you a very ungallant and disagreeable sort of fellow indeed and , if only I had your sef regard and lack of awareness , I would feel the temptation to develop your degree of whining self pity to cope with the traumatic effects of your criticism .

N. Friedman - 3/1/2008 Professor ,
We certainly have discussed the subject before .
Please note that I do not claim that Islamists have made no innovations .
Rather , my position is that the principle , albeit not the only , source of Islamism is Islam .

On the other hand , the millennial goal of bringing the entire world under Islamic rule is not remotely an innovation .
It is the dominant view during most of the history of Islam .
Such was described by Muslim writers at great length .
As explained around 1906 or 1907 , by the greatest non-Muslim Islamicist of all time , Ignaz Goldhizer ( d. 1921 ) :
In addition to the religious duties imposed upon each individual professing Islam , the collective duty of the " jihad " (= " fighting against infidels " ) is imposed on the community , as represented by the commander of the faithful .
Mohammed claimed for his religion that it was to be the common property of all mankind , just as he himself , who at first appeared as a prophet of the Arabs , ended by proclaiming himself the prophet of a universal religion , the messenger of God to all humanity , or , as tradition has it , " ila al - aḥmar wal - aswad " ( to the red and the black ) .
For this reason unbelief must be fought with the force of weapons , in order that " God 's word may be raised to the highest place . "
Through the refusal to accept Islam , idolaters have forfeited their lives .
Those " who possess Scriptures " ( " ahl al - kitab " ) , in which category are included Jews , Christians , Magians , and Sabians , may be tolerated on their paying tribute ( " jizyah " ) and recognizing the political supremacy of Islam ( sura ix . 29 ) .
The state law of Islam has accordingly divided the world into two categories : the territory of Islam ( " dar al - Islam " ) and the territory of war .
( " dar al - ḥarb " ) , i.e. , territory against which it is the duty of the commander of the faithful ( " amir al - mu' minin " ) to lead the community in the jihad .
As further explained by scholar M.J. Akbar , a Muslim of India background , in his excellent introductory book , Shade of Swords ( pp 's xv - xvi ) :
...
There are Muslims today , for instance , who will convert jihad into a holy bath rather than a holy war , as if it is nothing more than an injunction to cleanse yourself within .
It is true that the Prophet insisted that a greater jihad was the struggle to cleanse impurity within , but that does not take away from the fact that the lesser jihad inspired the spirit that once made Muslim armies all - conquering , enabled Muslims to protect their holy places , and ensured that most of the community lived with the protection of Muslim power despite formidable challenge from Christian alliances in a world war that was virtually coterminous with the birth of Islam .
So often did Muslim armies , whether in the west or the east , triumph against odds that it conjured up a sense of a self - replicating miracle .
Faith in Allah 's bargain was reinforced by each victory , particularly against Christian armies who mobilized repeatedly not only to destroy Muslim empires but also Islam , which they called a heresy against Christ .
Jihad is the signature tune of Islamic history .
If today 's Muslim rulers are reluctant to sound that note , it is often because they are concerned about the consequences of failure .
As in every bargain , there are two sides .
Allah promised victory to the Muslim , but only if the believer kept faith with him .
Defeat becomes an indictment of the ruler , and is therefore risky , particularly as Muslims have a long tradition of holding their rulers accountable .
They are enjoined to do so .
( Emphasis added ) .
Jihad , I should add , is mentioned on a number of occasions in the Koran in the context of making war .
That is not just my view .
It is the view of every major Muslim scholar I know of .
But , I do not see that it matters .
To nearly ALL of the Muslim theologians from the early times , the calls to make war to expand the realm of Islamic rule were typically taken as calls for Jihad .
A rather good examination of Jihad in Islam is set forth in David Cook 's rather brilliant book , Understanding Jihad .
The first chapter of the book can be found online here .
My only criticism of this book , which focuses at length on Jihad in the context of the ascetic idea , is its focus on the Hadith which reads , " there is no asceticism in Islam ; the asceticism in Islam is the holy war . "
While Cook may be correct this Hadith played a substantial role in how Jihad fighters saw themselves through the ages , the origin of the Hadith involved objection to ascetic movements such as the Sufi .
Be that as it may , I would highly recommend Cook 's book because it is written by a first rate scholar and historian and , so far as I am concerned , settles this question definitively .
While traditional doctrine held that Jihad was , other than for defense , a doctrine of state , there has always been dissent on this point , with many Muslims through the ages viewing Jihad as an individual endeavor .
In Patricia Crone 's brilliant book , God 's Rule - Government and Islam : Six Centuries of Medieval Islamic Political
Thought , she shows rather clearly that terrorism - i.e. NGO or private Jihad - was a problem from the very beginning and remained a problem throughout the period covered by her book - six hundred years !!!
She chronicles the difficulties that such terrorists caused rulers since the Jihadis did not always act in accordance with state policy and sometimes frustrated it .
In any event , these Jihadis would live on the outskirts of the Muslim regions and raid into non-Muslim territory , spreading terror and death as they raided .
The cult of the Assassins , chronicled rather well in Bernard Lewis ' book on the subject , discusses sleeper cells in countries which , on signal from the old man of the mountain , would assassinate political leaders and , in the process , kill themselves .
I realize they were neither Sunni or Shi'a but they are still within the Muslim tradition , with branches both in what would be today 's Iran and Lebanon .
Likewise , in his book about slavery and race in Islamic history , Lewis notes raiding into Europe for slaves and also into Africa and Asia for slaves .
Today , raiding for slaves in Africa continues in places like Eritrea and Sudan .
In fact , the principle issue of concern to the Mahdi pretender who fought with your country 's Mr. Gordon was protecting the right to take slaves in raids into Christian and animist territory .
Bat Ye'or , in her contraversial but brilliant book The Decline of Eastern Christianity Under Islam chronicles raids - razzias - into Christian portions of Spain and into France from Andalusia for purposes of pillaging Christian regions and capturing girls to bring back for the harems .
Moreover , she notes that such raids would include the burning down of villages and churches , etc. , etc. .
She further notes that such raids occurred numerous times a year and had the approval of both religious and political leaders .
This behavior continued over the course of hundreds of years - in fact , throughout the time of Muslim rule in Spain - , and more than once a year .
The achievements of Islam are great .
However , the theme of expanding the region of the world governed by Islamic rule , today 's Islamists are not all that far out of step with tradition .
art eckstein - 3/1/2008
The previous post does not mean that I disrespect N.F. 's position , let alone N.F. , a person I respect highly .
We just disagree somewhat on the issue of how integral political Islamism has to be to Islam in general .
N.F. sees it as more integral than I do , and I admit he has a case ; but I side somewhat more with Pipes on this .
art eckstein - 3/1/2008 N.F. and I have had this debate before .
He sees Islamism as more integral and natural to Islam than I do .
As here :
" Reply to N.F. ( #105216 )
by art eckstein on February 9 , 2007 at 8:19 AM
N.F. , I find myself in the odd position of having to defend Islam .
Given my frequent clashes with that ignorant , paranoid , dishonest and self - deceptive fool Omar , this is not pleasant for me to do .
But I do think that Islam as a religion is not static but is both hugely complex AND existing in a historicized context .
Hence trends within it are capable of development in any number of directions , some of which are good .
Even Ibn Warraq ( no friend of Islam , as you know ) acknowledges that many passages in the Koran are simply ignored by many Muslims , including the most offensive and aggressive passages : he cites the example of doctors in Pakistan who refused to amputate the limbs of thieves .
But this act by the doctors in itself changes " really - existing Islam . "
Even more pertinent , some Muslims , including prominent ones , interpret Sura 9.5 to mean that Muslims have the right to abrogate at will any peace treaty made with non-Muslims , whereas others say that 9.5 deals with a very specific case , and point to verse 48.26 which says one must keep the terms of treaties with those who have kept their terms with you .
The Koran is a complex and often self - contradictory text , and some verses will be more influential than others of a contrary trend , depending on the historical context and the influence of certain thinkers .
Of course , we should not be worried about those Muslims who go with 48:26 but about those who DO believe in the above interpretation of Sura 9:5 .
And if they are the vast majority of Muslims now , we should be very worried indeed , because it means effective diplomacy between such Muslims and non-Muslims is impossible because such Muslims are totally untrustworthy .
But even if this latter bad situatiion were the case , that does not mean that such a situation is " the real and only Islam , " past , present , future , forever .
Historical change over time is the primary perception and focus of historians .
( Of course , the changes need NOT be in what we would call a positive direction !
That 's what I 've said is the difference between trends in 19th c Islam , as far as I understand them , and trends today . )
The jihadists have a strong , indeed , unanswerable case for being AN authentic and indeed ONE major Muslim tradition .
And as you say , N.F. , you and I are in strong agreement on the nature of the current crisis , and on much else , including how to help Muslim " moderates " by treating the jihadists as the barbarians they are , and treating ignorant fools and liars such as Omar as one should treat such people ; and we 're in agreement on much else too .
I am not optimistic nor naive about Islam .
But I do not see a picture of total bleakness either .
The current situation is a historical situation caused by specific historical forces , and we are in agreement again that mostly those destructive forces come from within Islam itself .
Where we differ is in our understanding of whether those terribly destructive and aggressive forces MUST go unanswered in Islam on THEOLOGICAL grounds . "
The only " hate - head " around here is Gee the Jew - hater .
She gets the Alfred Rosenberg award practically every time she posts .
N. Friedman - 3/1/2008 Ms. Gee ,
" Shoah " and " genocide " do not mean the same thing .
In fact , " HaShoah " and " genocide " do not mean the same thing .
In fact , " Holocaust " and " genocide " do not mean the same thing .
Brutes yolk together terms without any care as to their distinctions .
That is the opposite of what thinking people do .
N. Friedman - 3/1/2008 Ms. Gee ,
Where have I tried here to create any confusion here ?
That is in your head .
What I said is that Omar can answer to his comment that equates Islamism and Islam .
I would be interested in his views since he , unlike me , is Muslim .
And , as I have said before , Omar is familiar with his religion and is capable of explaining himself .
If you want my view , Islam and Islamism are not two wholly different things .
They are related and interwoven .
As I understand it , Islamism is a word used for the revival movement among Muslims and an Islamist is one who is part of that revival movement .
Islamists tend , to varying degrees , to emphasize politics that will advance the religio- political aims of Islam that most Muslims understand Islam to have .
Sally Gee - 3/1/2008
So you have to speak Hebrew before it is possible to distinguish between " genocide " and " genocide " in plain English ?
Grow up .
This is how kids argue in a nursery - until some adult comes along and explains the difference between essentialism and nominalism .
Perhaps I should take that responsibility on myself but , in all honesty , I 'd rather pass .
Sally Gee -
3/1/2008
I think you 're right - perhaps unwittingly - when you suggest that maybe Omar is correct , Mr Friedman .
The confusion Mr Pipes , you and your fellow hatehead , Mr Eckstein , attempt to create provides a very sound basis for the joint award of the Alfred Rosenberg Prize for Crypto - Nazi Propaganda , 2008 .
I expect Mr Eckstein will be really pleased to add this to all his other awards .
art eckstein - 3/1/2008 N.F. is exactly correct .
There 's a difference in Hebrew between HaShoah ( the Holocaust ) and " shoah " ( disaster ) .
Der Spiegel had the translation correctly .
This is a fact Gee chooses to ignore .
As for Spielberg , obviously ( 1 ) the term in English does have the meaning of the Holocaust ; but ( 2 ) I doubt that HE speaks Hebrew either .
Not all Jews do , Gee .
N. Friedman - 3/1/2008 Ms. Gee ,
I shall look at the John Sinclair book .
No doubt the late John Sinclair will shed great light on what was meant by the Israeli speaker in this instance .
Or , do you refer me to Sinclair for some other reason ?
I would suggest that , in this case , were there really an intent to wipe out the Palestinian Arabs in Gaza , people would not be trying only to make political hay .
Rather , people would be trying to stop such horrors from occurring .
So would I .
Again , as used by the speaker , the word means disaster and has nothing to do with what occurred during WWII in Europe .
That is perfectly clear from the context and The Guardian is wrong to suggests otherwise .
I should add : this is not the first time that factoids have come out of the UK .
Again , in most instances , the word " shoah " is used differently from the word " HaShoah . "
That , whether or not you wish to believe it , is a fact .
Sally Gee - 3/1/2008
At the risk of sounding fairminded , Mr Friedman , can I suggest that you may also benefit from reading John Sinclair 's " Corpus , Concordance and Collocation " , OUP 1991 .
Sally Gee -
3/1/2008
Oh , right then .
Why did Mr Spielberg choose to set up the " Shoah Foundation " ?
Does he not speak Hebrew either ?
Even though you appear to be a prize and ineducable idiot , Mr Eckstein , it may help to reduce your obvious confusion about the nature of language as a means of mutually intelligible communication if you were to read John Sinclair 's " Corpus , Concordance and Collocation " , OUP 1991 .
Perhaps then you will be less beguiled by Mr Friedman 's third rate wordsmithing in the service of a terrorist state whose defence ministers casually and publically plot genocide .
But , then again , perhaps not ...
N. Friedman - 3/1/2008 Professor ,
Maybe Omar is correct .
On topics such as what his religion teaches , Omar is normally well informed .
Maybe Islamism is Islam , as his comment suggests .
I think we should let him explain what , if any , difference he sees between Islam and Islamism .
N. Friedman - 3/1/2008 Ms. Gee ,
The Guardian is , in this case , mistaken .
And note : other sources ( e.g. Der Spiegel - hardly a source of pro-Israel rhetoric ) have translated the word differently - as in , e.g. , if the Palestinian Arabs continue to fire rockets into Israel , the response by the Israelis will be devastating .
That is , from what I can discern , a pretty accurate explanation of what was said .
In any event , this is not even a close call .
The language used was not " HaShoah " and as the was later confirmed , he was using the word " shoah " in its ordinary sense to mean disaster .
art eckstein - 3/1/2008
Pipes is well known for distinguishing carefully between Islam and Islamist supremicist fanaticism .
This was admitted even by the liberal Harvard Magazine in its profile of him .
Pipes holds a Ph.D. in Muslim History and speaks Arabic fluently .
The person equating all of Islam with Islamst supremicist fanaticism is Omar .
That is a grave disservice to Islam , and especially to progressive Muslims .
Omar should realize that the Islamist pushing for non-Muslim Westerners to obey Sharia law as imposed upon them in the interpretation of the fanatics among Muslim immigrants is creating a backlash .
This backlash is quite natural , since Islamist supremicist fanatics are not * immigrants " to the West but rather intentional supremicist * colonists " in the West , intent upon imposing their foreign ( and in my view , of course , repulsive ) ideas upon the indigenous population .
I thought Omar was against colonialism .
art eckstein - 3/1/2008 " Using the Hebrew word reserved for the Holocaust " is totally inaccurate .
Ms. Gee , who does not speak Hebrew , uses to back her up another left - wing crank who does not speak Hebrew either .
No doubt Israel - haters all around the world will delight in the same mis-use of the term as Ms. Gee does .
But now she must understand that she misunderstands this Hebrew word and its use no longer out of ignorance but out of malice .
She 's been told the truth by N.F .
Sally Gee - 3/1/2008
Then , if i were you , it would be an idea to take the Guardian to task because they seem to have the same - widely held - understanding of the term Shoah I have .
Perhaps you will advise Matan Vilnai to bring an action against the Guardiam under England 's notorious libel laws .
As if ...
But let 's just remind ourselves of the opening paragraphs of the story and ask ourselves why Israel 's deputy defense minister can talk so freely about his willingness to commit genocide in Gaza - the ultimate Samson fantasy but this time with 20 - 20 vision .
" Israel 's deputy defence minister yesterday warned his country was close to launching a huge military operation in Gaza and said Palestinians would bring on themselves a " bigger shoah , " using the Hebrew word usually reserved for the Holocaust .
" The choice of vocabulary from Matan Vilnai , an often outspoken former army general , was unusually grave - the word is not normally used for anything other than the Nazi Holocaust of the Jews . "
N. Friedman - 3/1/2008 Omar ,
Is your point that Islamism and Islam are one and the same ?
Please explain .
N. Friedman - 3/1/2008 Omar ,
There are people who will say anything due to a political agenda .
That is the way of the world .
The fact remains that the word " shoah " not only has many meanings but that , as used by the speaker , it would not usually have the meaning that refers to the events in Europe during WWII .
Rather , when the word is normally used in connection with those events , it is normally used as " HaShoah , " not " shoah . "
In any event , we shall see whether something akin to HaShoah occurs in Gaza or whether , instead , the Israelis attempt to quell the firing of missiles by Hamas by means of an invasion .
My bet is the latter .
Somehow , I think such is your bet as well .
Were it not , you would not be spending your time arguing with me .
You would be warning the Gazans to try to save their lives .
In fact , so would I .
omar ibrahim baker - 3/1/2008 Had Mr Friedman been watching Al Gezira TV yesterday he would have heard with his own ears , and eyes , a philosophy Professor at the University of Haifa , whose name I do not recall , express utter surprise and condemnation for the use of the term , NOT out of horror at the prospects , but because nothing can be compared to the SHOAH which is , he implied , a strict Jewish " monopoly " an
" appellation d'origine contrôlée ' "
( Whether hewas worried itwould / could
be used by the Palestinians to black mail the world into paying reparations , both financial and political , endlessly he did NOT say ! )
omar ibrahim baker - 3/1/2008
In an extraordinarily mild and well reasoned post Pipes sums up the issue as :
" Ultimately , soft Islamism presents dangers at least as great as does violent Islamism . "
It is not only the mildness that is so surprising but equally his " truthfulness " in bringing out to day light the real enemy of Pipes and ilk : Islamism .
So it , the
neocon / Evangelist / Zionist / Jewish mission has nothing to do , or be bothered by , with the " violence "
, the " terrorism " , the " fanaticism " etc etc of Islam .
But it has everything to do with Islam per se and the softer it is the more dangerous it becomes !
That is one more " opinion " to demonstrate the truth about the whole conflict !
Conversely , although I thank Pipes for it , I believe it was very ill advised , on his part and for his " cause " , to declare it so bluntly no matter how " sincere " he is about it ; which he is I have no doubt .
It is GOOD that PIPES and ilk are coming out into the open for all , including all Moslems , to see !
Thanks PIPES !
N. Friedman - 3/1/2008 Ms. Gee ,
Again , the word in question was not use to mean what you think .
Again , two seconds worth of time investigating the matter would show you that , in fact , the word " shoah " is used frequently to refer to a disaster , not to what happened in Europe .
This , Ms. Gee , is not even a close call .
Rather , it is people like you who have political agendas who intentionally change the meaning of what the speaker said .
Sally Gee - 3/1/2008
But it is also a much stronger and more specific term used by us to describe the Jewish experience of the Third Reich ( as opposed to that of Gypsies , Russians and Czechs , for example ) than the Greek term " holocaust " .
The " disaster " you speak of is planned genocide - nothing more , nothing less .
It is one of the reasons why many religious Jews , amongst others , continue to question the existence of a distinctly Jewish state in Palestine .
N. Friedman - 3/1/2008 Ms. Gee ,
Do you speak Hebrew ?
I doubt it .
The word " Shoah " is a commonly used word in conversational Hebrew to mean " disaster . "
Nice try , though .
Biologists have determined the three - dimensional structure of an unusual viral enzyme that is required in the assembly of new viruses .
The Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus infects a green alga called chlorella , transferring its DNA into host cells .
Once inside the chlorella , the virus DNA makes an enzyme called glycosyltransferase , which is needed to produce structural proteins that are assembled to create the outer shells , or capsids , for new virus particles .
In contrast , many viruses commandeer the genes of host cells to make enzymes and proteins , said Ying Zhang , a postdoctoral researcher in the laboratory of Michael Rossmann .
The three - dimensional structure of the complete infectious virus had been determined earlier by the same group of researchers and their colleagues .
Now they have found the structure of a specific type of glycosyltransferase and also its complex with a molecule called UDP - glucose , which stands for uridine - 5 - diphosphate - glucose , along with positively charged manganese ions .
The manganese ions are critical because they coordinate the binding of the UDP - glucose to the enzyme .
Learning the fundamental mechanisms for how this glycosyltransferase works may later enable scientists to develop drugs that inhibit certain viral infections , Zhang said .
The glycosyltransferase apparently breaks a chemical bond between UDP and the glucose .
The glucose is then attached to the roughly 5,000 copies of a protein that assembles to form the viral capsid that surrounds and protects the virus 's DNA genome .
" The glucose may be helping to correctly fold the protein while it is being assembled into the capsid , " Rossmann said .
In addition , the glucose on the capsid also may be involved in the initiation of the viral infection , he said .
The researchers used X - ray crystallography to determine the structure of the glycosyltransferase enzyme and earlier had used cryoelectron microscopy to determine the three - dimensional structure of the virus .
The findings are detailed in a research paper appearing in the September issue of the journal Structure .
The paper was written by Zhang ; Purdue postdoctoral researcher Ye Xiang ; James Van Etten , the William Allington Distinguished Professor of Plant Pathology at the University of Nebraska ; and Rossmann .
The work has been funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Center for Research Resources .
Israel today threatened further military action to weaken Hamas in Gaza as its troops withdrew after a week - long offensive that killed more than 100 Palestinians .
The Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , said more strikes were likely against militants firing rockets from Gaza .
The declaration comes despite widespread condemnation of Israel 's action .
" We are in the midst of a combat action .
What happened in recent days was not a one - time event , " an Israeli official quoted Olmert as telling a parliamentary panel .
" The objective is reducing the rocket fire and weakening Hamas . "
Palestinians in Gaza can expect a respite as the US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , arrives in the region to try and salvage what remains of a US push for peace that began in November .
A senior Israeli government official said there would be a " two - day interval " for Rice 's visit .
She is to hold talks in Jerusalem and the West Bank city of Ramallah tomorrow and Wednesday on moving negotiations forward .
The US president , George Bush , said in November at the Annapolis conference that he hoped agreement on a Palestinian state could be reached this year .
But the deadliest fighting since the Palestinian uprising of the 1980s has made Rice 's task much harder .
Mahmoud Abbas , whose western - backed forces lost control of Gaza to Hamas in June , said he would not resume talks with the Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , until Israel stopped its attacks .
" The situation is grave and what resulted from the Israeli aggression was unprecedented since the 1967 war of Israeli occupation , " said the Palestinian prime minister , Salam Fayyad .
The Palestinian health ministry said 116 Palestinians were killed in the Gaza offensive .
Militant groups said about half were civilians .
Fayyad put the death toll at 110 and said 250 people were wounded .
Many of the civilian casualties came when Israeli missiles fired by helicopters , jets and unmanned drones hit buildings and homes that the army said were used by militants .
Overnight , Israel carried out air strikes in the Gaza Strip .
Three militants died , according to medical workers and Hamas .
The army said it had targeted workshops making rockets .
Two Israeli soldiers were killed in the offensive and on Wednesday an Israeli civilian was killed by a rocket , the first such death since May .
The UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , condemned Israel for using " excessive force " and called on Palestinians to halt their rocket attacks .
The US called for Israeli restraint .
" We 're encouraging Israel to exercise caution to avoid the loss of innocent life , " a US state department spokesman said after Rice spoke to Abbas yesterday .
A White House spokesman said : " The violence needs to stop and the talks need to resume . "
As Israel withdrew its troops , a spokesman for the Hamas armed wing declared victory and vowed it would continue the attacks .
" The enemy has been defeated , " said the Hamas spokesman .
A senior Hamas official , Sami Abu Zuhri , said : " Gaza will always be a graveyard for the occupation forces . "
Despite days of Israeli assault , Gaza militants continued firing rockets .
Three landed in Ashkelon , a city of 120,000 people , one hitting an apartment building , Israeli rescue services said .
No casualties were reported .
The Israeli deputy prime minister , Haim Ramon , told army radio : " This operation has run its course .
The main goal of the Israeli government ... is to end the firing at targets in the south .
There were dozens of deaths among the Hamas terorrists - this is certainly deterrence . "
The Israeli defence minister , Ehud Barak , said a full - scale invasion was still possible , and Israel might try to bring down Hamas .
" We will use force to change the situation , " Barak told a meeting late yesterday of security commanders , according to a statement from his office .
Since the Annapolis conference there has been little movement in talks between Olmert and Abbas .
The Palestinians have complained that Israel has done little to remove checkpoints that hamper movement and trade , and fighting between Hamas and Israel has escalated .
*** UPDATE **** I really think people are misinterpreting this post .
What I am trying to say here is that if Microsoft can get IE8 out there , and can get the majority of Windows users on it , then it will be a huge step .
But I very much question whether this will happen .
Read on to find out why .
****
With today ’s news that IE 8 is now passing the ACID2 test , I started thinking about what that would mean to us web developers .
( Well , I ’m an asp. net developer , not really a web developer .
It is like web development with training wheels , only the training wheels are really heavy , uneven , and make riding the bike harder .
🙂
Oh come on , have a sense of humor )
So , what would a standards compliant IE8 mean for web developers ?
Call me cynical , but I honestly do n’t think it will mean all that much for a long long ( long long long long ) time , and lets look at why I believe that .
Within the developer community , how many people still use IE anymore ?
( This has nothing to do with overall IE use , but just bear with me )
Sure we have to all still account for it when we are doing our development , but how many of us actually use it for our daily browsing ?
In order to get some sort of idea , I decided to use the traffic from this blog .
So , to get some recent data I pulled up Google analytics to look at my browser numbers on my site since December 1st .
This is probably about what you expected to see on a technically oriented site .
You have about 70 % Firefox , 20 % IE , and then the last 10 % is split among the rest of the browsers .
Okay , this is all fine and good , but lets look at the breakdown of the numbers on Firefox …
Not too bad , we have over 80 % on 2.0.0.11 , and then over 2 % on the Firefox 3 beta .
Between 2.0.0.10 and 2.0.0.9 we have almost 8 % .
Of all Firefox users though , less than 1 % are using Firefox 1 and even those are using Firefox 1.5 .
So , 99 % of all of these users are on Firefox 2 or above even though Firefox 2 was only released just over a year ago .
Next , lets take a look at the same breakdown for Internet Explorer …
IE7 was released in October of 2006 as well , and so the time on market is almost identical .
So , what is up with these numbers ?
Only 56 % on IE7 and a full 44 % on IE6 !
( Also , why in the world is there more IE 4.01 users than IE 5.5 ?
Ha , that is an aberration if I ever saw one )
Now , before you say , “ but hey , IE7 is only available for XP and Vista .
That is why so many people have n’t upgraded ! ”
Well , that is B.S. Look at the numbers for Windows operating systems …
XP , Vista , and Server 2003 ( all of which have IE7 available for them ) make up almost 98 % of all Windows users .
So , apparently IE users just do n’t want to upgrade .
Why ?
I have no idea .
Maybe they do n’t like tabs , or hate the fact that they hid the File menu .
The whole point is that if this is IE7 ’s adoption rate after it has been out for over a year , then what do you think is going to happen with IE8 ?
Somehow I doubt that there is going to be a huge uptake , since I would imagine that in the non-technical crowd this problem would be worse .
Also , Microsoft does n’t have a new OS release to push IE8 out with either .
On top of all this , it appears that IE8 is going to require a special “ head ” tag ( I keep seeing this , but I do n’t know where it is coming from , so take it with a grain of salt ) in order to turn on IE8 standards mode and if that tag is not there then it will render in IE7 “ standards ” mode .
I completely understand their reasoning for this , but it just makes my head hurt .
I guess most of the other browsers have n’t had to deal with this because they have mostly supported standards from the beginning and their users actually upgrade their browsers !
So , what does a standards compliant IE8 mean for us ?
Well , unless Microsoft forces users to upgrade when it is released ( which just is n’t the way Microsoft does things ) , it means that sometime around 2013 when IE6 and IE7 are sunsetted , we might finally be able to stop worrying about stupid browser quirks in IE .
But on the bright side , at least there is light at the end of the tunnel …even if it is a few light years away .
So , what do you think , is IE8 going to change anything ?
Or am I just being jaded ?
Free Software : tools for Freedom and democracy
Posted 23 Mar 2002 at 14:21 UTC by adulau
After the recent use of DMCA by the Church of Scientology to remove some critics about them from the google cache .
Free Software can be easily used to protect Freedom of speech , democracy and fundamental rights .
There is a large overview of software that can do indexing , crawling , mirroring of documents available on HTTP server , NNTP server and so on ...
Any volunteer for building a distributed caching system for protecting Freedom ?
There is multiple way to build a google - like distributed cache engine for protecting Freedom and democracy , here it is some idea ( just idea ;-) :
Using existing Free Software like mnogosearch [ http://www.mnogosearch.org/] that can do lots of things like caching , mirroring , multiple db backend , ...
Some work has to be done to make it more reliable in large scale and for making multiple caching destination ( different countries ) .
When they want to remove something , the only way to remove something is to give the complete url like : www.xenu.net/archive//...
We have to think as an alternative solution for url ( like temporary url moving day to day like : hash.something.org/archive/... )
An url type evolving in time in a random way , so to get the document you should go to a search interface to get the new document .
Of course , you can get the original document but this is a way to preventing censorship on a specific url .
We can have a pool of delegated subdomain ( xyz.gnu.org , hysss.eff.org , zxy.ael.be ... ) that make the thing more complex for potential censorship .
We have to fight against law like DMCA , EUCD , SSSCA and so on ...
But I think we have to fight in multiple front : political ( as we do for the moment ) front and a technical front also .
Free Software , as we know , is a matter of Freedom .
Freedom can be protected by using Free Software .
Feel free to give ideas , opinions about the link between Freedom and Free Software .
Freenet and Mnet , posted 23 Mar 2002 at 15:19 UTC by Zooko » ( Master )
There are two projects that I know of that are under active development that could be used for this purpose : Freenet and Mnet .
( I 'm the leader of the Mnet project . )
For current activity in Mnet , see the status page , the news page , the cvs repository , and the mnet - devel mailing list .
The Freenet home page has a similar plethora of resources .
Lots of work , posted 23 Mar 2002 at 23:52 UTC by raph » ( Master )
There 's been a lot of work done on building censor - proof publication and archive systems .
Probably the granddaddy of them all is Ross Anderson 's Eternity project .
Also see the " rewebber " .
More recent proposals , as Zooko points out , include MNet and Freenet .
The Free Haven project has generated a lot of interesting research , as well .
I think these projects are very worthwhile , but do n't forget the importance of political solutions to political problems .
There 's a reason we do n't scramble eggs with a hammer or drive nails with an eggbeater .
Write your congress - critters .
Engage in civil disobedience .
Join the ACLU .
Take the opportunity to educate people about the issues .
Also write code , but do n't labor under the delusion that any single one of these actions in isolation will fix the problem .

Any volunteer for building a distributed caching system for protecting Freedom ?
May I point you to the askemos project which is trying get an infrastructure done , which does n't only distribute the data but also the processing .
It 's true that you can do amazing things by harnessing the power of Free Software ; and in a sense , the low overhead makes Free Software very difficult to censor .
But in another sense , proprietary interests have the upper hand when it comes to censorship .
After all , the Church of Scientology does n't have to prevent you from linking to all the information you want to about their forty - one flavors of evil ; all they have to do in order to win is make sure the masses do n't see your links .
Which means that creating a distributed , hard - to - suppress network is the easy part .
The hard part is drawing eyeballs from outside the free software / free speech / anti-CoS communities .
After all , if the goal is something more than preaching to the choir -- if the goal is to actually fight misinformation and get the word out to society at large -- then these people are your target audience .
Anything you do that makes you visible to them also makes you an obvious target for the CoS heavies to shoot at .
Which means that with or without Free Software , fighting the social tumor that is the Church of Scientology is still going to be an uphill battle ; it 's going to take people brave enough to stand up to them for a cause , willing to take a few hits , willing to most likely suffer being dragged through court and have their reputation ruined in their local community .
Free Software can keep the Internet running , but it can't make heroes .
It 's a powerful tool , but it 's not a panacea .
I think world hunger is a more tractable problem for Free Software than the CoS ...

have n't tried it , but GNUnet fits into this category
I find it interesting that freely / openly licensed systems are the only lasting entries in this class of application .
Systems using proprietary licenses are short - lived in comparison , at least in part due to their lack of capability to a resist a direct bureaucratic attack .

It 's not a matter of technology but of political strength .
Hollywood and Scientology have an innate interest in controlling internet publication ( and human - to - human communication in general ) and will do anything they can to buy the laws they want .
Their efforts have to be opposed at a political level and not just with more search engines .

Starting in May , driver ’s licenses issued in Maine and South Carolina may not be accepted as identification at airports and federal buildings unless the states work out a last - minute agreement with the federal Department of Homeland Security .
The states are refusing to ask the agency to extend the deadline for applying new layers of security in their identification systems as required under the federal Real ID Act .
Congress passed the legislation in 2005 with the intention of making it harder for terrorists to obtain driver ’s licenses .
The final Real ID regulations were released Jan. 11 , and states have until Monday to request an extension of the compliance date .
Without an extension , driver ’s licenses from Maine and South Carolina will no longer be deemed valid as identification at airports and federal buildings starting May 11 , the original date of compliance .
As an alternative , travelers could use passports .
“ If an individual shows up at an airport on May 11 or later and their licenses are from any state not in compliance , it ’s effectively showing up without federal identification of any kind , ” said Amy Kudwa , a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security .
“ Individuals in those scenarios will have to have added security and screening . ”

This is what those mysterious concrete sculptures are in Toronto 's Lower Don Trail
It seems that everyone and their brother are now saying that the U.S. is in the midst of a recession .
The market analysts are predicting that the U.S. GDP will actually go negative this year .
It must be official now that even the White House has acknowledged it .
This got me to thinking about the effect a recession might have on my industry ( IT security ) .
My first thought was that if the profits of companies start dwindling then their IT budgets will predictably follow suit .
If IT budgets dwindle then my experience tells me that the security budgets will take an even larger percentage hit than IT overall .
When fighting for IT dollars in many cases security gets lost , put on hold , and brushed under the carpet .
Thankfully , we now have a proliferation of compliance / regulations ( PCI , HIPAA , SOX , etc. ) that can compel organizations to focus some budget on security projects .
So , if a recession will force security budgets to shrink at a greater percentage rate then the IT budget as a whole , what does that mean for an organizations ability to defend itself ?
Well let ’s see how a future scenario might play out .
Company XYZ will be consolidating their operations into a new location .
They must purchase new IT gear for the new location .
During the design phase it is highly likely that security controls ( FW , IPS , Host , etc ) will be reduced or eliminated altogether because of budget restraints .
The end result is Company XYZ has just reduced their security posture and ability to defend them selves .
As if the hypothesis that a recession will decrease the security effectiveness of organizations is n’t bad enough ; there is precedent that low GDP growth tends to increase the proliferation of new , highly effective cyber attacks .
Why is that ?
Well , I have a theory on it .
Negative GDP growth and a recession bring with them job layoffs and losses .
This produces a large skilled IT labor pool that is out of work and has time on their hands .
So this brings up a question :
Is their a correlation between the number of out of work IT professionals and the number of cyber attacks ?
I did some research to find out .
The bursting of the dot com bubble in late 2000 and 2001 was a horrible time to be in IT .
During that time we saw massive IT job loss that resulted in the creation of a large pool of unemployed skilled IT workers .
So I used this timeframe for my research .
During this time the U.S. economy saw a large weakening in the GDP growth of the country ( as shown in the diagram below ) .
[ img=450x350 ]

Image Source : Lombard Street Research
Note that the red circles above indicate economic recessions .
What I found out in my research was that during this 2000 - 2001 timeframe we saw the proliferation of some of the most notorious cyber attacks ever seen .
Here are some examples :
2000 – IloveYou virus launched – Infected 10 % of all computer connected to the internet in one day .
2001 – Anna Kournilova worm – Infected over 1 million computers in one day
2001 - Code Red and Code Red II worms –
In its day it was called the biggest worm incident in the history of the Internet
2001 - Nimda – Damage estimated at over 2 billion dollars
Based on this , my research suggests that there is indeed a relationship between slower GDP growth / recessions and an increase in cyber attacks .
It might be a result of the mass IT unemployment that recessions trigger .
Skilled IT folks who have just been fired , ca n’t find a job , and have extra time on their hands , seems like the perfect ingredients for whipping up a batch of cyber anarchy to me .
Do you believe there is a strong correlation between recession and cyber threats ?
So , will our current economic recession trigger the same cyber assault cycle that previous recessions have ?
Will we see new , more powerful worms propagating the world in the coming months ?
Let ’s hope not !

We know , we 're getting tired of Apple Blu-ray rumors as well -- they 're right up there with refreshed Cinema Displays in terms of rumor persistence -- but until Steve and the gang actually shove a drive into a machine we 're stuck with them .
The latest says that Apple is actively pressing Sony for slot - loading BD - R drives but quality control issues are gumming up the plan .
Reportedly , this latest ho - hum MacBook Pro refresh was to feature BD - R drives , but all Sony could muster up were Blu-ray / DVD±RW drives , which Apple refused .
That seems a little odd , frankly -- now that the format war is over and the competition 's already shipping mid-range laptops with slot - load BD - R drives , you 'd think Apple would want to cash in that Blu-ray Disc Association membership card with whoever can supply the drives .
As always , we 'll see when we see -- it 's gotta happen sometime , right ?

( Mental Floss ) --
Being a child prodigy is no guarantee that you 'll grow up to be rich , famous or happy .
You might have a breakdown and fade into obscurity ( like that guy in the movie " Shine " ) , quit the scene altogether ( like chess maestro Bobby Fischer ) , or turn to a life of petty crime ( insert the name of your favorite child actor here ) .
In fact , experts say the road from kid genius to adult dud is a well - traveled one .
But if you or someone you love happens to be a budding brainiac , do n't despair .
There are instances of wonder boys and girls who bucked the trend and grew up to be smart cookies .
Here are 10 notable examples .
BLAISE PASCAL ( 1623 -1662 )
Areas of expertise : Math , physical science and philosophy
Notable achievement : Making a bet with God
Secret to his success : Doing geometry when his dad was n't looking
The great French thinker Blaise Pascal began studying geometry at age 12 , even though his father had forbidden such academic endeavors and removed all mathematics textbooks from the house .
But even Pascal senior could n't help but be impressed when his son recreated the geometry theories of Euclid , so he started taking young Poindexter to weekly meetings with the elite mathematicians of Paris .
By age 19 , Pascal had begun to develop a hand - held , mechanical calculator , which might have made him rich if it had n't proved impractical to mass produce ( a big relief to the abacus industry ) .
Fortunately , that did n't send him spiraling into child - burnout depression , and he went on to many more years of scientific achievement .
Besides publishing influential treatises in geometry , Pascal made significant contributions in physical science , like experimenting with atmospheric pressure and determining that a vacuum exists outside Earth 's atmosphere .
His contributions to philosophy include the famous " Pascal 's Wager , " which states that believing in God costs you nothing if you 're wrong , and wins you everything if you 're right .

MARIA AGNESI ( 1718 - 1799 )
Areas of expertise : Mathematics and astronomy
Notable achievement : Proving that chicks are good at math , too
Secret to her success :
Time management ; she was known to write the solutions to difficult math problems in her sleep ( literally )
When Maria Gaetana Agnesi was born in Milan in 1718 , girls in upper - class Italian society were taught dressmaking , etiquette and religion , but not how to read .
Thankfully , her father , himself a mathematician , recognized Maria 's amazing memory and talent for languages and decided that something like literacy might be a good thing for his daughter .
By the time she was nine , Agnesi was impressing party guests with speeches she 'd translated into Latin .
By age 13 , when a visitor would ask her for a waltz , Agnesi would treat her dance partner to a discussion of Newton 's theory of gravity ( a second waltz was a rare request ) .
But thanks to her father 's second and third marriages , Agnesi eventually found herself in charge of a household of 20 brothers and sisters , and since she was the oldest , she ended up utilizing more of those Home Ec skills than she had anticipated .
Fortunately , in between breaking up slap fights and doling out bowls of spaghetti , the 30 - year - old Agnesi managed to compose a highly influential , two - volume manual on mathematics that included cutting edge developments like integral and differential calculus .
Afterward , Pope Benedict XIV wrote Agnesi , commending her work and suggesting her for a post at the University of Bologna .
FELIX MENDELSSOHN ( 1809 - 1847 )
Areas of expertise : Piano , organ and orchestra ( performance and composition )
Notable achievement : His " Wedding March , " which has survived over a century of rising divorce rates and overpriced wedding planners
Secret to his success : Nicest guy in classical music
Widely regarded as the 19th - century equivalent of Mozart , German composer Felix Mendelssohn was musically precocious at an early age .
Mendelssohn began taking piano lessons at age six , made his first public performance at age nine , and wrote his first composition ( that we know of ) when he was 11 .
By the time he turned 17 , he had completed his Overture to " A Midsummer Night 's Dream , " one of the Romantic period 's best - known , most - loved works of classical music .
Then , in 1835 , Mendelssohn 's father died , which ( just like Wolfy ) came as a crushing blow to the composer .
But rather than sending him into an alcohol - induced stupor , the experience motivated Felix to finish his oratorio , " St. Paul , " which had been one of his father 's dying requests .
From there , he went on to compose important and popular works , including the " Wedding March " ( though he probably would n't appreciate those cheesy " here comes the bride " lyrics ) .
In 1843 , at age 34 , Mendelssohn founded the Conservatory of Music in Leipzig , where he taught composition with fellow musical great Robert Schumann .
MARIE CURIE ( 1867 -1934 )
Areas of expertise : Physics , chemistry and radioactivity
Notable achievement :
The first woman to win a Nobel Prize ; and just for good measure , she won two
Secret to her success :
Wanted to be in her element , so she discovered it
Born in Warsaw , Poland , Marie Sklodowska was the child of two teachers who placed great importance on education for all of their children .
This was n't a problem for four - year - old Marie , who , just by hanging around her four older siblings , taught herself how to read ( Russian and French ) and was known to help her brothers and sisters with their math homework .
It was also at age four that she began to freak people out with her incredible memory , as she was able to recall events that had happened years before ( " Remember that time when I was three months old and you put my diaper on backwards , idiot ? " )
As a teenager , Marie was anxious to attend college , but her family could n't afford it since her father had lost his teaching job , so she spent five grueling years earning money as a governess ( it was n't like " The Sound of Music " at all ; the kids were stupid , and there was no singing or dancing ) .
But her time came in 1891 , and she headed for the Sorbonne in Paris .
There , she discovered future husband Pierre Curie , along with the radioactive elements radium and polonium .
In her thirties , Marie worked closely with her husband , and together they devised the science of radioactivity , for which they were awarded a Nobel Prize in physics .
After Pierre 's death in 1906 , Marie continued her work , winning her second Nobel ( this time in chemistry ) at age 44 .
PABLO PICASSO ( 1881 - 1973 )
Areas of expertise : Painting , drawing , sculpture
Notable achievement :
The most famous name in modern art
Secret to his success : Quantity and quality
Everyone knows that Picasso achieved artistic fame and success as an adult , but little Pablo was quite the prodigy , too .
In fact , it 's said that Picasso had an interest in drawing even before he could speak .
Perhaps that 's why , once he finally could talk , he immediately started demanding that his father ( an artist himself ) give him his paintbrushes .
And when he became old enough to go to school , pushy little Pablo said he would only go on the condition that , while there , he could draw as much as he liked .
Fortunately , the headmaster and the other students recognized Picasso's gift , and more or less allowed him to come , go and work as he pleased .
Years later , the adult Picasso attended an exhibit of children 's drawings and commented that he could never have been in such a show because at age 12 , he " drew like Raphael . "
A little modesty might have done him some good , but in fact , drawings that survive from his childhood suggest that prepubescent Pablo could indeed have given the great Renaissance artist a run for his money .
Picasso's many contributions to modern art -- including cubism , " Guernica , " and people drawn with two eyes on one side of their face -- are too exhaustive to list here .
By the time of his death , he 'd created over 22,000 works of art .
JEAN PIAGET ( 1896 -1980 )
Area of expertise : Child psychology
Notable achievement : Changing the way we think about the way children think
Secret to his success :
The ability to hold conversations with three - year - olds
Does it take a child who 's interested in psychology to make a child psychologist ?
Apparently not .
When Jean Piaget was growing up in Neuchâtel , Switzerland , his area of expertise was zoology .
He talked his way into a job at the local Museum of Natural History at the age of 10 , where he developed a keen interest in mollusks ( especially snails ) .
By high school , he 'd published so many papers on the subject that his name was well known among European mollusk experts ( most of whom assumed he was an adult ) .
So later in life , when his interests turned to psychology , Piaget 's zoological background led him to seek out the " biological explanation of knowledge . "
Suspecting that observing children might lead to an answer , he came up with an earth - shattering new way to explore how children think : by watching them , listening to them and talking to them .
Piaget deduced that a child 's mind is n't a blank slate , but is constantly imagining and testing new theories about the world and how it works .
This revelation , plus his 75 years of scientific research , spawned whole new fields of psychology .
He might even have had an explanation for why your kid put that peanut butter - and - jelly sandwich in the VCR .
JASCHA HEIFETZ ( 1901 - 1987 )
Area of expertise : Violin maestro
Notable achievement : Setting the standard for 20th - century violinists
Secret to his success :
When he played the violin , it made his teachers cry ( in a good way )
Little Jascha 's interest in music was noticeable at only eight months of age , when he reportedly smiled at his father 's violin playing , but winced in pain whenever Dad hit the wrong note .
When Jascha turned three , he asked for -- and received -- his first violin and promptly started taking lessons .
So naturally , Heifetz was giving public concerts by the age of five ( about the same time the rest of us started eating paste ) .
At age 16 , Jascha 's family moved to the Unites States to dodge the Russian Revolution , and before long , he had his debut at Carnegie Hall , where he wowed critics and became an overnight musical idol .
Musical burn - out seemed almost inevitable , but Heifetz continued touring into his sixties and kept recording into his seventies ( take that , Keith Richards ) , racking up Grammy after Grammy without releasing a single music video .
Heifetz once called being a child prodigy " a disease which is generally fatal , " and one that he " was among the few to have good fortune to survive . "
JOHN VON NEUMANN ( 1903 - 1957 )
Areas of expertise : Quantum mechanics , information theory , computer science
Notable achievements : Developing the hydrogen bomb and a few early computers
Secret to his success :
Not too bookish to enjoy a good kegger
As a child in Budapest , Hungary , János von Neumann amazed adults and annoyed fellow six - year olds by dividing eight - digit numbers in his head , speaking in Greek and memorizing pages out of the phone book .
He published his first scientific paper while still a teenager , but because of Hungary 's rising anti-Semitic atmosphere , he decided to pursue his mathematics career elsewhere .
Unfortunately , he chose to go to Germany , which clearly did n't turn out to be such a hot idea .
After he was offered a position at Princeton University , von Neumann headed to the States , choosing to adopt the first name John .
In America , he was free to hang around with other expatriate eggheads , including future magazine cover model Albert Einstein .
In between throwing raucous parties , ogling secretaries and getting into car accidents ( he was a notoriously reckless driver ) , von Neumann worked on theoretical mathematics and various real - world projects , including the development of the hydrogen bomb and construction of one of the first working computers .
PAUL ERDOS ( 1913 - 1996 )
Area of expertise : Mathematics
Notable achievements :
It would take a mathematician to explain them
Secret to his success : Loved numbers , tolerated everything else
Paul Erdös was multiplying three - digit numbers for kicks when he was three .
At age four , he started playing around with prime and negative numbers .
Not much later , he developed a cute little habit of asking people their ages and then computing how many seconds they 'd been alive .
Never able to shake his passion for numbers , Erdös grew up to become arguably the most prolific mathematician in history , authoring or co-authoring almost 1,500 mathematical papers .
In fact , collaborating with Erdös was such a point of prestige that -- to this day -- mathematicians assign themselves " Erdös numbers , " which works sort of like the fabled Kevin Bacon game .
An Erdös number indicates how closely a person has worked with the great one :
Those who co-authored a paper with him have a number of 1 , those who wrote a paper with one of his co-authors have a number of 2 , and so on .
Never had the pleasure of writing a mathematics paper ?
Congratulations , you have an Erdös number of infinity .
Now go balance your checkbook .
MIDORI ( b. 1971 )
Area of expertise : Violin virtuoso
Notable achievement :
Set the standard for violin performance in the 21st century ?
( Check back in 96 years )
Secret to her success : Time off
Japan native Midori was given her first violin at age four , and instead of chewing on it , she started taking lessons .
She gave her first public performance when she was seven , and by the time she was 11 , her playing had so impressed New York Philharmonic director Zubin Mehta that he invited her to come to the States and solo with his orchestra .
She accepted , and her debut with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra earned her a standing ovation .
Midori spent the next decade performing with the world 's leading orchestras on the major concert stages .
In her twenties , she took a bit of a break from performing , but that was hardly an indication of her declining career .
She founded a nonprofit foundation to bring music education to underprivileged children .
She also enrolled in New York University and earned a bachelors degree in psychology , which no doubt comes in handy when coping with overbearing orchestra conductors and schizophrenic bassoon players .
Music is still the focal point of her life , however .
She spent much of the winter of 2004 touring America and Europe .

Game maker Electronic
Arts today publicly announced that Madden NFL 09 will be released in North America on Tuesday , August 12 , with a 20th Anniversary Collector 's Edition also in the mix .
The most important aspect of the Collector 's Edition is that it will come bundled with NFL Head Coach 09 , which was originally supposed to be a stand - alone title .
In fact , the game also had a full - fledged development team working on it , but EA decided to bundle it in the Collector 's Edition rather than market a two - title bundle with a $ 30 higher price tag .
The 20th Anniversary Collector 's Edition will include Madden NFL 09 , additional Madden NFL gameplay , and access to additional bonus videos otherwise unavailable to gamers .

Gamers who purchase the Collector 's Edition will be able to create custom plays in NFL Head Coach 09 and transfer the plays to their playbooks for use in Madden NFL 09 .
EA 's 20th Anniversary Collector 's Edition will cost $ 89.99 , and will be available for the Microsoft Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation 3 game consoles .
The regular Madden NFL 09 will also be available for the Sony PlayStation 2 , Nintendo Wii and DS , and the Sony PlayStation Portable .
Both game titles are being developed by the EA Tiburon studio , located in Orlando , Florida .
WASHINGTON , Oct. 17  Leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee reached a tentative agreement on Wednesday with the Bush administration that would give telephone carriers legal immunity for any role they played in the National Security Agency ’s domestic eavesdropping program approved by President Bush after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks , a Congressional official said Wednesday .
Senators this week began reviewing classified documents related to the participation of the telephone carriers in the security agency program and came away from that early review convinced that the companies had “ acted in good faith ” in cooperating with what they believed was a legal and presidentially authorized program and that they should not be punished through civil litigation for their roles , the official said .
As part of legislation on the security agency ’s wiretapping authorities , the White House has been pushing hard for weeks to get immunity for the telecommunications companies in discussions with Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia , the Democratic chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , and Senator Christopher S. Bond of Missouri , the ranking Republican .
A tentative deal was first reported by The Washington Post .
The Intelligence Committee will begin reviewing the legislation at a closed session on Thursday .
The agreement between the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Bush administration would also include a greater role for the secret intelligence court in overseeing and approving methods of wiretapping used by the security agency , the official said .

" Anyone who claims this has refuted Islam and should be tried in order to take it back .
If not , he should be killed as an apostate from the religion of Islam , " said the fatwa , or religious opinion , dated March 14 and published on Barrak 's Web site .
" It is disgraceful that articles containing this kind of apostasy should be published in some papers of Saudi Arabia , the land of the two holy shrines , " he said , referring to Muslim holy places in Mecca and Medina .
" The rulers should hold these papers to account ... and all those who took part in the publication should know they were involved in the sin of heretical articles . "
Barrak , who is thought to be around 75 , is viewed by Islamists as the leading independent authority of Saudi Arabia 's hardline version of Sunni Islam , often termed Wahhabism .
He said the articles suggested Muslims were free to follow other religions .
Rights groups have accused Wahhabism of a xenophobic attitude which demonises other religions .
Abdullah bin Bejad al - Otaibi , one of the two writers , said he feared for his life and called on the government to intervene .
The second writer was Yousef Aba al - Khail .
" My articles have been met with fatwas before but it never got to this level of directly inciting murder or directly accusing someone of no longer being a Muslim , " he told Reuters .
" If this is allowed to pass , this country will be transformed into an arena of bloodshed .
It will be chaos . "
Saudi Arabia regularly executes drug traffickers , rapists and murderers , but it is rare for calls to be made to put people to death for opinions expressed in public .
Liberal reformers are engaged in a battle with religious hardliners over the direction of the country , a key U.S. ally and the world 's biggest oil exporter .
Diplomats say powerful clerics allied to some key members of the Saudi royal family have prevented the government under King Abdullah from moving forward with social and political reforms .

Eric H. points to the question of why burglaries have declined steadily , when other crime rates have been more volatile .
Here is one bit :
Criminologists have a lot of theories why burglaries are so different …
" If you ’re going to do a burglary , you need to have some buyers , " Mathis says .
" Everybody has everything now . "
Mathis says there ’s just too much on the street already .
Everyone he knows already has a digital camera , iPod knockoffs and pirated DVDs shipped in from China .
" And if it ’s not new , a lot of people do n’t even want to fool with it , " Mathis says .
Forget about last year ’s video games and old laptops , Mathis says .
And do n’t even bring a VCR or boxy TV to the street .
" You can get a TV for nothing almost , " he says .
" People are giving them away now . "
In other words , we have fewer burglaries because of low wages in China .
You ’ll note that the standard Baumol - Bowen model of the cost - disease predicts an ongoing decline in burglaries .
Goods become cheaper over time , and thus not worth stealing , while services grow more expensive over time .
It is usually harder to steal services so burglary rates should fall .
The article also cites the decline of heavy drug use , better locks and deadbolts , and more widespread use of locks , plus less cash left around the house .
Some experts cite greater neighborhood vigilance .
Note that robberies are not falling in similar fashion , which suggests that criminals prefer to get the victim away from home turf advantage .
Here is further information .
British burglary is falling too .
In the first two Effective Concurrency columns " The Pillars of Concurrency " ( DDJ , August 2007 ) and " How Much Scalability Do You Have or Need ? " ( DDJ , September 2007 ) we saw the three pillars of concurrency and what kinds of concurrency they express :
Pillar 1 : Isolation via asynchronous agents .
This is all about doing work asynchronously to gain isolation and responsiveness , using techniques like messaging .
Some Pillar 1 techniques , such as pipelining , also enable limited scalability , but this category principally targets isolation and responsiveness .
Pillar 2 : Scalability via concurrent collections .
This is all about reenabling the free lunch of being able to ship applications that get faster on machines with more cores , using more cores to get the answer faster by exploiting parallelism in algorithms and data .
Pillar 3 : Consistency via safely shared resources .
While doing all of the above , we need to avoid races and deadlocks when using shared objects in memory or any other shared resources .
My last few columns have focused on Pillar 3 , and I 've referred to lock levels or lock hierarchies as a way to control deadlock .
A number of readers have asked me to explain what those are and how they work , so I 'll write one more column about Pillar 3 ( for now ) .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Bank of America Corp said it has agreed to pay $ 28 million to Countrywide Financial Corp Chief Operating Officer David Sambol to induce him to run the merged companies ’ consumer mortgage operations .

The amount , which vests over three years , is 37 percent higher than the $ 20.4 million that Bank of America Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis was compensated in 2007 to run the second - largest U.S. bank .
Bank of America disclosed the amount in a Thursday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
Sambol , who is also Countrywide ’s president , was named in January to run the mortgage business after Charlotte , North Carolina - based Bank of America completes its purchase of the largest U.S. mortgage lender .
That transaction was valued Thursday at about $ 4.1 billion .
According to the filing , Sambol would be entitled to a $ 20 million retention bonus payable in equal installments on the first and second anniversaries of the merger , which is expected to close in the third quarter .
Sambol would also receive $ 8 million of restricted stock , vesting in three installments on the first , second and third anniversaries of the merger , the filing shows .
Awards replace cash severance payments to which Sambol would be entitled at Calabasas , California - based Countrywide , according to the filing .
Sambol would also be entitled at Bank of America to a $ 500,000 annual base salary , an annual incentive award targeted at $ 4 million , and an annual equity award targeted at 150,000 Bank of America options .
Bank of America was not immediately available for comment .
The U.S. Federal Reserve plans to hold public hearings on April 22 in Chicago and on April 28 and 29 in Los Angeles on the Countrywide takeover .
The combined company would make about one in four U.S. home loans .
Some consumer groups have criticized Bank of America for not doing more to help troubled borrowers .
Consumer groups , borrowers , lawyers and politicians have faulted Countrywide for lending excesses they say fueled the nation ’s housing crisis .
Sambol has also received criticism over his role at Countrywide .
Lewis , however , has praised Countrywide for its management expertise .
Bank of America agreed to issue 0.1822 of a share for each Countrywide share .
The merger values Countrywide at about $ 7.04 per share , based on Bank of America ’s Thursday closing price of $ 38.64 .
Countrywide shares closed Thursday at $ 5.88 .
Blood transfusions are actually among the least invasive medical procedures performed on fetuses .
More intrusive is endoscopic fetal surgery , in which surgeons manipulate a joystick - like instrument while watching the fetus on an ultrasound screen .
Most invasive of all is open fetal surgery , in which a pregnant woman ’s uterus is cut open and the fetus exposed .
Ray Paschall , an anesthesiologist at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville , remembers one of the first times he provided anesthesia to the mother and minimally to the fetus in an open fetal operation , more than 10 years ago .
When the surgeon lowered his scalpel to the 25 - week - old fetus , Paschall saw the tiny figure recoil in what looked to him like pain .
A few months later , he watched another fetus , this one 23 weeks old , flinch at the touch of the instrument .
That was enough for Paschall .
In consultation with the hospital ’s pediatric pain specialist , “ I tremendously upped the dose of anesthetic to make sure that would n’t happen again , ” he says .
In the more than 200 operations he has assisted in since then , not a single fetus has drawn back from the knife .
“ I do n’t care how primitive the reaction is , it ’s still a human reaction , ” Paschall says .
“ And I do n’t believe it ’s right .
I do n’t want them to feel pain . ”
But whether pain is being felt is open to question .
Mark Rosen was the anesthesiologist at the very first open fetal operation , performed in 1981 at the University of California , San Francisco , Medical Center , and the fetal anesthesia protocols he pioneered are now followed by his peers all over the world .
Indeed , Rosen may have done more to prevent fetal pain than anyone else alive  except that he does n’t believe that fetal pain exists .
Research has persuaded him that before a point relatively late in pregnancy , the fetus is unable to perceive pain .
Rosen provides anesthesia for a number of other important reasons , he explains , including rendering the pregnant woman unconscious and preventing her uterus from contracting and setting off dangerous bleeding or early labor .
Another purpose of anesthesia is to immobilize the fetus during surgery , and indeed , the drugs Rosen supplies to the pregnant woman do cross the placenta to reach the fetus .
Relief of fetal pain , however , is not among his objectives .
“ I have every reason to want to believe that the fetus feels pain , that I ’ve been treating pain all these years , ” says Rosen , who is intense and a bit prickly .
“ But if you look at the evidence , it ’s hard to conclude that that ’s true . ”

Rosen ’s own hard look at the evidence came a few years ago , when he and a handful of other doctors at U.C.S.F. pulled together more than 2,000 articles from medical journals , weighing the accumulated evidence for and against fetal pain .
They published the results in The Journal of the American Medical Association in 2005 .
“ Pain perception probably does not function before the third trimester , ” concluded Rosen , the review ’s senior author .
The capacity to feel pain , he proposed , emerges around 29 to 30 weeks gestational age , or about two and a half months before a full - term baby is born .
Before that time , he asserted , the fetus ’s higher pain pathways are not yet fully developed and functional .
What about a fetus that draws back at the touch of a scalpel ?
Rosen says that , at least early on , this movement is a reflex , like a leg that jerks when tapped by a doctor ’s rubber mallet .
Likewise , the release of stress hormones does n’t necessarily indicate the experience of pain ; stress hormones are also elevated , for example , in the bodies of brain - dead patients during organ harvesting .
In order for pain to be felt , he maintains , the pain signal must be able to travel from receptors located all over the body , to the spinal cord , up through the brain ’s thalamus and finally into the cerebral cortex .
The last leap to the cortex is crucial , because this wrinkly top layer of the brain is believed to be the organ of consciousness , the generator of awareness of ourselves and things not ourselves ( like a surgeon ’s knife ) .
Before nerve fibers extending from the thalamus have penetrated the cortex  connections that are not made until the beginning of the third trimester  there can be no consciousness and therefore no experience of pain .
Sunny
Anand reacted strongly , even angrily , to the article ’s conclusions .
Rosen and his colleagues have “ stuck their hands into a hornet ’s nest , ” Anand said at the time .
“ This is going to inflame a lot of scientists who are very , very concerned and are far more knowledgeable in this area than the authors appear to be .
This is not the last word  definitely not . ”
Anand acknowledges that the cerebral cortex is not fully developed in the fetus until late in gestation .
What is up and running , he points out , is a structure called the subplate zone , which some scientists believe may be capable of processing pain signals .
A kind of holding station for developing nerve cells , which eventually melds into the mature brain , the subplate zone becomes operational at about 17 weeks .
The fetus ’s undeveloped state , in other words , may not preclude it from feeling pain .
In fact , its immature physiology may well make it more sensitive to pain , not less : the body ’s mechanisms for inhibiting pain and making it more bearable do not become active until after birth .
Former state Rep. Michael Garcia , who resigned Friday amid allegations that he exposed himself and made lewd comments to a female lobbyist , termed the Jan. 7 incident “ consensual ” in a statement released Friday afternoon .
“ Initial press reports are highly inaccurate regarding my alleged conduct .
The other party and I engaged in consensual conduct that was inappropriate , given my position in the legislature and the fact that the other party is a lobbyist , ” Garcia said in a statement .
The Aurora Democrat , who had been House Assistant Majority Leader , referred reporters to his attorney .
House Speaker Andrew Romanoff ’s office announced Garcia ’s resignation shortly before 9 a.m .
The lobbyist , who spoke to The Denver Post on Thursday on condition of anonymity , said Garcia exposed himself to her last month and said , “ Would n’t this be real nice inside of you ? ”
The woman said she decided to bring the issue to Romanoff ’s attention after four other female lobbyists told her of similar encounters with Garcia stretching back seven years .
The woman said she and Garcia were playing pool at the Lancer Lounge in Denver with a group of lobbyists after a fundraiser for Garcia on Jan .
7 .
He exposed himself when the rest of the group had left that side of the bar , she said .
“ He just walked around the pool table and unzipped his pants and pulled everything out , ” she said .
She has not filed criminal charges .
The lobbyist said her attorney met with Romanoff ’s office this week .
Romanoff said he could not confirm any meeting and could not comment on the matter because House rules prohibit him from discussing a sexual harassment complaint or even acknowledging whether one was filed .
“ We have acted as swiftly and as responsibly as possible , ” Romanoff said .
The female lobbyist who made the allegations against Garcia said Friday she was relieved by his resignation .
“ I just want to leave it as is , ” the lobbyist said .
“ The House took this issue very seriously .
I commend House Speaker Romanoff for his actions . ”
House minority leader Mike May called Garcia ’s resignation a “ sad ending to a great legislative career . ”
May said he spoke with Romanoff late Thursday about the matter .
And while he said he has no reason to believe House leadership protected Garcia , May said he wants to examine the House ’s rules to make sure they are adequate to deal with such situations .
“ We do need to protect those who are victims , and our rules should do that , ” May said .
“ But the rules also should n’t protect a public official beyond normal . ”
Garcia ’s name was not called out at the House roll call this morning , and his name had been taped over on the board that shows how representatives had voted .
His brief resignation letter was read on the House floor this morning .
“ Mr. Speaker , I hereby submit my resignation from the Colorado House of Representatives , ” it read .
In his statement released this afternoon through a law firm , Garcia continued : “ The interests of the state are greater than my own .
As a result , I have made the difficult decision to resign .
I apologize for any hardship this has caused my constituents , friends , family and colleagues . ”
Iris Eytan , an attorney for Reilly , Pozner and Connelly , the firm that released the statement from Garcia , said she could not go into what specifically happened at the bar but said the lawmaker had not “ acted suddenly and immorally . ”
“ What he is saying is something occurred between these two people , and whatever it was , was consensual , ” Eytan said .
“ He respects her privacy .
He does n’t believe it ’s fair to air their private issues in public . ”
Garcia , 34 , worked as coordinator for the Youth Council for Public Policy at the University of Colorado at Boulder until the end of the first semester , a school official said .
Garcia was first elected to the House in 2000 and has been re-elected three times .
April 7 , 2008  -- ABC's Martha Raddatz asked American soldiers in Iraq what issues are most important to them when looking at the presidential candidates .
Though the military is not supposed to engage in partisan political activity , these soldiers spoke out about their personal endorsements , and their opinions are likely to matter .
In 2004 , 73 percent of the U.S. military voted for a presidential candidate , and officials believe it may be even higher this time around .
PFC Jeremy Slate said he supported Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , because of his stated intention to pull out of Iraq right away .
" That would be nice , " Slate said , " I 'd like to be home , yea . "
SFC Patricia Keller also expressed support for Obama , citing his representation for change .
Spc. Patrick Nicholls from Eggawam , Mass. , pointed out that many soldiers on the frontlines frequently think about their families back home .
" We think about how our families are doing back home .
That 's a major concern , like how the economy is doing , also as well as where we 're going to be in the future .
Because really , truly , what we consider we 're doing , we 're doing a valuable job , we want to make sure that the efforts we make are appreciated . "
He suggested he was too engaged in Iraq to keep up with politics back home .
" I have n't really been following it too much since we 've been over here , ma'am , " he told Raddatz .
" So , do n't really know which issues are too important to me right now .
... I do n't know who 's running , ma'am . "
Lt. Leah Wicks said that , tied into concerns about her family 's welfare , were concerns about the economy , " where we 're going to be in the future . "
Only moments before speaking with ABC News , the troops had been listening to Vice President Dick Cheney give a rousing speech , but it did n't change their political preference .
Spc. Imus Loto said he supported Obama .
" It will be something different .
But he 's out there and he 'll probably support us a lot more . "
By support , Loto meant pulling out troops .
" Pull me out , too . " he said .
Though the military is generally a more conservative group , soldiers like Sgt. Justin Sarbaum are just as eager for a pull - out as the Democratic candidates .
Sarbaum said he wondered which presidential candidate would be able to better the U.S. relationship with rogue nations , such as Iran , so that soldiers are not sent off to another war .
" Iran is obviously a big issue , " Sarbaum said , " Here in Iraq for my third time ; starting another war right now — is it really necessary ? "
Sgt. Cory Messingham from Lewisville , Texas , said he was n't following the race , but he was concerned about candidates ' paying attention to the emotional toll that the war has taken on soldiers .
" My biggest issue is support for the military , military funding and our deployments , not having long deployments anymore .
Because [ the ] majority of us are doing ... 15 - month deployments .
So , it 's tough on the soldiers and tough on the soldiers ' families .
Those are really my biggest issues . "
1st Sgt. David Logan said , " I am leaning toward Hillary .
I think that we should have a gradual drawdown . "
Though the soldiers have been living in Iraq , they listen closely to the candidates on issues far beyond the wars they are fighting .
" Education back in the states is one of my main concerns , " Spc. Matthew Durkin said .
Economy and environment were on Staff Sgt. Derek Dion 's mind .
" Things like gas prices , and look at the environment and what we 're going to leave our children . "
Spc. Joseph Lindsesdt , who is from Alaska , said he was watching for consistency of the candidates ' views .
" The steadiness of the candidate , whether they 've changed their views , constantly , over time , or with political wind , as I like to put it . "
To that end , Lindsesdt 's pick is Obama .
" The fact that he 's followed his views , regardless of what they have been [ sic ] and whether I 've agreed with them or not , sometimes .
But he 's been steady the entire way . "
When asked if he was concerned about criticism that Obama had less political experience than some of the other candidates , the battle - weary soldier replied , " No , I think being a decent leader does n't have to do anything with experience much . "
JUNG HWA SONG contributed to this report .
Senate Democrats defeated Monday a Republican attempt to ram through a bill that expands the government 's warrantless spying powers and give retroactive legal immunity to telecoms that aided the President 's secret warrantless wiretapping program .
The attempt by the Republicans to prohibit amendments to the bill and limit debate time failed to gather enough votes and failed with 48 yes votes and 45 against it .
They needed 60 yes votes to limit the debate ..
Senate Democrats want instead to pass a bill temporarily extending powers given to the nation 's spies this summer , in order to have more time to debate and work out a compromise with the House , whose version does not include immunity .
President Bush and Senate Republicans oppose any temporary extension , saying that Congress has had plenty of time in the last 6 months to pass a bill and that the bill under consideration satisfies both the president and the intelligence community .
Today 's defeat sets the stage for President Bush to blast Democrats in tonight 's State of the Union speech and makes it nearly inevitable that some sort of extension will be passed and signed into law this week .
Failure to do so would not prevent the nation 's spies from tracking foreign threats , but would remove their power to unilaterally order American - based phone and internet companies to install wiretaps .
Instead , they will have to ask a court to issued an order , as has been the case for the last 30 years .
The restriction would apply only to wiretaps physically located inside the United States .
Under any outcome , the government is free to wiretap outside the country in any means it likes or can pull off without court oversight , so long as they are not targeting Americans inside the United States .
The Senate immediately moved to vote on whether to take up a 30 - day extension , but Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R- Kentucky ) urged Republicans to vote against it .
That motion also failed to gather the necessary sixtie votes by the same margin of 48 votes against it and 45 for it ( the former all Republican , the latter mostly Democratic ) , though the Senate will almost certainly pass some sort of extension later this week .
The Senate is now in recess until this evening when President Bush will give the State of the Union speech and will plans to return to the spying bill late Tuesday morning .
UPDATE : The House , which is going to hold some sort of retreat in the coming days , is scheduled to vote on a 30 - day extension of the current powers tomorrow morning .
Much will depend , THREAT LEVEL thinks , on tonight 's State of the Union .
Check back later this evening for our take on the speech .

Over the years , the frugal 76 - year - old has made a fetish out of anonymity .
He declined to name his foundation , Atlantic Philanthropies , after himself , registering the $ 8 - billion behemoth in Bermuda to avoid U.S. disclosure laws .
He lavishes hundreds of millions of dollars on universities and hospitals but wo n’t allow even a small plaque identifying him as a donor .
“ We just did n’t want to be blowing our horn , ” he explains in a rare interview at his daughter ’s Upper East Side apartment .
The party was to celebrate a biography of the elusive tycoon by Irish journalist Conor O’Clery , titled “ The Billionaire Who Was n’t : How Chuck Feeney Secretly Made and Gave Away a Fortune , ” published last fall .
Feeney said he cooperated with the book and submitted to an interview because he is driven by a new public mission : nudging hedge fund heavies and silicon scions into “ giving while living . ”

It is the latest trend in philanthropy and one that he , more than anyone , jump - started several years before billionaires like Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett followed suit .
Feeney , a founder of the conglomerate Duty Free Shoppers , said he wants to “ set an example ” to address “ that layer up there of people , ” the ones , as he puts it , who have “ a jillion dollars .
. . .
I mean , honestly , if you ask them , ‘ Tell me what you ’re doing with your money this week ? ’ they could n’t spend a fraction of what they ’re accruing . ”
Most foundations , set up after the donor ’s death , dribble out barely more than 5 % of their assets each year , the legal minimum .
But Feeney , raised in a blue - collar Irish Catholic family in New Jersey , quietly transferred the bulk of his fortune to his foundation when he was 53 .
Then , eight years ago , he instructed his board to pay out every last dollar by 2016 .

So far : $ 4 billion down , $ 4 billion to go .
Atlantic Philanthropies is spreading its wealth at the rate of more than $ 400 million a year , more than any U.S. - based family foundation apart from Bill & Melinda Gates and Ford .
As Feeney sees it , there is too much misery in the world to justify delay .
“ I ’m not going to die until I can spend it , ” he vows with a merry chuckle .
Feeney ’s biggest beneficiary has been Cornell University , which he attended on the GI Bill , earning spending money by selling sandwiches to fraternities .
Over four decades , he has donated an astonishing $ 588 million to the Ithaca , N.Y. , campus , almost all of it anonymously .
Many of Feeney ’s grants are still directed to traditional bricks and mortar -- $ 60 million for a Stanford biomedical center and $ 125 million for a UC San Francisco cardiovascular complex .

But others are iconoclastic : Fighting homophobia among South African Muslims .
Lobbying against the death penalty in New Jersey .
Buying medical supplies for Cuban - trained doctors .
Funding a Washington office for Sinn Fein during the Irish peace negotiations .
Feeney built his global enterprise through cutthroat competition and uncanny business intuition .
He speaks fluent French and Japanese .
And he still hop - scotches from Dublin to Da Nang seeding new projects .
But his demeanor is affable and unprepossessing and his conversational style is hesitant .
He is allergic to introspection .
Direct questions send him into vague digressions leavened with humorous asides .
In the tiny world of stratospheric wealth , Feeney is a man of yin and yang : extravagant charity coupled with personal penny - pinching .
“ It ’s the intelligent thing to be frugal , ” says the erstwhile billionaire , who jokingly refers to himself as “ the shabby philanthropist . ”

He once owned six luxurious homes from the French Riviera to Mayfair to Park Avenue .
These days , he owns none , instead hunkering down in a cramped one - bedroom rental in San Francisco with his second wife , Helga , his former secretary .
He raked in billions selling duty - free cognac , perfume and designer labels .
But you wo n’t catch Feeney in a Hermes tie or Gucci loafers .
He once met the prime minister of Ireland with his drugstore glasses held together by a paper clip .
Feeney does n’t own a car and prefers buses to taxis .
Until he turned 75 , he flew coach .
Now , making excuses for wobbly knees , he upgrades with frequent flier miles .

“ I get as much satisfaction out of paying $ 25 .
I happen to enjoy grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches . ”

Niall O’Dowd , a friend of Feeney and editor of Irish - America magazine , reflects : “ The way he copes with his wealth is to never remove himself from his working - class persona .
He keeps grounded by acting like it has n’t happened to him -- like basically he is still the same guy . ”
At the book party , most of the guests were bused in from the Garden State : former classmates from St. Mary ’s of the Assumption High School and an extended clan of Feeney - Fitzpatricks , including two of his five children .
Feeney joked about his “ rent - a- crowd ” but , amid the toasts and roasts , seemed moved : “ Who was it who said , ‘ My cup runneth over ? ’ ”
He planted a kiss on the head of his 21 - year old great - nephew , Dennis Fitzpatrick , who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair .
He autographed copies of the book while seated at a small table with Dennis by his side .

“ He ’d send my parents $ 50,000 for our college educations , ” nephew Daniel Fitzpatrick , 50 , recalled .
“ But if you went out to have a beer with him , he ’d check the bar bill .
. . .
If I left the light on in a bedroom , he ’d say , ‘ By the way , you left a light on . ’
And I knew I ’d better go up and turn it off . ”
O’Clery , former international business editor of the Irish Times , spent two years traveling with Feeney and investigating a financial empire that had been sheathed for decades in obsessive secrecy .
He unfolds a story of ferocious entrepreneurship that operated , he concluded , “ on the edge of legality but was never corrupt . ”
Shortly after graduating from college , Feeney , who had served in the U.S. Air Force in Japan during the Korean War , moved to Europe .
With a partner he knew from Cornell , Robert Miller , he began peddling duty - free liquor to sailors .
The two went on to sell cars to American soldiers based in Europe and Asia .
Eventually , profiting from a postwar boom in tourism , they built Duty Free Shoppers into the biggest retailer of liquor and cigarettes in the world and a global purveyor of luxury goods .

Their ingenious schemes stretched the limits of the duty - free concept .
As O’Clery explains , Duty Free Shoppers allowed a tourist in Mexico , for instance , to peruse a catalog and choose a cashmere sweater to be shipped from Amsterdam to his home in the U.S. Leaving Mexico , he could declare the faraway sweater as “ unaccompanied baggage ” and avoid paying duty .
Feeney and Miller operated with Swiss bank accounts and offshore headquarters in Lichtenstein , Monaco and the Netherlands Antilles .
They registered assets in the names of Danielle , Feeney ’s French wife , and Miller ’s Ecuadorean wife , Chantal , as a precaution against the long arm of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service .
Today , Feeney makes no apologies .
“ Most large companies structure their affairs so that they minimize their tax payments , ” he says , rocking back on an armchair in his daughter ’s apartment .
“ As long as you do it within the law , it ’s OK . ”
For Duty Free Shoppers , publicity was to be avoided at all cost , to ward off not just tax collectors but also competitors .
“ If you had a machine to make money , you would n’t blow your horn and say copy me , copy me , ” says Feeney , whose annual share of dividends from the business reached $ 155 million in 1988 , making him richer at the time than Rupert Murdoch , David Rockefeller or Donald Trump .

Why did he decide to give it away , leaving himself with a net worth then that dipped below $ 1 million ?
“ I ’m an easygoing guy , ” he shrugs .
“ I like to eat my grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches quietly .
I do n’t like people to say , ‘ Look over there ; he ’s eating a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich . ’ ”
In 1990 , Feeney had separated from Danielle .
And , in the divorce , she retained their mansions and luxury apartments , along with $ 100 million .
“ The wealth got to him , ” recalls his nephew , Fitzpatrick .
“ He got disgusted by it , in my opinion .
He said , ‘ This expensive heavy - duty lifestyle does n’t fit me . ’ ”
Feeney gave his children , friends and colleagues copies of Andrew Carnegie ’s 1889 essay “ The Gospel of Wealth , ” in which the robber baron - turned - philanthropist admonishes rich men to use their fortunes to help others and “ to set an example of modest unostentatious living , shunning display . ”

In the realm of modesty , Feeney tended to extremes .
For years , Atlantic Philanthropies staff could n’t tell their families where they worked .
Beneficiaries , few of whom knew the origin of their grants , signed agreements acknowledging that the funding would halt if its source were revealed .
It was only in 1997 that the existence of Atlantic Philanthropies became public during the sale of Duty Free Shoppers to French luxury goods magnate Bernard Arnault .
Advertisement
Court papers revealed that Feeney ’s share of the company had been transferred to a foundation .
The news that a huge donor had surfaced -- bigger than renowned charitable institutions founded by the Pew , Lilly , MacArthur , Rockefeller and Mellon families -- rocked the philanthropic world , although many had long suspected something was afoot .
Today , though Atlantic Philanthropies lists its grants on its website , it still wo n’t issue news releases touting accomplishments .
Black tie thank - you dinners , along with plaques , remain verboten .
Feeney ’s practical reason for not plastering his moniker on buildings is to attract matching donors who would want naming rights -- as was the case at Stanford with high - tech tycoon Jim Clark and at a UC San Francisco cancer facility with venture capitalist Arthur Rock .
Does Feeney have no ego , then ?
“ It does n’t matter who put the building up , ” he says .
“ The important thing is that it happens . ”
Advertisement
In Vietnam , he recounts with a chuckle , “ the people at the Da Nang General Hospital felt so bad that we would n’t put our name on the hospital that they painted it green ” -- shamrock green .
He pauses , adding , “ Which used up a lot of paint . ”
Although his parents were American - born , Feeney ’s attachment to the land of his ancestors runs deep .
The Republic of Ireland in the 1980s was plagued by high unemployment , a brain drain and the festering guerrilla war to the north .
Anonymously , Feeney began pouring money into renovating Ireland ’s seven universities , along with two in Northern Ireland .
He offered $ 125 million for postgraduate research if the Irish government would match the amount , nearly 20 times what the Republic was spending a year .
Soon , Ireland ’s best and brightest flocked to the new research institutes .
In all , Atlantic Philanthropies has spent more than $ 1 billion in Ireland .
In 1993 , O’Dowd , who had worked with Feeney to promote U.S. naturalization for Irish immigrants , asked him to join in what would become the Connolly House Group , named after the Belfast headquarters of Sinn Fein , the political arm of the Irish Republican Army .
Advertisement
The small , secret group of Irish Americans offered the newly elected Clinton administration a back - channel to negotiate a cease fire between Britain and the Irish Republican Army .
“ At the time , it was risky business to be seen ‘ talking to terrorists '-- that was the label , ” said former Rep. Bruce Morrison , one of the group .
Feeney was intensely involved in the negotiations that led Clinton to grant a visa to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams , and he funded a Washington office for Sinn Fein to the tune of $ 750,000 .
“ It was New Jersey working class meets Belfast working class , ” O’Dowd recalled of a secret meeting between Feeney and Adams in a Dublin safe house .
“ These two guys understood each other right away . ”
Advertisement
The peace process was ultimately successful , and Feeney has since funneled millions into reconciliation programs in Northern Ireland .
“ The only way you ’re going to solve things with your friends or enemies is to sit down and talk to them , ” he says today .
“ It did n’t seem right to me that Irish people were killing Irish people . ”
On the coffee table in his daughter ’s living room , Feeney opens Bill Clinton ’s recent bestseller “ Giving . ”
He turns to the chapter “ How Much Should You Give and Why ? ” and reads from statistics derived from U.S. income tax data showing that if the top 14,400 taxpayers gave a third of their income , the total would be about $ 61 billion .
Advertisement
Feeney shakes his head .
“ People who would n’t miss it , ” he muses .
“ Sixty - one billion in one year ! ”
And why is n’t it happening ?
“ People traditionally collect money .
I guess there is an attraction to be known as a wealthy person , ” he says .
“ It ’s not my role in life to tell them what they should be doing .
. . .
I ’m just convinced if people gave money to things they ’ve identified as being in the public interest , they ’d get great satisfaction out of it . ”
Feeney mentions one of his favorite charities , Operation Smile , which sponsors surgeons to operate on children with cleft palates in developing countries .
He tells of watching a little girl in a waiting room sitting with her hands covering her mouth .
Advertisement
“ I kept an eye on her , ” he recalls .
“ After she had the operation and she was smiling [ like ] , ‘ It ’s not the ugly me you knew before .
It ’s the new me . ’ ”
On another occasion , he says , a man in a restaurant called him over and said , “ Do you realize you educated me in this business ?
I had one of your scholarships . . . and here I am now , the general manager of this chain . “
O’Clery , who hung out with Feeney for several years at P.J. Clarke ’s , the Manhattan pub , before broaching the topic of a book , attributes Feeney ’s generosity to growing up with charitable parents and in a neighborhood where people helped one another .
He calls his subject an “ enigma .
. . .
He likes to make money , but he does n’t like to have it .
He travels all over the world , but in a way , he ’s never left Elizabeth , N.J. ”
Advertisement
Feeney suggests with a cryptic smile , “ There ’s a thin line between sanity and the other side .
Some people might even say the idea of giving money away is crazy . ”
For those folks , Feeney has a Gaelic proverb : “ There are no pockets in a shroud . ”

Posted on March 18 , 2008 , Jonathan What 's New With the Zerg in Starcraft II ?
Starcraft was probably one of the most popular RTS ’s ever made .
Even now , almost a decade after its release , people the world over are still playing it ( especially in Korea , where it ’s pretty much a sport all its own ) .
How could anyone ever top something like that ?
I do n’t know , but Blizzard ’s certainly up to the task .
In this video , lead producer , Chris Sigaty , explains how the Zerg have evolved in the upcoming sequel .
One thing that ’s sure to cause screams of anguish from your rivals is that all of the Zerg units can now burrow .
Also , the queen has now been changed to a central defensive unit that can essentially add buffs to your units and buildings .
It already looks like gamers everywhere are going to have to come up with new strategies for this one .
Feb. 5 , 2008  -- CIA director Michael Hayden confirmed in an open session of Congress Tuesday his agency 's use of an interrogation technique many consider torture -- a technique at the center of a national debate on the treatment of U.S. detainees in the war on terror and in the war in Iraq .
In acknowledging that CIA officers and contractors used waterboarding on three " high - value " detainees , Hayden revealed information nearly identical to that shared by a former CIA officer last December with ABC News , which prompted the CIA to request a criminal prosecution .
Until Hayden 's comments before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence today , no senior U.S. intelligence official had publicly acknowledged the technique .
Hayden , who prohibited the practice of waterboarding by CIA agents in 2006 , confirmed that his agency waterboarded Khalid Sheik Mohammed , Abu Zubaydah and Abd al - Rahim Nashiri , in efforts to compel the men to talk .
He told senators the agency believed at the time " that additional catastrophic attacks were imminent . "
The men told CIA interrogators things that " led to reliable information , " Hayden told reporters after the hearing .
The CIA chief asserted to reporters later that Mohammed and Zubaydah had provided roughly 25 percent of the information the CIA had on al Qaeda from human sources .
ABC News first disclosed that the men were waterboarded in November 2005 .
On Dec. 10 , 2007 , former CIA officer John Kirakou , who participated in the capture of Abu Zubaydah , appeared on ABC News and discussed his conflicted feelings over the use of the technique .
Kiriakou said waterboarding was effective , and a technique he might use again .
He noted , however , it was also a technique he was uncomfortable with .
Some intelligence officials who reviewed reports based on those interrogations have challenged the idea they provided useful information .
Hayden told lawmakers the agency had not used waterboarding in almost five years , publicly confirming information that was first reported by ABC News last year .
He asked the lawmakers not to create new laws that would limit CIA interrogators .
" One should not expect them to play outside the box because we 've entered a new period of threat or danger to the nation , OK ?
So there 's no wink and nod here , " he said .
" If you create the box , we will play inside the box without exception . "
At the time a presidential finding was signed in 2002 approving the use of harsh interrogation techniques including waterboarding , one of the CIA 's most senior officials registered his objections to the technique , which a senior intelligence official failed to acknowledge today when he stated on the condition of anonymity that the current debate over the use of the technique is troubling to intelligence professionals .
In fact , a number of intelligence professionals , current and former , object to the use of the technique .

Mr Atrocity says :
Last week , like many others , I contributed a satirical take on the Metropolitan Police 's barmy new poster campaign to the boingboing thread on the subject .
I tried to think of the daftest thing I could with which to prove the point that the whole campaign was on the silly side .
I chose beards .
This is my poster : Link
I found a comment on the image this morning from this poor gentleman linking to his story about actually being stopped under the 2000 Terrorism
Act for having , it would seem , a suspicious beard : Link
Once again , the authorities prove themselves madder than anything we can conceive of in jest .
Run to the hills , people .

The next time Bernanke or anyone else says the weak dollar means nothing at home , think again .
Besides contributing to the runaway gas prices , it also means that food staples are even cheaper than before for export markets .
As the economies of India and China increase , they have more cash to buy cheap American corn , wheat , beef , etc and that means competition .
Competition means higher prices .
Add to that the inflated gas prices for corporate farming and transport and you have price increases at the grocery store not seen since the 1970s .
The odds of McCain or Republicans disrupting the system they built stand somewhere between slim and nil .
Rising food prices can be particularly corrosive to consumer confidence because people are so frequently exposed to the cost increases .
“ It ’s the biggest risk we face economically , and it might be the thing that does us in , ” said Rich Yamarone , director of economic research at Argus Research Corp. in New York .
“ There ’s nothing really worse than having a job , making money , and forking most of it over just so you can have the same amount of food .
You ’re running in place , and it really weighs on you . ”
According to Dana Goldstein , " a study from Harvard University last year found that of 168 nations worldwide , the United States is one of only four whose government does n't require employers to provide paid maternity leave . "
That 's shocking stuff , especially considering the way the country spent 2003 - 2006 under the unrestrained rule of the country 's pro-family political party .
It 's almost as if all that talk about religion and children is just a mask for an agenda of ruthless corporate exploitation leavened by the occasional dose of anti-gay hysteria and they do n't really care about American families at all !
One hopes Democrats could get on this case .
One disappointment of Barack Obama 's presidential campaign thus far has been that I would have expected someone with Karen Kornbluh on his team to have something exciting to say about work - family balance issues , but he has n't really distinguished himself on that front at all .

It 's become almost commonplace for Democrats to be outpolling Republicans nationally , such that we almost forget to mention it these days .
On Super Tuesday nearly everywhere there were dueling Democratic and Republican primaries , the Republicans were left in the dust .
In only two states , Utah and Arizona , did the Republican winner yesterday get more votes than the leading Democrat .
And in the former , Barack Obama got more than four times as many votes as presumptive frontrunner John McCain .
It 's nearly the same story when you compare total votes cast in the Republican and Democratic primaries .
Republican candidates attracted more total votes than Democrats only in three states , UT , AZ , and AL .
In fact in Alabama , the combined Republican vote was only very slightly higher than the combined vote in the Democratic primary .
Out of more than a million ballots cast yesterday in the state , the difference between total Republican and Democratic votes was less than 20,000 .
And Barack Obama ended up with 75,000 more votes than Mike Huckabee , the Republican winner .
We 're talking about Alabama here .
Republicans are running on fumes this year .
eat Willcutt 's home on Nicollet Island straddles two worlds .
The front - yard view -- a swath of downtown Minneapolis skyline -- is as urban as it gets .
But the view out back could be a scene from rural Nicollet County : a chicken coop , adorned with vintage farm tools and filled with fowl -- 30 hens , two roosters , a dozen ducks and three geese , to be precise .
Willcutt , a University of Minnesota student who shares chicken chores and eggs with several neighboring households , sees nothing incongruous about poultry farming in the heart of the city .
He 's been raising animals and growing his own veggies since he was a kid in Rice County .
" With chickens , you can harvest food even in the winter , " he said .
On a frigid February afternoon , when most urbanites were snug indoors , Willcutt was out feeding his flock a homemade treat of rice , yogurt , garlic and cat food , tossed with olive oil .
( They also eat commercial feed and kitchen scraps . )
" We do n't throw away food anymore .
We have our own garbage disposal . "
The Nicollet Island flock is large , as residential poultry populations go , but no longer a rarity .
Back - yard chicken coops are hatching in cities and suburbs all over the country , from New York to Seattle , and a growing array of books and websites are offering advice and support .
Willcutt operates a site , www.urbanagrarian.com, takes part in an online forum with 110 local members and teaches " Chickens in the City " classes .
" It 's a great way to meet interesting people who share the same values , " he said .
Melissa Driscoll of Minneapolis , who has raised chickens most of her life , taught a similar class during the 1990s .
" But there 's a lot more interest now , " she said .
Chicken - related questions to the University of Minnesota 's animal science department have surged in recent years , said poultry expert Jacquie Jacob , who now averages one such call each week .
And the number of small - animal permits issued in the city of Minneapolis nearly doubled between 2006 and 2007 , from 31 to 57 , said Tom Doty , manager of field services .
More than three - fourths of the 2007 permits were for fowl , according to Marilyn Fisher , manager of shelter operations .
How did the humble chicken suddenly acquire urban cachet ?
The locally grown food movement is a big factor , said Paula Pentel , an urban studies instructor at the University of Minnesota .
Consumer scares , such as last year 's spinach recall , have raised concerns about long supply chains , she said .
" People are interested in having more control over their food sources . "
That 's why Chelsie Glaubitz , a university student who keeps five hens in the Prospect Park neighborhood , asked for a coop for Christmas two years ago .
She had no agricultural background , but wanted to grow her own food .
" It tastes better , and it 's better for the environment , " she said .
" I have major reservations about industrial agriculture and animal welfare . "
Her housemates do n't share her fervor .
" They think I 'm kind of a hippie , " she said .
" They 'll eat the eggs , and if I 'm gone for a few days , they 'll help , although some of my roommates are more scared of eggs from the back yard than from the grocery store . "
For Chris Magnuson of Robbinsdale , it 's satisfying to cook with eggs laid by her three hens .
" I feel more connected and pride of ownership , " she said .
" When I make pancakes , I love cracking our own chicken eggs . "
Chickens make great pets , according to Driscoll , who keeps three in the Longfellow neighborhood .
" They 're fun to watch , and they 're good for gardening because you get great manure .
The chickens love the compost pile .
It 's kind of a recycling system . "
And some of today 's poultry keepers are " die - hard foodies who want eggs you can't find in the store , " Willcutt said .
" I started keeping ducks because I could n't find duck eggs and I wanted to cook with them .
They have more fat .
They 're particularly good in custards and desserts . "
Ohio investigators are treating a warehouse where 15 electronic voting machines have been quarantined as a crime scene following a report someone may have illegally tampered with them to remove a candidate 's name from the ballot .
Officials from Ohio's Franklin County Board of Elections asked for a forensic analysis of the touch screen machines after Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner reported seeing something she regarded as odd while voting during last November 's election :
A gray bar and the words " candidate withdrawn " appeared where candidate Jay Perez 's name should have been .
Brunner 's husband , who was using a nearby machine at the same time , said Perez was on his ballot .
" This is a huge problem , " Brunner told The Columbus Dispatch .
" There is great concern that not every voter has the same ballot . "
Investigators have already found that last April someone manually disabled a logging feature in Franklin County machines that is designed to help officials track unauthorized changes to the devices .
They also found that many of the machines had n't been tested prior to the November election , according to preliminary results submitted by SysTest Labs , a Colorado quality assurance and testing company .
Ohio has a checkered history with elections .
Two state elections officials were convicted of rigging a 2004 recount after admitting to doing precounts and displaying the evidence while being videotaped .
Last year , a study commissioned by Brunner 's office found state e-voting machines contained critical security failures that could jeopardize the integrity elections .
Brunner alerted the director of the Franklin County Board of Elections of the missing candidate a few days after the election and officials promptly pulled every suspect machine to check the ballots .
Perez 's name was listed on each one .
Officials have also checked ballots and paper tapes , but have also found no evidence to support Brunner 's account .
But she says there are reports from other precincts of voters seeing the same " candidate withdrawn " words on their machines .
Brunner has conceded investigators may never learn what really happened .
Separately , Princeton University Ed Felten said e-voting machine seller Sequoia Voting Systems has threatened him and a fellow researcher if they conduct an investigation into vulnerabilities into devices submitted by the state of New Jersey for testing .
" We will also take appropriate steps to protect against any publication of Sequoia software , its behavior , reports regarding same or any other infringement of our intellectual property , " a Sequoia attorney wrote , Felton reports . ®

Alright , perhaps I ’m biased : Pearl Jam have always bugged the crap out of me .
Back in the grunge era ( do I capitalize that ? ) , I was a fan of almost all of the Seattle bands , and even 3rd - level grunge - rock like Alice in Chains and Screaming Trees landed in my vinyl collection .
But I hated Pearl Jam : “ Jeremy ” ‘s warbling , maudlin self - righteousness and aimless melody grated on me like a Celine Dion ballad , and the highest I ’ve ever rated any of their songs is “ tolerable . ”
However , the more I learned about Eddie Vedder and crew , the more I grew to have grudging respect for them ; a radio show Vedder hosted in 1995 featured fantastic music , and the band ’s fight against Ticketmaster was admirable ( if fruitless ) .
I realized that I like what they like , just not what they make .
So I suppose it should n’t come as a surprise that they ’ve recorded an embarrassingly bad take on “ Rock Around the Clock ” in support of Obama called ( shudder ) “ Rock Around Barack . ”
Its simpering , smirking chorus of “ We ’re gonna rock around Barack tonight ” is so terrible I think I might have just blacked out after only the first 7 seconds of the thing , and when I woke up I was on the donation screen of Hillary Clinton ’s website .
With Romney out of the race ( and the Mega - Tuesday primaries settling nothing ) , my excitement over the knock - down drag - out rumble on the Democratic side has suddenly turned to abject terror : I just want this thing settled already , I do n’t care how !
Perhaps Pearl Jam are trying to help in their own perverted way : just like a bunch of really cool posters , a crew of aging hippies doing a Bill Haley cover for you ca n’t be a good sign .
Little Friends Noelle
- Sold -
Date of Birth : 24 .
December 2006
Birth Height : 19 1/4 - 19 1/2 " at 4 days
Foal Coat Color : Very Dark Brown or black / brown
Sire : HR Black Magic
32 " Black / no stripe
Dam : Annie's Acres Miriam
32 1/4 " - dark Brown
While others would probably not announce the birth of this special little girl we think she deserves a birth announcement just like all of our babies .
Everybody knows that not all babies are born perfect and what went wrong here - we do n't know .
Little Noelle was a complete surprise since we did n't count with her until the end of January .
Apparently Miriam came back into heat but was actually pregnant already .
We had just given Miriam her " baby shot " the day before little Noelle was born ( that we give about 30 days prior to foaling .
Little Noelle did not get here without problems .
While her birth must have been normal , we found the still wet little girl with her tongue hanging out to one side .
Miriam had sense enough to deliver her first baby in the shelter but we still had freezing temperatures that night .
Noelle did n't have much control over her tongue and could n't keep it in her mouth - which of course made nursing a chore .
She figured out how to wrap her tongue around one teat to get some milk but each nursing would take very long and she wore her patient moma out on that one side .
Noelle was not able to nurse on the other side and we had to keep mom milked down so she would n't be so sore and feed some of it to Noelle to keep her satisfied .
She expanded so much energy just to keep her tummy filled that she was exhausted every time that she finally had enough .
We did n't see any attempts of her wanting to play for the first 4 days and she had to wear a little blanket to keep in her body heat ( the first time we ever had to use a blanket on a baby ) .
She did n't want to use the heat lamp that we had out for her .
The nursing problems are probably caused by one of the worst overbites that we have seen , yet .
At 4 days of age she finally was able to keep her tongue in her mouth most of the time and figured out how to nurse on the other side as well .
She is now 9 days old and we are guardedly optimistic but know that she is not out of the woods , yet .
She has been grinding her teeth a lot which normally suggests ulcers but the vet said that she should n't have those without being on medication and on a normal diet .
Today she seemed to grind her teeth a little less .
While this little girl is never going to be a brood jennet ( if she makes it ) she is still very special - a christmas baby that has a very sweet personality and is of beautiful color .
We are hoping so much for this little girl to grow into a healthy adult .
Miriam is such an attentive moma .
Her baby takes one step and Miriam stops whatever she is doing and goes to check on her baby .
I think Miriam would go crazy if something happened to little Noelle and we would miss her terribly - afterall we spent more time in the stall over Christmas than anywhere else .

MARK SCHOENFELD and Scott Field have bought seven houses together since they met in 1994 .
“ We find something , put our stamp on it , then we ’re ready to move on , ” said Mr. Schoenfeld , a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group , the New York real estate concern .
He and Mr. Field , a broker at Elyse Harney Real Estate in New Preston , Conn. , say they are addicted to the adventure and constant motion of the house hunt .
But in 1996 they found a place for sale in Danbury , Conn. , that stopped them cold .
Set on four rolling acres and ringed by huge trees , the white center - hall colonial - style house from 1910 was “ the whole ‘ Gone With the Wind ’ fantasy , ” Mr. Schoenfeld said , from its graceful white - columned porch to its spectacular front - hall staircase to its six spacious , light - flooded bedrooms .
It was too good not to buy , but they were too daunted by its shabby condition to take it on .
“ It was just a disaster everywhere you looked , ” Mr. Field said .
The floors had not been refinished in decades , and a chain - smoking caretaker had left one bedroom ’s walls so stained with the residue of his habit that it resembled a 19th - century French bistro .
But the house stayed with them 
“ I could never get the staircase out of my head , ” Mr. Schoenfeld said  and when it was put on the market again in 2000 , they pounced , paying $ 540,000 .
They renovated happily for three years .
But then Mr. Field began to feel the pull of family members living in Maine , and they moved on , selling for $ 850,000 and buying a vacation place in Camden , Me. Giving up the house was tough , but as serial renovators , they thought they ’d get over it quickly  just another case of lathing and leaving .
They soon realized their mistake .
Julia Stiles
Fuck you , Julia Stiles is cute .
She 's realistically attractive enough that a rather large amount of males find her incredibly underwhelming , but that 's her charm ; she looks like a dignified , legitimately pretty woman you might see in a college class .
You may consider the phrase " realistically attractive " a synonym for " small breasted , " but , again , this adds to the charm .
Kate Hudson
Kate Hudson , on the other hand , looks like she should have huge knockers .
Not that Goldie Hawn did or anything , but considering the gal 's face and the rest of her body , she just seems like the type to be packing D's .
She played a band slut in Almost Famous , after all ; one would naturally assume a cup size which , if translated into an academic grade , would result in failing a course .
Unlike Stiles , Hudson 's lack of boobage is an unfortunate flaw in an otherwise stellar body -- still , though , she 's pretty hot regardless .
Rihanna
About half the pictures ever taken of Rihanna either look ( A ) hideous , or ( B ) like she 's stuffed tennis balls into each half of her bra .
In reality , Rihanna 's lovely lady lumps do n't amount to much , but they 're nice enough that that does n't quite matter .
If you can't have girth , make 'em perky -- and Rihanna 's love pillows are plenty perky .
Natalie Portman
Just in case you were thinking of complaining about Natalie Portman 's small breasts , remember how many people were unreasonably excited to see The Darjeeling Limited simply because Natalie Portman was allegedly gonna be naked in the preceding short film , Hotel Chevalier .
Big breasts or not , Natalie Portman is hot , and people want to see her naked .
Again , while we may assume that breast size and attractiveness go hand in hand , Portman is actually a heck of a lot cuter without lugging around huge chest cannons ; she looks a lot more charming , innocent , and attainable without them .
Keira Knightley
Ah , Keira Knightley .
The woman with breasts so small that they had to Photoshop her chest for the King Arthur poster .
The lady has had to deal with countless accusations of anorexia and / or bulimia since Bend it Like Beckham , so I wo n't beat a dead horse with small tits more than it already has been .
Suffice it to say , however , that Keira Knightley should not have small breasts .
She does n't look attainable like Portman or Stiles ; she looks like a classic sex goddess ( look at that jawline ) , and it 's more or less tragic that she does n't have a body to match .
Still , though .
Hot .

Police release footage of Times Square bombing NEW YORK ( AP ) 
Police have released footage from a private security camera showing a cyclist riding up to the Times Square military recruiting station where a small bomb was detonated .
The bicyclist is seen getting off the 10 - speed bike at 3:40 a.m. Thursday , and the blast occurring three minutes later .
It is followed by a brief flash and a cloud of white smoke .
Police say they later found the bike in the trash .
MAIL CLUE : Letters suspect in Times Square blast
No one was hurt in the blast .
But Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the device , though " unsophisticated , " could have caused " injury and even death . "
A witness said they saw the person on the bike acting suspiciously around the time bomb went off .
In October , two small explosive devices were tossed over a fence at the Mexican Consulate on Manhattan 's East Side in 2007 , shattering some windows ; police said they believed someone on a bicycle threw the devices .
At the time , police said they were investigating whether it was connected to a similar incident at the British consulate on May 5 , 2005 .
No one was arrested in either incident .
The bicyclist on Thursday was described as carrying a backpack and wearing a dark garment with a hood .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the witness did not see anyone placing or throwing the explosive device .
" In 2005 , 2007 , dummy hand grenades were used and the explosive , black powder , was put into those grenades and that caused the explosion , " Kelly said .
" Here , it may be similar powder — we still have to determine that .
But it was placed in an ammunition box .
That was the carrier for the explosive .
There was no grenade . "
Kelly held up a similar green metal box at a press conference and said they were readily available in Army - Navy surplus stores .
The 3:45 a.m. Times Square blast caused minor damage to the landmark military recruiting station , prompting a huge police response that disrupted transit at the " crossroads of the world . "
It left a gaping hole in the front window and shattered a glass door , twisting and blackening the metal frame of the building , which is on a traffic island .
Police were examining numerous security videotapes from the area .
VIDEO : Blast is ' terrorism to me ' , New Yorker says " I was getting ready to set up the cart when I heard a loud explosion , " said Bashir Saleh , who runs a breakfast cart at 43rd Street and Seventh Avenue , across from the recruiting station .
" I ran out , and saw smoke coming out . "
" I did n't see it that second , " said David Hassan , another breakfast cart owner operating across the street from Saleh .
" I saw smoke and there was a loud boom .
I was scared .
I 'm still shaky . "
Both men said that an officer from the police substation , a block south of the recruiting station , immediately came running out .
Police reinforcement arrived soon after , they said .
The military 's 1,600 recruiting stations nationwide were alerted to the New York incident and advised to use extra caution , said Douglas Smith , spokesman for the Army recruiting command .
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said no official higher state of alert had been issued .
" We do get occasional vandals at our recruiting stations , " Whitman said , adding that he did n't have figures on how many .
" It 's unfortunate but it happens from time to time . "
He said New York recruiters would be working temporarily out of their Union Square office .
Bloomberg said the act " insults every one of our brave men and women in uniform stationed around the world . "
" Whoever the coward was that committed this disgraceful act on our city will be found and prosecuted to the full extent of the law , " said Bloomberg .
" We will not tolerate such attacks . "
The recruiting center has drawn sporadic protests for many years , including in October 2005 , when a group who call themselves the Granny Peace Brigade rallied there against the Iraq war .
Eighteen activists , most of them grandmothers in their 80s and 90s , were later acquitted of disorderly conduct .
The brigade issued a statement Thursday deploring the bombing .
Police cars and yellow tape initially blocked drivers from entering one of the world 's busiest crossroads , though some traffic was allowed through around the start of rush hour .
Guests at the Marriott Marquis on 46th Street said they heard a " big bang " and felt the building shake .
Terry Leighton , 49 , from London , England , said he was on the 21st floor of the hotel when he heard the blast and looked out a window .
" I thought it could have been thunder , " he said .
" I looked down and there was a massive plume of smoke .
So I knew it was an explosion . "
At one point in the investigation subway trains passed through the Times Square subway station without stopping , but normal service resumed later in the morning .
Police cars and tape blocked the streets .
The recruiting center was renovated in 1999 to better fit into the flashy ambiance of Times Square , using neon tubing to give the glass and steel office a patriotic American flag motif .
For a half century , the station was the armed forces ' busiest recruiting center .
It has set national records for enlistment , averaging about 10,000 volunteers a year .

Carol Brouillet – Closing remarks
This year ’s Film Festival was dedicated to the memory of Chuck Millar , Giuletto Chiesa , and Sandra Brown , courageous , loving , truth seekers , who will be deeply missed .
2020 is an unusual year ; weddings have been cancelled , schools closed , almost all large public gatherings banned , the global economy dismantled ; the middle class and Main Street ’s small and medium sized businesses are struggling to survive .
In California , the film industry , the theaters have been hit hard .
The Grand Lake Theater , which has generously hosted countless events and 15 prior 9/11 Truth Film Festivals is currently closed .
In March , the Northern California 9/11 Truth Alliance could no longer meet legally and was forced to hold meetings in cyberspace .
No Lies Radio hosted Zoom meetings and discussions and organizing continued , despite the obstacles and challenges that everyone faced
The group voted to go “ virtual ” this year , with the assistance of No Lies Radio who has been webstreaming the live Film Festival for many years .
We will miss the Grand Lake Theater , the chance to hug , greet and talk with old friends and make new ones , the popcorn , the cookies , being together , in person .
However , a virtual Film Festival is the best we can do , and does actually allow some interactivity , questions and answers , and bringing in distant speakers , without dealing with airports and hotels .
Please join us !
Voice your questions for our guest speakers and panelists .
Guns and Butter ’s Bonnie Faulkner will kick off the Film Festival , as she has for 16 years !
We will post the program here when we finalize it .
As this dramatic year continues to unfold , our program is evolving ; we have penciled in films that are still in production , as well as the best 9/11 Truth films that we could find , since last year ’s Film Festival .
In addition to 9/11 , our speakers will address Covid - 19 and the problems facing the upcoming national election .
The impact of 9/11 continues to shape US domestic and foreign policy , robbing us of our liberties , and costing millions of lives , as the subsequent wars continue to wreak havoc abroad .
We have been committed to “ seek and disseminate truths about the terrible crimes committed on September 11 , 2001 , exposing gaps and deceptions in the official story .
Our goal is to inspire more eyewitness revelations , truthful media coverage , and a movement that will bring the responsible criminals to justice and eliminate governmental and corporate policies that enable criminal elements to commit such acts . ”

After the following story was posted , Apple changed its license to allow Safari for Windows on Windows PCs .
At least in part
In using Apple Software Update to slip his Safari browser onto millions of Windows PCs , Steve Jobs did n't just undermine " the security of the whole Web " .
He 's made a mockery of end user licensing agreements .
As spotted by our Italian friends at setteB.IT , Apple 's Safari license says that users are permitted to install the browser on no more than " a single Apple - labeled computer at a time . "
This means that if you install Safari for Windows on a Windows PC , you 're violating the license .
Apple dabbles in paradox
Early last week , as Apple unveiled Safari version 3.1 , it began offering the browser to Windows users via the Apple Software Update tool that accompanies iTunes and Quicktime .
In other words , millions of people who do n't use Safari have now been confronted with a pop-up window that lists the browser as an important software " update . "
And this is an offer that many iTunes and Quicktime users are less than likely to refuse .
When that pop -up window pops up , the go - ahead - and - install - Safari button is checked by default .
Apple forces Safari onto Windows
But you 'll also notice that in pushing Safari onto Windows machines , Apple Software Update points out that Safari is subject to an Apple licensing agreement .
" Use of this software is subject to the original Software License Agreement (s ) that accompanied the software being updated , " the " updater " says .
And that licensing agreement forbids the use of Safari on Windows machines .
The agreement was last updated in January of this year , six months after Safari for Windows made its debut .
According to Jonathan Kramer , a tech - minded attorney with the Kramer Telecom Law Firm , you are n't in any legal danger if you install Safari for Windows on a Windows PC .
Apple can't enforce a contract clause that does n't make sense .
" We call this an impossibility issue , " Kramer told us .
" You ca n't enforce a term that 's impossible . "
So this is merely a case of Apple making itself look silly . ®
Quantum time waits for no cosmos THE INTRIGUING notion that time might run backwards when the Universe collapses has run into difficulties .
Raymond Laflamme , of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico , has carried out a new calculation which suggests that the Universe cannot start out uniform , go through a cycle of expansion and collapse , and end up in a uniform state .
It could start out disordered , expand , and then collapse back into disorder .
But , since the COBE data show that our Universe was born in a smooth and uniform state , this symmetric possibility cannot be applied to the real Universe .
Physicists have long puzzled over the fact that two distinct " arrows of time " both point in the same direction .
In the everyday world , things wear out -- cups fall from tables and break , but broken cups never re- assemble themselves spontaneously .
In the expanding Universe at large , the future is the direction of time in which galaxies are further apart .
Many years ago , Thomas Gold suggested that these two arrows might be linked .
That would mean that if and when the expansion of the Universe were to reverse , then the everyday arrow of time would also reverse , with broken cups re-assembling themselves .
More recently , these ideas have been extended into quantum physics .
There , the arrow of time is linked to the so - called " collapse of the wave function " , which happens , for example , when an electron wave moving through a TV tube collapses into a point particle on the screen of the TV .
Some researchers have tried to make the quantum description of reality symmetric in time , by including both the original state of the system ( the TV tube before the electron passes through ) and the final state ( the TV tube after the electron has passed through ) in one mathematical description .
Murray Gell - Mann and James Hartle recently extended this idea to the whole Universe .
They argued that if , as many cosmologists believe likely , the Universe was born in a Big Bang , will expand out for a finite time and then recollapse into a Big Crunch , the time - neutral quantum theory could describe time running backwards in the contracting half of its life .
Unfortunately , Laflamme has now shown that this will not work .
He has proved that if there are only small inhomogeneities present in the Big Bang , then they must get larger throughout the lifetime of the Universe , in both the expanding and the contracting phases .
" A low entropy Universe at the Big Bang cannot come back to low entropy at the Big Crunch " ( Classical and Quantum Gravity , vol 10 p L79 ) .
He has found time - asymmetric solutions to the equations -- but only if both Big Bang and Big Crunch are highly disordered , with the Universe more ordered in the middle of its life .
Observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation show that the Universe emerged from the Big Bang in a very smooth and uniform state .
This rules out the time - symmetric solutions .
The implication is that even if the present expansion of the Universe does reverse , time will not run backwards and broken cups will not start re- assembling themselves .
Is time travel possible ?
John and Mary Gribbin
In one of the wildest developments in serious science for decades , researchers from California to Moscow have recently been investigating the possibility of time travel .
They are not , as yet , building TARDIS lookalikes in their laboratories ; but they have realised that according to the equations of Albert Einstein 's general theory of relativity ( the best theory of time and space we have ) , there is nothing in the laws of physics to prevent time travel .
It may be extremely difficult to put into practice ; but it is not impossible .
It sounds like science fiction , but it is taken so seriously by relativists that some of them have proposed that there must be a law of nature to prevent time travel and thereby prevent paradoxes arising , even though nobody has any idea how such a law would operate .
The classic paradox , of course , occurs when a person travels back in time and does something to prevent their own birth -- killing their granny as a baby , in the more gruesome example , or simply making sure their parents never get together , as in Back to the Future .
It goes against commonsense , say the sceptics , so there must be a law against it .
This is more or less the same argument that was used to prove that space travel is impossible .
So what do Einstein 's equations tell us , if pushed to the limit ?
As you might expect , the possibility of time travel involves those most extreme objects , black holes .
And since Einstein 's theory is a theory of space and time , it should be no surprise that black holes offer , in principle , a way to travel through space , as well as through time .
A simple black hole wo n't do , though .
If such a black hole formed out of a lump of non-rotating material , it would simply sit in space , swallowing up anything that came near it .
At the heart of such a black hole there is a point known as a singularity , where space and time cease to exist , and matter is crushed to infinite density .
Thirty years ago , Roger Penrose ( now of Oxford University ) proved that anything which falls into such a black hole must be drawn into the singularity by its gravitational pull , and also crushed out of existence .
But , also in the 1960s , the New Zealand mathematician Roy Kerr found that things are different if the black hole is rotating .
A singularity still forms , but in the form of a ring , like the mint with a hole .
In principle , it would be possible to dive into such a black hole and through the ring , to emerge in another place and another time .
This " Kerr solution " was the first mathematical example of a time machine , but at the time nobody took it seriously .
At the time , hardly anybody took the idea of black holes seriously , and interest in the Kerr solution only really developed in the 1970s , after astronmers discovered what seem to be real black holes , both in our own Milky Way Galaxy and in the hearts of other galaxies .
This led to a rash of popular publications claiming , to the annoyance of many relativists , that time travel might be possible .
In the 1980s , though , Kip Thorne , of CalTech ( one of the world 's leading experts in the general theory of relativity ) , and his colleagues set out to prove once and for all that such nonsense was n't really allowed by Einstein 's equations .
They studied the situation from all sides , but were forced to the unwelcome conclusion that there really was nothing in the equations to prevent time travel , provided ( and it is a big proviso ) you have the technology to manipulate black holes .
As well as the Kerr solution , there are other kinds of black hole time machine allowed , including setups graphically described as " wormholes " , in which a black hole at one place and time is connected to a black hole in another place and time ( or the same place at a different time ) through a " throat " .
Thorne has described some of these possibilities in a recent book , Black Holes and Time Warps ( Picador ) , which is packed with information but far from being an easy read .
Now , Michio Kaku , a professor of physics in New York , has come up with a more accessible variation on the theme with his book Hyperspace ( Oxford UP ) , which ( unlike Thorne 's book ) at least includes some discussion of the contribution of researchers such as Robert Heinlein to the study of time travel .
The Big Bang , string theory , black holes and baby universes all get a mention here ; but it is the chapter on how to build a time machine that makes the most fascinating reading .
" Most scientists , who have not seriously studied Einstein 's equations , " says Kaku , " dismiss time travel as poppycock " .
And he then goes on to spell out why the few scientists who have seriously studied Einstein 's equations are less dismissive .
Our favourite page is the one filled by a diagram which shows the strange family tree of an individual who manages to be both his / her own father and his / her own mother , based on the Heinlein story " All you zombies -- " .
And Kaku 's description of a time machine is something fans of Dr Who and H.G. Wells would be happy with : [ It ] consists of two chambers , each containing two parallel metal plates .
The intense electric fields created between each pair of plates ( larger than anything possible with today 's technology ) rips the fabric of space - time , creating a hole in space that links the two chambers .
Taking advantage of Einstein 's special theory of relativity , which says that time runs slow for a moving object , one of the chambers is then taken on a long , fast journey and brought back :
Time would pass at different rates at the two ends of the wormhole , [ and ] anyone falling into one end of the wormhole would be instantly hurled into the past or the future [ as they emerge from the other end ] .
And all this , it is worth spelling out , has been published by serious scientists in respectable journals such as Physical Review Letters ( you do n't believe us ?
check out volume 61 , page 1446 ) .
Although , as you may have noticed , the technology required is awesome , involving taking what amounts to a black hole on a trip through space at a sizeable fraction of the speed of light .
We never said it was going to be easy !
So how do you get around the paradoxes ?
The scientists have an answer to that , too .
It 's obvious , when you think about it ; all you have to do is add in a judicious contribution from quantum theory to the time travelling allowed by relativity theory .
As long as you are an expert in both theories , you can find a way to avoid the paradoxes .
It works like this .
According to one interpretation of quantum physics ( there are several interpretations , and nobody knows which one , if any , is " right " ) , every time a quantum object , such as an electron , is faced with a choice , the world divides to allow it to take every possibility on offer .
In the simplest example , the electron may be faced with a wall containing two holes , so that it must go through one hole or the other .
The Universe splits so that in one version of reality -- one set of relative dimensions -- it goes through the hole on the left , while in the other it goes through the hole on the right .
Pushed to its limits , this interpretation says that the Universe is split into infinitely many copies of itself , variations on a basic theme , in which all possible outcomes of all possible " experiments " must happen somewhere in the " multiverse " .
So there is , for example , a Universe in which the Labour Party has been in power for 15 years , and is now under threat from a resurgent Tory Party led by vibrant young John Major .
How does this resolve the paradoxes ?
Like this .
Suppose someone did go back in time to murder their granny when she was a little girl .
On this multiverse picture , they have slid back to a bifurcation point in history .
After killing granny , they move forward in time , but up a different branch of the multiverse .
In this branch of reality , they were never born ; but there is no paradox , because in he universe next door granny is alive and well , so the murderer is born , and goes back in time to commit the foul deed !
Once again , it sounds like science fiction , and once again science fiction writers have indeed been here before .
But this idea of parallel universes and alternative histories as a solution to the time travel paradoxes is also now being taken seriously by some ( admittedly , not many ) researchers , including David Deutsch , in Oxford .
Their research deals with both time , and relative dimensions in space .
You could make a nice acronym for that -- TARDIS , perhaps ?
Time travel for beginners John Gribbin Exactly one hundred years ago , in 1895 , H. G. Wells classic story The Time Machine was first published in book form .
As befits the subject matter , that was the minus tenth anniversary of the first publication , in 1905 , of Albert Einstein 's special theory of relativity .
It was Einstein , as every schoolchild knows , who first described time as " the fourth dimension " -- and every schoolchild is wrong .
It was actually Wells who wrote , in The Time Machine , that " there is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space , except that our consciousness moves along it " .
Since the time of Wells and Einstein , there has been a continuing literary fascination with time travel , and especially with the paradoxes that seem to confront any genuine time traveller ( something that Wells neglected to investigate ) .
The classic example is the so- called " granny paradox " , where a time traveller inadvertantly causes the death of his granny when she was a small girl , so that the traveller 's mother , and therefore the traveller himself , were never born .
In which case , he did not go back in time to kill granny . . . and so on .
A less gruesome example was entertainingly provided by the science fiction writer Robert Heinlein in his story
By his bootstraps ( available in several Heinlein anthologies ) .
The protagonist in the story stumbles on a time travel device brought back to the present by a visitor from the far future .
He steals it and sets up home in a deserted stretch of time , constantly worrying about being found by the old man he stole the time machine from -- until one day , many years later , he realises that he is now the old man , and carefully arranges for his younger self to " find " and " steal " the time machine .
Such a narcissistic view of time travel is taken to its logical extreme in David Gerrold 's The Man Who Folded Himself ( Random House , 1973 ) .
Few of the writers of Dr Who have had the imagination actually to use his time machine in this kind of way .
It would , after all , make for rather dull viewing if every time the Doctor had been confronted by a disaster he popped into the TARDIS , went back in time and warned his earlier self to steer clear of the looming trouble .
But the implications were thoroughly explored for a wide audience in the Back to the Future trilogy , ramming home the point that time travel runs completely counter to common sense .
Obviously , time travel must be impossible .
Only , common sense is about as reliable a guide to science as the well known " fact " that Einstein came up with the idea of time as the fourth dimension is to history .
Sticking with Einstein's own theories , it is hardly common sense that objects get both heavier and shorter the faster they move , or that moving clocks run slow .
Yet all of these predictions of relativity theory have been born out many times in experiments , to an impressive number of decimal places .
And when you look closely at the general theory of relativity , the best theory of time and space we have , it turns out that there is nothing in it to forbid time travel .
The theory implies that time travel may be very difficult , to be sure ; but not impossible .
Perhaps inevitably , it was through science fiction that serious scientists finally convinced themselves that time travel could be made to work , by a sufficiently advanced civilization .
It happened like this .
Carl Sagan , a well known astronomer , had written a novel in which he used the device of travel through a black hole to allow his characters to travel from a point near the Earth to a point near the star Vega .
Although he was aware that he was bending the accepted rules of physics , this was , after all , a novel .
Nevertheless , as a scientist himself Sagan wanted the science in his story to be as accurate as possible , so he asked Kip Thorne , an established expert in gravitational theory , to check it out and advise on how it might be tweaked up .
After looking closely at the non-commonsensical equations , Thorne realised that such a wormhole through spacetime actually could exist as a stable entity within the framework of Einstein 's theory .
Sagan gratefully accepted Thorne 's modification to his fictional " star gate " , and the wormhole duly featured in the novel , Contact , published in 1985 .
But this was still only presented as a shortcut through space .
Neither Sagan nor Thorne realised at first that what they had described would also work as a shortcut through time .
Thorne seems never to have given any thought to the time travel possibilities opened up by wormholes until , in December 1986 , he went with his student , Mike Morris , to a symposium in Chicago , where one of the other participants casually pointed out to Morris that a wormhole could also be used to travel backwards in time .
Thorne tells the story of what happened then in his own book Black Holes and Time Warps ( Picador ) .
The key point is that space and time are treated on an essentially equal footing by Einstein 's equations -- just as Wells anticipated .
So a wormhole that takes a shortcut through spacetime can just as well link two different times as two different places .
Indeed , any naturally occurring wormhole would most probably link two different times .
As word spread , other physicists who were interested in the exotic implications of pushing Einstein 's equations to extremes were encouraged to go public with their own ideas once Thorne was seen to endorse the investigation of time travel , and the work led to the growth of a cottage industry of time travel investigations at the end of the 1980s and in to the 1990s .
The bottom line of all this work is that while it is hard to see how any civilization could build a wormhole time machine from scratch , it is much easier to envisage that a naturally occurring wormhole might be adapted to suit the time travelling needs of a sufficiently advanced civilization .
" Sufficiently advanced " , that is , to be able to travel through space by conventional means , locate black holes , and manipulate them with as much ease as we manipulate the fabric of the Earth itself in projects like the Channel Tunnel .
Even then , there 's one snag .
It seems you can't use a time machine to go back in time to before the time machine was built .
You can go anywhere in the future , and come back to where you started , but no further .
Which rather neatly explains why no time travellers from our future have yet visited us -- because the time machine still has n't been invented !
So where does that leave the paradoxes , and common sense ?
There is a way out of all the difficulties , but you may not like it .
It involves the other great theory of physics in the twentieth century , quantum mechanics , and another favourite idea from science fiction , parallel worlds .
These are the " alternative histories " , in which , for example , the South won the American Civil War ( as in Ward Moore 's classic novel Bring the Jubilee ) , which are envisaged as in some sense lying " alongside " our version of reality .
According to one interpretation of quantum theory ( and it has to be said that there are other interpretations ) , each of these parallel worlds is just as real as our own , and there is an alternative history for every possible outcome of every decision ever made .
Alternative histories branch out from decision points , bifurcating endlessly like the branches and twigs of an infinite tree .
Bizarre though it sounds , this idea is taken seriously by a handful of scientists ( including David Deutsch , of the University of Oxford ) .
And it certainly fixes all the time travel paradoxes .
On this picture , if you go back in time and prevent your own birth it does n't matter , because by that decision you create a new branch of reality , in which you were never born .
When you go forward in time , you move up the new branch and find that you never did exist , in that reality ; but since you were still born and built your time machine in the reality next door , there is no paradox .
Hard to believe ?
Certainly .
Counter to common sense ?
Of course .
But the bottom line is that all of this bizarre behaviour is at the very least permitted by the laws of physics , and in some cases is required by those laws .
I wonder what Wells would have made of it all .
Time travel back on the agenda CLAIMS that time travel is impossible in principle have been shown to be in error by an Israeli researcher .
Amos Ori , of the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology , in Haifa , has found a flaw in the argument put forward recently by Stephen Hawking , of Cambridge University , claiming to rule out any possibility of time travel .
This is the latest twist in a story that began in the late 1980s , when Kip Thorne and colleagues at the California Institute of Technology suggested that although there might be considerable practical difficulties in constructing a time machine , there is nothing in the laws of physics as understood at present to forbid this .
Other researchers tried to find flaws in the arguments of the CalTech team , and pointed in particular to problems in satisfying a requirement known as the " weak energy condition " , which says that any real observer should always measure energy distributions that are positive .
This rules out some kinds of theoretical time machines , which involve travelling through black holes held open by negative energy stuff .
There are also problems with time machines that involve so - called singularities , points where space and time are crushed out of existence and the laws of physics break down .
But Ori has found mathematical descriptions , within the framework of the general theory of relativity , of spacetimes which loop back upon themselves in time , but in which no singularity appears early enough to interfere with the time travel , and the weak energy condition is satisfied ( Physical Review Letters , vol 71 p 2517 ) .
" At present , " he says , " one should not completely rule out the possibility of constructing a time machine from materials with positive energy densities . "
Is time an illusion ?
JUST because we perceive time flowing in one direction , does that mean there " really is " a difference between the past and future ?
The old philosophical question has been re-examined by Huw Price , of the University of Sydney , in the context of quantum mechanics .
He concludes that the idea that the past is not influenced by the future is an anthropocentric illusion , a " projection of our own temporal asymmetry " .
By allowing signals from the future to play a part in determining the outcome of quantum experiments , he can resolve all the puzzles and paradoxes of the quantum world .
This approach has a long ( if not entirely respectable ) history , but the implications have never been spelled out as clearly as Price does in an article to be published in the journal Mind .
It is one of the curiosities of Maxwell 's equations , for example , that they allow two sets of solutions for the effect of a moving electric charge , one describing an electromagnetic wave moving out from the particle into the future at the speed of light ( a retarded wave ) and the other describing waves from the future converging on the particle at the speed of light ( advanced waves ) .
The advanced wave solutions have been largely ignored since Maxwell developed his equations in the 19th century , but a few researchers , including Richard Feynman and Fred Hoyle , have considered the implications of taking such waves to be physically real .
More recently , the idea has been investigated in a quantum context by the American researcher John Cramer .
He envisages a quantum entity such as an electron that is about to be involved in an interaction ( from the everyday point of view ) sending out an " offer " wave into the future .
The particle that the electron is about to interact with picks up the offer wave , and sends a response echoing backwards in time to the electron .
The advanced and retarded waves combine to create a " handshake " between the two particles which , in a sense atemporally , determines the outcome of the interaction at the instant the electron starts to make the offer .
As Price discusses , this kind of approach solves the classic quantum puzzles , such as the electron faced with two holes in a screen , " deciding " which hole to go through .
Experiments show that , even though an individual electron can only go through one hole , its behaviour is affected by whether or not the second hole is open or closed .
The offer wave goes out through both holes , but the echo comes back only through one hole , the one the electron then goes through .
So the handshake process does take account of the presence of both holes , even though the electron only goes through one of them .
Many physicists find such ideas abhorrent , because they run counter to " common sense " .
They would , for example , encourage speculations like those of Henry Stapp ( see Science , XX August ) , that our own minds can influence things that have already happened .
The power of Price 's approach , though , is that it offers a framework for understanding how the world can include both forward and backward causation at a fundamental level , but appear to have a unique direction of time from a human perspective .
His argument is complex , but in words it boils down to an argument that the reason why the things we do in the present do not seem to have altered the past is that the past has already taken account of what we are doing !
If we decide to do something different , the past already knows -- so " to say that if we suppose the present to be different , while the past remains the same , it will follow that the past is different . . . is untrue , of course , but simply on logical grounds .
No physical asymmetry is required to explain it " .
For the more mathematically inclined , Price offers a discussion of John Bell 's famous inequality , in which two widely separated quantum systems seem to be connected by what Albert Einstein called a " spooky action at a distance " .
The action at a distance is real , on this picture , and is essentially Cramer 's handshaking process .
But there is no limitation on free will , according to Price .
We are free to make any decisions we please , and to take any actions we choose .
The past already knows what those decisions will be , but that does not affect our freedom in making them , and " we should n't expect to ' see ' backward influence in action , " which may be bad news for Stapp , after all .
" It is time , " says Price , " that this neglected approach [ to quantum mechanics ] received the attention it so richly deserves . "
Time Machines Paul J. Nahin American Institute of Physics p408 £??
Distributed in UK by OUP ; ISBN 0883189356 John Gribbin TIME TRAVEL has become , if not respectable , then certainly fashionable in some quarters of the physics world over the past decade or so .
Much of the blame can be laid at the door of the astronomer Carl Sagan , who was writing a science fiction novel in the summer of 1985 , and asked the relativist Kip Thorne , of CalTech , to come up with some plausible sounding scientific mumbo- jumbo to " explain " the literary device of a wormhole through space which could enable his characters to travel between the stars .
Encouraged to look at the equations of the general theory of relativity in a new light , Thorne and his colleagues first found that there is nothing in those equations to prevent the existence of such wormholes , and then realised that any tunnel through space is also , potentially , a tunnel through time .
The laws of physics do not forbid time travel .
This realisation had two consequences .
When Sagan 's novel , Contact , appeared in 1986 it contained a passage that read like pure
Sf hokum , but which was ( although few readers realised it at the time ) a serious science factual description of a spacetime wormhole .
And as Thorne and his colleagues began to publish scientific papers about time machines and time travel , the spreading ripples have stimulated a cottage industry of similar studies .
Curiously , this anecdote does not feature in Paul Nahin 's otherwise remarkably comprehensive account of the fact and fiction of time travel .
Nahin is a professor of electrical engineering at the University of New Hampshire , and the author of several published science fiction stories , some dealing with the puzzles and paradoxes of time travel .
He tells us how he discovered , and " devoured " science fiction stories at the age of ten , and this book is clearly a labour of love .
The approach is scholarly , with 36 pages of footnotes , nine technical ( but not overly mathematical ) appendices , and a no-holds - barred bibliography .
Nahin 's style is distinctly more sober than the material he deals with , but what he lacks in sparkle he certainly makes up for in comprehensiveness .
The approach , in line with the author 's background , is from the fiction and towards the fact .
Old favourites , such as H. G. Wells and Frank Tipler , make their expected appearances , as do less familiar time travel fictions from the nineteenth century ( comfortably predating Albert Einstein 's theories ) and more obscure scientists and philosophers .
And , of course , the familiar time travel paradoxes get a thorough airing .
There are , though , two major weaknesses in Nahin 's treatment of the science .
The lesser is his discussion of black holes , which is weak and sometimes a little confused .
Much more importantly , though , he fails to appreciate how the " many worlds " interpretation of quantum mechanics allows a time traveller to go back in time and alter the past without producing problems such as the notorious grandfather paradox .
In the conventional version of the paradox , a traveller goes back and murders his grandfather as a young boy , so the traveller could never have been born , so grandfather never died -- and so on .
But in the many worlds version ( championed today by David Deutsch , of the University of Oxford ) , the act of killing grandad creates a new reality , so that when the traveller then goes forward in time he is no longer in his own world , but in the universe " next door " .
This explains , for example , some of the more subtle touches in the " Back to the Future " trilogy of movies , which Nahin comments on while missing their point entirely .
But although the book is flawed , it is still welcome .
It does not lend itself to being read from front to back like a novel , but is ideal to dip in to and hop around in , like a time traveller dipping in to history .
It is also a first class reference book for anyone interested in the Sf side of time travel , and one that will be welcomed by the fans -- at least , they will welcome it when and if it becomes available in paperback at a sensible price .
Hyperspace connections :
Black holes , white holes , wormholes John Gribbin
When astronomer Carl Sagan decided to write a science fiction novel , he needed a fictional device that would allow his characters to travel great distances across the Universe .
He knew , of course , that it is impossible to travel faster than light ; and he also knew that there was a common convention in science fiction that allowed writers to use the gimmick of a shortcut through " hyperspace " as a means around this problem .
But , being a scientist , Sagan wanted something that would seem to be more substantial than a conventional gimmick for his story .
Was there any way to dress up the mumbo- jumbo of Sf hyperspace in a cloak of respectable sounding science ?
Sagan did n't know .
He is n't an expert on black holes and general relativity -- his background specialty is planetary studies .
But he knew just the person to turn to for some advice on how to make the obviously impossible idea of hyperspace connections through spacetime sound a bit more scientifically plausible in his book Contact .
The man Sagan turned to for advice , in the summer of 1985 , was Kip Thorne , at CalTech .
Thorne was sufficiently intrigued to set two of his PhD students , Michael Morris and Ulvi Yurtsever , the task of working out some details of the physical behaviour of what the relativists know as " wormholes " .
At that time , in the mid-1980s , relativists had long been aware that the equations of the general theory provided for the possibility of such hyperspace connections .
Indeed , Einstein himself , working at Princeton with Nathan Rosen in the 1930s , had discovered that the equations of relativity -- Karl Schwarzschild 's solution to Einstein 's equations -- actually represent a black hole as a bridge between two regions of flat spacetime -- an " Einstein - Rosen bridge " .
A black hole always has two " ends " , a property ignored by everyone except a few mathematicians until the mid-1980s .
Before Sagan set the ball rolling again , it had seemed that such hyperspace connections had no physical significance and could never , even in principle , be used as shortcuts to travel from one part of the Universe to another .
Morris and Yurtsever found that this widely held belief was wrong .
By starting out from the mathematical end of the problem , they constructed a spacetime geometry that matched Sagan 's requirement of a wormhole that could be physically traversed by human beings .
Then they investigated the physics , to see if there was any way in which the known laws of physics could conspire to produce the required geometry .
To their own surprise , and the delight of Sagan , they found that there is .
To be sure , the physical requirements seem rather contrived and implausible .
But that is n't the point .
What matters is that it seems that there is nothing in the laws of physics that forbids travel through wormholes .
The science fiction writers were right -- hyperspace connections do , at least in theory , provide a means to travel to far distant regions of the Universe without spending thousands of years pottering along through ordinary space at less than the speed of light .
The conclusions reached by the CalTech team duly appeared as the scientifically accurate window dressing in Sagan 's novel when it was published in 1986 , although few readers can have appreciated that most of the " mumbo- jumbo " was soundly based on the latest discoveries made by mathematical relativists .
Since then , the discovery of equations that describe physically permissible , traversable wormholes has led to a booming cottage industry of mathematicians investigating these strange phenomena .
It all starts with the Einstein - Rosen bridge .
The Einstein connection
It 's one of the intriguing curiosities of the history of science that spacetime wormholes were actually investigated by mathematical relativists in great detail long before anybody took the notion of black holes seriously .
As early as 1916 , less than a year after Einstein had formulated his equations of the general theory , the Austrian Ludwig Flamm had realised that Schwarzschild 's solution to Einstein 's equations actually describes a wormhole connecting two regions of flat spacetime -- two universes , or two parts of the same universe .
Speculation about the nature of wormholes continued intermittently for decades .
What the pioneering relativists did establish , very early on , was that Schwarzschild wormholes provide no means of communicating from one universe to the other .
The problem is that in order to traverse an Einstein - Rosen bridge from one universe to the other , a traveller would have to move faster than light at some stage of the journey .
And there is another problem with this kind of wormhole -- it is unstable .
If you imagine the " dent " in spacetime made by a large mass such as the Sun , squeezed into a volume only slightly bigger than its corresponding Schwarzschild sphere , you would get an " embedding diagram " , like Figure 1 .
The surprise about the Schwarzschild geometry is that when you shrink the mass down to within its Schwarzschild radius , you do n't just get a bottomless pit , as in Figure 2 ; instead , the bottom of the embedding diagram opens out to make the connection with another region of flat spacetime ( Figure 3 ) .
But this beautiful , open throat , offering the tantalising prospect of travel between universes , exists for only a tiny fraction of a second before it snaps shut .
The wormhole itself does not even exist for long enough for light to cross from one universe to the other .
In effect , gravity slams shut the door between universes .
This is especially disappointing , because if you ignore the rapid evolution of the wormhole and only look at the geometry corresponding to the instant when the throat is wide open , it seems as if such wormholes might even connect , not separate universes but separate regions of our own Universe .
Space may be flat near each mouth of the wormhole , but bent around in a gentle curve , far away from the wormhole , so that the connection really is a shortcut from one part of the Universe to another ( Figure 4 ) .
If you imagine unfolding this geometry to make the entire Universe flat except in the vicinity of the wormhole mouths , you get something like Figure 5 , in which a curved wormhole connects two separate regions of a completely flat Universe -- and do n't be fooled by the fact that in this drawing the distance from one mouth to the other through the wormhole itself seems to be longer than the distance from one mouth to the other through ordinary space ; in the proper four - dimensional treatment , even such a curved wormhole can still provide a shortcut from A to B .
Or at least , it could if the wormhole stayed open for long enough , and if passage through the wormhole did n't involve travelling at speeds faster than that of light .
But this is not the end of the story of hyperspace connections .
A simple Schwarzschild black hole has no overall electric charge , and it does not rotate .
Intriguingly , adding either electric charge or rotation to a black hole transforms the nature of the singularity , thereby opening the gateway to other universes , and makes the journey possible while travelling at speeds less than that of light .
Adding electric charge to a black hole provides it with a second field of force , in addition to gravity .
Because charges with the same sign repel one another , this electric field acts in the opposite sense to gravity , trying to blow the black hole apart , not pulling it more tightly together .
Rotation does much the same .
There is a force , in either case , that opposes the inward tug of gravity .
Although gravity still tries to slam shut the door opening to other universes , the electric field , or rotation , holds the door open for travellers to get through .
But there is still a sense in which this is a one way door ; you could not get back to the universe you started from - - you would inevitably emerge into another region of spacetime , usually interpreted as another universe .
What goes in one end ( the black hole ) comes out of the other end ( sometimes dubbed a white hole ) .
Turning around to go back the way you came would require travelling faster than light .
Until Sagan made his innocent enquiry about wormholes to Thorne , this was the nearest the mathematicians had come to describing a plausible traversable , macroscopic wormhole .
New speculations , encouraged by Sagan 's wishful thinking and developed by the CalTech researchers and others , suggest that it might indeed be possible to construct traversable wormholes artificially , just as Sf writers have been telling us for decades , given a suitably advanced technological civilization .
Wormhole engineering
There is still one problem with wormholes for any hyperspace engineers to take careful account of .
The simplest calculations suggest that whatever may be going on in the universe outside , the attempted passage of a spaceship through the hole ought to make the star gate slam shut .
The problem is that an accelerating object , according to the general theory of relativity , generates those ripples in the fabric of spacetime itself known as gravitational waves .
Gravitational radiation itself , travelling ahead of the spaceship and into the black hole at the speed of light , could be amplified to infinite energy as it approaches the singularity inside the black hole , warping spacetime around itself and shutting the door on the advancing spaceship .
Even if a natural traversable wormhole exists , it seems to be unstable to the slightest perturbation , including the disturbance caused by any attempt to pass through it .
But Thorne 's team found an answer to that for Sagan .
After all , the wormholes in Contact are definitely not natural , they are engineered .
One of his characters explains :
There is an interior tunnel in the exact Kerr solution of the Einstein Field Equations , but it 's unstable .
The slightest perturbation would seal it off and convert the tunnel into a physical singularity through which nothing can pass .
I have tried to imagine a superior civilization that would control the internal structure of a collapsing star to keep the interior tunnel stable .
This is very difficult .
The civilization would have to monitor and stabilize the tunnel forever .
But the point is that the trick , although it may be very difficult , is not impossible .
It could operate by a process known as negative feedback , in which any disturbance in the spacetime structure of the wormhole creates another disturbance which cancels out the first disturbance .
This is the opposite of the familiar positive feedback effect , which leads to a howl from loudspeakers if a microphone that is plugged in to those speakers through an amplifier is placed in front of them .
In that case , the noise from the speakers goes into the microphone , gets amplified , comes out of the speakers louder than it was before , gets amplified . . . and so on .
Imagine , instead , that the noise coming out of the speakers and into the microphone is analysed by a computer that then produces a sound wave with exactly the opposite characteristics from a second speaker .
The two waves would cancel out , producing total silence .
For simple sound waves , this trick can actually be carried out , here on Earth , in the 1990s .
Cancelling out more complex noise , like the roar of a football crowd , is not yet possible , but might very well be in a few years time .
So it may not be completely farfetched to imagine Sagan 's " superior civilization " building a gravitational wave receiver / transmitter system that sits in the throat of a wormhole and can record the disturbances caused by the passage of the spaceship through the wormhole , " playing back " a set of gravitational waves that will exactly cancel out the disturbance , before it can destroy the tunnel .
But where do the wormholes come from in the first place ?
The way Morris , Yurtsever and Thorne set about the problem posed by Sagan was the opposite of the way everyone before them had thought about black holes .
Instead of considering some sort of known object in the Universe , like a dead massive star , or a quasar , and trying to work out what would happen to it , they started out by constructing the mathematical description of a geometry that described a traversable wormhole , and then used the equations of the general theory of relativity to work out what kinds of matter and energy would be associated with such a spacetime .
What they found is almost ( with hindsight ) common sense .
Gravity , an attractive force pulling matter together , tends to create singularities and to pinch off the throat of a wormhole .
The equations said that in order for an artificial wormhole to be held open , its throat must be threaded by some form of matter , or some form of field , that exerts negative pressure , and has antigravity associated with it .
Now , you might think , remembering your school physics , that this completely rules out the possibility of constructing traversable wormholes .
Negative pressure is not something we encounter in everyday life ( imagine blowing negative pressure stuff in to a balloon and seeing the balloon deflate as a result ) .
Surely exotic matter cannot exist in the real Universe ?
But you may be wrong .
Making antigravity
The key to antigravity was found by a Dutch physicist , Hendrik Casimir , as long ago as 1948 .
Casimir , who was born in The Hague in 1909 , worked from 1942 onwards in the research laboratories of the electrical giant Philips , and it was while working there that he suggested what became known as the Casimir effect .
The simplest way to understand the Casimir effect is in terms of two parallel metal plates , placed very close together with nothing in between them ( Figure 6 ) .
The quantum vacuum is not like the kind of " nothing " physicists imagined the vacuum to be before the quantum era .
It seethes with activity , with particle - antiparticle pairs constantly being produced and annihilating one another .
Among the particles popping in and out of existence in the quantum vacuum there will be many photons , the particles which carry the electromagnetic force , some of which are the particles of light .
Indeed , it is particularly easy for the vacuum to produce virtual photons , partly because a photon is its own antiparticle , and partly because photons have no " rest mass " to worry about , so all the energy that has to be borrowed from quantum uncertainty is the energy of the wave associated with the particular photon .
Photons with different energies are associated with electromagnetic waves of different wavelengths , with shorter wavelengths corresponding to greater energy ; so another way to think of this electromagnetic aspect of the quantum vacuum is that empty space is filled with an ephemeral sea of electromagnetic waves , with all wavelengths represented .
This irreducible vacuum activity gives the vacuum an energy , but this energy is the same everywhere , and so it can not be detected or used .
Energy can only be used to do work , and thereby make its presence known , if there is a difference in energy from one place to another .
Between two electrically conducting plates , Casimir pointed out , electromagnetic waves would only be able to form certain stable patterns .
Waves bouncing around between the two plates would behave like the waves on a plucked guitar string .
Such a string can only vibrate in certain ways , to make certain notes -- ones for which the vibrations of the string fit the length of the string in such a way that there are no vibrations at the fixed ends of the string .
The allowed vibrations are the fundamental note for a particular length of string , and its harmonics , or overtones .
In the same way , only certain wavelengths of radiation can fit into the gap between the two plates of a Casimir experiment ( Figure 7 ) .
In particular , no photon corresponding to a wavelength greater than the separation between the plates can fit in to the gap .
This means that some of the activity of the vacuum is suppressed in the gap between the plates , while the usual activity goes on outside .
The result is that in each cubic centimetre of space there are fewer virtual photons bouncing around between the plates than there are outside , and so the plates feel a force pushing them together .
It may sound bizarre , but it is real .
Several experiments have been carried out to measure the strength of the Casimir force between two plates , using both flat and curved plates made of various kinds of material .
The force has been measured for a range of plate gaps from 1.4 nanometers to 15 nanometers ( one nanometer is one billionth of a metre ) and exactly matches Casimir 's prediction .
In a paper they published in 1987 , Morris and Thorne drew attention to such possibilities , and also pointed out that even a straightforward electric or magnetic field threading the wormhole " is right on the borderline of being exotic ; if its tension were infinitesimally larger . . . it would satisfy our wormhole - building needs . "
In the same paper , they concluded that " one should not blithely assume the impossibility of the exotic material that is required for the throat of a traversable wormhole . "
The two CalTech researchers make the important point that most physicists suffer a failure of imagination when it comes to considering the equations that describe matter and energy under conditions far more extreme than those we encounter here on Earth .
They highlight this by the example of a course for beginners in general relativity , taught at CalTech in the autumn of 1985 , after the first phase of work stimulated by Sagan 's enquiry , but before any of this was common knowledge , even among relativists .
The students involved were not taught anything specific about wormholes , but they were taught to explore the physical meaning of spacetime metrics .
In their exam , they were set a question which led them , step by step , through the mathematical description of the metric corresponding to a wormhole .
" It was startling , " said Morris and Thorne , " to see how hidebound were the students ' imaginations .
Most could decipher detailed properties of the metric , but very few actually recognised that it represents a traversable wormhole connecting two different universes . "
For those with less hidebound imaginations , there are two remaining problems -- to find a way to make a wormhole large enough for people ( and spaceships ) to travel through , and to keep the exotic matter out of contact with any such spacefarers .
Any prospect of building such a device is far beyond our present capabilities .
But , as Morris and Thorne stress , it is not impossible and " we correspondingly cannot now rule out traversable wormholes . "
It seems to me that there 's an analogy here that sets the work of such dreamers as Thorne and Visser in a context that is both helpful and intriguing .
Almost exactly 500 years ago , Leonardo da Vinci speculated about the possibility of flying machines .
He designed both helicopters and aircraft with wings , and modern aeronautical engineers say that aircraft built to his designs probably could have flown if Leonardo had had modern engines with which to power them -- even though there was no way in which any engineer of his time could have constructed a powered flying machine capable of carrying a human up into the air .
Leonardo could not even dream about the possibilities of jet engines and routine passenger flights at supersonic speeds .
Yet Concorde and the jumbo jets operate on the same basic physical principles as the flying machines he designed .
In just half a millennium , all his wildest dreams have not only come true , but been surpassed .
It might take even more than half a millennium for designs for a traversable wormhole to leave the drawing board ; but the laws of physics say that it is possible -- and as Sagan speculates , something like it may already have been done by a civilization more advanced than our own .
Why time travel is possible John Gribbin Physicists have found the law of nature which prevents time travel paradoxes , and thereby permits time travel .
It turns out to be the same law that makes sure light travels in straight lines , and which underpins the most straightforward version of quantum theory , developed half a century ago by Richard Feynman .
Relativists have been trying to come to terms with time travel for the past seven years , since Kip Thorne and his colleagues at Caltech discovered -- much to their surprise -- that there is nothing in the laws of physics ( specifically , the general theory of relativity ) to forbid it .
Among several different ways in which the laws allow a time machine to exist , the one that has been most intensively studied mathematically is the " wormhole " .
This is like a tunnel through space and time , connecting different regions of the Universe -- different spaces and different times .
The two " mouths " of the wormhole could be next to each other in space , but separated in time , so that it could literally be used as a time tunnel .
Building such a device would be very difficult -- it would involve manipulating black holes , each with many times the mass of our Sun .
But they could conceivably occur naturally , either on this scale or on a microscopic scale .
The worry for physicists is that this raises the possibility of paradoxes , familiar to science fiction fans .
For example , a time traveller could go back in time and accidentally ( or even deliberately ) cause the death of her granny , so that neither the time traveller 's mother nor herself was ever born .
People are hard to describe mathematically , but the equivalent paradox in the relativists ' calculations involves a billiard ball that goes in to one mouth of a wormhole , emerges in the past from the other mouth , and collides with its other self on the way in to the first mouth , so that it is knocked out of the way and never enters the time tunnel at all .
But , of course , there are many possible " self consistent " journeys through the tunnel , in which the two versions of the billiard ball never disturb one another .
If time travel really is possible -- and after seven years ' intensive study all the evidence says that it is -- there must , it seems , be a law of nature to prevent such paradoxes arising , while permitting the self - consistent journeys through time .
Igor Novikov , who holds joint posts at the P. N. Lebedev Institute , in Moscow , and at NORDITA ( the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics ) , in Copenhagen , first pointed out the need for a " Principle of Self - consistency " of this kind in 1989 ( Soviet Physics JETP , vol 68 p 439 ) .
Now , working with a large group of colleagues in Denmark , Canada , Russia and Switzerland , he has found the physical basis for this principle .
It involves something known as the Principle of least action ( or Principle of minimal action ) , and has been known , in one form or another , since the early seventeenth century .
It describes the trajectories of things , such as the path of a light ray from A to B , or the flight of a ball tossed through an upper story window .
And , it now seems , the trajectory of a billiard ball through a time tunnel .
Action , in this sense , is a measure both of the energy involved in traversing the path and the time taken .
For light ( which is always a special case ) , this boils down to time alone , so that the principle of least action becomes the principle of least time , which is why light travels in straight lines .
You can see how the principle works when light from a source in air enters a block of glass , where it travels at a slower speed than in air .
In order to get from the source A outside the glass to a point B inside the glass in the shortest possible time , the light has to travel in one straight line up to the edge of the glass , then turn through a certain angle and travel in another straight line ( at the slower speed ) on to point B . Travelling by any other route would take longer .
The action is a property of the whole path , and somehow the light ( or " nature " ) always knows how to choose the cheapest or simplest path to its goal .
In a similar fashion , the principle of least action can be used to describe the entire curved path of the ball thrown through a window , once the time taken for the journey is specified .
Although the ball can be thrown at different speeds on different trajectories ( higher and slower , or flatter and faster ) and still go through the window , only trajectories which satisfy the Principle of least action are possible .
Novikov and his colleagues have applied the same principle to the " trajectories " of billiard balls around time loops , both with and without the kind of " self collision " that leads to paradoxes .
In a mathematical tour de force , they have shown that in both cases only self - consistent solutions to the equations satisfy the principle of least action -- or in their own words , " the whole set of classical trajectories which are globally self - consistent can be directly and simply recovered by imposing the principle of minimal action " ( NORDITA Preprint , number 95/49A ) .
The word " classical " in this connection means that they have not yet tried to include the rules of quantum theory in their calculations .
But there is no reason to think that this would alter their conclusions .
Feynman , who was entranced by the principle of least action , formulated quantum physics entirely on the basis of it , using what is known as the " sum over histories " or " path integral " formulation , because , like a light ray seemingly sniffing out the best path from A to B , it takes account of all possible trajectories in selecting the most efficient .
So self - consistency is a consequence of the Principle of least action , and nature can be seen to abhor a time travel paradox .
Which removes the last objection of physicists to time travel in principle -- and leaves it up to the engineers to get on with the job of building a time machine .
I was just checking the predictions in the Obama campaign ’s leaked delegate estimates and was floored .
They nailed the hell out of it !
Here are their predictions :
Vote % Pledged Delegates State Delegates Obama Clinton Obama Clinton Ohio 141 46 % 53 % 68 73 Rhode Isl. 21 42 % 57 % 8 13 Texas 193 47 % 51 % 92 101 Vermont 15 55 % 44 % 9 6
The actual numbers , or at least decent current estimates ( taken from DailyKos ) are :
Vermont ( 15 delegates ) Obama 9
Clinton 6 Rhode Island ( 21 delegates ) Clinton 12
Obama 8 Texas Total ( Nowhere near final ) Obama ~99
Clinton ~ 94 Ohio ( 141 delegates , punching in results with 97 % reporting here ) Clinton 73
Obama 68
So as far as I can tell they were perfect on Vermont and Ohio , one delegate off in Rhode Island and maybe two delegates off in Texas ?
Holy crap .
UPDATE : A couple of people pointed out that there are updated results over at DKos .
These are different but not vastly different .
These are still not final numbers , since all counting of the Texas caucuses — stuck at about 35 % — has yet to resume .
But for now , Clinton has picked up a few delegates .
Vermont ( 15 delegates ) Obama 9
Clinton 6 Rhode Island ( 21 delegates ) Clinton 12
Obama 8 Texas Total ( Nowhere near final ) Clinton ~97
Obama ~96 Ohio ( 141 delegates ) Clinton 76
Obama 65
So Vermont and Rhode Island are still basically as estimated .
Clinton is doing a touch better in Ohio and Texas than predicted .
All in all a bang - up job by the Obama prediction team 🙂

Jim Gibbons ’ transition team in 2006 , is the majority owner of the Endoscopy Center of Southern Nevada , the source of a disease outbreak that ’s caused the largest hepatitis C scare in the country , according to health officials , who said 40,000 people who received anesthesia while undergoing endoscopic procedures there , including colonoscopies , must be tested immediately for hepatitis B , hepatitis C and HIV .
The clinic was one of the busiest of its kind in Nevada .
When Jim DiFiore , manager of the city ’s business services decision , suspended the facility ’s license Friday , he cited previously undisclosed findings by health investigators who inspected the clinic in January .
DiFiore said in a letter to the clinic ’s owners that Desai ordered his nurses to reuse syringes and reuse single - dose vials of medication when administering anesthesia to patients who received endoscopic procedures .
The practice , which allowed cross contamination of patients ’ blood , caused six people to become infected with hepatitis C .
Desai did it to save money , DiFiore said .
The state Licensure and Certification Bureau , which oversees the ambulatory surgical center , allowed it to stay open because the dangerous procedures were corrected .
But DiFiore quoted a health investigator who said , “ It ’s very hard to believe that they wo n’t do it again , ” when explaining why he was shuttering the clinic .
“ The fact that , once caught , you have agreed not to engage in a technique well known to the medical community to subject patients to death or serious illness again does not persuade me that you wo n’t do it again , ” DiFiore wrote .
Desai and the other Endoscopy Center owners would not comment for this story , on the advice of their attorneys , Abran Vigil and Alan Sklar .
DiFiore , who referred to the investigators from the Southern Nevada Health District , the Licensure and Certification Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a “ tiger team , ” said he was told by a CDC officer that the Endoscopy Center practices were so obviously dangerous it was like “ driving the wrong way down the freeway . ”
“ I do not believe that there is any department of motor vehicles in this country that would not immediately revoke the driving license of a driver when given credible evidence that the driver had driven the wrong way down the freeway every day for the past four years , ” he wrote .
Citing more information provided by the health investigators , DiFiore said many nurses knew the technique was dangerous to patients , but they were ordered by administrators , mainly Desai , “ to engage in the practice in order to save money . ”
Some followed Desai ’s orders and risked contaminating patients with life - threatening diseases , while others disobeyed him , DiFiore wrote .
Desai used to sit on the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners , which has now launched an investigation into the clinic , which is also owned by Dr. Vishvinder Sharma , Dr. Eladio Carrera and Dr. Clifford Carrol .
Dr. Jim Christensen , an allergist who is on the board of the Health District , said the allegations in DiFiore ’s letter elevate the situation from malpractice to criminal behavior .
District Attorney David Roger promised “ a massive investigation ” into what occurred at the clinic .
Can Helium be substituted ?
The answer is no for applications which need cooling below a temperature of minus 210 degrees centigrade since that is the temperature at which the next best thing , liquid nitrogen , freezes .
Helium on the other hand only liquifies at minus 272 degrees centigrade and stays in that state even down to absolute zero .
Making it the most precious element for cooling at very low temperatures .
For MRI scanning this means the available substitutes can only offer much higher temperatures at which the scanner can operate , implying less conductivity and therefore a less effective scanner .
Some of the great things that make human live much easier are dependent on rare non-renewable resources .
Helium is one of these , a noble gas with remarkable qualities due to its inert state .
It is used for example to cool metals needed to create superconductivity .
This process is applied in the medical industry to make Magnetic - Resonating - Image ( MRI ) scans , a technique to produce images of body tissue , making accurate diagnosis of health problems without surgery possible .
But Helium is also applied in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopty ( NMR ) , for the arc welding of various metals amongst which are titanium , magnesium and aluminium , to reduce high - pressure risk in deep - sea breathing systems , to purge and pressurize liquid - hydrogen rocket propulsion systems , to find leaks in pipelines , as a coolant in certain nuclear reactor types , possibly for superfluid gyroscopes and last and for me definetly the least , to let balloons float .
Introduction
Helium is a gas that over time came into existence mainly from the radiogenic decay of uranium and thorium in the earth ’s mantle .
As it migrated to the surface it has remained trapped in underground fields combined with other gasses and in the earth ’s atmosphere .
The forming rate is too slow to be of any relevance in the timescale of a few human generations .
Interestingly , very few studies are being done on the limitations of this resource .
Only one research group in the entire world is currently studying the topic .
The number of people who know a great deal about the future supply can be counted on one or maybe two hands .
One of these is Phil Kornbluth , executive vice president of Matheson Tri-Gas Global Helium .
For some background information on Helium I suggest listening to this interview with Kornbluth .
Types of Helium reserves
The sources of Helium on earth can be broadly divided into three categories ;
1 ) Helium rich resources from natural gas fields with a helium concentration of 0.3 % or higher ; 2 ) Helium lean resources from natural gas fields with a concentration below 0.3 % which mostly is uneconomical to extract ;
3 ) Atmospheric
Helium which will likely never be produced because it is too energy intensive to do so .
For the two sources of Helium from natural gas , there is little known about the energy costs of production since Helium has so far been produced as a by - product of natural gas production .
In this case only produced when the lifetime of the natural gas field and the gas resources warrant the construction of infrastructure to produce Helium for 20 years or longer .
How much Helium is there ?
The expected ultimate extractable amounts of Helium are estimated at 40,000 million Sm3 as of 1 January 2007 by the United States Geological Survey ( Sm3 = standard cubic meters ) .
Of this amount 93 % is endowed in six countries , the United States , Algeria , Canada , China , Qatar and Russia .
This ultimate extractable reserve base has been identified using an economic classification , not a geologic one .
The reserve classification here includes currently economic , marginally economic and some of the identified currently subeconomic reserves .
Of this ultimate extractable amount 7,030 million Sm3 has been classified as reserves that are extractable using existing technology under current economic conditions .
However , for Canada , China and Qatar this data is not available which makes the actual figure likely to be much higher .
The countries for which figures are available are the United States ( 3,500 million Sm3 ) , Algeria ( 1,850 million Sm3 ) and Russia ( 1,680 million Sm3 ) .
Since Helium is a by - product of natural gas production , and the discoveries of natural gas fields peaked in the ‘ 70s of the 20th century and have been on a declining trend ever since , it is unlikely that much more Helium reserves will be discovered .
The earth ’s endowment of Helium is therefore quite well known although the figures are not very precise .
This is due to a lack of a universal methodology to measure Helium reserves .
Whether these figure are on the upside or downside is unknown .
For reasons of political nature , governments worldwide normally have a tendency to exaggerate reserve figures and as a result it is likely that the expected ultimate amount of Helium in reality is lower .
The consumption & the lifetime of Helium
Figures for worldwide helium consumption are not available since there is no agency that tracks this data .
As there only is one storage for helium in the entire world , the Cliffside field in the United States managed by the federal bureau of land management , it can be inferred that world production statistics plus net stock drawdowns or minus net stock intakes in the United States roughly match consumption figures .
From these figure it can be concluded that Helium consumption has been rising steadily over time especially since the mid 80 ’s of the 20th century .
Figure 1 - Worldwide Helium Consumption from 1955 until 2004
With this methodology a world consumption number of 202 million Sm3 can be derived as of the year 2004 .
A static approach in which the expected ultimate extractable amounts are divided over present consumption gives a lifetime expectancy of 200 years for Helium .
Using a more dynamic approach , in which the average consumption growth from 1990 to 2004 namely 5 percent is continuously extrapolated , gives a resource lifetime of approximately 48 years .
Figure 2 - Helium Production in the Untied States from 1955 until 2004
Natural gas peaks , Helium peaks ?
However , this does not take into account that the production of a resource never follows a peak and then suddenly drops to near zero .
In reality resource production roughly follows a more smooth bell shaped curve due to the physical and economic conditions of extraction .
This is also true for natural gas fields and its associated helium .
To gain insights into the lifetime of a non-substitutable resource before it runs into its phase of scarcity no matter what technology or investment takes place , it would therefore be better to estimate the maximum possible rate of extraction .
For natural gas it has been estimated by independent scientists such as Jean Laherrère that the point of maximum production will be reached somewhere in the period of 2020 - 2030 .
Does that imply that Helium will become scarce somewhere in that period ?
Not necessarily because the number of Helium rich natural gas fields is very small .
If some of the natural gas fields are not developed on a speedy basis then the helium production curve will be much smoother and shortages will appear earlier .
Politics and economics come into play
Interestingly , these shortages are already here to a certain extent .
The price of Helium rose significantly in the past few years .
From a range of 1.5 to 1.8 dollars per Sm3 in the period 1995 - 2002 to a price of 3 dollars per Sm3 in 2006 .
The rise in prices occurred due to a scarcity of Helium as a result of production in the United States being in decline since 1999 .
Being the largest producer of Helium in the world this has led to a gap between supply and demand .
This gap is being filled up by stock drawdowns from the United States Helium Reserve .
This stock has declined from 985 million Sm3 in 1999 to 696 million Sm3 in 2006 .
Figure 3 - Helium in the United State Helium Reserve from 1995 until 2006
While sufficient reserves exist to scale up production in other countries these have been slow in response to the decline in production in the United States .
This is primarily due to the fact that Helium is a by - product of natural gas fields and operators make a decision not based on the availability of Helium but based on the need to develop Natural Gas Fields .
Some new production capacity is coming online in Qatar and Algeria in 2007 / 2008 , but this will not alleviate the situation to sustain a growth rate of 5 % .
For the near term future therefore , Helium prices will remain high until a large new source of production comes on - stream .
The Helium industry recognises this and is forecasting a tight demand - supply balance until at least 2011 .
Figure 4 - Expected Supply and Demand Balance up to 2011 according to Airproducts , one of the big Helium Supply companies in the world .
So how long will this tightness last ?
The first natural gas field that will bring sufficient quantities online that is being spoken about is Kovykta , which lies in Eastern Siberia in Russia .
This field contains 40 % to 50 % of the Russian Helium reserves and is intended to be developed to provide natural gas for China and to provide Helium supplies to the world .
Startup is expected to be 2015 at the earliest .
So we can expect the present constrained Helium supply to persist until at least 2015 , by which the federal helium reserve in the United States will be nearly depleted .
If the production of Kovykta is delayed much further beyond 2015 it could lead to severe worldwide Helium shortages .
2. Considering the whole ' risen from the dead ' thing , it would certainly follow .
1 . Is there anything he CAN 'T do ?
Depends who you ask .
For example :
3. Nice .
4. Slut .
5. Gotta love it .
6. Appropriate with regard to so many individuals .
7 . At least it 's not scrawled on a bathroom stall .
8 . I thought what mattered was n't the size of the boat but the motion of the ocean .
9 . Must be all the fish .
10 . Touché .
11 . Does he cut coupons too ?
12 . The two have a lot in common : whether they 're dead or alive depends on who you ask .
People crowded onto rooftops to watch the proceedings

Thousands of people have attended the funerals in Jerusalem of eight students killed by a Palestinian gunman at a Jewish religious college on Thursday .
People at the Mercaz Harav seminary openly wept as a rabbi recited prayers over the bodies of the victims .
Israel 's government has said the attack will not lead it to break off peace talks with the Palestinian Authority .
The gunman , who was shot dead by an army officer , was a resident of East Jerusalem and worked as a driver .
Israeli police named him as Ala Hashem Abu Dhaim , a 25 - year - old from the Jabal Mukabir neighbourhood .
His family set up a funeral tent outside their home there , adorned with the flags of Hamas , Islamic Jihad and the Lebanese militant group , Hezbollah .
Attack threatens wide fallout
In pictures : Victims buried Voices : Seminary shooting
His sister described him as quiet and intensely religious , but said he was not a member of a militant group .
Israeli security forces detained several of his male relatives , his fiancee , and a number of neighbours after the shooting , she added .
" They surrounded the building and raided my brother 's flat .
They smashed it up , took things away and arrested all these people , " she told the BBC Arabic Service .
A previously unknown group called the Jalil Freedom Battalions - the Martyrs of Imad Mughniyeh and Gaza , claimed it was behind the attack , Hezbollah 's al - Manar television channel reported .
Imad Mughniyeh , a senior Hezbollah leader and military commander , was killed in a car bomb in the Syrian capital , Damascus , on 12 February .
The BBC's Crispin Thorold in Jerusalem says that until Israel establishes whether the statement is true , it is unclear how it will respond .
However , the outpouring of public grief will add to pressure on the Israeli government to end the peace talks with the Palestinians , our correspondent says .
Palestinian Authority President broke off contacts with the Israelis at the weekend after an Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip killed more than 120 people .
Settler stronghold Sobbing and wailing filled the air at the funerals for the eight religious students killed in what the Israeli government described as a massacre on Thursday night .
Thousands gathered outside the bullet - scarred seminary to attend the ceremony as a rabbi recited Hebrew psalms in memory of the victims , all but one of whom were aged between 15 and 19 .
The eldest victim was 26 years old .
Police have named Ala Abu Dhaim as the gunman " The time for us has come to understand that an external struggle as well as an internal struggle is raging , " Rabbi Yaakov Shapira told the crowd .
Abu
Dhaim entered the library at the seminary in West Jerusalem , where about 80 students were gathered , and fired an AK - 47 rifle for several minutes , witnesses said .
Students scrambled to flee the scene , jumping out of windows , witnesses said .
A student reportedly shot the gunman twice before an off - duty Israeli army officer killed him .
Dani Speigel , a student from the seminary - called a yeshiva in Hebrew - told the BBC of the loss that his school had suffered .
" Well , it 's very hard here in the yeshiva , we 're having a very hard time .
What people do not understand is that kids , 14 years old , 15 years old , 16 years old , high school kids died here yesterday , " he said .
MERCAZ HARAV SEMINARY
Founded in 1924 by influential Rabbi Avraham Hacohen Kook Some 500 students enrolled in Talmudic study Students mainly high - school age and young adults Graduates serve as rabbis and rabbinical judges in Israel and Jewish settlements School has played a major role in ideology and theology of Israeli religious settlement movement Key figures linked to the school were strongly opposed to Israeli pull - out from Gaza
Grim mood at seminary World reaction in quotes The BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen says that the school was no ordinary seminary .
It was the ideological cradle of the settler movement in the West Bank , which could be the reason it was targeted .
Many of its students are on special courses that combine religious study with service in combat units in the Israeli army .
Our editor says that those who gathered at the seminary ahead of the victims ' funerals were people who were already opposed to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's decision to engage in talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas .
This incident will only make stronger their determination to stop any agreements going through , our editor says .
Blow to talks
The Palestinian leadership has been split between Mr Abbas 's Fatah faction , in control of the West Bank , and Hamas , who have ruled Gaza since forcing out Fatah last year .
The Palestinians - without Hamas - have been engaged in a US - launched peace process with the Israelis since late last year .
Hamas supporters celebrated the attack , drawing condemnation from Mr Abbas as well as Israel .
DEADLY ATTACKS ON ISRAELIS 4 Feb 2008 : One dies , Dimona suicide bombing 29 Apr 2007 : Three die , Eilat suicide bombing 17 Apr 2006 : Nine die , 40 wounded , suicide bombing near old bus station in Tel Aviv 30 Mar 2006 : Four die , Kedumim suicide bombing 29 Dec 2005 :

The Israeli operations aim to stop Palestinian militants from firing rockets from Gaza that have been hitting its border towns since it ended its permanent military presence in Gaza in 2005 .
There was international condemnation of Thursday 's shooting .
UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said it was " clearly an attempt to strike a blow at the very heart of the peace process " .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called it a " savage attack " , but the UN Security Council failed to agree on a statement .
HAVE YOUR SAY
As long as Gaza keeps firing missiles into Israeli towns , Israel will do everything to defend itself Elaine , UK The Libyan representative said his country and several others wanted the council to couple any condemnation of the Jerusalem shootings with one against Israel for killing large numbers of civilians , including children , in Gaza .
Israel has occupied East Jerusalem since the 1967 war and annexed the area , a move not recognised by the international community .
Israel regards the entire city as its " eternal , indivisible " capital and has settled hundreds of thousands of Jews in East Jerusalem .
The Palestinians hope to establish the capital of their future state in East Jerusalem , which is home to about 240,000 Palestinians .

What are these ?
In my last posting on this blog I emphasized that my primary goal as the new CEO of Tesla Motors was to get the car on the road .
The potential of this company is vast but it is dependent on meeting our commitments and that starts with delivering the 2008 Tesla Roadster to our customers .
Since my previous communication we have obtained all the required regulatory approvals for the sale of the Roadster in the US and delivered the first production Tesla Roadster .
We also set at that time a date of March 17th 2008 for the start of regular production of the Roadster .
I am pleased to report to you that we have met this commitment and have begun regular production .
While this is an important milestone for the company and a watershed for the new era of electric vehicles , we still have a lot of work to do .
Our key focus with the Roadster will be on gradually ramping up our production in a deliberate and controlled manner reaching a rate of over 100 Roadsters per month early next year .
At this point our attention is expanding into the sales and service arena marked by the opening of our Los Angeles store and Menlo Park store in the near future .
We are determined to provide a customer sales and service experience that will not only raise the bar to the automobile business but will far exceed the best available anywhere .
Our customers have been a key part of this journey to date , staying engaged and loyal as they have watched us closely through our development process .
We plan on rewarding this loyalty by delivering a revolutionary car and providing a level of service that inspires confidence and a sense of association with a company that really cares .
With this milestone , the Tesla Roadster is the only zero emission electric vehicle in production today – this is in stark contrast to the others who only talk about their future plans .
Tesla ’s remarkable achievement validates the vision , ingenuity , hard work and commitment of Tesla ’s employees .
Tesla will further expand its existing technological lead as we build and deliver thousands of Roadsters per year .
With innovative EV technology , a strong brand , and being ahead of the pack , Tesla has established an extraordinary platform for future success .

Hersh : Israel pressed me to agree Syrian site was nuclear Muriel Kane

This A new article by veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh offers a detailed examination of the claims that Israel bombed a nuclear facility under construction in Syria last September and finds that none of the evidence stands up to scrutiny .
According to Hersh , " A former senior U.S. intelligence official , who has access to current intelligence , said , ' We do n't have any proof of a reactor  no signals intelligence , no human intelligence , no satellite intelligence . ' "
However , Hersh found that the Israelis were continuing to stand adamantly by their claims : " When I went to Israel in late December , the government was still maintaining secrecy about the raid , but some current and former officials and military officers were willing to speak without attribution .
Most were adamant that Israels intelligence had been accurate .
' Dont you write that there was nothing there ! ' a senior Israeli official , who is in a position to know the details of the raid on Syria , said , shaking a finger at me .
' The thing in Syria was real . ' "
Just one Israeli official expressed doubts , but also brushed them away : " Retired Brigadier General Shlomo Brom , who served as deputy national - security adviser under Prime Minister Ehud Barak , told me that Israel wouldnt have acted if it hadnt been convinced that there was a threat .
' It may have been a perception of a conviction , but there was something there , ' Brom said .
' It was the beginning of a nuclear project . '
However , by the date of our talk , Brom told me , ' The question of whether it was there or not is not that relevant anymore . ' "
One Syrian official suggested to Hersh that the Israelis may have picked up the presence of North Korean laborers at the site and drawn their own conclusions .
" ' The Israelis may have their own spies and watched the laborers being driven to the area , ' the senior officer said .
' The Koreans were not there at night , but slept in their quarters and were driven to the site in the morning .
The building was in an isolated area , and the Israelis may have concluded that even if there was a slight chance '  of it being a nuclear facility  ' we 'll take that risk . ' "
RAW STORY 's Larisa Alexandrovna reported last fall that current and former intelligence privately agreed the Syrian facility was not nuclear in nature .
Hersh 's article is the first major mainstream confirmation of that reporting .

Speedcabling skills would often come in useful at the BBC
The first " speedcabling " competition took place in an art gallery in Los Angeles and was won by LA - based web developer Matthew Howell .
The challenge was devised by IT professional Steven Schkolne .
Contestants are faced with a tangled mass of six ethernet cables of various lengths .
Their task is simply to separate them in the fastest time .
To get them to replicate the conditions of the wires found snaking and choking their way around hard drive units , monitors and printers in offices worldwide , Schkolne first started by tangling them in a figure eight .
Then he threw the bundles in a clothes dryer - no longer attached to any computer unit , naturally .
" I did a bunch of experiments and found that putting them in a dryer for three minutes works pretty well , it allows them to tangle naturally , " he told BBC World Service 's Digital Planet programme .
" After that , they 're pretty much how they appear in nature . "
Victory posture
Two years ago , Mr Schkolne began to wonder if others shared both his skill and his passion for detangling cables .
Asking around among friends and colleagues in Los Angeles , he found there was interest in a race to prove who was the king of the cables .
" You separate the cable , and then you have to hold the full cable above your head , " he said , outlining the sport 's finer points
Matthew Howell developed his technique as a pizza maker
" And this allows the judge to see it 's been clearly separated .
It also allows the winner to form a kind of victory posture - raising their arms above their head when they 're done . "
Crucially , the cables also have to be able to carry a network signal after detangling .
" The finals were brutal - 12 ethernet cords , some as long as 25 feet , all knotted into a nasty bundle , " said eventual winner Mr Howell .
Explaining his detangling technique , he said : " Each cable is its own rabbit hole .
" So before going down one of those cable paths , up and around , weaving in and out , you have to pull it apart .
" You have to pull the pieces out , and really call on the element of air . "
And to get that " air , " Howell drew on some previous work experience - kneading pizza dough .
" You kind of pull it , let it go , then you let it kind of spin in between your hands - and you do n't really hold onto it for too long , " he said .
" Keep spinning and pulling , and it 's really just kind of a 3D version of that pizza dough thing above your head , and then you see these little pieces flip out , and you pull them out . "
Howell dubs his technique " fierce data cloud . "
His prize for winning was a $ 50 gift certificate for dinner at a local Italian restaurant .
Imagine , for a moment , that U.S. troops invading Iraq had , as they neared Baghdad , been fired on by an artillery unit using shells filled VX nerve gas — an attack that would have lasted minutes before a U.S. aircrew had taken out the battery , and may have brought a horrible death to a handful of American soldiers .
Imagine , further , that the conquering troops had later discovered two warehouses full of VX and mustard gas shells .
And later , that inspectors in a science lab had discovered a refrigerator full of Botulinum toxin or even anthrax .
The Administration and its allies in the punditocracy would have “ proved ” their case for war , and the media would have hailed President Bush as the kind of Churchillian visionary that he imagines himself to be .
And goodness knows what new adventures the Pentagon ideologues would have immediately begun planning .
Now , ask yourself , had the above scenario unfolded and the “ case for war ” ( on the terms accepted by the media and the Democrats ) been proven , would Iraq look any different today ?
Would it be any less of a bloodbath ; any less of a quagmire for U.S. troops ; any less of a geopolitical disaster ; any less of a drain on U.S. blood and treasure ?
Would the U.S. mainland or U.S. interests and allies worldwide be any safer today ?
In short , would the Iraq invasion seem any less of a catastrophic strategic blunder had the U.S. discovered some caches of unconventional weapons in Iraq ?
The answer to all of those questions is obviously no .
And it ’s from that point that we must begin our discussion on Iran , and the media ’s role in preparing the American public for another disastrous war of choice .
The “ necessity ” in the American public mind to go to war in Iraq was established through the mass media — a failure for which there has been precious little accounting .
But that failure runs far deeper than is typically acknowledged even by critics :
It was not simply a case of the media failing to properly and critically interrogate the spurious claims by the Administration of Iraq ’s Weapons of Mass Destruction capability .
Sure , even the likes of France and Germany suspected that Saddam may , in fact , have still had a few piles of chemical munitions left over from the Iran - Iraq war .
The point , however , is that they did not see these as justifying a war .
They recognized from the outset that invading Iraq would cause more problems than it would solve .
The more important failure of the U.S. media , then , is its failure to question the basic proposition that if Iraq had , indeed , had unconventional weapons , then an invasion and occupation of that country was a wise and prudent course of action .
Of course many of the decision - makers in the U.S. media in the wake of 9/11 were scared and confused , and looking for John Wayne - style authority figures for comfort — read back now and you ’ll find some astounding toadying up to the self - styled tough guys of the Administration : Bill Keller ’s wet - kiss profile of Paul Wolfowitz in the New York Times suggested to me a man playing out Robert Mitchum ’s epiphany in The Green Berets , the jaded liberal recognizing the harsh truths of John Wayne ’s approach to making the world safe for freedom .
And Donald Rumsfeld ’s loquacious buffoonery created a comforting sense of certainty among a liberal media intelligentsia suddenly desperate to embrace an imperial mythology , and in the case of the George Packers and Peter Beinarts , to render it profound as a narrative of global liberation .
Others simply preferred to avoid anything that might have demagogues branding them “ un-American , ” for fear of losing ad dollars .
That may help explain the failure , but it does not excuse it .
The fact that carnival barkers like Kristol and Beinart continue to be touted as having opinions worth heeding on these matters is ample evidence that the media has either learned little , or else is more dedicated to a kind of edutainment vaudeville than in empowering the American people to make informed foreign policy choices .
Beinart , in a mawkish attempt to account for himself in the excellent Bill Moyers documentary Buying the War , offers up this little gem :
“ The argument in the fall of 2002 was not mostly about the facts , it was about a whole series of ideas about what would happen if we invaded . ”
Exactly .
The fact that Beinart and company were wrong on the facts was only part of the problem .
More importantly , it was their ideas about the use of force and its consequences that proved so disastrously flawed .
And most of the decision - makers in the mainstream media did not bother to challenge the basic proposition that if Saddam had certain categories of weapons , then an invasion was necessary and beneficial .
The very idea that there are certain categories of weapons that draw down a red mist over rational discussion of geopolitical options is an exceedingly dangerous one — that should be one of the key lessons drawn from Iraq .
And that ’s exactly what ’s being cooked up over Iran , too .
The very same crew of neocons and liberal hawks and the Israeli political establishment and its allies in Washington , are goading America to attack Iran .
They insist Iran is going hell for leather to acquire nuclear weapons , and allowing it to do so represents a mortal threat to the West , Arab moderates and Israel .
And just when a convenient excuse was needed for the U.S. failure in Iraq and Afghanistan , would n’t you know it , it ’s those darn Iranians “ interfering ” .
Do n’t even think about discussing , what , are you Neville Chamberlain or something ?
Do n’t you know it ’s 1938 all over again ?
Of course , not all of it is as plain silly as the paragraph above .
( For the record :
First , there is no evidence that Iran is actually building a nuclear weapon ; merely that it is building a civilian nuclear energy program with all elements of the fuel cycle permissible under the NPT that would , in fact , put nuclear weapons easily within reach should they opt to build them .
Second , even if Iran did possess nuclear weapons , the idea that it would use them to initiate a conflict in which Tehran would certainly be destroyed is based on tabloid - style alarmism about the nature of the regime in Tehran — in fact , Iran ’s Islamic Republic has long proved to be guided more by unsentimental realpolitik than by revolutionary fervor in the pursuit of its national interests and regional influence .
It took eight years for Nur Muhammad , 35 , finally to fall pregnant with the child she desperately wanted .
Last week ,
Ali , her pride and joy , became the youngest victim of the upswing in violence .
The four - month - old baby boy fell ill last Monday with a fever , the day fighting broke out in Basra , the second - biggest oil city of Iraq .
The street where the family lives became a battlefield , imprisoning them in their home , unable to get help .
' The disease spread so fast .
My husband tried to leave our home to look for help but he was shot in his leg in front of our house , ' Muhammad said .
' My only child was seriously sick and I also had to look after my injured husband .
I was forced to use a knife sterilised with a lighter to take the bullet from his leg . '
No one was able to reach the house with medicine or food until Friday afternoon .
Ali had died in the morning .
' It took me a few hours to realise my son had become an angel .
He was shining and had a smile on his face , ' she said .
' I waited all my life to have my baby and now a ridiculous political fight for supremacy took him away from me . '
Muhammad , tears streaming down her hollow cheeks , was in deep shock .
' I do n't have a reason to live anymore .
My husband threatened to divorce me if I did n't give him a child and now I doubt he will stay married to me now that Ali has been taken . '
Since Monday , when Basra erupted in violent clashes between the Mahdi army of Shia leader Moqtada al - Sadr and the Iraqi government , hundreds of families have been unable to leave their homes to look for food , water , health care , and oil for generators .
Officials report that more than 160 have been killed and at least 400 injured in the last five days .
' By the time many of the injured reach the hospital , they can not be saved .
The difficulties in getting to medical centres also costs lives .
Even medical staff can't get to work as the situation on street remains critical , ' said a clinician at Basra Main Hospital , who asked to remain anonymous .
' We are lacking medical supplies and parts of the hospitals have no electricity .
Pregnant women are risking home deliveries . '
Khalid Jalal , 36 , a pharmacist and father of three , said his family had been without food and electricity since Tuesday .
He said : ' My children are starving and masked militants have prohibited us from leaving our home .
I cannot stand seeing my kids crying for food and forced to drink unclean water because militants believe they are God 's soldiers .
' God does n't want a human being to suffer - but that is what the fighters and the government are giving us , rather than the promised US democracy .
They are looking for supremacy while innocent people die for no reason , ' he said .
' I was happy when the British troops left Basra , but now I urge them to come back to save the lives of my children . '
The International Committee of Red Cross is concerned about the humanitarian impact of fighting in Basra and Baghdad and says many families are now reduced to bringing their own generators to Baghdad hospitals to ensure they have sufficient power supplies .
Schools , universities government offices and shops are closed in Basra and many neighbourhoods of Baghdad .
Streets are empty and few faces can be seen near windows .
In the Shia mosques of Baghdad , Basra , Hilla , Nasiriyah and other southern provinces , religious leaders call for support and criticise the government 's attitude towards Sadr followers .
They accuse the Shia Prime Minister , Nouri al - Maliki , of being a betrayer and an American devotee .
There are food and medicine stockpiles in a number of warehouses in Basra but so far it has been impossible to distribute them .
Aid delivery has stopped inside the city until security improves .
A curfew in Basra was eased on Friday to allow movement around the city from 6 am to 6 pm but , in many districts , the actions of militants have kept them indoors .
British military spokesman Major Tom Holloway said coalition forces were providing air support and helpinto refuel Iraqi helicopters and transport planes .
' The British military is providing air power over Basra as the Iraqi air force does n't have fast jets yet , ' Holloway said .
' We are closely helping to provide military support to bring peace back to Basra . '
Funerals have been seen taking places in areas of Baghdad and Basra where clashes have diminished ; anger and desperation are etched on the mourners ' faces .
' My uncle and cousin were killed in an air strike in Sadr City on Friday .
The US says it is just attacking militants so how can they explain how two innocent people , who were hard workers and far from politics and social issues , are now dead ? ' said Assad Hassan Alawi , 24 , a student in Sadr City .
' They left women and children without anyone to bring them food .
Maybe they are going to be the next victims - not from an air strike , but from hunger caused by the unfair Iraq invasion , ' he said .
' I 'm against the war , the fight for power and any religious leader who , instead of spreading the true Islamic peace , multiplies violence and death . '
THE US political process bears an uncanny resemblance to mainstream filmmaking .
Elections and speeches are scripted to the letter , politicians put on a tirelessly rehearsed act , catering endlessly to the whims of the target audience .
A successful Hollywood filmmaker can’t afford to risk raising issues in a way that did n’t immediately reflect audience sympathies .
Good politicians vying for votes are similar in that they speak according to the already existing expectations — and prejudices — of the voting public .
Rarely do candidates stand behind a podium without amending or overriding their personal beliefs in return for generating applause .
You would hardly hear , for example , of a US presidential candidate getting booed by an audience .
Candidates do not bring fresh principles to the table , but instead shape their views based on what national and local polls tell them matters to the voting public .
And what matters is largely manipulated by the media and the state .
Their combined scare tactics , for example , convinced most Americans of outright falsehoods , such as Saddam ’s ties to 9/11 , his stockpiles of WMDs , the ‘ liberation ’ of women in Afghanistan , and so forth .
In a healthy democracy , the media is expected to represent the interests of the people — all the people , while the government serves as a conduit to carrying and defending these interests without violating the constitution .
But in the age of evangelical fanatics , lobby groups , international corporations and lucrative Iraq contracts , democracy itself can be placed on hold .
Indeed , maintaining the image of a democracy while violating its genuine principles has consumed the efforts of successive US administrations .
No other administration , however , has compromised the interest of the American people and flouted the constitution as much as the brazen Bush administration .
No wonder Republicans were squarely defeated in the Congressional elections of 2006 .
Americans clearly voted for change , but change in a system so skilfully corrupt does n’t come easy .
The way in which Democrats supported the recent spending bill for 2008 , their vacillating stance on Iraq , and their downright hawkish stance on Iran say volumes about their contribution to maintaining the status quo .
Democrats are also bound by the roles of the game .
They need the money , media coverage and lobbyists .
Currently , there are 35,000 registered federal lobbyists representing all sorts of special interests , including foreign powers such as Israel , whose collaborative role in the Iraq fiasco is too blatant to overlook .
Barak Obama , who does indeed have little experience of understanding how the system works still possesses a talent for pleasing the crowd .
Thus his initial assertion that lobbyists “ wo n’t work in my White House ” .
Then , possibly after being told by his campaign managers that special interests are more influential than the rest of the country , he tweaked his vow slightly whereby lobbyists “ are not going to dominate my White House . ”
Although his pledge changed its substance almost entirely , he was able to receive victory in Iowa .
For now , analysts can extract temporary comfort from the prevailing interpretation of the Iowa caucuses ’ results .
Obama was elected by the Democratic caucuses with 37 per cent because he was the only nominee that managed to present a truly new message — that he and only he can advocate real ‘ change ’ .
As for former Arkansas governor , Republican Mike Huckabee , he was the best possible candidate to represent the Republican voters ’ conservative concerns .
The former Baptist pastor is the rising star of the Christian evangelicals who boast 40 million followers , all tied by an outrageous message of doomsday .
Rev Stan Moody of the Christian Policy Institute , writes , “ Huckabee is a Rapturist ” in reference to the mid-19th Century interpretation of biblical text which culminated in 1909 as the Scofield Desk Reference Bible .
This envisions — and not metaphorically — a Greater Israel as a precondition to the return of Christ , who , with the true Christians , will defeat Satanic forces , convert 144,000 Jews and exterminate the rest .
It has no Harry Potter twists , but it puts Hollywood horror movies to shame .
The actual concern is that this group has cultivated an alliance with the Israeli government since the late 1970s and is a major power broker in US foreign policy in the Middle East .
In her article , which appeared in the Jerusalem Post on January 3 , Hilary Leila Krieger reported from Iowa that Huckabee “ has also been staunchly supportive of Israel , writing in Foreign Affairs that , ‘ I will not waver in standing by our ally Israel . ’
It is a country he has visited several times , leading groups there as well as taking his family . ”
According to the same article , “ Huckabee has drawn on his experience in the Holy Land in making his pitch to voters , which has especially resonated with evangelicals . ”
With the notable exceptions of Republican Ron Paul and Democrat Dennis Kucinich , most visible presidential candidates were eager to compromise the interest of their country to guarantee that of Israel ’s .
Clinton and Obama exemplify this .
The Jewish Telegraphic Agency wrote , “ Obama has always enjoyed strong Jewish support since entering state politics in Illinois in 1996 , although some in the pro-Israel establishment are wary of his calls to negotiate with rogue states such as Syria and Iran . ”
JTA , of course , nonchalantly substitute the word ‘ Zionist ’ for ‘ Jewish ’ , but that ’s another story .
While supporting Israel , right or wrong , is business as usual for US politicians , Huckabee ’s advent — described as the ‘ second coming ’ of Ronald Reagan by a producer at an Iowa TV station — is the truly alarming trend .
He cannot simply be dismissed as a lunatic Armageddonist who thinks that he can win an election ; he actually captured the Republican endorsement in Iowa .
Huckabee knows well how to carry the momentum to the next destination —he needs to keep up the religious fervour , as narrow - minded and irrational as it may be .
We are told that this is what voters are expecting .
To win , like a good filmmaker , Huckabee must deliver .
Life can indeed resemble the movies , but in the case of US elections the movie has become so familiar and predictable that it ’s no longer be even entertaining .

Pubblichiamo nuovo interessante articolo di Alessandra Ferretti , giornalista , che collabora con diverse testate nazionali su temi economici .
Quest articolo è dedicato al concetto di fornitura globale .
Integrare per crescere .
Più esattamente , integrare tecnologie e managerialità per diventare , da fornitori , veri e propri partner d?impresa .
Una tendenza , questa , che si sta imponendo sempre di più tra le aziende italiane e che viene considerata ormai una vera e propria necessità .
Sul tema abbiamo chiesto un?opinione a chi davvero se ne intende .
Vincenzo Baglieri , Direttore dell ?
Area Produzione Tecnologica e Assistant Professor di Economia e gestione delle imprese all ?
Università Bocconi ( foto a sinistra ) , spiega : ? I tempi e i modi con cui si fa business sono cambiati .
Anzitutto , la domanda evolve più rapidamente e le aziende contraggono i cicli di vita dei propri prodotti e servizi attraverso offerte sostitutive .
Quindi , chi produce e gestisce competenze tecnologiche non può vivere in contesti organizzativi distinti da chi possiede invece le competenze per tradurre le tecnologie in prodotti e servizi ?.
Come cambia dunque il rapporto di un? azienda col proprio cliente nel momento in cui questi viene considerato un ? partner ??
Ancora Baglieri : ?
Essere partner , nei confronti dei clienti e/o dei fornitori , significa pensare che , oltre a relazioni conflittuali e negoziali , si possano intessere rapporti basati sulla collaborazione reciproca .
In altre parole , significa mantenere le proprie autonomie , ma cercare insieme soluzioni di sviluppo congiunto sulla base di una fiducia tra le parti .
A queste condizioni , il coinvolgimento di un cliente nell ? attività di sviluppo del prodotto è un vantaggio per entrambi gli attori .
Perché ?
Il cliente riceve la giusta innovazione ed il fornitore investe le proprie risorse nel modo migliore ?.
Che spazio avrà dunque l’integrazione di managerialità e tecnologia nella formazione dei nuovi manager ?
Ancora Baglieri : ?
Notevole , perché si tratta di un profilo professionale nuovo .
Da parte nostra , attraverso la formazione manageriale che facciamo in SDA Bocconi sui temi del Technology e dell ?
Innovation Management , sottolineiamo sia l?urgenza di dedicare risorse alla creazione di processi aziendali finalizzati allo sviluppo dell ?
innovazione tecnologica in chiave strategica , sia la necessità di disegnare e dare contenuto , negli organigrammi , alla ?casella ? del Direttore dell ?
Innovazione ” .
Un attore che ha già messo in pratica questo approccio è Bosch Rexroth .
Leader mondiale nel settore dell ?
automazione industriale , solo in Italia il gruppo vanta un giro d’affari di 370 milioni di euro e un indotto di 1.500 addetti .
Carlo Castagnola , Regional Manager del gruppo ( foto a destra ) , riferisce : ? Già in seguito alla fusione di Bosch e Rexroth abbiamo cercato un vantaggio competitivo nell ?
integrazione dei prodotti tra di loro ovvero nella strategia cosiddetta Drive & Control .
Tuttavia , col tempo abbiamo compreso come l?innovazione non potesse limitarsi ai soli prodotti o tecnologie .
Era necessario rivedere anche i processi mentali ?.
? Si è trattato di un?evoluzione naturale ? , prosegue Castagnola , ?aiutata naturalmente dalla disponibilità di ingredienti che avevamo nelle nostre ?
cucine ?.
Così , dal concetto di Drive & Control siamo giunti a quello di ?
fornitura globale ?
o , come preferisco chiamarla , di ? partner d?impresa ?.
La novità consiste proprio nel considerare e trattare il partner di fornitura , fin dall ?
ideazione di un nuovo prodotto industriale , come parte attiva del processo di ottimizzazione e ingegnerizzazione .
Come ha sentenziato qualcuno , ? in certe aree dell ? attività umana la contaminazione porta sempre a risultati positivi ?.
Ebbene , ora io dico : “ contaminiamoci ?.
Un concetto , questo , che Bosch Rexroth ha fatto proprio anche per la formazione dei nuovi manager .
Un attore che ha già messo in pratica questo approccio è Bosch Rexroth .
Leader mondiale nel settore dell ?
automazione industriale , solo in Italia il gruppo vanta un giro d’affari di 370 milioni di euro e un indotto di 1.500 addetti . , Regional Manager del gruppo ( foto a destra ) , riferisce : prosegue Castagnola , Ebbene , ora io dico :
Un concetto , questo , che Bosch Rexroth ha fatto proprio anche per la formazione dei nuovi manager .
Obiettivo di TEC , scuola di formazione del gruppo nata in Italia nel 2003 , è insegnare infatti proprio l?integrazione dell ?
anima tecnologica e di quella manageriale in azienda .
Da un anno a questa parte , inoltre , è attivo un laboratorio a disposizione degli ingegneri con le più diverse specializzazioni , ai quali il lavoro di gruppo facilita notevolmente lo scambio e l?interazione delle rispettive specializzazioni .
Novità assoluta è invece il ?
Centro di competenza del food & packaging ? , nato proprio recentemente presso il centro regionale Bosch Rexroth di Bologna con l?obiettivo di studiare le soluzioni globali di automazione anche in questo complesso settore .
Ma la logica della fornitura globale contraddistingue anche Biesse , leader tra i costruttori di macchine per la lavorazione del legno e partner di Bosch Rexroth .
Pietro Possenti , Responsabile Acquisti di Biesse ( foto a sinistra ) , gruppo da 480 milioni di euro , 2.300 addetti e una quotazione a Piazza Affari al Segmento Star , illustra l?esperienza dell?azienda : ?
Il 2003 ha segnato per Biesse un anno critico , occasione di profonde riflessioni .
E? stato allora che abbiamo pensato , tra le altre cose , anche ad un approccio più strategico , ? globale ? , appunto , con i fornitori .
I requisiti della ? fornitura globale ??
Primo : un buon terreno fertile ovvero un cliente maturo capace di saper misurare i vantaggi competitivi di un sourcing strategico , non solo sotto la forma del prezzo , ma soprattutto sotto la forma del valore .
Secondo : una buona pianta ovvero un fornitore leader capace di sapersi esprimere in forma competitiva e tecnologica a qualsiasi livello .
Entrambi devono avere una base comune su cui mettere in equilibrio anche i progetti più complessi , la volontà di creare e far crescere il valore nel tempo .
In questo modo , la competitività non è vista più solo sul componente singolo , ma sul complessivo , non coinvolge solo la funzione acquisti , ma tutta l?azienda .
I clienti si aspettano da noi competitività e innovazione tecnologica e , in un contesto come questo , l?integrazione diventa fondamentale ?.

Fred Thompson ’s departure could shake up the race more than his continued presence .
If Thompson exits , he 's expected to endorse John McCain .
Thompson may drop out , back McCain
DES MOINES , Iowa — Several Republican officials close to Fred Thompson ’s presidential campaign said they expect the candidate will drop out of the race within days if he finishes poorly in Thursday ’s Iowa caucus .
Thompson ’s campaign , which last spring and summer was generating fevered anticipation in the media and with some Republican activists , has never ignited nationally , and there are no signs of a late spark happening here in Iowa , where even a third - place finish is far from assured .

This reality — combined with a fundraising drought — left well - connected friends and advisers of Thompson Wednesday evening predicting that he will pull the plug on hype and hope before the Jan.
8 New Hampshire primary .
Thompson ’s departure could shake up the race more than his continued presence .
Friends and advisers said they have long considered it likely that if the lobbyist - actor is forced from the race he would endorse John McCain , his former Senate colleague who lately has been staging a political revival in New Hampshire .
“ Without a solid third - place finish , there ’s no point in going on , ” a Thompson adviser said Wednesday .
“ It was an honorable race , and he turned out to be a good candidate .
The moment had just passed . ”
A Thompson campaign source said there is “ a strong likelihood ” that if Thompson comes in a distant third in Iowa , with less than 15 percent of the vote , he would drop out soon — most likely before this weekend ’s New Hampshire presidential debates .
The Thompson sources said they were describing a consensus expectation that is now widespread among his political circle , not announcing a decision that the candidate himself has definitively reached .
But Thompson lately has been dropping clear signals that he has reached an up - or - out moment of his own .
On Wednesday he took the unusual step of raising expectations for himself at a time when most other candidates are trying to lower them .
When asked what Iowa results he’d be happy with , Thompson held up two fingers , indicating a second - place finish , according to reporters who were with him .
He did something similar on Sunday , when Thompson — apparently in a semi- jocular mood — dismayed his staff by telling reporters that he needed to finish second in the caucuses , a bar that nobody here expects him to cross .
Thompson aides have long said he needs an early victory to serve as a bridge to connect him to the key Southern contests that he envisioned propelling him to the nomination .
Thompson had pinned his hopes entirely on Iowa serving that role .
But every recent poll has showed him lagging in a distant third .
Thompson picked up a key endorsement in the backing of Rep.
Steve King , a conservative who represents the western part of the state , and had won acclaim from conservative activists for his closing message to Iowa voters , a Web video arguing that the Democratic candidates are all running to the left and beholden to special interests like the National Education Association .
Thompson , the former U.S. senator from Tennessee and “ Law and Order ” actor , brought a dash of celebrity and down - home humor to the strait - laced field of Republican candidates .
But conservatives ’ excitement quickly dissipated after he got off to a sluggish start and showed only sporadic enthusiasm for campaigning .
Recently , his stump speeches have dripped with contempt for the press and the campaign process , and this week he even joked about napping .
On New Year ’s Day , he held just one campaign event at a time when the top candidates were going full throttle .
His war chest was so depleted that he was unable to advertise on television after Christmas , and was only able to get back on the air in Iowa by blasting a stream of e-mails pleading for contributions .
Friends and advisers emphasized that no deal has been cut to have Thompson endorse McCain .
But they note that there would be a logic to doing so soon , in order to help a friend and colleague at a moment when he needs it most .
In turn , Thompson might be named attorney general in a McCain administration .
Trying to fend off rumors about an impending demise of the campaign , Thompson issued a news release Wednesday afternoon saying he plans to participate in debates in New Hampshire on Saturday and Sunday .
Thompson was alone in issuing such a release :
No other campaign thought that was necessary .
Despite the air of doom hovering over his candidacy , Thompson has not yet shared his intentions with the campaign or indicated to friends that he has reached a decision in tandem with his wife , Jeri , an influential adviser .
Campaign underlings continue to make plans as far ahead as Super Tuesday , Feb . 5 .
“ Doing well in Iowa means exceeding expectations , and Fred has been exceeding expectations for more than 40 years , ” said Karen Henretty , a Thompson spokeswoman .
“ Thursday ’s results are n’t likely to close any chapters . ”
But other advisers to Thompson described his campaign as “ broke ” and said that without a shot of momentum from Iowa , continuing the campaign would be pointless and impractical .
Thompson advisers expect Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee to claim the two top spots in the Iowa caucuses .
The main suspense is whether Thompson will finish close enough to get credit for a surprisingly strong performance , coaxing him to keep battling , or will finish far behind .
Thompson and McCain had a close relationship until the former actor entered the White House race .
In 2000 , Thompson was one of just four Senate Republicans to endorse McCain ’s presidential bid .
At the start of this year , Thompson was even making phone calls on behalf of McCain ’s campaign .
Thompson has built little support in New Hampshire , so his endorsement would not mean a lot for McCain there .
But Thompson has been near the top of most polls in South Carolina , which holds its primary on Jan. 19 .
So his backing there could help McCain capitalize on any momentum he picks up in the first two contests .

Rice today entered the race debate that has been a simmering undercurrent of the presidential campaign when she said it had been " important " for Barack Obama to give his landmark speech on race and defended the patriotism of African Americans .
The US secretary of state also decried the " birth defect " of slavery that she said has left Americans struggling to confront racism .
" Africans and Europeans came here and founded this country together - Europeans by choice and Africans in chains , " Rice told the Washington Times .
" That 's not a very pretty reality of our founding . "
Rice , the second African - American and second female in US history to lead the state department , grew up in Alabama at the height of the civil rights movement in America .
One of her childhood playmates was killed in an infamous 1963 church bombing committed by white supremacists , whom Rice has called " terrorists " .
She declined to comment directly on the presidential campaign in the Times interview , saying only that it was " important " that Obama " gave it for a whole host of reasons " , but strongly defended the patriotism of African Americans .
Video clips of Barack Obama 's former pastor , Jeremiah Wright , shouting , " God damn America , " ignited the race row that has been dominating the Democratic presidential race .
Conservatives have also accused Obama and his wife , Michelle , of displaying insufficient love for the country .
" What I would like understood as a black American is that black Americans loved and had faith in this country even when this country did n't love and have faith in them - and that 's our legacy , " Rice said .
When Rice addressed race in the incendiary aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , she told the New York Times that the US " is about 100 percent ahead of any place else in the world in issues of race " .
In today 's interview , she did note the " enormous progress " in race relations that is reflected by her ascendance in politics .
Republican strategists often mention Rice as a possible running mate for John McCain in this year 's election , but she expressed a preference for returning to her California home after George Bush leaves office .
Rice 's success drew heated criticism in 2003 from Reverend Wright , who dubbed her " Condoskeeza " in a sermon .
" For every one Colin Powell , a millionaire , you 've got 10 m blacks who cannot read , " Wright said at the time .
" For every one Condoskeeza Rice , you 've got 1 m in prison . "

It 's a bittersweet day for the Resigned Gamer .
Today I will pack up my XBox 360 and scant other belongings for a long and arduous trip across the continent .
I will leave Doomeru and this big city life for new opportunities on the untamed internet frontiers of Northeast Ohio .
Much like when our Semitic Polish / Russian ancestors huddled in the cargo holds of trans - oceanic freighters , fleeing the bloody pogroms and raping cossacks for a new life in America , my journey will be fraught with unknown perils .
At any moment the strained battery of my iPod could be pushed to its limit , I could be waylaid by a jackknifed tractor - trailer , forever lost to construction detours , find myself at an unmanned toll booth without exact change , or be brought to my knees upon the heartless asphalt by a ruptured tire and left to the merciless whim of AAA .
There will be trials and tribulations , true , but there will also be hope .
Hope for a better future , for me , for my children , and for my children 's children .
And that hope will drive me on until I reach my destination .
This week 's haiku go out to all the brave souls before me who have pioneered the wilds in search of fortune .
To those who reached the promised land , and those who came up short .
All who 've ever dared to try .
As we ’ve been paying down out debt faster than we originally anticipated the past few months , I ’ve been doing a number of new calculations on what might happen in the future – how much ahead of schedule we might be able to pay off the credit card as well as the entire debt , how much we need to pay each month to maintain out current goals and how that compares to when we started , and how much more than our minimum payments we need to pay each month to keep on track .
And I ’ve come up with something I ’ve decided to call the debt crossover point .
The crossover point , in personal finance terms , refers to the point where the money you earn from investments equals and then exceeds your expenses .
At that point , you no longer need an outside source of income ( ie , work ) to maintain your lifestyle .
For most people , if this point is reached it is at or during retirement .
My debt crossover point , as I ’ve termed it , is the point where just paying our minimum budgeted payments will allow us to pay off our entire debt according to our goal timetable ( December 2010 ) .
Our minimum budgeted payments is slightly different than our actual minimum payments , it is a fixed number ( $ 810.41 ) which is the amount we have firmly budgeted each month to pay towards debt .
That number is the actual minimum payment on our car loan and both our student loans plus $ 200 towards our credit card .
It is slightly higher than our actual minimum payments because our credit card minimum payment goes down each month as we pay more of it off ( currently about $ 63 ) .
According to my calculations , once we make our next credit card payment with the windfall snowflake included , the amount we need to pay to debt each month to pay it all off by December 2010 is $ 895 .
So we are still about $ 85 away from reaching that debt crossover point .
But we have made enormous progress , for when we started in June 2007 with this concentrated and accelerated debt paydown effort , we had to pay $ 1050 per month to reach our goal , so we are $ 155 / month closer to that crossover point than we were .
Now , do I intend on just reverting to paying only our budgeted minimum once we reach the point that the budgeted minimum is all that is required to reach the target completion date ?
NO .
Not at all .
The faster our debt is paid down , the better .
I would LOVE to completely pay down our debt much earlier than December 2010 , and will continue to throw everything we can at it month after month .
But what I like about approaching the debt crossover point is that it provides security .
With my income increasingly variable as I try to start a new contract position as well as explore different alternative income streams , being close to the debt crossover point provides security .
If I have a month where I do not earn much money , and we cannot pay much more than our budgeted minimum , then the closer we are to the debt crossover point the less that will affect our overall debt reduction goals .
And that is an increasingly comforting feeling .
Do n’t worry – I have n’t lost the fire .
But it is good to have an extra layer of security .
If I keep having good months I might start looking at how feasible a December 2009 goal might be though .
Then the debt crossover point will be reset high again .
But that ’s still a good thing .

It ’s easier to gain access to the death - row section of most publicly run prisons than it is to get into Hutto , unless you are a detainee or an employee of C.C.A .
Even Jorge Bustamante , a sociologist and a former Nobel Peace Prize nominee , who is the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights of Migrants , was denied access to Hutto .
From Geneva , he had applied to visit , as part of a tour that he was making of immigration - detention facilities in the U.S , and permission was granted .
But when he arrived in America , last May , Bustamante was told that permission had been revoked .
Bustamante remains angry about the incident , and says he will mention it in a report that he plans to submit to the General Assembly this month .
For my part , I got no response to repeated requests to tour the facility , which were sent by phone and fax to Evelyn Hernandez , the administrator of Hutto .
( She also refused multiple requests to speak on the phone , as did top officials at C.C.A. )
Two weeks after I submitted questions in writing to C.C.A. officials , I did receive some answers .
Steven Owen , a spokesman for the corporation , wrote that “ C.C.A. always strives to provide humane , safe and secure housing to the populations entrusted to our care in accordance with applicable laws and the expectations of our customers .
We are proud of the company ’s 25 - year track record . ”
No reporters have been admitted on any occasion since a single - day group media tour , in February , 2007 .
Currently , the only way to see the inside of Hutto is to watch an intermittently blurry video available on YouTube , evidently filmed by immigration officials and later posted by a blogger .
It shows kids and adults in blue and green scrubs walking down fluorescent - lit halls and eating food from plastic trays .
There are brief shots of a prison cell outfitted with a crib and of a man lying on a couch , his wrist encircled by a bright - blue I.D. bracelet .
Another sequence shows kids outside their cells , learning the alphabet song .
The footage has no sound .
Last March , the A.C.L.U. , along with the immigration - law clinic at the University of Texas and the law firm LeBouef , Lamb , Greene & MacRae , brought suit against Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and the immigration officials who oversee Hutto .
The suit said that conditions at Hutto violated a 1997 legal settlement that grew out of a Supreme Court case known as Flores v. Reno , which centered on the detention of minors who had arrived in the U.S. unaccompanied by an adult .
The settlement called for minors in immigration custody to be released to family members or appointed custodians whenever possible , and ordered that children in detention be placed in the “ least restrictive ” setting available .
Kevin Yourdkhani was among the twenty - six children named as plaintiffs in the A.C.L.U. case .
In a statement for the U.S. District Court in Austin , his mother said of conditions at Hutto , “ Majid and I can not be good parents .
We cannot provide Kevin with the basic things that he needs .
. . .
We cannot give him a pen to write with or any books to read .
We cannot teach him about the outside world or let him run around , the way young boys should .
We are totally helpless as parents and depend on the guards for everything . ”
Her family , she said , “ is falling apart in here . ”
The A.C.L.U. commissioned a psychiatrist to investigate conditions at Hutto , and , not surprisingly , the resulting report documented depression and fearfulness among children housed there , and predicted that , until the facility overhauled its “ policies and procedures beyond recognition ” and replaced its “ current ( correctional ) staff , ” it would not be appropriate for children .
More surprising , a psychiatric report commissioned by the government defendants also questioned the “ authoritarian milieu fostered by this excessive number of security personnel , ” and criticized an atmosphere “ capable of contributing to the development of unnecessary anxiety and stress for these children . ”
The report ’s author , Richard Pesikoff , a professor of psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine , concluded that it was “ essential ” to make changes at Hutto , in order to protect the mental health of the children .
Kevin , it must be said , was lucky .
The plaintiffs ’ lawyers soon figured out that the crayons and markers they had brought in to occupy the kids while they talked to their parents could also be politically useful .
They were particularly so in the hands of articulate , indignant Kevin .
One day , Kevin drew an American flag and wrote “ Pleace help us ” inside one of the stripes .
He drew a picture of his common area , with sofas , tables , “ police , ” and “ camra . ”
And he wrote a letter to Stephen Harper , the Canadian Prime Minister , in a rainbow of colors : “ Dear Mr. Priminster Harper , I do n’t like to stay in this jail .
I ’m only nine years old .
I want to go to my school in Canada .
I ’m sleeping beside the wall .
Please Mr. Priminster haper give visa for my family .
This Place is not good for me .
I want to get out of the cell . ”
One of the University of Texas law students , Matthew Pizzo , placed Kevin ’s handiwork in his satchel , and Barbara Hines later mailed it to journalists in Canada .
Newspapers and bloggers there started covering Kevin ’s story .
Sometime around then , Hines recalls , she and her students were told by Hutto officials that they could no longer bring in crayons and markers .
After six weeks at Hutto , the Yourdkhanis were released , and the Canadian government offered them temporary resident permits .
Students at Hines ’s immigration clinic found the family a new lawyer in Toronto .
The Yourdkhanis are now awaiting the outcome of a “ humanitarian and compassionate ” application for permanent residence , and their lawyer expects the process to be resolved by the end of the year .
Majid is working at a restaurant ; Masomeh is at home for the time being .
In November , when I visited the Yourdkhanis in their high - rise apartment in Toronto , Kevin was excited about a new aquarium that his parents had bought for him .
He had taken the bus home after school , grabbed an ice - cream bar out of the freezer , and was sprawled on the couch in shorts and a Darth Vader T - shirt , answering his parents ’ questions about a field trip that his class had taken that day .
He told me that he tried not to think about Hutto , but said , “ It was horrible in there .
People should be free , especially kids . ”
He said that he had given some thought to what he would do if anybody tried to take him away from Canada now .
“ I ’d glue my foot to the ground , ” he said .
“ And they ’d have to cut me out of the ground .
They ’d have to take the cement with me ! ”
Immigration officials have said that , before the A.C.L.U. lawsuit , the average length of detention at Hutto was about fifty days .
For some families , however , the stays were much longer .
Liliam Restrepo , a thirty - six - year - old Colombian woman , was detained at Hutto , along with her ten - and twelve - year - old daughters , Paola and Andrea , for nearly a year .
In Colombia , she was an activist with the Partido Liberal Colombiano , and says that she had to leave because of threats from paramilitaries .
She now lives in a cramped one - bedroom walkup in South Boston , where she cleans houses for a living , and is awaiting an appeal on her asylum claim .
She told me that children come out of Hutto with “ a mind - set , a feeling they ca n’t forget .
It ’s bad for adults , but it ’s worse for children .
My kids play these games — they still do — where they are arresting people .
My one daughter , she is afraid now of the police .
She does n’t want to walk by the police station at the end of our street .
They have been trying to adapt to the life of freedom here , but it is difficult , because they unconsciously still feel they are detained .
They ca n’t stop thinking and talking about prison . ”
Restrepo , a slim woman with long dark hair , was wearing a neatly pressed Corona Extra T - shirt and tiny gold hoop earrings .
At her small , rickety kitchen table , she sat with her hands folded in her lap .
The linoleum was cracked and worn , but somebody had tacked on the wall a calendar from a Chinese restaurant and an incongruous print of a couple of plummy - looking golfers on a lush green set of links .
Life was clearly tough for Restrepo , but she was still glad to be out of Hutto .
So were her daughters .
Andrea recalled having to take a group shower with other kids , and being embarrassed ; guards , she said , shouted at kids for running or making noise .
What she missed most , she said , was “ just being able to breathe real air . ”
The facility has an indoor gym , but when the Restrepos were at Hutto there were days at a stretch when kids were not allowed outside .
Bani Yaghoub was due to return to Tehran next year to complete her medical studies and become a specialist in urology .
But instead she died in suspicious circumstances in Hamadan prison on October 13 .
Eyewitnesses said she was arrested by Iran 's morality police while walking with her fiance in a Hamadan city park .
Her fiance was released an hour later , but she was kept in prison overnight .
The next day , her lifeless body was handed over to her parents with the police claiming she committed suicide by hanging herself .
" Now people see that even an ordinary person does not have basic security ; and a person simply can get arrested on a street and , instead of returning home , their bodies are buried in a cemetery . " -- journalist Isa Saharkhiz
Bani Yagoub 's family , however , say they have no reason to believe that their daughter would take her own life .
Her father , who reportedly works at an Islamic Revolution Guards Corps facility , accuses the police of assaulting and murdering his daughter .
The family also says her brother had spoken with her over the phone 15 minutes before the time the police claim she killed herself .
Bani Yaghoub 's brother said there was no indication she was minutes away from taking her life .
The family says Bani Yaghoub 's body was bruised and that there was blood in her nose and in her ears .
Authorities earlier this year launched a fresh crackdown to enforce Islamic
dress - code rules ( file photo )
Media Coverage
Bani Yaghoub 's death has caused worries in Iranian society about basic civil liberties and personal safety .
Iran 's state media has briefly reported the official version of the event .
The independent media , however , have been covering all sides of the story and public reaction to her death .
Isa Saharkhiz , an independent journalist and a member of the Association of Press Freedom in Iran , says the details of this woman 's tragic death in prison have reached the Iranian people through the country 's independent media and foreign news agencies .
Saharkhiz says that under the Islamic regime , Iranians have somehow become accustomed to political activists or independent journalists being arrested and even killed in suspicious circumstances , but this ordinary woman 's death while in custody has shocked society .
" Now people see that even an ordinary person does not have basic security ; and a person simply can get arrested on a street and , instead of returning home , their bodies are buried in a cemetery , " he tells RFE / RL .
" It has become a very sensitive issue in our society and created many questions . "
Call For Full Investigation
In an open letter to the head of the Iranian judiciary this week , a group of former Iranian parliamentarians called for a thorough investigation into the circumstances around Bani Yaghoub 's death .
The Iranian Alumni Association of Majlis Representatives , which brings together more than 400 former Iranian parliamentarians , urged Ayatollah Hashemi Shahrudi to fully investigate the case in order to answer all outstanding questions .
Bani Yaghoub 's death attracted more attention this week with high - profile lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi discussing the possibility of an autopsy being done .
Mehrangiz Kar , an Iranian - born , human - rights lawyer and author based in the United States , says whether the cause of death was a murder or a suicide , the police and judiciary are responsible for this tragic event .
" Who , how , and why could push such a young girl -- one who had a bright future ahead of her -- to the point of anxiety and despair ? " she tells Radio Farda .
" No matter what has happened , the authorities are responsible for this death . "
Both Kar and Saharkhiz say the chances are slim that the authorities would hold any police officer or a prison worker responsible for Bani Yaghoub 's death .
They say the authorities cannot ignore the case , which has taken on a high profile with all of the media coverage .
But they believe officials will probably drag on the investigation for months and even years until publicity around it eventually fades .
Similiar Case
Bani Yagoub 's death in prison was similar to that of Zahra Kazemi , an Iranian - Canadian photographer who was arrested while taking pictures outside Iran 's notorious Evin prison in 2003 .
Kazemi later died amid allegations that she was severely beaten , tortured , and possibly raped in prison .
Prison officials , however , said Kazemi had a stroke .
Earlier this year , Iran launched a " public security and moralization campaign " during which many citizens , including many women , were arrested and questioned for their alleged un -Islamic attitude , such as Western - style hairdos or outfits .
Unmarried men and women cannot walk together in public holding hands .
There are many cases in Iran when young men and women have been arrested for walking together .
However , most of them were later released after paying a fine or receiving other punishments such as flogging .
The government ’s assaults on our common sense , our wallets , and our dignity are becoming so numerous that one is hard pressed to keep up .
The media pivot like a herd of wildebeests from one scandal to the other  from illegal wiretapping , to torture , to mercenaries , to saber rattling in the Persian Gulf , to $ 4 billion lost at Homeland Security , to $ 9 billion stolen in Iraq .
Amid such a blur of perfidy , major events that portend disaster in the future can slip by with barely a notice by the media , by Congress , or by the public at large .
For example , does one voter in a hundred know that the Department of Defense has quietly activated a new regional military command ?
Just type in the acronym " AFRICOM " into a search box , and the reader will find a DOD website that presents the new United States Africa Command , in the same boosterish manner that Microsoft rolls out a new operating platform .
According to the site , " U.S. Africa Command will better enable the Department of Defense and other elements of the U.S. government to work in concert and with partners to achieve a more stable environment in which political and economic growth can take place .
U.S. Africa Command is consolidating the efforts of three existing headquarters commands into one that is focused solely on Africa and helping to coordinate US government contributions on the continent . "
In other words , more meddling , more fishing in troubled waters , more displacement of traditional diplomacy with militarized " shaping of the environment , " more armed , buzz - cut boy scouts playing roughly the same role Graham Greene ’s " Quiet American " played in Southeast Asia .
Oh , yes , and oil in the Gulf of Guinea .
The Center for Defense Information has posted a useful primer on AFRICOM [ pdf ] , and discusses some of the misgivings that the intended host countries have about Uncle Sam ’s gun-toting social work on the Dark Continent .
There is no need to recapitulate its information and arguments ; the reader should consult it for further enlightenment .
There remain only two issues to mention that the CDI piece does not cover : the domestic institutional angle and the domestic political angle .
All government bureaucracies , if allowed to fester , metastasize like a malignant cancer cell .
DOD , having been given extraordinarily indulgent latitude by a somnolent Congress , has metastasized more than the norm .
AFRICOM is yet another venue for general officer billets , staff jobs , and proconsular pretensions .
Once created , the bureaucratic imperative becomes paramount .
The collapse of the Warsaw Pact nearly two decades ago did not lead to the dissolution of NATO .
AFRICOM , once created , will be immortal .
AFRICOM also represents a God -sent opportunity for both our major political parties to find new worlds to conquer .
The GOP , being a subsidiary of Big Oil , is fairly licking its chops at West African oil , although how a bunch of armed social workers would " stabilize " a basket case like Nigeria is not clear , given the unfortunate precedent of Somalia .
As for the Democrats , this could be their big moment once again to preen as Wilsonian internationalists and hairy - chested liberals .
Throughout the 1990s , any discussion about the Balkans was sure to include some cavil from advanced thinkers that we intervene only in white countries because we value their lives more  what about Rwanda ?
Should the first Wednesday after the first Monday of November 2008 dawn with a Democratic President - elect , AFRICOM will be a ready - made vehicle for proving he or she is no wimp , and for mollifying important Democratic voting blocs as well .
Should the President - elect be a Republican , there is always the oil .
The “ John McCain is dead ” story line from last summer claimed that weak fundraising , poor polls , a backlash from conservatives and staff disarray had doomed his candidacy .
Why reporters get it wrong
New Hampshire sealed it .
The winner was Hillary Rodham Clinton , and the loser — not just of Tuesday 's primary but of the 2008 campaign cycle so far — was us .
" Us " is the community of reporters , pundits and prognosticators who so confidently — and so rashly — stake our reputations on the illusion that we understand politics and have special insight that allows us to predict the behavior of voters .

If journalists were candidates , there would be insurmountable pressure for us to leave the race .
If the court of public opinion were a real court , the best a defense lawyer could do is plea bargain out of a charge that reporters are frauds in exchange for a signed confession that reporters are fools .
New Hampshire was jarring because it offered in highly concentrated form all the dysfunctions and maladies that have periodically afflicted political journalism for years .
Let ’s look back at some of the bogus narratives of this election so far .
There was the “ John McCain is dead ” story line from last summer .
Weak fundraising , poor polls , a backlash from conservatives and staff disarray had doomed his candidacy .
Never mind .
Then there was Iowa .
The caucuses , we wrote , are all about organization .
Except they were won on the Republican side by Mike Huckabee , who had only the barest - bones organization .
D’oh !
Or Barack Obama .
The reason his candidacy was not taking flight , as the wisdom had it last fall , was that he was preaching a bland message of unity and civility in a year when Democrats were eager for a sharper , more confrontational and more partisan message .
Guess not .
These were only appetizers to the main course of humiliation .
After a barrage of coverage that all but anointed Obama as the New Hampshire winner and declared him the clear front - runner for the nomination , that exercise in groupthink was stopped cold by the actual votes .
Whoops .
Looks like we have a trend here .
Our own publication , Politico , did its part in promoting several of these flimsy story lines .
We used predictive language in stories .
We amplified certain trends and muffled the caveat , which perhaps should be printed with every story , like a surgeon general ’s warning : “ We do n’t know what will happen until voters vote . ”
If we were trying to construct a defense , we could also point to other cases where we pushed against conventional thinking or anticipated outcomes that really did come true .
But self - defense should not be the point after a debacle this glaring .
When we started Politico , we vowed to be more transparent than news organizations traditionally have been about how we do our work — and how we sometimes err .
In that spirit , here are some thoughts about why this profession , supposedly devoted to depicting reality , obsesses about so many story lines that turn out to be fiction .
1. Horse race frenzy
We are addicts .
Do not listen to any reporter who says otherwise .
It is why reporters leave their homes , spouses and families for long stretches to cram into crummy hotels and smelly buses to cover campaigns .
The Web has made us a bit less defensive about this than we were in the past .
That ’s because we now have metrics — based on what stories get clicked on — that show our readers are obsessed with the horse race , too .
There is no way to cover the horse race without polls .
That explains our obsession .
But it does not excuse our lack of discretion .
We cover polls we know to be statistically suspect , from firms we know use questionable methodology .
Most of all , we treat even legitimate polls as holy writs , rather than simply snapshots of the general contours of a race .
We are not about to forswear polls .
They can be astonishingly prescient , as was The Des Moines Register poll that correctly showed Obama and Huckabee surging in the days before the caucus .
For that matter , most New Hampshire polling correctly predicted John McCain ’s win , Mitt Romney ’s close second - place finish and Huckabee ’s bump to third .
But no poll that we saw was anticipating Clinton ’s win .
The entire profession gives polls an oracular significance that no responsible polling expert would ever agree with .
Perhaps every story should come with a bold - type reminder , “ This is polling , folks , not infallible data . ”
But the instinct to be even a couple hours ahead of the story is relentless .
At The Washington Post , where we both worked , exit polls in 2004 had the newsroom busy working on Why Kerry Won stories — scrapped just minutes before publication as real returns made clear this was not in the cards .
2 . The echo chamber
Check out the nicer restaurants in Manchester , N.H. , or Des Moines , Iowa , in the political season and you will see the same group of journalists and pols dining together almost every night .
We go to events together , make travel plans together and read each other 's work compulsively .
We go to the same websites — the Drudge Report , Real Clear Politics , Time ’s “ The Page ” — to see what each other is writing , and it ’s only human nature to respond to it .
That is one chief reason the “ Hillary is inevitable ” and “ Hillary is toast ” narratives developed so quickly and spread so rapidly .
Take Tuesday alone as an illustration .
Breakfast was at a Nashua , N.H. , hotel with a political operative working for a rival campaign ; the worker was explaining why it was a virtual impossibility that Hillary Clinton could recover in the remaining primaries from what we both assumed would be a severe New Hampshire defeat .
In the afternoon , there was an e-mail exchange with a network political analyst .
Politico editor , swimming very tentatively against the conventional wisdom : “ I am not sure she ’s through yet ; ... 40 percent chance she is nominee , I think . ”
Network analyst : “ If she ’s within 12 , I agree with you .
More than that , hard to see . ”
That was followed by TV , where the same Politico editor went on Fox News to note that the big turnout was almost certainly a great sign for Obama .
On the way out of the studio , chatting with colleagues , came the first word of the surprising exit poll data .
It ’s close ; looks like she might even come within 5 points or so .
Hmm , interesting .
The drive back to the hotel room included cell phone calls and ( dangerous ) BlackBerry exchanges with Clinton operatives and other political sources , all eager to pump for and share information about what was happening and what it might mean .
There is a defense of sorts here , too .
Even Clinton aides themselves started the day believing they were going to get blown out .
But just because well - placed people are in the echo chamber does not mean the noise is accurate .
3. Personal bias
This one is complicated .
Most reporters , in our experience , really do work hard to separate their personal feelings from their professional judgment .
But it has been tough to avoid a sense this week that some of the coverage has been shaped by journalists rooting for certain outcomes — either because they think it ’s the better story or simply the one they ’d prefer to see .
NBC ’s Brian Williams stirred some controversy earlier in the week when he reported that his network ’s correspondent covering Obama admitted it was hard to be objective covering the Illinois senator .
Reporters are human , and some did seem swept up in the same emotions many voters experienced when they saw a black man win snow - white Iowa by preaching a gospel of change .
Many are sympathetic to Obama ’s argument that the culture of Washington politics is fundamentally broken .
McCain also benefits from the personal sentiments of reporters .
Many journalists are enamored with McCain because of the access he gives and , above all , the belief that he is free of political artifice .
Hillary Clinton , cautious and scripted , got the reverse treatment .
She is carrying the burden of 16 years of contentious relations between the Clintons and the news media .
Many journalists rushed with unseemly haste to the narrative about the fall of the Clinton machine .
On this score , reporters are recidivists .
The Clintons were finished in 1992 , when Bill Clinton ’s New Hampshire campaign was rocked by scandal .
In 1993 , when Time pronounced him “ The Incredible Shrinking President . ”
In 1994 , when Hillary Clinton botched health care and Democrats lost Congress .
In 1995 , when Bill Clinton pleaded he still had “ relevance . ”
In 1998 , when the Monica Lewinsky scandal sent the Clinton presidency reeling .
Hillary Clinton 's comeback in New Hampshire this week probably shared a trait in common with those earlier episodes :
The media frenzy itself became part of the story , contributing to a sense of piling on and making people more sympathetic to the candidate .
Things are not all bad .
Politico is part of a broad , technology - inspired movement that has led to more open and more exhaustive coverage of this presidential race than ever before .
A lot of that coverage is damn good .
As far as what ’s bad , there is generally one good answer to excesses and hype in political journalism : Respect the voters .
That means waiting to find out what they really think .
Is the Federal Reserve an independent monetary authority or a handmaiden beholden to political and market players ?
Has it reverted to its mistaken behavior in the 1970s ?
Recent actions and public commitments , including Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke 's testimony to Congress yesterday -- where he warned of a steeper decline and suggested that more rate cuts lie ahead -- leave little doubt on both counts .
An independent central bank is supposed to maintain the value of the currency and prevent inflation .
In the 1970s and again now , ...

Editor ’s Note :
The post below was originally published in March of 2008 .
Since the tragic events last week , I felt compelled to write a follow - up .
View the farewell post and the entire set of Neverland photos here .
Michael Jackson ’s Neverland Ranch is up for auction next week .
Bearings has gained access to the ranch , and has posted the images below .
As an aside , I personally believe Jackson is innocent of all charges .
I speak as someone who has been on Jackson ’s Neverland Ranch .
It ’s a bit disconcerting to think that I stand in solidarity with Geraldo Rivera , but what can ya do ?
Many images I am not posting , out of respect for Jackson ’s privacy .
What I do post are places that were largely seen by the public ( or at least by hordes of kids who count it a privilege to have been on “ the Ranch . ” )
Whether or not you believe he ’s innocent , one can still appreciate the beauty of Jackson ’s vision in creating such a place .
None of us should ever lose our sense of wonder and amazement at the world , and I think Jackson truly wanted children to have this , largely because he never had it as a child himself .
Without further ado , here are the photos .

Authored Papers
Teens and Older Partners
by Michael Males , Ph.D .
May - June 2004
This paper includes the following sections :
Introduction
Government and non-government entities have characterized " teenage pregnancy " and " teenage motherhood " as major social problems in the United States .
The 400,000 to 500,000 young women under age 20 who become mothers each year in the U.S. have often been " blamed " for causing immense social costs , including higher public welfare costs and negative outcomes for their children ( Maynard 1997 ; National Campaign 1997 ) .
However , claims that children of teenage mothers suffer or generate higher social costs than to children of older mothers from similar socioeconomic backgrounds have been disputed in recent reports ( Cohen et al 2002 ; Hotz 1997 , 2000 ) .
Preventing teenage pregnancy is defined as a goal of several government ( e.g. , Federal Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs — OAPP ) and non-government organizations ( e.g. , The National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy — NCPTP ) .
However , a review of the data presented by the NCPTP ( 1997 ) shows that adult males age 20 and older , not teenage males , father the large majority of births to mothers under age 20 ( an estimated 280,000 of the 430,000 births in 2002 ) .
However , this important fact generates only sporadic attention from the major organizations involved with preventing teen pregnancy .
In addition , the fact that older partners are also implicated in most other negative sexual outcomes , such as abortions and sexually transmitted infections ( STIs , including HIV ) , among teens has received virtually no discussion .
Many of the major organizations and foundations concerned with teenage pregnancy ( i.e. , Kaiser Family Foundation , 1998 ) do not mention this issue at all , while others ( Planned Parenthood 2004 ; Alan Guttmacher Institute 1999 ; National Center for Policy Analysis 2001 ) cite it only in passing , with little comment on its implications .
Even less discussion surrounds the fact that a surprisingly large proportion of births fathered by teenage males ( about 40,000 annually ) involve partners over age 20 .
Finally , for the youngest mothers of most concern to policy makers , those under age 15 , about six times more babies are fathered by men over age 20 than by peer boys ( National Center for Health Statistics 1908 - 2003 ) .
After a brief flurry of research activity and policy proposals in the mid- and late - 1990s , interest in the issue of older partners in teenage pregnancy and childbearing has waned considerably .
After a brief flurry of research activity and policy proposals in the mid- and late - 1990s , interest in the issue of older partners in teenage pregnancy and childbearing has waned considerably .
Consider the following :
" Teenage girls with older partners are more likely to become pregnant than those with partners closer in age , " Planned Parenthood ( 2004 ) reported .
Further , girls who get pregnant are more likely to have the baby rather than get an abortion if their partners are older ( Alan Guttmacher Institute , 1994 ) .
A recent study found that 6.7 percent of women aged 15 - 17 have partners six or more years older .
The pregnancy rate for this group is 3.7 times as high as the rate for those whose partners are no more than two years older ( Planned Parenthood 2004 ; Darroch et al. , 1999 ) .
Teens who date older partners had a lower likelihood of consistent contraceptive use .
For each year a partner is older than the respondent , the likelihood of always using contraception decreases by 11 percent .
( In this study , on average , first sexual partners were one year older than the respondent . )
Child Trends ( 2004 ) .
The predominance of older , adult partners may be an uncomfortable topic to raise and a difficult one to address by policies or education programs .
However , it should not be dismissed as an unimportant factor in what we call �teenage� sexuality and childbearing .
In fact , it may be a crucial variable .
This edition of ReCAPP will attempt to explore this issue more fully as well as offer some practical suggestions for addressing it .

" Teenage " Pregnancy and Childbearing : An Accurate Description ?
" Teenage childbearing " is defined as a birth to a mother under age 20 regardless of the age of the father , and �teenage pregnancy � likewise is defined by the age of the female only .
In the popular imagination , and often in official and program portrayals as well , it is conceptualized as a pregnancy and / or childbirth caused by " teenage boys and girls " of high school or younger age ( Males & Chew 1996 ; Landry & Forrest 1995 ) .
Regardless of the popular depiction of " teenage " pregnancy as an event involving two teenagers , the best statistics indicate that around two - thirds of the male partners of teenage females and one - fifth of the female partners of teenage males are older than age 20 .
No matter what age limit is cited as defining " teenage pregnancy " and childbearing ( " teenagers " under age 20 ; " adolescents " under age 18 ; or females under the " age of consent , " — 16 in most states ) , the large majority of male sexual partners will be older than that age limit .
The ages of male partners in abortion outcomes are not as easy to measure ; the scant information available suggests teenage women are somewhat more likely to keep the baby when their partners are older , meaning that pregnancies ending in abortion are likely to involve younger men than pregnancies ending in childbearing ( Alan Guttmacher Institute 1994 ) .

Historical Context
Historically , reproduction by teenage females with older ( often much older ) males has been a normative pattern .
The first national birth registry statistics ( 1921 ) covering more than half the nation 's population reported that 91 % of fathers of babies born to mothers ages 15 - 19 , and 70 % of those to mothers ages 10 - 14 , were over age 20 .
Age gaps between partners were quite large at this time , averaging seven years .
In fact , one - third of the fathers of babies of mothers ages 15 - 19 , and 29 % of babies born to mothers under age 15 , were age 25 or older .
The proportion of births to teen mothers fathered by men over age 20 fell slowly , to 88 % in 1940 , 85 % in the 1950s , and a low of 66 % in the early 1970s .
Today , about half of the births to teen mothers involve men ages 20 - 24 , and an additional one - sixth are over age 25 .
Despite its long history and prominence in vital statistics reports , the fact that adult men father the large majority of babies born to teenage mothers came as a surprise to researchers in the 1990s who had assumed the fathers were predominately teenage males ( Landry & Forrest 1995 ) .
Today , about half of the births to teen mothers involve men ages 20 - 24 , and an additional one - sixth are over age 25 .
In terms of recent trends , California ( the state of California will be used as an example throughout this paper ) statistics indicate the number of teenage births involving married couples and ones involving two teenage partners declined the most rapidly over the last 12 years .
Married teens are more likely to have reduced their fertility during the decade if their spouses also were teens .
For unmarried couples , there was a lesser decline in births , and the age of the partner did not seem to affect the trend much .
The three tables below summarize these data .

Partner Age Gaps
Although partner age gaps were often very large in the past , great confusion surrounds the issue as to how big a partner age gap , and how young a younger partner , is acceptable today .
The Alan Guttmacher Institute 's research summary finds that most teenagers appear to have partners close in age :
Nearly two - thirds ( 64 % ) of sexually active 15 - 17 - year - old women have partners who are within two years of their age ; 29 % have sexual partners who are 3 - 5 years older , and 7 % have partners who are six or more years older .
Most sexually active young men [ 15 - 17 years old ] have female partners close to their age : 76 % of the partners of 19 - year - old men are either 17 ( 33 % ) or 18 ( 43 % ) ; 13 % are 16 , and 11 % are aged 13 - 15 .
( Alan Guttmacher Institute 1999 ; see also Darroch et al. , 1999 ; Sonenstein et al. , 1997 ) .
That two - thirds of sexually active 15 - 17 year - old women have partners within two years of their age , while 60 % of the births to mothers this age are fathered by men three or more years older , suggests that some factor reduces fertility among teens with younger partners .
A similar , though lesser , pattern appears for teenage males ( see Table 3 ) , while sexually active 19 year - old men virtually all report same - age or younger partners — 30 % of the births fathered by 19 year - old men are by mothers ages 20 and older .
Some observers , such as the Urban Institute ( UI ) , declare that " the pattern of fathers being slightly older than mothers fits squarely within societal norms " ( Lindberg et al. , 1997 , p. 61 ) .
Based on the average maximum age gap between adult and teenage sex partners specified in major states ' felony statutory rape laws , " slightly " turns out to be " up to five years older . "
According to UI 's standard then , a 20 year - old impregnating a 15 year - old , would be seen as socially acceptable .
However , UI argues that teenage women should be discouraged from deciding to " prematurely engage in childbearing and other adult behaviors " ( Lindberg et al. , 1997 , p. 65 ) , which seems to suggest a commonly held view — it is acceptable for older males to have sexual relations and babies with younger females , but it is not acceptable for younger females to have sex or to become mothers .
Others argue for stricter standards .
State statutory rape laws typically apply misdemeanor penalties when one partner is under age 18 and the other is three or more years older , and felony penalties for sexual relations between persons under age 16 and partners five or more years older .
However , prosecution of statutory rape cases is rare and difficult , and a brief effort at enforcement in the mid-1990s in states such as California produced little result ( see Donovan , 1997 ) .
State statutory rape laws typically apply misdemeanor penalties when one partner is under age 18 and the other is three or more years older , and felony penalties for sexual relations between persons under age 16 and partners five or more years older .
The characteristics of adult men and the teenage women they date are clearly not ideal .
Compared to teenage fathers , adult fathers with teen partners were significantly more likely to have a history of school failure , to smoke , to have been arrested , to react happily to the pregnancy , and to be employed at a higher wage .
Teenage women who chose older male partners were significantly more likely to report that the pregnancy was planned , their parents reacted happily to the news , they were casually involved with the father at the time of conception , they used alcohol and drugs frequently , they had behavior problems at school , and they dropped out of school both before and after the conception ( Lamb et al 1986 ) .
However , after learning of their pregnancies , teenage mothers with troubled histories tended to adopt healthier behaviors , including substantially reduced drug , tobacco and alcohol use and suicidal thoughts , and improved self - esteem and interest in returning to school ( Stiffman et al. , 1990 ; Bayatpour et al. , 1992 ) .
A number of studies have suggested greater levels of difficulty , including school failure and poverty , among teen mothers and their male partners of both teen and adult age .
An interesting pioneering study of 275 couples found differences not just between older versus younger fathers of the babies born to teenage mothers , but between teenage mothers who pick older versus younger reproductive partners — and the results were quite mixed ( Lamb et al. , 1986 ) .
As for infant health , younger teen mothers ' babies weigh less at birth than those of older mothers ( birth weight is the best overall indicator of infant health ) .
However , the age of the mother is of much less significance than her socioeconomic status .
For example , white mothers ages 10 - 14 have babies with higher average birth weight , and white mothers ages 15 - 19 have babies with substantially higher birth weight , than black adult mothers at every age level ( Center for Health Statistics 2003 ) , reflecting the fact that even poorer young white mothers are less likely to be impoverished than black adult mothers .
Further , more recent studies of teenage mothers and more appropriate control groups have questioned whether children of teenage mothers generate higher long - term social costs , perform worse in school , or suffer impaired development or health compared to adult mothers of similar background and socioeconomic status ( Cohen et al 2002 ; Hotz et al. , 1997 , 2000 ) .
The age of the mother is of much less significance than her socioeconomic status .
Perhaps as a result of the complexities related to older partners dating teens , little attention has been given to the issue and how it is related to what we call " teenage " sex , pregnancy , STI , and childbearing today .
The lack of attention given the issue may be due to the challenges it presents to traditional concepts of " teenage pregnancy . "
Addressing the issue also raises difficult policy and prevention questions that most groups in the debate do n't want to consider within the political parameters in which discussion is currently framed .
If what we call " teenage sex " and its outcomes are not behaviors distinct to teenagers , but rather are integrated with adult sexuality , traditional educational approaches , programs , and policy sanctions aimed at teenagers would be questionable , even discriminatory .
For example , no group depicts the high rates of pregnancy among American teenage girls as the result of " American adults impregnating and fathering babies with teenagers at far higher rates than adults in other Western nations , " though this is as relevant as the behaviors of young women .
Finally , an issue that is rarely discussed is the wide individual variation in maturity and readiness for sexual activity and marriage .
Recent studies comparing adults and adolescents along a wide variety of indices of cognitive ability , including understanding of facts , ability to foresee the consequences of future behaviors , impulsiveness , delusions of invulnerability , trust in the intentions of others , and similar measures , typically find few differences between teens age 14 - 15 , and virtually no difference between teens age 16 and older , and adults ( Grisso et al 2003 ; Offer & Schonert - Reichl 1992 ) .

Who are the Fathers ?
Few states have reasonably complete tabulations of the age of the father in births to teenage mothers .
California 's Center for Health Statistics ( 1960 - 2003 ) reports fathers ' ages in 85 % of the state 's 53,908 births among teenage mothers ages 12 to 19 in 2002 .
Fathers ' ages range from 13 to 62 years and average 21.5 years ; mothers average 18.3 years ( unknowns are apportioned as described below ) .
The state also reports mothers ' ages for 22,540 births fathered by teenage males ages 13 to 19 .
Mothers range in age from 12 to 46 years and average 18.8 years .
In the tables below , the numbers of fathers of unknown age are apportioned in the same manner as fathers of known age to each year of mother 's age by marital status and race .
For example , if 14 year - old boys comprise 6 % of the fathers of known age in births by unwed 14 year - old white mothers , they are assumed to be 6 % of the fathers of unknown age in births by unwed 14 year - old white mothers .
Because younger mothers report higher percentages of births by fathers of unknown age , the tables below show somewhat higher percentages of younger fathers than those reporting only fathers of known age .
That is , while teenage males under age 20 comprise 34.5 % of the 41,775 births to teenage mothers in which fathers ' ages are known in 2002 , this method apportions to teenage males 43.2 % of the 9,282 births in which the father 's age is listed as unknown .

Of 51,000 births among teenage mothers , 17,500 were fathered by teen males , 25,200 by men age 20 - 24 , and 8,300 by men over age 25 .
Partner age gaps were considerably greater for younger mothers .
For example , roughly the same number of births to girls under age 15 were fathered by men over age 25 , as by peer boys under age 15 .
In nearly half the births ( 49 % ) to mothers ages 15 - 17 , the father is 20 or older ; fewer than one in five of these births involve fathers under age 18 .
For the youngest mothers , under age 15 , there are few births , but more than half of fathers are over 18 and more than one - fourth are 20 and older .
Socioeconomic status has a strong effect on birth rates but inconsistent effects on the age of fathers in teen births .
California 's poorest teens are 20 times more likely to become mothers before age 20 .
Fathers of births by teens in the state 's poorer counties tend to be younger and less likely to be married than for teens in richer counties .
For example , impoverished San Joaquin County and wealthy San Mateo County have about the same number of teens ( 20,000 ) .
However , 34 % of fathers in the 1,399 births involving at least one teenage parent in San Joaquin are under age 20 , compared to 27 % of the 212 such births in San Mateo .
Further , 21 % of the teens giving birth in San Joaquin are married , compared to 36 % in San Mateo .
California births to mothers under age 20 in 2002 , expressed as rates per 1,000 females ages 15 - 19 by race , are partitioned below by age of father :

The influence of poverty can be seen in California 's birth rates for teenage mothers in 2002 , but the effects are complicated , and poverty is not the only determining factor .
Latina teens are 3.6 times more likely to become mothers than white teens overall , and 4.1 times more likely for births involving fathers under age 18 .
Ethnic and immigrant patterns also appear to influence the ages of fathers in teen births .
For example , African - American fathers of babies born to teenage girls appear somewhat younger , while Asian and Native fathers are more likely to be over age 25 than for other races .

Teens in poorer , recent immigrant populations have considerably older partners .
In particular , teens in poorer , recent immigrant populations have considerably older partners .
Of the 410 births by Hmong Asian women under age 20 in 2002 , 74 % were fathered by men older than 20 , including 22 % by men older than 25 .
Similarly , 71 % of the 2,111 births by teens of Central American and Caribbean origin were fathered by men over age 20 .
This data appears to reflect patterns of recent immigrants from Third World countries , including arranged marriages .
Teen Fathers and Older Partners
Of approximately 22,000 births fathered by California teenage males in 2002 , approximately 17,500 involved teen females , and nearly 4,500 — one fifth — involved mothers over age 20 .
Four - fifths of these were fathers ages 18 - 19 with mothers ages 20 - 24 .
Abortion measures and other outcomes do not appear to be available for younger - male / older - female liaisons .

Next : Teens and Older Partners , Part 2 : Why Do Teens Date Older Partners ?
In addition to facing the wrath of content owners around the world , The Pirate Bay 's administrators have recently been facing a much more local threat : camera - toting investigators following them around in cars marked with Danish plates .
Is Prince to blame ?
Prince loves sticking it to the man — this is the guy who changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol and performed with the word " slave " written on his face when he was unhappy about his recording contract .
But when " the man " is Prince himself and the one doing the sticking is BitTorrent search site The Pirate Bay , Prince reaches for the lawyer stick .
He has declared himself out to " reclaim the Internet , " and The Pirate Bay is at the top of his list ( fan sites appear to be on the list as well ) .
Peter Sunde , a Pirate bay admin , tells
Ars that the Purple One 's legal team has already started leaning on some advertisers to drop support for the site .
" We 're not even worried , since the Internet is too big for morally upset people to get it their way , " Sunde said in an e-mail .
" I 'm just sad that Prince — whose music I really like — ca n't understand that he 's the new Metallica versus Napster .
And we all know who lost that ... "
Comparing his site to the original Napster seems a bit strange , since Napster was eventually shuttered and then retooled after legal pressure .
Sunde does n't want to go the way of the original Napster , of course , but similar legal pressures on the site are ratcheting up .
The newest wrinkle in the long saga of The Pirate Bay : investigators following Pirate Bay members around in cars with Danish plates .
Sunde says that the investigators are taking pictures from inside the car " with a flash , so I 'm not sure how smart they are . "
He notes that something similar happened last year before a police raid on Pirate Bay servers .
He is " quite sure " that this is related to Prince 's own announced plan to sue the site ( though a Swedish prosecutor has also announced plans to sue the administrators in the next couple of months ) .
" What do they think they can find out by following us around ? "
Sunde asks .
" Everything we do is digital . "
It 's just another strange day in the increasingly strange life of a Pirate Bay admin .
Ludwig von Wohl was recruited by British intelligence chiefs
von Wohl 's role
Hungarian Ludwig von
Wohl persuaded senior intelligence figures that he could replicate the forecasts of the Nazi leader 's personal astrologer .
He claimed that if London knew what advice Hitler , born on 20 April , was getting , they would know his next move .
But the security service MI5 had warned that von Wohl was a " charlatan " .
American tour
Von Wohl , who was also known as Louis de Wohl , was a controversial figure .
Although he was dismissed as a buffoon and a scoundrel by some of the military people he met , others suggested that he was extremely astute , with a keen insight into the thinking of leading Nazis .
He cannot believe that anyone is going to re-employ this dangerous charlatan and confidence - trick merchant
MI6
Despite dismissing his claims of being from Hungarian nobility , MI5 hoped de Wohl could feed them information about his clients among the " great and the good " .
But the Special Operations Executive ( SOE ) - the wartime sabotage organisation - recruited de Wohl for its SO2 propaganda section , giving him the rank of captain and an army uniform .
He is said to have loved to " strut " around London in his military clothes .
In 1940 SOE sent de Wohl on a lecture tour of the United States aimed at convincing a sceptical public that Hitler could be defeated , and therefore that the US should enter the war .
His mission was regarded as a great success , with his talks and interviews being given significant publicity .
But the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941 dramatically brought the US into the conflict as Britain 's ally .
Astrological advice
De Wohl returned to London and then came up with his proposal to examine the astrological advice being given to Hitler by Swiss stargazer Karl Ernst Krafft .
De Wohl claimed that as Hitler relied heavily on Krafft 's predictions , which were based on mathematics surrounding birthdates , the British could gain a unique insight into his thinking if they knew the astrological advice he was receiving .
The plan appealed to some leading figures , including the Director of Naval Intelligence Admiral John Godfrey , who found Hitler 's erratic strategic moves hard to work out .
While his plan was enthusiastically embraced by member of SOE and the Political Warfare Executive , MI5 and MI6 were appalled .
" One of our senior officers comments that he cannot believe that anyone is going to re-employ this dangerous charlatan and confidence - trick merchant , " a report from MI6 said .
Another MI5 officer said none of de Wohl 's predictions had come true , apart from his forecast of Italy 's entry into the war , which he made when it was " quite patent to anybody with the slightest knowledge of international affairs " .
Historians now say that Hitler took no notice at all of astrological forecasts .
All the released files can be viewed at the National Archives in Kew , west London .
Here is a thunk , a kind of delayed apply that takes a function and arguments but , rather than calling the function right away returns another function that , when called , will call the first function with the arguments originally given .
thunk = lambda name , * args : lambda : name ( * args )
Here is a trampoline that basically unwraps nested thunks until a result is found .
def _trampoline ( bouncer ) : while callable ( bouncer ) : bouncer = bouncer ( ) return bouncer
Here is a useful wrapper function that turns a function into a trampolined version .
trampoline = lambda f : lambda * args : _trampoline ( f( * args ) )
Now let 's just define one more ingredient , an identity function .
identity = lambda x : x
Now we can write factorial in continuation - passing style :
_factorial = lambda n , c=identity : c (1 ) if n == 0 else thunk ( _factorial , n - 1 , lambda result : thunk ( c , n * result ) )
and trampoline it :
factorial = trampoline ( _factorial )
We now have a factorial function that does n't have stack limitations .
You can say
print factorial ( 100000 )
and ( a couple of minutes later ) Python will happily display the result :-)
I did consider currying thunk :
thunk = lambda name : lambda * args : lambda : name ( * args )
so the CPS factorial would be :
_factorial = lambda n , c=identity : c( 1 ) if n == 0 else thunk ( _factorial ) ( n - 1 , lambda result : thunk ( c ) ( n * result ) )
UPDATE : Sorry to the first few commentors , due to a cute - and - paste SNAFU I was using the curried version of thunk for the first definition of _factorial .
Now fixed .
DNA is the blueprint of all life , giving instruction and function to organisms ranging from simple one - celled bacteria to complex human beings .
Now Northwestern
University researchers report they have used DNA as the blueprint , contractor and construction worker to build a three - dimensional structure out of gold , a lifeless material .
Using just one kind of nanoparticle ( gold ) the researchers built two common but very different crystalline structures by merely changing one thing -- the strands of synthesized DNA attached to the tiny gold spheres .
A different DNA sequence in the strand resulted in the formation of a different crystal .
The technique , to be published in the journal Nature , and reflecting more than a decade of work , is a major and fundamental step toward building functional " designer " materials using programmable self - assembly .
This " bottom - up " approach will allow scientists to take inorganic materials and build structures with specific properties for a given application , such as therapeutics , biodiagnostics , optics , electronics or catalysis .
Most gems , such as diamonds , rubies and sapphires , are crystalline inorganic materials .
Within each crystal structure , the atoms have precise locations , which give each material its unique properties .
Diamond 's renowned hardness and refractive properties are due to its structure -- the precise location of its carbon atoms .
In the Northwestern study , gold nanoparticles take the place of atoms .
The novel part of the work is that the researchers use DNA to drive the assembly of the crystal .
Changing the DNA strand 's sequence of As , Ts , Gs and Cs changes the blueprint , and thus the shape , of the crystalline structure .
The two crystals reported in Nature , both made of gold , have different properties because the particles are arranged differently .
" We are now closer to the dream of learning , as nanoscientists , how to break everything down into fundamental building blocks , which for us are nanoparticles , and reassembling them into whatever structure we want that gives us the properties needed for certain applications , " said Chad A. Mirkin , one of the paper 's senior authors and George B. Rathmann Professor of Chemistry in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences , professor of medicine and professor of materials science and engineering .
In addition to Mirkin , George C. Schatz , Morrison Professor of Chemistry , directed the work .

By changing the type of DNA on the surface of the particles , the Northwestern team can get the particles to arrange differently in space .
The structures that finally form are the ones that maximize DNA hybridization .
DNA is the stabilizing force , the glue that holds the structure together .
" These structures are a new form of matter , " said Mirkin , " that would be difficult , if not impossible , to make any other way . "
He likens the process to building a house .
Starting with basic materials such as bricks , wood , siding , stone and shingles , a construction team can build many different types of houses out of the same building blocks .
In the Northwestern work , the DNA controls where the building blocks ( the gold nanoparticles ) are positioned in the final crystal structure , arranging the particles in a functional way .
The DNA does all the heavy lifting so the researchers do n't have to .
Mirkin , Schatz and their team just used one building block , gold spheres , but as the method is further developed , a multitude of building blocks of different sizes can be used -- with different composition ( gold , silver and fluorescent particles , for example ) and different shapes ( spheres , rods , cubes and triangles ) .
Controlling the distance between the nanoparticles is also key to the structure 's function .
" Once you get good at this you can build anything you want , " said Mirkin , director of Northwestern 's International Institute for Nanotechnology .
" The rules that govern self - assembly are not known , however , " said Schatz , " and determining how to combine nanoparticles into interesting structures is one of the big challenges of the field . "
The Northwestern researchers started with gold nanoparticles ( 15 nanometers in diameter ) and attached double - stranded DNA to each particle with one of the strands significantly longer than the other .
The single - stranded portion of this DNA serves as the " linker DNA , " which seeks out a complementary single strand of DNA attached to another gold nanoparticle .
The binding of the two single strands of linker DNA to each other completes the double helix , tightly binding the particles to each other .
advertisement
Each gold nanoparticle has multiple strands of DNA attached to its surface so the nanoparticle is binding in many directions , resulting in a three - dimensional structure -- a crystal .
One sequence of linker DNA , programmed by the researchers , results in one type of crystal structure while a different sequence of linker DNA results in a different structure .
" We even found a case where the same linker could give different structures , depending on the temperatures at which the particles were mixed , " said Schatz .
Using the extremely brilliant X - rays produced by the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron at Argonne National Laboratory in combination with computational simulations , the research team imaged the crystals to determine the exact location of the particles throughout the structure .
The final crystals have approximately 1 million nanoparticles .
" It took scientists decades of work to learn how to synthesize DNA , " said Mirkin .
" Now we 've learned how to use the synthesized form outside the body to arrange lifeless matter into things that are useful , which is really quite spectacular . "
The Nature paper , entitled " DNA - programmable nanoparticle crystallization " is to be published January 31 , 2008 .

ANALYSIS : Sources close to retailers indicate that Toshiba sold over 90,000 $ 99 HD DVD players over the weekend , and that figure only represents a portion of the retailers that participated in the frenzy .
According to Video Business , the 90,000 count includes Toshiba HD - A2 players sold at Wal - Mart , Best Buy , and Circuit City along with a few other brick and mortar outlets .
But it apparently does n't include online retailers who also participated in the price drop , such as Amazon.com .
BetaNews ' own estimates placed sales at around 40,000 to 70,000 within Wal - Mart alone based on information compiled about stocks at the discount retailer 's various locations around the country .

Wal - Mart 's move spurred a retailer war over prices of the players , even bringing down the cost of other models as a result when HD - A2 stocks depleted .
It 's fairly likely that total sales of all HD DVD players eclipsed the 100,000 mark during just the past week .
Sales of the Toshiba HD - A3 , the successor to the HD - A2 , appeared to be equally brisk , with many retailers selling out of their stocks quickly after the older model became hard to find .
At many locations , the newer player was selling for $ 199 - $ 100 off its original retail price .
Furthermore , sales of the HD - A2 alone over the past few days are nearly equivalent to total sales of the top Blu-ray player , Sony 's BDP - S300 , which has shipped 100,000 units since its introduction over the summer .
BetaNews has a request in with Toshiba for full sales numbers , but the company thus far has not provided specific figures .
It All Comes Down to Price
Over the weekend , BetaNews talked to several new - to - HD disc consumers and there was almost a universal reaction that price was the primary factor behind the purchases .
Buying an HD DVD player , however , did not necessarily mean the door was shut to Blu-ray .
" I was waiting on the price to come down on the hardware to where i thought the return on investment was there , because I know lots of money will be spent on software once I had a player , " Mike Taylor of Park City , Utah told BetaNews .
The story was the same from David Balfoort of Syracuse and David Lazerson of Cape Coral , Florida .
While Lazerson remains open to Blu-ray if the price drops below $ 250 , Balfoort says he'd only consider the opposite format if it " wins the war . "
Another interesting finding of the interviews was that no one felt worried about their purchase , despite the future of high - definition discs remaining up in the air .
" I 'm not nervous at all about the purchase , " Lazerson said , pointing to the upconversion feature of the player , which he noted alone makes it worth the $ 98 purchase price .
Balfoort , who already had a extensive home theater , said that an HD movie player was the last piece of the puzzle .
" I generally purchase a DVD player every 12 - 18 months so there was no nervousness involved , " he told BetaNews .
Blu-ray 's Dilemma
Through these interviews , it seems clear that Sony 's recent offerings of a small price cut this holiday may not be enough to counter what could be increasing momentum for HD DVD .
With so many new players now in consumers ' hands , it can only be expected that disc sales will increase as well .
Multiple studies show that the PlayStation 3 alone will not be enough to keep the Blu-ray format afloat .
Six out of ten users are n't even aware that the device can play Blu-ray movies , and out of the remaining four , only two had actually used the player in the past month to play a disc , according to NPD Group .
In addition , a rising number of HD DVD owners will make it hard for Sony to make the case to both retailers and studios to support its format exclusively .
Consumer demand will keep HD DVD on the radar of the studios who currently support it , and will give the format leverage to lure new studios in .
It is not out of the question that this past weekend 's moves by Wal - Mart have in the very least extended the format war much longer than many Blu-ray supporters would have imagined , and very well could have provided the needed momentum toward a successful conclusion for those in HD DVD 's camp .
" Wal - Mart does n't have these sales for no reason , there 's always a business aspect , " an employee told BetaNews on Friday while customers waited in line to snap up a $ 99 HD DVD player .
" You can fully expect that this will be the price next year ; they are always ahead of the curve on that . "
From Friday 's action , it looks like the nation 's leading retailer wants to play kingmaker .
And from the results we 're seeing today , it just may have .
Using data from the SCIAMACHY instrument aboard ESA 's Envisat environmental satellite , scientists have for the first time detected regionally elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide – the most important greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming – originating from manmade emissions .
More than 30 billion tonnes of extra carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) is released into the atmosphere annually by human activities , mainly through the burning of fossil fuels .
According to the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , this increase is predicted to result in a warmer climate with rising sea levels and an increase of extreme weather conditions .
Predicting future atmospheric CO 2 levels requires an increase in our understanding of carbon fluxes .
Dr Michael Buchwitz from the Institute of Environmental Physics ( IUP ) at the University of Bremen in Germany and his colleagues detected the relatively weak atmospheric CO 2 signal arising from regional ‘ anthropogenic ’ , or manmade , CO 2 emissions over Europe by processing and analysing SCIAMACHY data from 2003 to 2005 .
As illustrated in the image , the findings show an extended plume over Europe ’s most populated area , the region from Amsterdam in the Netherlands to Frankfurt , Germany .
Carbon dioxide emissions occur naturally as well as being created through human activities , like the burning of fossil fuels ( oil , coal , gas ) for power generation , industry and traffic .

" The natural CO 2 fluxes between the atmosphere and the Earth ’s surface are typically much larger than the CO 2 fluxes arising from manmade CO 2 emissions , making the detection of regional anthropogenic CO 2 emission signals quite difficult , " Buchwitz explained .
" This does not mean , however , that the anthropogenic fluxes are of minor importance .
In fact , the opposite is true because the manmade fluxes are only going in one direction whereas the natural fluxes operate in both directions , taking up atmospheric CO 2 when plants grow , but releasing most or all of it again later when the plants decay .
This results in higher atmospheric CO 2 concentrations in the first half of a year followed by lower CO 2 during the second half of a year with a minimum around August .
" That we are able to detect regionally elevated CO 2 over Europe shows the high quality of the SCIAMACHY CO 2 measurements . "
Buchwitz says further analysis is required in order to draw quantitative conclusions in terms of CO 2 emissions .
" We verified that the CO 2 spatial pattern that we measure correlates well with current CO 2 emission databases and population density but more studies are needed before definitive quantitative conclusions concerning CO 2 emissions can be drawn . "
Significant gaps remain in the knowledge of carbon dioxide ’s sources , such as fires , volcanic activity and the respiration of living organisms , and its natural sinks , such as the land and ocean .
" We know that about half of the CO 2 emitted by mankind each year is taken up by natural sinks on land and in the oceans .
We do not know , however , where exactly these important sinks are and to what extent they take up the CO 2 we are emitting , i.e. , how strong they are .
" We also do n’t know how these sinks will respond to a changing climate .
It is even possible that some of these sinks will saturate or turn into a CO 2 source in the future .
With our satellite measurements we hope to be able to provide answers to questions like this in order to make reliable predictions , " Buchwitz said .
By better understanding all of the parameters involved in the carbon cycle , scientists can better predict climate change as well as better monitor international treaties aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions , such as the Kyoto Protocol which addresses the reduction of six greenhouse gases .
Last year , European Union leaders highlighted the importance of cutting emissions from these manmade gases by endorsing binding targets to cut greenhouse gases by at least 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
A man who went on a TV show downloading spree after misunderstanding the terms of his cellphone contract has been hit with a bill for $ 54,000 .
The factory worker , 29 , who fears being made bankrupt said : " I just laughed out loud .
How on earth could I afford to pay that ? "
A loan , maybe ?
Santa ?
Most people know that downloading TV shows does n’t usually cost anything when you get them using BitTorrent .
However , Ian Simpson , a 29 year old factory worker found a way to make them cost – lots .
After taking out a cell phone contract which he thought included ‘ unlimited ’ internet use ( albeit with a ‘ fair use ’ clause ) , he got some advice from a friend who showed him how to connect his cell phone to his laptop .
According to a Stewart Maclean report in the UK’s Daily Mirror , Simpson said : “ My mate told me how to wire my mobile to my laptop as a modem .
It meant I could download faster than on the handset and get a proper internet connection in my flat . ”
However , after downloading TV shows for a month , Simpson ’s service was disconnected : “ I probably downloaded 20 or 30 TV shows and four albums ” he said .
“ I assumed it ’d be OK , but they cut me off .
I rang up and they said I owed them nearly Â £ 30,000 . ”
“ If I ’d known it would cost so much I would n’t have done it ” he added .
A spokesman for the cellphone company , Vodafone in the UK said : “ Few customers exceed the fair usage .
But it seems clear Ian has run up these charges legitimately .
The rules are clearly stated .
Mobile web pages use fewer megabytes .
That package is not designed for large - scale downloading or computer - speed web use . ”
Simpson , who claims he can only afford to rent a room in which to live , lives in hope that the company will go easy on him : “ Unless they take a sensible approach I do n’t think I ’ll have any choice but to go bankrupt . ” he said .
Luckily for him it seems that Vodafone will “ try to come to some sympathetic arrangement ” despite being taken unawares by “ the intensity of Ian ’s downloading ” .
Intensity .
On a cell phone .
What a guy .
Always check the small print ;)
Questions remain , however , about the provenance of weapons in Iraq , especially given the rampant black market in arms .
David Kay , a former C.I.A. adviser and the chief weapons inspector in Iraq for the United Nations , told me that his inspection team was astonished , in the aftermath of both Iraq wars , by “ the huge amounts of arms ” it found circulating among civilians and military personnel throughout the country .
He recalled seeing stockpiles of explosively formed penetrators , as well as charges that had been recovered from unexploded American cluster bombs .
Arms had also been supplied years ago by the Iranians to their Shiite allies in southern Iraq who had been persecuted by the Baath Party .
“ I thought Petraeus went way beyond what Iran is doing inside Iraq today , ” Kay said .
“ When the White House started its anti-Iran campaign , six months ago , I thought it was all craziness .
Now it does look like there is some selective smuggling by Iran , but much of it has been in response to American pressure and American threats — more a ‘ shot across the bow ’ sort of thing , to let Washington know that it was not going to get away with its threats so freely .
Iran is not giving the Iraqis the good stuff — the anti-aircraft missiles that can shoot down American planes and its advanced anti-tank weapons . ”
Another element of the Administration ’s case against Iran is the presence of Iranian agents in Iraq .
General Petraeus , testifying before Congress , said that a commando faction of the Revolutionary Guards was seeking to turn its allies inside Iraq into a “ Hezbollah - like force to serve its interests . ”
In August , Army Major General Rick Lynch , the commander of the 3rd Infantry Division , told reporters in Baghdad that his troops were tracking some fifty Iranian men sent by the Revolutionary Guards who were training Shiite insurgents south of Baghdad .
“ We know they ’re here and we target them as well , ” he said .
Patrick Clawson , an expert on Iran at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , told me that “ there are a lot of Iranians at any time inside Iraq , including those doing intelligence work and those doing humanitarian missions .
It would be prudent for the Administration to produce more evidence of direct military training — or produce fighters captured in Iraq who had been trained in Iran . ”
He added , “ It will be important for the Iraqi government to be able to state that they were unaware of this activity ” ; otherwise , given the intense relationship between the Iraqi Shiite leadership and Tehran , the Iranians could say that “ they had been asked by the Iraqi government to train these people . ”
( In late August , American troops raided a Baghdad hotel and arrested a group of Iranians .
They were a delegation from Iran ’s energy ministry , and had been invited to Iraq by the Maliki government ; they were later released . )
“ If you want to attack , you have to prepare the groundwork , and you have to be prepared to show the evidence , ” Clawson said .
Adding to the complexity , he said , is a question that seems almost counterintuitive : “ What is the attitude of Iraq going to be if we hit Iran ?
Such an attack could put a strain on the Iraqi government . ”
A senior European diplomat , who works closely with American intelligence , told me that there is evidence that Iran has been making extensive preparation for an American bombing attack .
“ We know that the Iranians are strengthening their air - defense capabilities , ” he said , “ and we believe they will react asymmetrically — hitting targets in Europe and in Latin America . ”
There is also specific intelligence suggesting that Iran will be aided in these attacks by Hezbollah .
“ Hezbollah is capable , and they can do it , ” the diplomat said .
In interviews with current and former officials , there were repeated complaints about the paucity of reliable information .
A former high - level C.I.A. official said that the intelligence about who is doing what inside Iran “ is so thin that nobody even wants his name on it .
This is the problem . ”
The difficulty of determining who is responsible for the chaos in Iraq can be seen in Basra , in the Shiite south , where British forces had earlier presided over a relatively secure area .
Over the course of this year , however , the region became increasingly ungovernable , and by fall the British had retreated to fixed bases .
A European official who has access to current intelligence told me that “ there is a firm belief inside the American and U.K. intelligence community that Iran is supporting many of the groups in southern Iraq that are responsible for the deaths of British and American soldiers .
Weapons and money are getting in from Iran .
They have been able to penetrate many groups ” — primarily the Mahdi Army and other Shiite militias .
A June , 2007 , report by the International Crisis Group found , however , that Basra ’s renewed instability was mainly the result of “ the systematic abuse of official institutions , political assassinations , tribal vendettas , neighborhood vigilantism and enforcement of social mores , together with the rise of criminal mafias . ”
The report added that leading Iraqi politicians and officials “ routinely invoke the threat of outside interference ” — from bordering Iran — “ to justify their behavior or evade responsibility for their failures . ”
Earlier this year , before the surge in U.S. troops , the American command in Baghdad changed what had been a confrontational policy in western Iraq , the Sunni heartland ( and the base of the Baathist regime ) , and began working with the Sunni tribes , including some tied to the insurgency .
Tribal leaders are now getting combat support as well as money , intelligence , and arms , ostensibly to fight Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia .
Empowering Sunni forces may undermine efforts toward national reconciliation , however .
Already , tens of thousands of Shiites have fled Anbar Province , many to Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad , while Sunnis have been forced from their homes in Shiite communities .
Vali Nasr , of Tufts , called the internal displacement of communities in Iraq a form of “ ethnic cleansing . ”
“ The American policy of supporting the Sunnis in western Iraq is making the Shia leadership very nervous , ” Nasr said .
“ The White House makes it seem as if the Shia were afraid only of Al Qaeda — but they are afraid of the Sunni tribesmen we are arming .
The Shia attitude is ‘ So what if you ’re getting rid of Al Qaeda ? ’
The problem of Sunni resistance is still there .
The Americans believe they can distinguish between good and bad insurgents , but the Shia do n’t share that distinction .
For the Shia , they are all one adversary . ”
Nasr went on , “ The United States is trying to fight on all sides — Sunni and Shia — and be friends with all sides . ”
In the Shiite view , “ It ’s clear that the United States cannot bring security to Iraq , because it is not doing everything necessary to bring stability .
If they did , they would talk to anybody to achieve it — even Iran and Syria , ” Nasr said .
( Such engagement was a major recommendation of the Iraq Study Group . )
“ America cannot bring stability in Iraq by fighting Iran in Iraq . ”
The revised bombing plan for a possible attack , with its tightened focus on counterterrorism , is gathering support among generals and admirals in the Pentagon .
The strategy calls for the use of sea- launched cruise missiles and more precisely targeted ground attacks and bombing strikes , including plans to destroy the most important Revolutionary Guard training camps , supply depots , and command and control facilities .
“ Cheney ’s option is now for a fast in and out — for surgical strikes , ” the former senior American intelligence official told me .
The Joint Chiefs have turned to the Navy , he said , which had been chafing over its role in the Air Force - dominated air war in Iraq .
“ The Navy ’s planes , ships , and cruise missiles are in place in the Gulf and operating daily .
They ’ve got everything they need — even AWACS are in place and the targets in Iran have been programmed .
The Navy is flying FA - 18 missions every day in the Gulf . ”
There are also plans to hit Iran ’s anti-aircraft surface - to - air missile sites .
“ We ’ve got to get a path in and a path out , ” the former official said .
A Pentagon consultant on counterterrorism told me that , if the bombing campaign took place , it would be accompanied by a series of what he called “ short , sharp incursions ” by American Special Forces units into suspected Iranian training sites .
He said , “ Cheney is devoted to this , no question . ”
A limited bombing attack of this sort “ only makes sense if the intelligence is good , ” the consultant said .
If the targets are not clearly defined , the bombing “ will start as limited , but then there will be an ‘ escalation special . ’
Planners will say that we have to deal with Hezbollah here and Syria there .
The goal will be to hit the cue ball one time and have all the balls go in the pocket .
But add - ons are always there in strike planning . ”
The surgical - strike plan has been shared with some of America ’s allies , who have had mixed reactions to it .
Israel ’s military and political leaders were alarmed , believing , the consultant said , that it did n’t sufficiently target Iran ’s nuclear facilities .
The White House has been reassuring the Israeli government , the former senior official told me , that the more limited target list would still serve the goal of counter - proliferation by decapitating the leadership of the Revolutionary Guards , who are believed to have direct control over the nuclear - research program .
“ Our theory is that if we do the attacks as planned it will accomplish two things , ” the former senior official said .
An Israeli official said , “ Our main focus has been the Iranian nuclear facilities , not because other things are n’t important .
We ’ve worked on missile technology and terrorism , but we see the Iranian nuclear issue as one that cuts across everything . ”
Iran , he added , does not need to develop an actual warhead to be a threat .
“ Our problems begin when they learn and master the nuclear fuel cycle and when they have the nuclear materials , ” he said .
There was , for example , the possibility of a “ dirty bomb , ” or of Iran ’s passing materials to terrorist groups .
“ There is still time for diplomacy to have an impact , but not a lot , ” the Israeli official said .
“ We believe the technological timetable is moving faster than the diplomatic timetable .
And if diplomacy does n’t work , as they say , all options are on the table . ”
The bombing plan has had its most positive reception from the newly elected government of Britain ’s Prime Minister , Gordon Brown .
A senior European official told me , “ The British perception is that the Iranians are not making the progress they want to see in their nuclear - enrichment processing .
All the intelligence community agree that Iran is providing critical assistance , training , and technology to a surprising number of terrorist groups in Iraq and Afghanistan , and , through Hezbollah , in Lebanon , and Israel / Palestine , too . ”
There were four possible responses to this Iranian activity , the European official said : to do nothing ( “ There would be no retaliation to the Iranians for their attacks ; this would be sending the wrong signal ” ) ; to publicize the Iranian actions ( “ There is one great difficulty with this option — the widespread lack of faith in American intelligence assessments ” ) ; to attack the Iranians operating inside Iraq ( “ We ’ve been taking action since last December , and it does have an effect ” ) ; or , finally , to attack inside Iran .
The European official continued , “ A major air strike against Iran could well lead to a rallying around the flag there , but a very careful targeting of terrorist training camps might not . ”
His view , he said , was that “ once the Iranians get a bloody nose they rethink things . ”
For example , Ali Akbar Rafsanjani and Ali Larijani , two of Iran ’s most influential political figures , “ might go to the Supreme Leader and say , ‘ The hard - line policies have got us into this mess .
We must change our approach for the sake of the regime . ’ ”
A retired American four - star general with close ties to the British military told me that there was another reason for Britain ’s interest — shame over the failure of the Royal Navy to protect the sailors and Royal Marines who were seized by Iran on March 23rd , in the Persian Gulf .
“ The professional guys are saying that British honor is at stake , and if there ’s another event like that in the water off Iran the British will hit back , ” he said .
The man that U.S. Republicans will choose as their presidential nominee this year , who is n't suited to America 's domestic or foreign - policy challenges , has long been a favourite of liberals in the U.S. media .
This is McCain the war hero and maverick , who has repeatedly broken with his own party to oppose his colleagues ' pork - barrel spending , the U.S. torture of detainees , and drilling for oil in the pristine Arctic Natural Wildlife Refuge , and to support stem - cell research , the most significant campaign - finance reform since the Watergate era , aggressive action to curb global warming and , most recently , an expedited " path to citizenship " for America 's estimated 12 million illegal immigrants .
In voting against U.S. President George W. Bush 's ruinous tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 , McCain correctly adduced that they would not be accompanied by fiscal prudence among the spendthrift Republicans who then controlled Congress .
And that they were skewed to Americans least in need of tax relief .
" I cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us at the expense of middle - class Americans who need tax relief , " McCain said in 2001 .
But there is another McCain , one who is among the least - principled major American political figures – all the more notable for how central " standing on principal " is to McCain 's self regard .
To win the conservative Republican votes so critical in the primaries and caucuses this year , McCain has flip - flopped on numerous of his most " principled " stands .
Those unfair tax cuts ?
He now favours extending them .
His compassion about illegal immigrants has given way to a pledge to build walls to keep the Mexicans out .
McCain has gone from opposing the repeal of Roe vs.
Wade to asserting his pro-life credentials .
McCain 's opposition to federal subsidies for corn - based ethanol , which consumes more energy to produce than it yields , gave way to a pro-ethanol stand as the caucuses in corn-belt Iowa approached .
Much of this is standard fare in a campaign cycle in which many of the leading candidates ' positions have " evolved . "
What 's alarming is that McCain is stubbornly absolutist on the most important question of the presidential content : Iraq , and America 's place in the world .
McCain is no less delusional than the Bush administration in detecting progress in Mesopotamia .
Iraq still has no functioning government , no army capable of defending the nation , no oil - sharing law , and no effort at ethnic reconciliation one year after the " surge " of 30,000 additional U.S. troops and five years after the U.S. - led invasion .
" We are winning in Iraq , " says McCain , who famously demonstrated the new and safer Baghdad last spring by visiting the downtown Shorja market wearing a Kevlar vest and guarded by more than 100 U.S. soldiers , two Apache gunships , and three Black Hawk helicopters .
Within a day of the departure the McCain entourage , 21 merchants and workers in the Shorja market were ambushed and killed .
One need n't venture into the murky realm of psychoanalysis to grasp McCain 's worldview .
As they say , if your only tool is a hammer , every problem looks like a nail .
McCain , described as third - generation navy royalty , is the son of a U.S. admiral who led the U.S. overthrow of a democratically elected government in the Dominican Republic in 1965 , and the grandson of a U.S. admiral who helped eradicate local opposition to the American invasion of the Philippines at the turn of the previous century .
McCain 's new theme in debates and town - hall meetings is that Americans should expect to retain a military presence in Iraq " for a 100 years , " citing the continued U.S. presence in places such as Japan and Korea .
McCain misses the point that America is not at war in Okinawa or Korea 's 38th parallel , And that even U.S. war hawks are beginning to realize it is the mere presence of U.S. military forces that has inflamed anti-Americanism , not just in war zones but globally .
It was , after all , America 's military bases in Saudi Arabia that inspired Osama bin Laden to attack U.S. assets around the world .
McCain struggled in naval academy , finishing 894th out of 899 students , and was rejected by the U.S. National War College until his family intervened with the Secretary of the Navy .
In active service , McCain was , by his lengthy acknowledgement in a commencement address last year , a " discipline problem " of violent disposition and frequent insubordination who came late to the task of proving himself .
For whatever reason , McCain has long since located America 's greatest achievements on the field of battle .
It may be a slight exaggeration to say , as liberal blogger Arianna Huffington insists , that McCain has " an ardour for war . "
But having jeopardized his presidential campaign by spending so much of last year in Iraq and the Senate cheerleading for an unpopular conflict suggests that McCain would like to field - marshal a war he feels he can win .
McCain 's frequently touted early criticism of the Iraq war , directed at Donald Rumsfeld ( but never at Bush , the only man who could fire him ) , reinforces the probability that McCain is not really running for president .
" I 'm going to be honest .
I know a lot less about economics than I do about military and foreign policy issues , " he said in a 2005 interview .
Which means reviving the economy and delivering universal health care do n't top McCain 's to - do list .
The post McCain seeks is commander - in - chief ; he is determined to succeed in Iraq where Bush and Rumsfeld failed .
It is n't McCain 's recent statement that an Iran with nuclear ambitions should be threatened with " extinction " that 's particularly disturbing .
Or his twisted idea of humour at a campaign event last April in singing " Bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb Iran " to the tune of the Beach Boys ' " Barbara Ann . "
It 's McCain 's utter conviction that , no matter what the sentiment of the American people , he knows better .
And that sounds a lot like the last seven years .
" . . . it 's my job to give my best estimate to the American people , no matter what the political calculations may be , as to what 's the best in our nation 's national security interest , " McCain told host Tim Russert on Meet the Press last May in what has since become a mainstay of McCain 's stump speeches .
" And I know what 's best , in my mind , my experience , in my knowledge , in my inspiration , as to what 's best for this country . "
McCain knows that the U.S. should continue spending between $ 2 billion ( U.S. ) and $ 3 billion a week in prolonging America 's worst foreign - policy disaster , which already has cost the Republic about $ 1 trillion .
In his mind , victory in Iraq , and restoring America 's military pride and the world 's respect for his country 's awesome might , transcends everything .

Using growth in GDP per head rather than crude GDP growth reveals a strikingly different picture of other countries ’ economic health .
For example , Australian politicians often boast that their economy has had one of the fastest growth rates among the major developed nations–an average of 3.3 % over the past five years .
But Australia has also had one of the biggest increases in population ; its GDP per head has grown no faster than Japan ’s over this period .
Likewise , Spain has been one of the euro area ’s star performers in terms of GDP growth , but over the past three years output per person has grown more slowly than in Germany , which like Japan , has a shrinking population .
Some emerging economies also look less impressive when growth is compared on a per-person basis .
One of the supposedly booming BRIC countries , Brazil , has seen its GDP per head increase by only 2.3 % per year since 2003 , barely any faster than Japan’s .
Russia , by contrast , enjoyed annual average growth in GDP per head of 7.4 % because the population is falling faster than in any other large country ( by 0.5 % a year ) .
Indians love to boast that their economy ’s growth rate has almost caught up with China ’s , but its population is also expanding much faster .
Over the past five years , the 10.2 % average increase in China ’s income per head dwarfed India ’s 6.8 % gain .
Mapping Slavery in America
Distribution of the Slave Population

Edwin Hergesheimer ’s map of Southern slavery was printed in September of 1861 and sold to raise money for sick and wounded Union soldiers .
It identified the percentage of the population enslaved in each county , and the total number of slaves — four million , up from 700,000 in 1790 — was a figure that could not have gone unnoticed by Americans living through such violent upheaval .
By using this relatively new “ choropleth ” technique of shading , Hergesheimer showed Americans their country through the lens of slavery .
The “ slave map ” was of particular interest to President Abraham Lincoln , as illustrated in a painting by Francis Bichnell Carpenter , First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln .
[ Offsite link : See an image of the painting on the U.S. Senate website . ]
The artist spent six months living at the White House in order to complete this work , and in that time repeatedly observed Lincoln studying the map .
To master the detail on the map for his painting , Carpenter surreptitiously borrowed it ; and when the president visited the artist in his White House studio a few days later he remarked , “ You have appropriated my map , have you ?
I have been looking all around for it . ”
According to Carpenter , Lincoln was once again instantly absorbed by the map and used it to trace the recent progress of Union troops through Virginia .
It gave Lincoln happy news , for the areas conquered by the Union just that week were densely populated with slaves .
Thus Hergesheimer ’s map appears in the corner of Carpenter ’s painting , a detail as meticulously chosen as the artist ’s arrangement of Lincoln ’s cabinet : those sympathetic to emancipation appear on the president ’s right , while the more conservative members are placed at his left .
The map also appealed to Carpenter for its elegant organization of information .
By just a glance , one could see the proportion of blacks to whites in the Southern states , which made it impossible to deny that slavery was at the heart of the rebellion .

The turn of the nineteenth century was a period of national reconciliation , but one that came at the cost of the rights and welfare of black Americans .
Yet the Civil War continued to affect politics .
The rising power of the Republican Party — born out of antislavery impulses in the 1850s — was in no small part aided by the willingness of Republicans to “ wave the bloody shirt ” and remind the nation of their party ’s leadership during the war and unbroken Unionism .
This view is embodied in the 1888 map “ Historical Geography , ” a vision of the nation very much at odds with the contemporary spirit of reconciliation .
In this rendering the Civil War is only a symptom of a much deeper division traceable to the early days of colonial settlement and which turned on the decision to import slaves to Jamestown .
From here , “ history ” brought forth two entirely different societies .
To Plymouth came Liberty , “ planted by Pilgrims upon the Bible … where it received God ’s blessing ” in the form of intellectual , technical , and educational advantages unblemished by the sin of slavery .
By contrast , “ nearly every evil which exists in the political economy of our beloved country can be traced back to the pernicious teachings of the Jamestown settlers and their children . ”
The Pentagon has long had a conflict of interest .
The Department of Defense builds the weapons of war ( albeit in a grossly inefficient manner using a captive defense industry that is a ward of the state ) .
Yet the department also supervises and funds 85 percent of the intelligence effort to identify threats that those weapons , at least theoretically , are designed to counter .
Thus , political pressure for more business from states and congressional districts containing defense industries leads the U.S. government to inflate external threats to justify ever greater defense spending .
The Pentagon helps generate such political pressure by distributing defense contracts and subcontracts , not on the basis of the best or most efficient defense companies , but to companies in as many states and congressional districts as possible .
Such is the way the military - industrial complex  identified by president and former general Dwight Eisenhower  works .
Of course , it is much easier to find new threats to highlight if you help create them yourself .
A classic case of threat - generation occurred with NATO expansion .
NATO , the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , was originally created after World War II as a defensive alliance against possible Soviet expansionism in Europe .
After the Cold War , despite the eclipse of its reason for being , NATO started expanding its territory and mission .
The alliance admitted former Soviet allies in Eastern Europe and republics of the defunct USSR , which implanted a hostile alliance on a weakened Russia ’s doorstep .
NATO became even more threatening to Russia because , at the same time , the alliance shifted its mission from defending the soil of member countries to offensive missions outside the treaty area  for example , bombing Bosnia , Kosovo , and Serbia .
All of this expansion of territory and mission was done under the guise of transitioning new European members from communist to capitalist societies and stabilizing other areas in Europe and the world .
Of course , admitting Eastern European countries to the economically oriented European Union would have sufficed to obtain the former objective ; admitting the new democracies to NATO merely caused these resource - deficient countries to spend more on defense .
As for the latter goal , it is questionable whether NATO has stabilized countries through attacking or occupying them .
The real reason for NATO expansion was to expand U.S. influence in Europe while Russia was weakened .
During the debates on NATO expansion during the mid-nineties , many people , including me , warned that kicking the Russian bear when he was down might come back to bite the United States .
The United States continues to deepen its ties in the former Soviet sphere of influence by proposing that a missile - defense system be installed in Poland and the Czech Republic to ostensibly defend against Iranian long - range missiles , which that nation will not have for some time .
Yet the bear is no longer hibernating .
Today ’s Russia  buoyed by revenues from higher oil and natural gas prices , economic growth , and a more assertive leader  is no longer the weak Russia of the 1990s .
Yet Russia ’s new assertiveness , threats of a military buildup , and strident opposition to the installation of U.S. missile defense in Europe are being portrayed as arising out of the deepening autocracy of the Putin regime .
They are also being used to justify the need for maintaining a vigorous NATO alliance .
For example , Michael Gerson , a former Bush administration speechwriter - turned - Washington Post columnist , recently wrote that " it seems wise to maintain a military alliance of democracies in Europe , with Russia increasingly convinced that one Cold War was not enough . "
This shocking rewrite of history ignores a record of post - Cold War U.S. meddling in the former Soviet sphere of influence in order to reduce Russia ’s influence and expand that of the United States .
In contrast , Russia has not meddled in the U.S. sphere of influence in Latin America .
Unlike the first Cold War , the origins of which were cloudy , the blame for any new Cold War with Russia should be laid firmly on the U.S. ’ doorstep .
U.S. wars on relatively primitive terrorists and guerrillas are insufficient to justify the building of new generations of sophisticated weapons  where the big money is for defense contractors  so a threat from a nation - state peer competitor has to be invented .
Columnists like Gerson are happy to help .
The trend toward autocracy in Russia is horrible for the Russian people , but it is little threat to the United States .
Even autocracies have legitimate security concerns , and Russia has been invaded several times through Eastern Europe , which is why the Russians are worried about a hostile alliance on its borders .
Empirical evidence shows that authoritarian regimes are n’t necessarily externally aggressive  for example , the dictators in Burma  and that democracies are no less belligerent than autocracies in their foreign policies .
In fact , data show that the most aggressive nation on the planet after World War II has been the United States  not the Soviet Union  with more than 100 military or covert interventions in other countries .
Gerson also laments that America ’s NATO allies do n’t pull their weight in defense spending or in Afghanistan , the latest NATO nation - building project .
He writes , " During the past fifteen years , Europe has taken a peace dividend so massive that the slightest military exertion leaves it bent and gasping for air . "
Gerson is actually understating the problem .
Those allies have been free - riding for all of the 60 - plus years after World War II .
But can you blame them ?
If the United States is foolish enough to subsidize the defense of these wealthy nations through the NATO alliance , they would be foolish not to spend the money elsewhere .
As for Afghanistan , NATO allies may be unenthusiastic about the effort because helping with the U.S. occupation of Muslim lands can lead to blowback terrorism on their soil  for example , the attacks on Spain and Britain for helping the United States occupy Iraq .
Here again , the U.S. military - industrial complex is busy generating new threats for the U.S. military and its allies to counter .
Most businesses would love to be able to generate demand for their products .
Unfortunately , the Pentagon and the military - industrial complex have this luxury and regularly waste oodles of taxpayer dollars making U.S. citizens less safe .

Gamers will soon be able to interact with the virtual world using their thoughts and emotions alone .
A neuro - headset which interprets the interaction of neurons in the brain will go on sale later this year .
" It picks up electrical activity from the brain and sends wireless signals to a computer , " said Tan Le , president of US / Australian firm Emotiv .
" It allows the user to manipulate a game or virtual environment naturally and intuitively , " she added .
The brain is made up of about 100 billion nerve cells , or neurons , which emit an electrical impulse when interacting .
The headset implements a technology known as non-invasive electroencephalography ( EEG ) to read the neural activity .
Ms Le said : " Emotiv is a neuro - engineering company and we 've created a brain computer interface that reads electrical impulses in the brain and translates them into commands that a video game can accept and control the game dynamically . "
Headsets which read neural activity are not new , but Ms Le said the Epoc was the first consumer device that can be used for gaming .
" This is the first headset that does n't require a large net of electrodes , or a technician to calibrate or operate it and does require gel on the scalp , " she said .
" It also does n't cost tens of thousands of dollars . "
This area of immersion and control could prove to be the breakthrough gaming has longed for .

The use of Electroencephalography in medical practice dates back almost 100 years but it is only since the 1970s that the procedure has been used to explore brain computer interfaces .
The Epoc technology can be used to give authentic facial expressions to avatars of gamers in virtual worlds .
For example , if the player smiles , winks , grimaces the headset can detect the expression and translate it to the avatar in game .
It can also read emotions of players and translate those to the virtual world .
" The headset could be used to improve the realism of emotional responses of AI characters in games , " said Ms Le .
" If you laughed or felt happy after killing a character in a game then your virtual buddy could admonish you for being callous , " she explained .
The $ 299 headset has a gyroscope to detect movement and has wireless capabilities to communicate with a USB dongle plugged into a computer .
The Emotiv said the headset could detects more than 30 different expressions , emotions and actions .
The headset could be used to improve the realism of emotional responses of AI characters in games
Tan Le , Emotiv
They include excitement , meditation , tension and frustration ; facial expressions such as smile , laugh , wink , shock ( eyebrows raised ) , anger ( eyebrows furrowed ) ; and cognitive actions such as push , pull , lift , drop and rotate ( on six different axis ) .
Gamers are able to move objects in the world just by thinking of the action .
Emotiv is working with IBM to develop the technology for uses in " strategic enterprise business markets and virtual worlds "
Paul Ledak , vice president , IBM Digital Convergence said brain computer interfaces , like the Epoc headset were an important component of the future 3D Internet and the future of virtual communication .
Most people will respond by saying , “ What an absurd question !
Look around you , dummy ; of course it works ! ”
And even the most strident critics of capitalism , the distributist , the socialist , the libertarian , is likely to concede that it works .
Their critiques are likely to begin , “ Yes , but ... it could be more ' moral ' ( or work better , or whatever ) . ”
However , I assert that there is a critic whose challenge cannot be successfully answered by the capitalist .
This is not the Christian , or the socialist , or even the Marxist challenger .
It is a critic that even the most committed capitalist cannot get around .
That critic is the capitalist himself .
By purely capitalist standards , capitalism does not work and never has .
What , precisely , does a capitalist mean when he says that capitalism works ?
Simply this : that the capitalist system can provide a relatively stable and prosperous economic order without a lot of government interference in the market .
Now , the Marxist critic might point out that the “ prosperity ” excludes a large number of people , and the Georgist or the Distributist might point out that capitalism depends , contrary to its own theory , on a certain monopolization of land and the other means of production , but the capitalist is likely to reject these critiques .
But he cannot fail to notice , if he is intellectually honest , that capitalism has never been a stable economic order without the heavy involvement of the government .
We can date the era of massive government intervention in the market from about World War II , with such “ Keynesian ” practice becoming established government policy in the early 50's .
Yet when we look at the economy from 1853 to 1953 , we find that it was in recession fully 40 % of the time .
Hardly a stable order .
Further , since 1953 , it has been in recession only 15 % of the time .
Consider the following chart of economic activity in the period 1900 - 2006 ( thanks to John Watkins for generating this chart ) :
This chart may be difficult to read in such a small format ( if you click on the chart , you will get a better view of it ) .
Nevertheless , its message can be gleaned easily enough from its major features .
The gray bands represent periods of recession .
The red line represents the change in business activity from one quarter to the next .
A few things are evident : there is a lot more gray on the left side of the chart than on the right side ; the red line ( read on the right - hand scale ) is far more erratic on the left side of the chart ; the blue line ( read on the right - hand scale ) has a much lower slope on the left side .
What the chart shows is that capitalism was extremely unstable in the “ pure ” capitalist era , that is was prone to near - constant recession , and that it exhibited anemic growth by post - World War II standards .
What is most curious about the capitalist critic of capitalism is that one never meets him .
Rather , one notices a curious disconnect between the theory and the practice , a disconnect which does n't seem to bother practitioners of capitalism .
For example , I listen to the business news quite regularly , and I constantly hear statements in the following form :
“ The government ought to ( ' lower the interest rate , ' ' raise the interest rate ' ' expand ( or contract ) credit , ) so that the free market can do its work .
” The people who make these statements never seem to realize the disconnect between the first half of their sentences and the second .
Or another example : Republican presidential candidates regularly tout the free market , and then propose to give $ 20 billion to Detroit to save the auto industry , or propose expensive responses to the recession , or the health care crises , or whatever .
Or one of my favorite examples comes from Charles Krauthammer , the libertarian columnist .
In a column excoriating auto mileage standards , he states that the best way to address the problem is with government controlled prices for gasoline .
Now , when a promenent libertarian calls for government price - controls , you know that real capitalism is dead .
Capitalists like to think of themselves as realists .
But my minimum requirement for a realist is that he occasionally looks at the real world .
I have no objection to those who spend all their time contemplating their ideological navels , but to quality as a realist , one ought to glance up , even if only now and then , at the real world .
When the capitalist does this , he will find that nobody really believes in capitalism anymore , or at least no practitioner of capitalism does ; they all want government hand - outs , protections , subsidies , and favorable treatment .
And maybe that is the right thing to do .
But it surely is n't the capitalist thing to do .
Robert Irvine of Dinner Impossible on Food Network Fired ( Photos )
, host of ' Dinner : Impossible ' , a Food Network cable show , has reported been fired for doctoring his resume with a load of lies .
According to the St. Petersburg Times , Irvine fabricated his education and claims that he had cooked for Princess Diana among other tall tales .
The current season of shows will be aired , as will reruns , but Irvine 's contract will not be extended .
The Network is busy scrubbing any inaccurate references on the taped segments .
The cable network issued the following statement :
" We looked into the situation and found that , as Robert as already admitted , there were some embellishments and inaccuracies in his resume , " Food Network President Brooke Johnson is quoted as saying .
" The few and minor incidents of the inclusion of these embellishments into ' Dinner Impossible ' have been removed .
" The show is , and has always been , completely accurate in the depiction of the cooking challenges faced by Robert .
We will continue airing both old shows and the new season of programs currently in production .
We have not renewed Robert ’s contract for future seasons but will fulfill our contractual obligations . "
The network also released a statement from Irvine :
“ I was wrong to exaggerate in statements related to my experiences regarding the Royal Family .
... I am truly sorry for the errors in my judgment . "
Prince Charles .
His Robert Irvine arrived on the scene in St. Petersburg , Florida two years ago .
His dazzled the community with his plans and his incredible background .
He owned a castle in Scotland , cooked for the royals and was a friend of .
His grand plan was to open side by side upscale restaurants called Ooze and Schmooze .
Turns out he was skating a thin line and was building his new enterprise without the capital to pay the bills .
His grand scheme imploded and he was left with more than egg on his face .

There are loads of misconceptions and confusion regarding the Flash UPnP Attack that was discussed over here .
Therefore , it is probably a good idea to shed some light on the matter , since I do n't want to leave people with the wrong impression .
If the majority of people still do n't get it after this post , then that will mean that we have failed and we should n't have published the research .
What does the Flash UPnP hack consist of ?
When the victim opens a malicious SWF file , or a page that embeds one ( think about ad networks , etc ) , a 4 ( could be less or slightly more ) step ATTACK will silently execute in the background , upon which the attacker will have control over the victim 's router , pretty much regardless of its model .
Q : Does the attack rely on any vulnerabilities within Flash ?
No !
The attack is based on the navigateToURL function and the URLRequest object .
Both of them are used as described in the Flash ActionScript specifications .
Q : Does the Flash UPnP Attack depend on certain browser type and / or version ?
No !
The attack is possible because of Flash not because of the underlaying browser !
Q : Does the Flash UPnP Attack depend on certain Operating System type and / or version ?
No !
Flash is cross-platformed .
The attack will work wherever Flash works .
Q : The Demo does not work with the most recent version of Flash Player , right ?
No !
It does work !
Q : Nevertheless , UPnP is useless , right ?
No !
UPnP is quite serious business and hacking it often leads to a catastrophic effect .
The following is possible with UPnP :
portforward internal services ( ports ) to the router external facing side ( a.k. a poking holes into your firewall and / or network )
portforward the router web administration interface to the external facing side .
port forwarding to any external server located on the Internet , effectively turning your router into a zombie : the attacker can attack an Internet host via your router , thus hiding their IP address ( not all routers are affected by this , but most are )
server located on the Internet , effectively turning your router into a zombie : the attacker can attack an Internet host via your router , thus hiding their IP address ( not all routers are affected by this , but most are ) change the DNS server settings so that next time when the victim visits bank.com , they actually end up on evil.com mascaraed as bank.com
change the DNS server settings so that the next time when the victim updates theirs favorite Firefox extensions , they will end up downloading evil code from evil.com which will root their system .
reset / change the administrative credentials
reset / change the PPP settings
reset / change the IP settings for all interfaces
reset / change the WiFi settings
terminate the connection
etc .
And these are just a small portion of the things you can do over UPnP .
Q : Nevertheless , UPnP is secure .
The user will be prompted with a Basic Authentication prompt , right ?
No !
UPnP specifications do not provide any standard for authentication .
Therefore , everyone can do these changes without any restrictions .
Q : Is UPnP turned on by default ?
Yes !
UPnP is turned on by default on most , if not all devices .
Otherwise , things like MSN and Skype realtime audio and video , P2P ( Peer - to - Peer ) software like Emule , games of all kinds and bunch of other things wont work unless the user manually makes changes in her router 's configuration .
Due to the fact that the average user is not a System Administrator , UPnP is enabled by default in order to make the magic working behind the screen .
Q : Can I turn UPnP off ?
Yes !
Please consult with the manual provided by your router manufacturer .
It is a good idea to consider the inconveniences that this change may cause you .
Remember : there are no perfect things !
It is all about keeping the balance .
Q : Is it just my router that supports UPnP ?
No !
Many types of devices support the UPnP protocol : Cameras , Printers , Mobile Phones ( yes my mobile has UPnP capabilities ) , Digital Entertainment Systems , etc .
Q : Is it possible to hack into other UPnP enabled devices with the Flash UPnP Attack ?
Yes !
It is possible to hack into any UPnP enabled device as long as the UPnP control point is delivered over HTTP .
HTTPU ( HTTP over UDP ) UPnP implementations are not vulnerable due to the fact that Flash does not support the UDP transport protocol .
Q : Am I safe if my UPnP device handles only HTTPU ?
No !
You still need to consider the risk that someone can send arbitrary UDP requests to the UPnP control point .
Remember , UPnP does not have any authentication or authorization facilities !
Q : Am I safe if I disable / uninstall Flash ?
Although I am not aware of any other method for achieving the same effect , it is very likely that the same attack can be performed by other types of Web technologies .
Q : Why did you publish the research ?
We hope that by exposing this information , we will drastically improve the situation for the better future .
I think that this is a lot better than keeping it for ourselves or risking it all by given the criminals the opportunity to have in possession a secret which no one else is aware of .
What vendor ?
Who ?
There are so many device manufacturers that it is highly unfeasible to contact each one individually .
Regarding Adobe , well ... , they have n't done anything wrong either .
So , I do n't think that you should blame them .
Q : How would you rate the issue ?
HIGHLY SEVERE !
Turn UPnP off !
_ I am planning to keep this post up - to - date as new question / misconceptions / confusions emerge ._
First off , let ’s set out the criteria : a BAD porn movie title does the opposite of its intention , which is to arouse your interests and convince you to buy the tape .
Nope , these titles work against them — they disgust , confuse or just plain turn you off .
I ’ve divided them up into 5 categories : 1 ) Gross , 2 ) Groan , 3 ) Stupid , 4 ) What The Hell , and 5 ) The Porn Store Clerk Laughed At Me. I ’ll elaborate later .
There are a number of exclusions .
Foreign titles are out because a bad translation is out of the original namer ’s control .
Ethnic videos were also excluded because they ’re all pretty offensive , so “ Chicken Chow Mine ” and “ Sushi Girls # 24 – Stir Fry Snatch ” are not on the list , as well as pretty much all the black videos .
( I have never seen so many uses of the words “ ho ” and “ booty ” in my life . )
Gay is out because the titles always make me giggle or extremely uncomfortable .
Also , any movie titles describing a disgusting sex act were disqualified because that ’s a personal bias .
So you do n’t get “ Bust A Nut In Grandma ’s Butt ” because some people like old women .
Really old women .
Yikes .
“ Edward Penishands ” was immediately out because that one pops up on EVERYBODY ELSE ’S Best Porn Movie Title list because it is actually an awesome title .
I saw that movie .
That had to be the worst porn shoot ever for that poor guy .
To research this article , I used the online database of over 70,000 movies at http://excaliburfilms.com.
They ’re all real titles — look them up if you want to .
( I ’m not linking to each one of these !)
I have not seen all of these films .
Actually , I have not seen any of these films .
And I do n’t want to — hence , this list .
It is certainly not definitive , I simply could not review every single porn movie title ever .
You have to draw a limit somewhere .
The list is numbered , but it is not ranked because I ca n’t be bothered .
You may also disagree with my choices because the title actually turns you on .
I do n’t care .
You ’re sick .

Not so long ago , the phone rang in my office .
It was Barack Obama .
For over a decade , Obama was a colleague of mine at the University of Chicago Law School .
He is also a friend .
But since his election to the Senate , he does not exactly call every day .
On this occasion , he had an important topic to discuss : the controversy over President Bush 's warrantless surveillance of international telephone calls between Americans and suspected terrorists .
I had written a short essay suggesting that the surveillance might be lawful .
Before taking a public position , Obama wanted to talk the problem through .
In the space of about 20 minutes , he and I investigated the legal details .
He asked me to explore all sorts of issues : the President 's power as Commander - in - Chief , the Constitution 's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , the Authorisation for Use of Military Force and more .
Obama wanted to consider the best possible defence of what Bush had done .
To every argument I made , he listened and offered a counter - argument .
After the issue had been exhausted , Obama said that he thought the programme was illegal , but now had a better understanding of both sides .
He thanked me for my time .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
This was a pretty amazing conversation , not only because of Obama 's mastery of the legal details , but also because many prominent Democratic leaders had already blasted the Bush initiative as blatantly illegal .
He did not want to take a public position until he had listened to , and explored , what might be said on the other side .
This is the Barack Obama I have known for nearly 15 years – a careful and even - handed analyst of law and policy , unusually attentive to multiple points of view .
The University of Chicago Law School is by far the most conservative of the great American law schools .
It helped to provide the academic foundations for many positions of the Reagan administration .
But at the University of Chicago , Obama is liked and admired by Republicans and Democrats alike .
Some of the local Reagan enthusiasts are Obama supporters .
Why ?
It does n't hurt that he 's a great guy , with a personal touch and a lot of warmth .
It certainly helps that he is exceptionally able .
But niceness and ability are only part of the story .
Obama also has a genuinely independent mind , he 's a terrific listener and he goes wherever reason takes him .
Those of us who have long known Obama are impressed and not a little amazed by his rhetorical skills .
Who could have expected that our colleague , a teacher of law , is also able to inspire large crowds ?
The Obama we know is no rhetorician ; he shines because of his problem - solving abilities , his creativity and his attention to detail .
In recent weeks , his speaking talents , and the increasingly cult - like atmosphere that surrounds him , have led people to wonder whether there is substance behind the eloquent plea for " change " – whether the soaring phrases might disguise a kind of emptiness and vagueness .
But nothing could be further from the truth .
He is most comfortable in the domain of policy and detail .
I do not deny that sceptics are raising legitimate questions .
After all , Obama has served in the Senate for a short period ( less than four years ) and he has little managerial experience .
Is he really equipped to lead the most powerful nation in the world ?
The United States is in the midst of a kind of Obamamania , in which a series of wonderful speeches and unexpected victories have created a storm of enthusiasm , sometimes verging on hysteria .
Some people think that the fervour is thin , and could abate as fast as it has arisen .
Even if it persists , the very enthusiasm that accounts for Obama 's political success might have unfortunate effects on his ability to lead , if elected .
It will undoubtedly raise expectations to an unrealistic degree , both domestically and internationally .
Obama speaks of " change " , but will he be able to produce large - scale changes in a short time ?
What if he fails ?
An independent issue is that all the enthusiasm might serve to insulate him from criticisms and challenges on the part of his own advisers – and , in view of his relative youth , criticisms and challenges are exactly what he requires .
Fortunately , the candidate 's campaign proposals offer strong and encouraging clues about how he would govern ; what makes them distinctive is that they borrow sensible ideas from all sides .
In this sense , he is not only focused on details but is also a uniter , both by inclination and on principle .

Transparency and accountability matter greatly to him ; they are a defining feature of his proposals .
With respect to the mortgage crisis and the debate over credit markets , Obama rejects heavy - handed regulation and insists on disclosure , so that consumers will know exactly what they are getting .
It is highly revealing that he worked with Republican ( and arch - conservative ) Tom Coburn to produce legislation creating a publicly searchable database of all federal spending .
Obama 's healthcare plan places a premium on cutting costs and on making care affordable , without requiring adults to purchase health insurance .
( He would require mandatory coverage only for children . )
Republican legislators are unlikely to support a mandatory approach , and his plan can be understood , in part , as a recognition of political realities .
But it is also a reflection of his keen interest in freedom of choice .
Obama acknowledges that large increases in the minimum wage might " discourage employers from hiring more workers " .
It should not be surprising that in terms of helping low - income workers , he has long been enthusiastic about an approach , pioneered by Republicans , that supplements wages but does not threaten to throw people out of work .
In combining concern for the disadvantaged with an appreciation of free markets , he rejects old - style leftism , and his approach sometimes overlaps with the Third Way thinking associated with Tony Blair and Bill Clinton .
But Obama is not a compromiser ; he does not try to steer between the poles ( or the polls ) .
Both internationally and domestically , he is willing to think big and to be bold .
He publicly opposed the war in Iraq at a time when opposition was unpopular .
He favours high - level meetings with some of the world 's worst dictators .
He would rethink the embargo against Cuba .
He wants to hold an unprecedented national auction for the right to emit greenhouse gases .
These are points about policies and substance .
As president , Obama would set a new tone in US politics .
He refuses to demonise his political opponents ; deep in his heart , I believe , he does n't even think of them as opponents .
It would not be surprising to find Republicans and independents prominent in his administration .
Obama wants to know what ideas are likely to work , not whether a Democrat or a Republican is responsible for them .
Recall the most memorable passage from his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic Convention : " We coach Little League [ baseball ] in the blue [ Democratic - voting ] states , and , yes , we 've got some gay friends in the red states .
There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq , and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq . "
In his book The Audacity of Hope , he asks for a politics that accepts " the possibility that the other side might sometimes have a point " .
Remarking that ordinary Americans " do n't always understand the arguments between right and left , conservative and liberal " , Obama wants politicians " to catch up with them " .
Rejecting one of the most intense and seemingly unbridgeable divisions in American politics , he writes of " the middle - aged feminist who still mourns her abortion , and the Christian woman who paid for her teenager 's abortion " .
After he received an email from a pro-life doctor , Obama recalls how he softened his website 's harsh rhetoric on abortion , writing : " [ T ] hat night , before I went to bed , I said a prayer of my own – that I might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me . "
In short , Obama 's own approach is insistently charitable .
He assumes decency and good faith on the part of those who disagree with him .
And he wants to hear what they have to say .
Both in substance and in tone , Obama questions the conventional political distinctions between " the left " and " the right " .
To the extent that he is attracting support from Republicans and independents , it is largely for this reason .
Obama 's unusual background undoubtedly plays a significant role here .
He is , after all , a child of a woman from Kansas and a man from Kenya , an African - American who spent several years being raised by his white grandparents .
A former community organiser with extensive experience in the inner city , he became president of the Harvard Law Review and worked for much of his career at the University of Chicago .
He knows that simple divisions badly disserve human realities .
From knowing Obama for many years , I have no doubts about his ability to lead .
He knows a great deal , and he is a quick learner .
Even better , he knows what he does not know , and there is no question that he would assemble an accomplished , experienced team of advisers .
His brilliant administration of his own campaign provides helpful evidence here .
But there is some fragility to the public fervour that envelops him .
Crowds and cults can be fickle , and if some of his decisions disappoint , or turn out badly , his support will diminish .
Some people think it might even collapse .
My own concern involves the importance of internal debate .
The greatest American presidents benefited from robust dialogue and from advisers who were willing to say : " Mr President , your thinking about this is all wrong . "
Because Obama himself is exceptionally able , and because so many people are treating him as a near - messiah , his advisers might be too deferential , too unwilling to question .
There is a real risk here .
But I believe that his humility , and his intense desire to seek out dissenting views , will prove crucial safeguards .
In the 2000 campaign , George W Bush proclaimed himself a " uniter , not a divider " , only to turn out the most divisive President in memory .
Because of his own certainty , and his lack of curiosity about what others might think , Bush polarised the nation .
Many of his most ambitious plans went nowhere as a result .
As president , Barack Obama would be a genuine uniter .
If he proves able to achieve great things , for his nation and for the world , it will be above all for that reason .

Last month , we reported about Scripps Oceanographic Institute researchers ' work on the impact of climate change on the Western water crisis .
Now , the same researchers are back in a smaller scientific journal to answer a simple question posed in the title of their paper : " When Will Lake Mead Go Dry ? "
Based on models constructed from the analysis of historical records from the Federal Bureau of Land Reclamation , the researchers , Tim Barnett and David Pierce , say there is a ten percent chance the reservoir will be dry in 2014 , and a 50 percent chance no water will be left by 2021 .
Lake Mead was created by the Hoover Dam 's blockage of the Colorado River .
The river is fed by snow pack from Rockies , which has been decreasing .
The dam , of course , was one of the prototypical megaengineering efforts of the 20th century and a symbol of how human ingenuity could conquer any obstacle , including supplying water to a city the size of Las Vegas in the middle of the desert .
But the sheer amount of water that natural and manmade climate changes and human usage is drawing out of the Colorado River system is staggering .
The researchers estimate that 1 million acre-feet , or 326 billion gallons , of water are being leached out of the system each year .
They say that 's enough to supply 8 million people .
( Update : Hat tip to Keith for making me check my math ; I had shifted a few decimal places in an earlier version of this post .
Ah , the wisdom of crowd copyediting . )
Their conclusion is dire :
Today , we are at or beyond the sustainable limit of the Colorado system .
The alternative to reasoned solutions to this coming water crisis is a major societal and economic disruption in the desert southwest ; something that will affect each of us living in the region .
We 've nudged what has been a naturally replenishing system into a downward spiral .
While everyone hopes that there is a technological answer to generating fresh water–say , desalination , or wastewater recycling – those things cost money and energy , and will almost certainly drive up the cost of water .
But take a step back and look at the system , it defies reason to build huge cities in a desert that 's getting even dryer .
I have no doubt that as the price of water and air conditioning rise in Vegas and Phoenix , the low upfront housing costs and hot sun will start to lose their appeal .
I just hope that happens before we permanently break the Colorado River water system .

A Standard Missile - 3 ( SM - 3 ) is launched from the Pearl Harbor - based Aegis cruiser , USS Lake Erie ( CG 70 ) on November 6 , 2007 enroute to an intercept as part of a Missile Defense Agency test .
A similar missile will be used to shoot down a crippled spy satellite in coming weeks .
During the next week , a wayward U.S. spy satellite will makepasses across North America and western Europe soon after sunset and should beeasily visible to the unaided eye .
That 's if it does n't get shot down first .
The falling satelliteis named USA 193 .
It was launched Dec. 14 , 2006 .
It has been described as beingsimilar in size to a school bus and might weigh as much as 10,000 pounds .
Itcarries a sophisticated and secret imaging sensor but the satellite 's centralcomputer failed shortly after launch , never reaching its final orbit , and the Pentagon declared it a total loss in early 2007 .
Since then , the satellite 's orbit has been decaying — slowlyat first .
But in recent weeks USA 193's nearly circular orbit has been rapidlylowering .
Currently , its altitude is approximately 160 miles ( 260 km ) above the Earth .
Unless a proposed plan by the Pentagon is enacted to shoot down USA193 during the next week , the satellite could conceivably re-enter the Earth 's atmosphere and burn up sometime in mid-March .
Viewing opportunity
Today through Feb. 22 , USA 193 will make a number of eveningpasses over North America and western Europe .
It 's orbit is inclined58.5 - degrees to the equator , a setup that makes it readily observable from mostof the Northern Hemisphere .
During this period , USA 193 will move along a generalsouthwest - to - northeast trajectory and pass over a number of cities in the United States , southern Canada and western Europe .
To spot a specific satellite , you need to know when andwhere to look .
Predictions for the times and locations of USA 193 are available at the Heavens Above website ( www.heavens-above.com).Based on this website 's sighting information , USA 193 will be very favorablyplaced for observation over a number of large cities , assuming it is still inorbit around the Earth and weather conditions permit .
What to look for
To find satellites , it 's also helpful to know how to roughly measure the sky .
Your clenched fistheld at arm 's length measures roughly 10 - degrees of the sky .
( From the horizonto the top of the sky ( the zenith ) measures 90 - degrees . )
From Chicago , as an example , the spy satellite is predictedto reach as high as 38 - degrees above the horizon ( nearly four fists ) on Feb.17 .
That same date , as seen from Orlando , Florida , an evening pass as high as65 - degrees is predicted .
From Boston and Seattle , nearly overhead passes are forecastfor ( respectively ) Feb.18 and Feb. 22 .
And on the latter date , London , England should have a fine pass , with USA 193 arcing as high as 77 - degrees above the horizon .
It should be stressed that because of the rapidly changingnature of its orbit , sighting information from Heavens - Above should be checkedfrequently .
Those whohave seen the International Space Station ( ISS ) flying across their local skies should be aware that USA 193 will appear noticeably fainter , since it 's quite a bit smaller than the ISS .
Yet , at its brightest , the spy satellite still should rank as bright as thebrightest stars , at roughly first magnitude in astronomers parlance .
Also , sincethe spy satellite is in a lower orbit than the ISS , expect USA 193 to move much more rapidly across your line of sight .

SO WHAT ’S THE HOLD UP !
Why only for New York , Ohio , Delaware , and Massachusetts ?
Why none for her own State California , which I know has been screaming for impeachment .
And why none for me ?
I sent her a petition to put in the congressional record .
Actually , Congress has received millions of them !
While I ’m sure there ’s some procedural reason for her entering these into the record other than , ‘ Pelosi is pro-impeachment , ’ we should still contact Pelosi and tell her to follow through with the process .

OTTAWA ( Reuters ) - Air travelers in Canada who make comments about bombs and guns will from now on only be arrested if it is clear they are making a serious threat , officials said on Wednesday .
The Canadian Air Transport Safety Authority , trying to clamp down on screeners who alert police every time they hear alarming words , has issued a bulletin urging staff to show more discretion .
A person who announces “ You better look through my suitcase carefully , because there ’s a bomb in there ” , “ I am going to set fire to this airplane with this blowtorch ” or “ The man in seat 32 F has a machine gun ” will still be arrested .
But someone who remarks “ Your hockey team is going to get bombed ( badly beaten ) tonight ” , “ Hi Jack ! ” or “ You do n’t need to frisk me , I ’m not carrying a weapon ” will first be warned about their behavior .
Brigitte Caron , a spokeswoman for the authority , compared the new system to handing out yellow warning cards in soccer .
A player can receive one yellow card and still stay in the game .
“ Sometimes it ’s just a joke and the person will say ‘ I ’m sorry , I was upset ’ , ” she said .
In recent years more than 100 passengers have been arrested for making threatening remarks in Canadian airports , she added .
Iran says its nuclear programme is for solely civilian purposes
Fewer people now say Iran should face sanctions or military strikes over its refusal to abide by UN resolutions .
The United States and Western allies believe Iran may be developing nuclear weapons .
Iran vehemently denies this .
Of more than 30,000 people asked , most said Iran should be allowed to produce nuclear fuel if subject to UN checks .
" It appears that people in many countries are interested in ramping down the confrontation with Iran , while still using UN inspectors to ensure that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons , " said Steven Kull , director of Pipa , which carried out the poll in partnership with Globescan , on behalf of the BBC World Service .
The latest survey was carried out in 31 countries and draws on a similar poll conducted in June 2006 .
Public support for sanctions or military strikes has fallen in more than half of the countries surveyed , including in those where support for tough action was highest .
Support has dropped 10 points in Australia ( from 52 % to 42 % ) , nine points in Britain ( 43 % to 34 % ) , and nine points in Germany ( 46 % to 37 % ) .
Overall , only 7 % of those questioned in the Pipa / Globescan poll backed the idea of military strikes .
Most of the recent interviews were conducted after the release of the US National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) last December , which surprised many by saying Iran had halted its nuclear weapons programme in 2003 , says the BBC 's world affairs correspondent Frances Harrison .

Analysts said that assessment took some of the wind out of the sails of US and European - led efforts to increase pressure on Iran through UN sanctions .
However , the US government says it still sees Iran as a significant danger , and Israel says it believes it is aiming to build nuclear weapons .
They were two of only three countries surveyed in the poll where a marked majority backed sanctions or military action against Iran .
The other was South Korea .
China support
The NIE has contributed to a lessening of tension since 2006 , when the first BBC survey was conducted and international concern about Iran 's nuclear activities was at its height .
That was the year Iran broke the UN nuclear agency seals on its enrichment site at Natanz and announced it had successfully enriched uranium for the first time .
In 14 out of 21 countries surveyed in 2006 , at least 35 % of people supported tough action against Iran .
In 2008 , support reached 35 % in only 9 of those 21 countries .
On average , more than 40 % of people questioned in Asia , Africa , the Middle East and the Americas supported diplomacy as the route forward .
But , our correspondent Frances Harrison says , Iran may find it worrying that China - one of its most important trading partners and a permanent UN Security Council member with a veto vote - was not far behind , with 40 % of people backing punitive measures .
Figures do not sum to 100 % , as ' do n't knows ' have not been included
Methodology : In total 32,039 citizens in Argentina , Australia , Canada , Chile , China , Costa Rica , Egypt , El Salvador , France , Ghana , Germany , Great Britain , Guatemala , Honduras , India , Indonesia , Israel , Italy , Japan , Kenya , Mexico , Nicaragua , Nigeria , Panama , the Philippines , Portugal , Russia , South Korea , Spain , Turkey , and the United States were interviewed face - to - face or by telephone between October 31 , 2007 and January 25 , 2008 .
Polling was conducted for the BBC World Service by the international polling firm GlobeScan and its research partners in each country .
In 13 of the 31 countries , the sample was limited to major urban areas .
The margin of error per country ranges from +/- 2.4 to 4.4 per cent .
SCOTTSBORO - Jackson County Circuit Judge John Graham today ordered the Scottsboro City Board of Education to allow a gay couple to attend Scottsboro High School 's senior - junior prom tonight .
Chelsea Overstreet , 17 , a junior at the high school , and her date Lauren Martin , 16 , a sophomore at the school , were initially told by school officials they could not attend because the school board does not allow students of the same sex to attend the prom together , their lawyer Parker Edmiston of Scottsboro said in a press conference this afternoon .
Because there is no state law specific to the issue , Graham cited a federal court ruling that prohibits public schools from barring same - sex couples from proms .
" It was a letdown " when they were told they could n't go to the prom as a couple , said Martin 's mother , Connnie Farrington of Scottsboro .
She said her daughter had just bought a suit when a teacher told her about two weeks ago that she could not go to the prom unless she was with a boy .
But now she 's ecstatic , " she said , after hearing about the judge 's ruling earlier today .
Both Martin and Overstreet attended the press conference .
Martin was dressed in a tuxedo and Overstreet was in her prom dress .
They were to have photographs made after the conference prior to going to the 8 p.m. prom at Scottsboro 's Goosepond Civic Center .

The Home Secretary came under fire last night for allowing a radical Lebanese propagandist with links to the extremist group Hezbollah to enter Britain for a national speaking tour .
The Conservatives urged Jacqui Smith to ban Ibrahim Moussawi from the UK , warning that he was " likely to foment extremism or promote violence " .
Mr Moussawi edits Hezbollah 's newspaper and is former political editor of the Iranian - backed group 's television station , which is banned in many countries including France , Spain and the U.S. where its output is seen as anti-Semitic .

The radical propagandist : Ibrahim Moussawi , who edits Hezbollah 's newspaper , will tour Britain
He was recently barred from entering Ireland , where he was due to speak at anti-war meetings .
He is scheduled to appear at an event in London tonight organised by the Stop the War Coalition , with more events planned around the country over the coming week .
Shadow Security Minister Baroness Neville - Jones attacked the Government 's record of allowing radical extremists into the UK , after ministers previously ignored calls to deny Mr Moussawi entry to the UK .
She said : " The Government has the power to deny entry to people whose presence is not conducive to the public good .
" Yet in the past they have let in extremists to preach hate .
" Jacqui Smith failed to stop Ibrahim Moussawi from coming last December , despite my specific request that she do so .
" Regardless of what Moussawi actually says when he is here , it is vital that the Government always makes the security of the UK its top priority .
" That means stopping those who are likely to foment extremism or promote violence from coming here to speak .
Ibrahim Moussawi should not be allowed to return to the UK . "
The Stop the War Coalition website describes Mr Moussawi as " Editor of the journal Al - Intiqad in Lebanon , linked to Hezbollah . "
Last night , the Home Office would not comment on Mr Moussawi 's case , although sources confirmed that his visa had been approved for the trip .
Al - Manar television - the Arabic word for " beacon " - where he worked until recently as foreign and political editor , is Hezbollah 's main mouthpiece in the Middle East and around the world , broadcasting from Beirut .
It describes itself as the " station of resistance " and campaigns on behalf of Hezbollah and against the state of Israel , and American and British policy in the Middle East .
It routinely describes fighters who are killed and suicide bombers as " martyrs " , and condemns Israeli forces as criminals .
The station has been widely condemned for anti-Semitism after it broadcast a 30 - part series based on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , a forged document setting out a supposed secret Jewish conspiracy to take over the world .
Bosses at the station deny anti-Semitism , claiming they are merely anti-Israeli .
Last month , David Cameron accused Gordon Brown of failing to tackle the dangers from extremist preachers radicalising audiences in the UK .
The Home Office said last night that the Home Secretary uses powers to exclude foreign nationals whose presence is " not conducive to the public good " when it is justified and " based on all the available evidence " .
A spokesman said : " Since July 2005 , successive Home Secretaries have made robust use of this power to exclude 76 individuals from the UK .
" In the same period , a further 136 individuals have been excluded on grounds of national security . "
Epictetusâ€ ™ Top 7 Timeless Pearls of Wisdom
Now , who is Epictetus you may ask ?
He was a Greek philosopher that lived about 1900 years ago .
When he was young he was a slave in Rome but was later released and started to teach philosophy first in Rome and later on in Greece .
Epictetus was somewhat of a lonesome minimalist .
He lived with few possessions and by himself for a long time .
He also seems to never have written anything , but luckily his thoughts were recorded by his pupil Arrian .
Here are seven excellent pearls of wisdom from Epictetus .
If you are going your own way , prepare for reactions .
â€ œIf you want to improve , be content to be thought foolish and stupid.â€ 
Besides being a funny quote I believe it is very relevant to self - improvement .
If you start changing then people may react in different ways .
Some may be happy for you .
Some may be indifferent .
Some may be puzzled or react in negative and discouraging ways .
Much of these reactions are probably not so much about you but about the person who said it and his / her life .
How they feel about themselves is shining through in the words they use and judgements they make .
And thatâ€™s OK .
Most likely they wonâ€™t react as negatively as you may imagine .
Or they will probably at least go back to focusing on their own challenges pretty soon .
Plusâ€¦
You choose to be insulted .
â€ œIt is not he who reviles or strikes you who insults you , but your opinion that these things are insulting .â€ 
What you feel and how you react to something is always up to you .
There may be a â€œnormalâ€ or a common to react to different things .
But that mostly just all it is .
You can choose your own thoughts , reactions and emotions to pretty much everything .
You donâ€™t have to freak out , overreact of even react in a negative way .
Perhaps not every time or instantly .
Sometimes a knee - jerk reaction just goes off .
Or an old thought habit kicks in .
But as you realize that no - one outside of yourself can actually control how you feel you can start to incorporate this thinking into your daily life and develop it as a thought habit .
A habit that you can grow stronger and stronger over time .
Doing this makes life a whole lot easier and more pleasurable .
Forget about what you think you know .
â€ œIt is impossible to begin to learn that which one thinks one already knows.â€ 
If you think that you already know something then your mind will not be open to actually learning it .
Whatever someone is telling you your mind will sort through based on what you think you know .
Youâ€™ll only hear and learn what you what you want to hear and learn .
So whenever you want to learn anything it may be a good tip to disregard as much as possible of what you think you know .
In my experience this makes it easier to pick things up and not disregard important stuff .
Of course , the ego often wants to jump in to meddle and strengthen itself by making you think that you already know whatever youâ€ ™re about to learn .
Be careful in trusting that somewhat arrogant inner voice . :)
Listen .
â€ œWe have two ears and one mouth so that we can listen twice as much as we speak.â€ 
This is a useful piece of advice in just about any interaction .
Itâ€™s useful when learning something new .
And itâ€™s helpful just while in a regular conversation .
Itâ€™s not always easy to stick to it though .
Sometimes you get too excited about something to keep quiet .
Sometimes you just want to brag or recount what happened .
Having the attention of all the other people feels good .
So how do you get around this habit of hogging the spotlight ?
One useful way is to just forget about yourself .
Focus your attention outward instead of inward in a conversation .
Place the mental focus on the person you are talking and listening to instead of yourself .
Placing the focus outside of yourself makes you less self - centred and your need to hog the spotlight decreases .
If you start to actually listen to what people are saying it also becomes easier to find potential paths in the conversation .
By asking open - ended questions â€ “ the ones that will give you more than a yes or no answer â€ “ you can explore these paths and have better and more fun conversations .
Appreciate what you have .
â€ œHe is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not , but rejoices for those which he has.â€ 
One good way to live a miserable life is to constantly focus on what you donâ€™t have .
If you appreciate what you have youâ€™ll find everyday life more pleasurable .
However , that doesnâ€™t mean that you shouldnâ€™t focus on what you want .
To me itâ€™s more about focusing on what you want and not keeping your focus in a more popular place : on what you lack .
This will make it easier to get what you want since you always seem to notice and receive more of whatever you focus you mind upon .
You can read more about this under mistake # 6 in 9 Great Ways to Make Yourself Absolutely Miserable .
Notice what is reflected .
â€ œWhen you are offended at any man 's fault , turn to yourself and study your own failings .
Then you will forget your anger.â€ 
I really like this one because Iâ€™ve become more and more interested in how we relate to each other .
Like how what someone says about you may not be much of a reflection of you but of the person that said it .
This is a good thing to remember whenever someone is saying something negative about you .
Itâ€™s also useful to remember whenever you feel negatively about someone else .
It can not only help you forget about your negative emotion .
It can also help you to learn more about yourself , what you fear and how you may be fooling yourself .
Suffering is optional .
And so is happiness .
â€ œThere is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will .â€ 
â€ œI must die .
Must I then die lamenting ?
I must be put in chains .
Must I then also lament ?
I must go into exile .
Does any man then hinder me from going with smiles and cheerfulness and contentment ?â€ 
â€ œIt is not death or pain that is to be dreaded , but the fear of pain or death.â€ 
Suffering is optional .
And so is happiness .
What you choose to think about determines how you feel .
Now , again , it may be â€œnormalâ€ and common to go through a lot of mindmade suffering after the initial pain that ignited the suffering .
And itâ€™s easy to slip back into old thoroughly ingrained thought habits .
One tip that I have found helpful for this is to learn to reconnect as much as possible with the present moment .
Suffering is to a large extent created when your mind is thinking thoughts about either the past or a possible future .
You can learn a handful of good ways to connect with present in 8 Ways to Return with The Present Moment .
It is also very useful to realize that you are not your thoughts or emotions .
They are just things that are flowing through you .
But they are not you .
You are the one observing them .
This realization can gradually free you more and more from keeping negative thought and emotions going .
Whenever they arise and you realize that you arenâ€™t them , that you donâ€™t have to identify with them their power over you fades and vanishes quicker than if you had identified with them completely .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Federal regulators stressed the importance of leaving the United States open to investments by sovereign wealth funds Wednesday , but warned of the need to push for better transparency among these growing state - sponsored entities .
Testifying before two subcommittees of the House Financial Services Committee , representatives from the Treasury Department , Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Reserve said that these funds not only foster domestic economic growth but have provided stability to financial markets and U.S. companies .
" If we were to prohibit sovereign wealth funds from investing in our market for fear they might introduce market distortions , there is a risk we might actually end up doing precisely this to ourselves , " said Ethiopis Tafara , director of the office of international affairs for the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Congress is examining these controversial investments after foreign funds pumped more than $ 40 billion into Wall Street firms in recent months .
Some world leaders , as well as the American public , are concerned that these funds may try to wield these investments as a diplomatic tool .
The worries are fueled by the funds ' lack of transparency about their operations .
A majority of American voters think these foreign infusions harm both the national security and the economy of the United States , according to a recent survey by Public Strategies Inc .
Lawmakers generally spoke highly of the funds ' operations in the U.S. during Wednesday 's hearing , but they acknowledged the need to examine them more closely .
" We must ensure they play by the same rules that all large investors play by , and must assure that sovereign wealth funds do not pursue purely nationalistic [ goals ] at the expense of the companies in which they invest , " said Rep. Spencer Bachus , R - Al .
Some groups like the International Monetary Fund have encouraged these funds to develop a voluntary set of " best practices " , which would include disclosing , among other things , their investment positions , ownership stakes , and size of their resources .
Sovereign wealth funds , which act as a country 's investment arm , have long invested money gained through exports or from the sale of commodities such as oil .
But they have ramped up their infusions into a range of American companies , including Motorola ( MOT , Fortune 500 ) and Home Depot ( HD , Fortune 500 ) , purchasing stakes worth a total of $ 414 billion in 2007 , up 90 % from the year before , according to Rep. Luis Gutierrez , D - Ill. , chair of the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy .
The credit crisis , which has left several financial firms strapped for cash , opened up even more opportunities for these funds .
A number of Wall Street firms have looked to sovereign wealth funds to raise capital .
So far , Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) has raised $ 22 billion from state funds located in Abu Dhabi , Kuwait and Singapore .
Others have enacted similar moves including Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) , which has raised nearly $ 13 billion from the governments of Kuwait , Korea and Singapore 's state - run Temasek Holdings .
In December , Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) said it received a $ 5 billion injection from China 's state - run investment arm , China Investment Corp .
These funds , however , are expected to experience exponential growth in a short period of time .
In the next three years , their combined assets under management are expected to quadruple to $ 7.9 trillion from $ 1.9 trillion , according estimated published last fall by Merrill Lynch .
Their growing clout was an area of concern for some lawmakers Wednesday , including Rep. Paul Kanjorski , D - Penn. , who chairs the subcommittee on Capital Markets , Insurance and Government Sponsored Enterprises .
" What do we do over the next decade or two as these numbers run up ? " asked Kanjorski .
" At what point will we lose control ? "
Also attending Wednesday 's hearing were representatives from Norway 's state - run fund and Singapore 's Temasek Holdings .
Both speakers , whose funds are considered among the most transparent by experts , acknowledged the vigorous debate about sovereign wealth funds and stressed their investments were simply an effort to provide for the beneficiaries of their funds - their citizens .
When asked about what impact a protectionist stance by the United States could have , Simon Israel , the executive director of Temasek Holdings , stressed that it would not only affect his fund , but would have domestic consequences as well .
" We believe that it would be damaging to our mutual interests in that respect , " said Israel .
When I first released PerfectTablePlan I considered 50 - 200 guests as a typical event size , with 500 + guests a large event .
But my customers have been using the software for ever larger events , with some as large as 3000 guests .
While the software could cope with this number of guests , it was n’t very responsive .
In particular the genetic algorithm I use to optimise seating arrangements ( which seats people together or apart , depending on their preferences ) required running for at least an hour for the largest plans .
This is hardly surprising when you consider that seating assignment is a combinatorial problem in the same NP - hard class as the notorious travelling salesman problem .
The number of seating combinations for 1000 guests in 1000 seats is 1000 ! , which is a number with 2,658 digits .
Even the number of seating combinations for just 60 guests is more than the number of atoms in the known universe .
But customers really do n’t care about how mathematically intractable a problem is .
They just want it solved .
Now .
Or at least by the time they get back from their coffee .
So I made a serious effort to optimise the performance in the latest release , particularly for the automatic seat assignment .
Here are the results :
Total time taken to automatically assign seats in 128 sample table plans varying in size from 0 to 1500 guests
The chart shows that the new version automatically assigns seats more than 5 times faster over a wide range of table plans .
The median improvement in speed is 66 % , but the largest plans were solved over ten times faster .
How did I do it ?
Mostly by straightening out a few kinks .
Some years ago I purchased my first dishwasher .
I was really excited about being freed from the unspeakable tyranny of having to wash dishes by hand ( bear with me ) .
I installed it myself – how hard could it be ?
It took 10 hours to do a wash cycle .
Convinced that the dishwasher was faulty I called the manufacturer .
They sent out an engineer who quickly spotted that I had kinked the water inlet pipe as I had pushed the dishwasher into place .
It was taking at least 9 hours to get enough water to start the cycle .
Oops .
As soon as the kink was straightened it worked perfectly , completing a cycle in less than an hour .
Speeding up software is rather similar – you just need to straighten out the kinks .
The trick is knowing where the kinks are .
Experience has taught me that it is pretty much impossible to guess where the performance bottlenecks are in any non-trivial piece of software .
You have to measure it using a profiler .
Unfortunately Visual Studio 2005
Standard does n’t seem to include profiling tools .
You have to pay for one of the more expensive versions of Visual Studio to get a profiler .
This seems rather mean .
But then again I was given a copy of VS2005 Standard for free by some nice Microsofties – after I had spent 10 minutes berating them on the awfulness of their “ works with vista ” program ( shudder ) .
So I used an evaluation version of LTProf.
LTProf samples your running application a number of times per second , works out which line and function is being executed and uses this to build up a picture of where the program is spending most time .
After a bit of digging through the results I was able to identify a few kinks .
Embarrassingly one of them was that the automatic seat assignment was reading a value from the Windows registry in a tight inner loop .
Reading from the registry is very slow compared to reading from memory .
Because the registry access was buried a few levels deep in function calls it was n’t obvious that this was occurring .
It was trivial to fix once identified .
Another problem was that some intermediate values were being continually recalculated , even though none of the input values had changed .
Again this was fairly trivial to fix .
I also found that one part of the seat assignment genetic algorithm took time proportional to the square of the number of guests ( O( n ^ 2 ) ) .
After quite a bit of work I was able to reduce this to a time linearly proportional to the number of guests ( O( n ) ) .
This led to big speed improvements for larger table plans .
I did n’t attempt any further optimisation as I felt was getting into diminishing returns .
I also straightened out some kinks in reading and writing files , redrawing seating charts and exporting data .
The end result is that the new version of PerfectTablePlan is now much more usable for plans with 1000 + guests .
I was favourably impressed with LTProf and will probably buy a copy next time I need to do some optimisation .
At $ 49.95 it is very cheap compared to many other profilers ( Intel VTune is $ 699 ) .
LTProf was relatively simple to use and interpret , but it did have quirks .
In particular , it showed some impossible call trees ( showing X called by Y , where this was n’t possible ) .
This may have been an artefect of the sampling approach taken .
I will probably also have a look at the free MacOSX Shark profiler at some point .
I also tried tweaking compiler settings to see how much difference this made .
Results are shown below .
You can see that there is a marked difference with and without compiler optimisation , and a noticeable difference between the - O1 and - O2 optimisations ( the smaller the bar , the better , obviously ) :
Effect of VS2005 compiler optimisation on automatic seating assignment run time
Obviously the results might be quite different for your own application , depending on the types of calculations you are doing .
My genetic algorithm is requires large amounts of integer arithmetic and list traversal and manipulation .
The difference in executable sizes due to optimisation is small :
I tried the two other optimisation flags in addition to - O2 .
/ OPT : NOWIN98 – section alignment does not have to be optimal for Windows 98 .
/ GL – turns on global optimisation ( e.g. across source files , instead of just within source files ) .
Neither made much noticeable difference :
However it should be noted that most of the genetic algorithm is compiled in a single file already , so perhaps / GL could n’t be expected to add much .
I compared VC++6 and VS2005 version of the same program and found that VS2005 was significantly faster [ 1 ] :
I also compared GCC compiler optimisation for the MacOSX version .
Compared with VS2005 GCC has a more noticeable difference between optimised and unoptimised , but a smaller difference between the different optimisations :
Surprisingly - O3 was slower than - O2 .
Again the effect of optimisation on executable size is small .
I also tested the relative speeds of my 3 main development machines [ 2 ] :
It is interesting to note that the XP box runs the seat assignment at near 100 % CPU utilisation , but the Vista box never goes above 50 % CPU utilisation .
This is because the Vista box is a dual core , but my the seat assignment is currently only single threaded .
I will probably add multi- threading in a future version to improve the CPU utilisation on multi-core machines .
In conclusion :
Do n’t assume , measure .
Use a profiler to find out where your application is spending all its time .
It almost certainly wo n’t be where you expected .
Get the algorithm right .
This can make orders of magnitude difference to the runtime .
Compiler optimisation is worth doing , perhaps giving a 2 - 4 times speed improvement over an application built without compiler optimisation .
It probably is n’t worth spending too much time tweaking compiler settings though .
Do n’t let a software engineer fit your dishwasher .

Not strictly like - for - like as the VC++6 version used dynamic
Qt libraries , while the VS2005 version used static Qt libraries .
[ 2 ] I am assuming that VS2005 and GCC produce comparably fast executables when both set to - O2 .

転置インデック ス [ 2007-06 -17-6 ]
による検索システムの実装はパフォーマンスを無視すれば意外と簡単です。それを示すために
Perl で簡単な検索システムを作ってみました。検索方式は転置インデックス( Inverted Index ) 、ランキングに は TF - IDF [ 2005-10 - 12-1 ]
を用いました。検索対象ファイルは一行一記事で以下のフォーマットとします。記事IDは数字、記事内容は
UTF -8 の文字で構成されるものとします。以下のようなサンプル test.txt を用意しました。まずは、インデックスを作ります。インデックス単位は文字bigram
( 隣接2文字)とします。インデックスファイルのフォーマットは以下の通りです。検索対象ファイルからインデックスファイルを作成するプログラムindex.pl
です。6-20行が検索対象ファイルを読み込みインデックスを作成する部分、21行以降が作成したインデックスを出力する部分です。前者では、一行ずつ読み込んだ記事の記事内容文字列を文字に分解し(9-11行)、隣接する2文字をつなげてbigramにし(14行目)、そのbigramが出現する記事IDをハッシュに格納しています(16行目)。これを実行してインデックスファイル test.idx を作ります。完成したインデックスファイル test.idx は以下のようになります（長いので途中部分を省略しています）。NUMは検索対象ファイルに含まれている記事数で、TF-IDFのIDFの計算に使用します。さて、次はこのインデックスファイルを使って検索します。検索プログラム search.pl は以下の通りです。6-14行が先ほど作ったインデックスファイルを読み込む部分、19-24行が検索キー文字列をbigramにしそれぞれのTFを計算する部分、25-32行が各bigramごとにTF-IDFを計算し各記事のスコアに加算する部分、33行以降が各記事をスコアの高い順に出力（検索結果ランキング表示）する部分です。では search.pl で検索してみます。第一引数にインデックスファイルを指定します。検索キーは標準入力から入力します。文字コードは
UTF - 8 です。一番スコアが高いのが記事ID
3 の 「ペンギン大好き」でした。なお、この実装では極端に長い記事のスコアが高くなる傾向にあり、検索精度が問題になると思われます。スコアを長さで正規化すると良いかもしれません。Google や Yahoo ! などの Web 検索エンジンも 、Namazu や Hyper Estraier などの全文検索エンジンも、基本はこれです。
As turtle - tastic as broadband is in the US compared to Asia , other than Time Warner 's experiment to charge by the byte , at least consumption - based billing has mostly been a problem for Canadians .
Until now .
Justin from Bend , Oregon just sent us his ISP 's new pricing plan , which makes Time Warner 's look supremely generous : $ 55 a month buys you a measly 50 GB running at a respectable 16 M bps downstream .
If you run over , it 's an extra $ 1.50 per GB .
We hope Bend residents are n't huge fans of iTunes rentals — they 'll chew through your allowance mighty quick .
Welcome to what 's shaping up to be the scary future of broadband in this country :
It 'll be faster , but it 's either going to be filtered , slowed down or capped .

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) --
With economic issues topping voter concerns this election season , Illinois Sen .
Barack Obama is planning to deliver what his campaign is billing as a " major " speech about the economy on Thursday morning in New York City .
Details were n't available Wednesday morning , but the Democratic presidential contender is scheduled to speak at 9:15 a.m. Eastern Thursday at Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York City .
Obama 's speech on the economy will follow remarks made Tuesday by Republican nominee - in - waiting John McCain about the housing market , and housing market plans laid out by New York Sen. Hillary Clinton on Monday .
McCain said top U.S. mortgage lenders should provide " maximum support " to help cash - strapped but creditworthy customers keep their homes and called for greater transparency in the lending process .
Clinton is seeking a $ 30 billion emergency housing fund that would go to states and localities to help head off foreclosures , as well as backing other steps like a bill that would expand the government 's capacity to guarantee mortgages that are reworked on affordable terms .
" The Clinton approach demonstrates , in our view , a clear preference to use government intervention in the mortgage markets , " wrote analyst Brian Gardner of Keefe , Bruyette & Woods in a note on Wednesday .
The Democratic candidates are jockeying for position ahead of the next contest , Pennsylvania 's April 22 primary .
Clinton is leading Obama in the state , but when it comes to the general election , McCain is competitive with both Democrats .
Housing continues to be a major economic worry for Americans as the slump continues .
On Tuesday , Standard & Poor 's said home prices in 20 major U.S. metro areas have plunged a record 10.7 % in the past year as prices continued to decelerate .
See full story .
I ’ve said it a thousand times but I ’ll repeat it once more .
When they first announced the new Iron Man movie , I thought it was a stupid idea .
I do n’t care about Iron Man , and quite frankly I think he ’s a bit of a lame comic book character .
But over the last year I ’ve slowly began to get won over with the studio apparently making all the right decisions about for this movie .
From casting , director , visual effects company … you name it .
The first trailer came out and it was really good .
Now this new trailer is here … and it rocks my bloody world .
Holy shit this thing looks fantastic .
Check it out !

SANTA FE , N.M. 
“ Are you glad to see me , Santa Fe ? ” Edward M. Kennedy roared .
“ Yes ! ” Santa
Fe roared back .
There were whoops and “ Viva Kennedy ” chants from the overflow crowd at a community college .
A man in the back held an “ Obama 2008 , Kennedy 2016 ” sign .
“ Estoy muy contento estar aquí en Santa Fe con usted , ” Mr. Kennedy said in perfectly accented Spanish  that is , perfectly Boston - accented Spanish .
( “ I am very happy to be here in Santa Fe with you , ” he was trying to say , somewhat imperfectly . )
But Mr. Kennedy , the Massachusetts Democrat , is ever game for trying , and the crowd ate it up .
The white - haired liberal legend with a bad back , halting speech and worn brown shoes has been called a “ lion in winter ” so many times that he has the political cliché version of frostbite .
Yet Mr. Kennedy , 75 , is hot , hot , hot on the trail , stumping for Senator Barack Obama , who was 15 months old when Mr. Kennedy began his Senate career in 1962 .
He is drawing raucous crowds , invoking the family legacy , working the lunch crowd at the Flying Tortilla in Santa Fe and getting the kitchen staff together for a photo .
Arriving at a rally in East Los Angeles on Friday , Mr. Kennedy was swarmed by a couple of dozen reporters and the like , a big , fuzzy boom mike hovering over his head , autograph hounds and cellphone - camera paparazzi at the perimeter .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush on Thursday announced a suspension of U.S. troop withdrawals from Iraq this summer to allow the military to reassess the security situation , as U.S. air strikes killed 10 people in a Baghdad slum where dozens of people died in clashes this week .
Iraqi police said on Thursday that U.S. air strikes killed 10 people in Sadr City , a militia stronghold in eastern Baghdad where street fighting had eased after four days of clashes that killed close to 90 people .
Bush endorsed a recommendation by his commander in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , to complete a limited withdrawal of combat troops by July , but then impose a 45 - day freeze of the total at about 140,000 troops before considering more possible cuts .
“ I ’ve told him he ’ll have all the time he needs , ” Bush said in Washington .
The Sadr City slum has since Sunday been the focal point of battles between security forces and black - masked Mehdi Army militiamen loyal to Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr .
The violence is an extension of clashes that erupted in March when Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki cracked down on the militia in the southern city of Basra .
It has colored a U.S. election - year debate over troop cuts by highlighting the fragility of recent security gains .
In his speech , Bush stepped up his criticism of Iran , accusing it of backing militants behind attacks in Iraq , and said failure in Iraq would embolden both Iran and al Qaeda .
“ Iraq is the convergence point for two of the greatest threats to America in this new century : al Qaeda and Iran , ” Bush said , although he reassured a weary public that the war will end .
“ While this war is difficult , it is not endless , ” he said of the conflict , now in its sixth year .
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates held out the prospect of more troop withdrawals this autumn .
“ I would emphasize that the hope , depending on conditions on the ground , is to reduce our presence further this fall , ” he told the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee .
U.S. STRIKES
Iraqi police said two separate U.S. air strikes on Thursday killed six people and wounded 10 in Sadr City .
Lt. Col. Steven Stover , a U.S. military spokesman , confirmed two strikes on a suspected rocket site from a drone plane but said he was unaware of any deaths .
Late on Wednesday , a U.S. helicopter fired two missiles at gunmen in the slum who attacked a joint U.S. - Iraqi security station , killing four , Stover said .
Iraqi police and hospital officials said two of the four dead were young boys .

A roadside bomb also killed a U.S. soldier in Baghdad overnight , raising the U.S. military death toll in Iraq to 20 for April , putting this month on track to be the deadliest for American soldiers since September .
U.S. military deaths have averaged roughly one a day over the past six months but that number has doubled in April .
Still , police , the U.S. military and residents said the streets of Sadr City were calmer than in the past four days , when Sadr ’s militia battled the U.S. and Iraqi military .

“ The situation is quieter .
We are hearing sporadic gunfire and U.S. combat planes have been flying overhead but the Iraqi military is not in the streets like past days , ” Sadr City resident Raad al - Humairi said .
“ Some shops have opened .
People buy what they need and then the shops close again . ”
For the first time in many days , the U.S. Embassy said the heavily fortified Green Zone in central Baghdad had not sustained rocket or mortar attacks from Sadr ’s militia .
The Iraqi military plans to lift on Saturday a 2 - week - old vehicle blockade in Sadr City that has led to piled - up rubbish and food and medicine shortages in the district of 2 million people .
On Thursday , U.S. and Iraqi forces raided a Sadr office in the town of Numaniya , south of Baghdad , seizing weapons and imposing a curfew , police said .
Under Bush ’s plan , the military will complete a withdrawal in July of some 20,000 extra combat troops deployed in the past year but then pause before deciding whether more can be pulled out .
Bush also said he was reducing combat tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan to one year from 15 months .
SIT is an integral tire component that uses atmospheric air to automatically inflate the tire while it is used .
This ensures maintenance - free , constant tire pressure over the lifetime of the tire .
Sounds like magic to me .
How long until the magic item that is constantly adding pressure to said tire runs out of air ?
And how would you know that it was out ?
( A flat tire ? )
Do n't get me wrong .
Anything that keeps tire pressure constant is absolutely wonderful , even if it eventually runs out .
I would love to have this on my car , and it ultimately would be great for the environment if we all had it .
I am just trying to understand at what point this new feature would fail , and how we would know .
No bang for Paul ’s buck
An idea calling for Roy Jones Jr. to fight Felix Trinidad with a “ Ron Paul for President ” tattoo on his back Saturday night has been kayoed by the former boxing champion .
“ This is going to be Roy Jones ’ last fight , and he did n’t want it to be remembered for that , ” said Heath Whitaker , a fan of both Jones and Paul , the long shot Republican presidential candidate .
A doctored photograph appeared on the Gambling 911.com Web site depicting Jones with a “ Ron Paul 2008 ” advertisement on his back along with an American flag .
A story on the site said the candidate ’s supporters had hoped to buy the space between Jones ’ shoulders for the fight between the former champions .
“ Sixty - one million homes , ” said a resigned Whitaker who had offered Jones $ 50,000 to sport the Paul tattoo for the HBO - televised bout .
Whitaker said he also contacted Don King about purchasing ads for Paul on the ring girl cards but had yet to hear back from the fight promoter .
He did not , however , contact the Trinidad camp about advertising on the bottom of the Puerto Rican ’s shoes in case of a knockout .
No , really .
It is .
Seriously .

Today 's testimony before the House was not quite as riveting as yesterday 's Senate session for Petraeus , but I did catch this little tidbit that had me wondering .
Rep. Buck McKeon asks Gen. Petraeus to speak to troop morale and this is what he had to say :
Congressman , first of all , let me just say that … I do n’t want to start off by generalizing about morale … I want to start off by explaining morale is an individual event .
And morale depends from soldier to soldier , and for me as well , on the kind of day that you ’re having out there in the theatre .
And it ’s a roller coaster existence .
Now , having said that , as there is actually something called “ The Mental Health Assessment ” which is done every year , the last one in the late fall , I believe it was .
And after several years of a generalization of morale as going down , morale actually went up .
Really ?
Up ???
Five years in , a backdoor draft of stoploss and 3 , 4 , and 5 tours of duty and the troops are feeling better now ?
Well , that did n't compute for me , so I had to go find this " Mental Health Assessment " ( . pdf ) and sure enough , on page 24 , there 's the statistics Petraeus quoted :
Soldiers ratings of unit morale were significantly higher in 2007 than in 2006 after controlling for sample differences of ( 1 ) gender , ( 2 ) rank , and ( 3 ) months in theater .
Figure 2 shows the raw percentages ( top graph ) and adjusted percents ( bottom graph ) .
Notice in the bottom graph that the adjusted percent of Soldiers who rate unit morale high or very high in 2007 is close to double the estimate from 2006 .
Ah , there 's the rub .
If you factor out the women , the NCOs and those who have done multiple tours of duty over several years , things are looking great !
By the way , I admit I was never a math major , but that last sentence about the morale being close to double this year ... well , that 's true if 7.4 % was half of 13.1 % .
Either way , that 's only 1 out of every 7 troop members who consider their morale high .
Is that something to celebrate ?
Or maybe Petraeus wanted to get out in front of this NY Times article :
Army leaders are expressing increased alarm about the mental health of soldiers who would be sent back to the front again and again under plans that call for troop numbers to be sustained at high levels in Iraq for this year and beyond .
Among combat troops sent to Iraq for the third or fourth time , more than one in four show signs of anxiety , depression or acute stress , according to an official Army survey of soldiers ' mental health . [..]
Among the 513,000 active - duty soldiers who have served in Iraq since the invasion of 2003 , more than 197,000 have deployed more than once , and more than 53,000 have deployed three or more times , according to a separate set of statistics provided this week by Army personnel officers .
The percentage of troops sent back to Iraq for repeat deployments would have to increase in the months ahead .
The Army study of mental health showed that 27 percent of noncommissioned officers - a critically important group - on their third or fourth tour exhibited symptoms commonly referred to as post - traumatic stress disorders .
That figure is far higher than the roughly 12 percent who exhibit those symptoms after one tour and the 18.5 percent who develop the disorders after a second deployment , according to the study , which was conducted by the Army surgeon general 's Mental Health Advisory Team .
And that does n't even begin to talk about happens when they finally do return home .
That 's why it 's so important for us to support Sen. Jim Webb's Dwell Time Amendment .
Hear that , McCain ?
You want them to stay until the job is done , you have to take care of them to do so .
Brown University professor Peter Schultz ’s study of the Peruvian meteorite has yielded some interesting conclusions that could upend the conventional wisdom about the size and type of meteorites that can strike Earth .
The Carancas Fireball
Planetary geologists had thought that stony meteorites would be destroyed when they passed through Earth ’s atmosphere .
This one struck ground near Carancas , Peru , at about 15,000 miles per hour .
Brown University geologists have advanced a new theory that would upend current thinking about stony meteorites .
Image : Peter Schultz , Brown University PROVIDENCE , R.I. [ Brown University ] —
It made news around the world : On Sept. 15 , 2007 , an object hurtled through the sky and crashed into the Peruvian countryside .
Scientists dispatched to the site near the village of Carancas found a gaping hole in the ground .
Peter Schultz , professor of geological sciences at Brown University and an expert in extraterrestrial impacts , went to Peru to learn more .
For the first time , he will present findings from his travels at the 39th annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in League City , Texas , in a talk scheduled for 2 p.m. on March 11 , 2008 .
Brown graduate student Robert “ Scott ” Harris collaborated on the research , joined by Jose Ishitsuka , a Peruvian astrophysicist , and Gonzalo Tancredi , an astronomer from Uruguay .
What Schultz and his team found is surprising .
The object that slammed into a dry riverbed in Peru was a meteorite , and it left a 49 - foot - wide crater .
Soil ejected from the point of impact was found nearly four football fields away .
When Schultz ’s team analyzed the soil where the fireball hit , he found “ planar deformation features , ” or fractured lines in sand grains found in the ground .
Along with evidence of debris strewn over a wide area , the shattered sand grains told Schultz that the meteorite had maintained a high rate of speed as it shot through the atmosphere .
Scientists think it was traveling at roughly 15,000 miles per hour at the moment of impact .
“ Normally with a small object like this , the atmosphere slows it down , and it becomes the equivalent of a bowling ball dropping into the ground , ” Schultz said .
“ It would make a hole in the ground , like a pit , but not a crater .
But this meteorite kept on going at a speed about 40 to 50 times faster than it should have been going . ”
Scientists have determined the Carancas fireball was a stony meteorite – a fragile type long thought to be ripped into pieces as it enters the Earth ’s atmosphere and then leaves little more than a whisper of its journey .
Yet the stony meteorite that struck Peru survived its passage mostly intact before impact .
“ This just is n’t what we expected , ” Schultz said .
“ It was to the point that many thought this was fake .
It was completely inconsistent with our understanding how stony meteorites act . ”
Schultz said that typically fragments from meteorites shoot off in all directions as the object speeds to Earth .
But he believes that fragments from the Carancas meteorite may have stayed within the fast - moving fireball until impact .
How that happened , Schultz thinks , is due to the meteorite ’s high speed .
At that velocity , the fragments could not escape past the “ shock - wave ” barrier accompanying the meteorite and instead “ reconstituted themselves into another shape , ” he said .
That new shape may have made the meteorite more aerodynamic – imagine a football passing through air versus a cinderblock – meaning it encountered less friction as it sped toward Earth , hitting the surface as one large chunk .
“ It became very streamlined and so it penetrated the Earth ’s atmosphere more efficiently , ” Schultz said .
Schultz ’s theory could upend the conventional wisdom that all small , stony meteorites disintegrate before striking Earth .
If correct , it could change the thinking about the size and type of extraterrestrial objects that have bombarded the Earth for eons and could strike our planet next .
“ You just wonder how many other lakes and ponds were created by a stony meteorite , but we just do n’t know about them because when these things hit the surface they just completely pulverize and then they weather , ” said Schultz , director of the Northeast Planetary Data Center and the NASA / Rhode Island University Space Grant Consortium .
Schultz ’s research could have implications for Mars , where craters have been discovered in recent missions .
“ They could have come from anything , ” he said .
“ It would be interesting to study these small craters and see what produced them .
Perhaps they also will defy our understanding . ”

It 's really too bad nanotechnology is so gosh darn morally unacceptable , it could do so much good for humanity !
Take this new wiperless windshield , for instance .
Designed by Leonardo Fioravanti of Pininfarina , the Hidra features an aerodynamic design , and a bit of a nanotech sandwich ( mmm , sandwich ) to keep the front glass clear of water and debris .
The first layer protects from sun and repels water , the second layer features " nano - dust " to push dirt to the edges of the windshield and is activated by the third layer which senses the dirt , while the whole kit is powered by the fourth layer which conducts electricity to keep it going .
The tech could be ready for mass production within 5 years , but there 's already a working prototype in the Hidra concept car .

Police in Italy gave photos of some of those arrested in Old Bridge
The report says Cosa Nostra has been sending people to the US to form alliances with families with which it had lost contact in the 1980s .
It says that while the mob maintains a foothold in the lucrative drugs trade , it is now moving into new areas .
Although Cosa Nostra has its roots in Italian organised crime , it has long been a separate organisation in the US .
But this month in an operation codenamed Old Bridge , a reference to these long - standing links between Sicily and New York , the FBI revealed details of the new relationships being formed across the Atlantic .
They rounded up more than 80 gangsters in New York including the acting bosses of the Gambino crime family - known to have direct links with Sicily .
Fewer witnesses
The Italian anti-mafia commission says Old Bridge was a remarkable success but it shows the Sicilian Cosa Nostra is " re-establishing its links with the American cousins " .
US authorities detained more than 80 suspects
The commission says it has evidence Cosa Nostra is sending its top members to New York while allowing those expelled by the mob during the clan wars of the 1980s to return home to Sicily .
Their report says that many US food distribution and construction firms are now controlled by the US Cosa Nostra , whose bosses are of Sicilian origin and have direct links .
And while Cosa Nostra still maintains its control over the lucrative drugs trade and its traditional activities of extortion and racketeering , it is now diversifying into new industries like online gambling .
Angela Napoli , a member of the anti-mafia commission , says the work to defeat Cosa Nostra falls on the Italian politicians - who must do more - and on the very brave witnesses who come forward to give evidence .
The commission says not enough is being done to help them .
Those under state protection say they feel abandoned .
And consequently the number now prepared to come forward is falling .
Following on from our lists of evil women and men in history , we are introducing our first list of great people .
The women I have selected have been great leaders , warriors , visionaries , or humanitarians .
It has been incredibly difficult to rank this list ( with the exception of position 1 ) so you should not consider it to be absolute .
10 . Emmeline Pankhurst 1858 – 1928
In 1889 Emmeline Pankhurst founded the Women ’s Franchise League , followed by the Women ’s Social and Political Union in 1905 .
She was joined by her daughters Christabel and Sylvia among others in the fight for Women ’s Suffrage .
Pankhurst ’s tactics for drawing attention to the movement led to her being imprisoned several times , and even experienced force - feeding after going on hunger strike several times .
She was also instrumental in placing women in men ’s jobs during World War 1 .
She received funding of several thousand pounds from the government to aid her in encouraging employers that women were in fact fit to undertake these jobs .
Her efforts finally came to fruition in March 1918 , when women over the age of 30 were given the right to vote .
Later that same year , women over the age of 21 were given the right to become Members of Parliament , despite the fact they were still unable to vote .
It was n’t until 1928 that women were finally given the same voting rights as men in the United Kingdom .
9. Boudica d. AD 60 or 61
Boudica was a queen of the Iceni people of Norfolk who lead an uprising of the tribes against the occupying forces of the Roman Empire .
Her husband , Prasutagus had left his Kingdom jointly to his daughters and the Roman Emperor when he died .
The Roman Empire allowed allied independence only for the lifetime of the current king , and inheritance though the male line only was permitted .
As he had left his kingdom to his daughters , his will was ignored and his kingdom annexed as if it had been conquered .
It is reported that Boudica was flogged and her daughters raped .
She was later chosen as the leader of her people and their neighbors in an uprising against the Romans .
Her army fell on the poorly defended city of Camulodunum ( Colchester ) , and destroyed it , besieging the last defenders in the temple for two days before it fell .
Archaeology shows the city was methodically demolished .
Quintus Petillius Cerialis attempted to relieve the city , but his forces were routed .
His infantry was wiped out : only the commander and some of his cavalry escaped .
Tacitus says the Britons had no interest in taking or selling prisoners , only in slaughter by gibbet , fire , or cross .
Dio ’s account gives more prurient detail : that the noblest women were impaled on spikes and had their breasts cut off and sewn to their mouths , “ to the accompaniment of sacrifices , banquets , and wanton behaviour ” in sacred places , particularly the groves of Andraste .
Ironically , the great anti-imperialist rebel is now identified with the head of the British Empire , and her statue stands guard over the city she razed to the ground .
8. Catherine of Siena
1347 – 1380
Saint Catherine of Siena ( born 23rd of 25 children ) was a scholastic philosopher and theologian .
She received no education and at age seven decided to become a lay member of the Dominican religious order ( against the wishes of her parents ) .
She lived at home as an anchoress in order to be able to perform acts of self denial that would not have been permitted in a nunnery .
Catherine dedicated her life to helping the ill and the poor , where she took care of them in hospitals or homes .
She wrote letters to men and women in authority , especially begging for peace between the republics and principalities of Italy and for the return of the papacy from Avignon to Rome .
She carried on a long correspondence with Pope Gregory XI , also asked him to reform the clergy and the administration of the Papal States .
Incredibly , the Pope , inspired by her wisdom , did return the Papal administration to Rome .
Catherine ’s letters are considered one of the great works of early Tuscan literature .
More than 300 letters have survived .
Pope Pius II canonized Catherine in 1461 and she is now one of three female Doctors of the Church .
She is also one of the patron saints of Europe .
You can read the letters of Saint Catherine of Siena online .
7. Eva Peron 1919 – 1952
Eva Peron ( Evita ) was First Lady of Argentina from 1946 until her death in 1952 .
During her time as wife of President Juan Peron , she became powerful within the Pro-Peronist trade unions .
Eventually , she founded the charitable Eva Perón Foundation , and the nation ’s first large - scale female political party , the Female Peronist Party .
Her charitable organization built homes for the poor and homeless , and also provided free health care to citizens .
Eventually , Evita became the center of her own vast personality cult and her image and name soon appeared everywhere , with train stations , a city ( “ Ciudad Evita ” ) , and even a star being named after her .
Despite her dominance and political power , Evita was always careful to never undermine the important symbolic role of her husband .
On August 22 , 1951 the unions held a mass rally of two million people called “ Cabildo Abierto ” at which they begged Eva Peron to run for vice president .
It has been claimed that “ Cabildo Abierto ” was the largest public display of support in history for a female political figure .
She eventually declined to run and died the following year of Cancer .
6. Rosa Parks 1913 – 2005
Rosa Parks was an African American civil rights activist whom the U.S. Congress later called “ Mother of the Modern - Day Civil Rights Movement ” .
On December 1 , 1955 , Parks became famous for refusing to obey bus driver James Blake ’s order that she give up her seat to make room for a white passenger .
This action of civil disobedience started the Montgomery Bus Boycott , which is one of the largest movements against racial segregation .
In addition , this launched Martin Luther King , Jr. , who was involved with the boycott , to prominence in the civil rights movement .
She has had a lasting legacy worldwide .
Rosa Parks resided in Detroit until she died at the age of ninety - two on October 24 , 2005 .
City officials in Montgomery and Detroit announced on October 27 , 2005 that the front seats of their city buses would be reserved with black ribbons in honor of Parks until her funeral .
Her casket was transported to Washington , DC , and taken , aboard a bus similar to the one in which she made her protest , to lie in honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda ( making her the first woman and second African American ever to receive this honor ) .
5. Tomyris 6th century BC
Tomyris ( reigned c. 530 BC ) was a queen of the Massagetae , an Iranian people of Central Asia east of the Caspian Sea .
She was famous for defeating and killing the Persian emperor Cyrus the Great during his invasion and attempted conquest of her country .
When Cyrus captured Tomyris ’ son , she sent a letter to him denouncing his treachery and challenging him to honorable battle .
In the fight that ensued , the Persians were defeated with high casualties , Cyrus himself was killed , and Tomyris had his corpse beheaded .
She allegedly kept his head with her at all times and drank wine from it until her death .
Persian and Central Asian folklore maintain a rich store of other tales about Tomyris .
It is believed that the word Tomis present day Constanta comes from Tomyris .
4. Hatshepsut , King of Egypt Reign 1479 BC to 1458 BC
Hatshepsut is generally regarded by Egyptologists as one of the most successful female pharaohs , reigning longer than any other woman of an indigenous Egyptian dynasty .
Although records of her reign are documented in diverse ancient sources , Hatshepsut was once described by early modern scholars as only having served as a co-regent from about 1479 to 1458 BC , during years seven to twenty - one of the reign previously identified as that of Thutmose III .
It is now known that Hatshepsut assumed the position of pharaoh and her reign as king is usually given as twenty - two years since Manetho assigns her a reign of 21 years and 9 months .
As Hatshepsut reestablished the trade networks that had been disrupted during the Hyksos occupation of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period , thereby building a wealth of the Eighteenth Dynasty that has become so famous since the discovery of the burial of one of her descendants , Tutankhamun , began to be analysed .
Hatshepsut was one of the most prolific builders in ancient Egypt , commissioning hundreds of construction projects throughout both Upper and Lower Egypt , that were grander and more numerous than those of any of her Middle Kingdom predecessors .
Although many Egyptologists have claimed that her foreign policy was mainly peaceful , there is evidence that Hatshepsut led successful military campaigns in Nubia , the Levant , and Syria early in her career .
3. Joan of Arc 1412 – 1431
Saint Joan of Arc was a 15th century national heroine of France .
She was tried and executed for heresy when she was only 19 years old .
The judgment was declared invalid by the Pope and she was declared innocent and a martyr 24 years later .
She was beatified in 1909 and canonized as a saint in 1920 .
Joan asserted that she had visions from God which told her to recover her homeland from English domination late in the Hundred Years ’
War .
The uncrowned King Charles VII sent her to the siege at Orléans as part of a relief mission .
She gained prominence when she overcame the dismissive attitude of veteran commanders and lifted the siege in only nine days .
Several more swift victories led to Charles VII ’s coronation at Reims and settled the disputed succession to the throne .
She remained astute to the end of her life and rehabilitation trial testimony frequently marvels at her astuteness .
Her subtle replies under interrogation even forced the court to stop holding public sessions .
2. Florence Nightingale 1820 – 1910
Florence Nightingale who came to be known as “ The Lady with the Lamp ” , was a pioneer of modern nursing , a writer and a noted statistician .
Her lasting contribution has been her role in founding the modern nursing profession .
She set a shining example for nurses everywhere of compassion , commitment to patient care , and diligent and thoughtful hospital administration .
The work of the Nightingale School of Nursing continues today .
The Nightingale building in the School of Nursing and Midwifery at the University of Southampton is named after her .
International Nurses Day is celebrated on her birthday each year .
Florence Nightingale ’s most famous contribution came during the Crimean War , which became her central focus when reports began to filter back to Britain about the horrific conditions for the wounded .
Florence and her compatriots began by thoroughly cleaning the hospital and equipment and reorganizing patient care .
Nightingale believed the high death rates in the hospitals were due to poor nutrition and supplies and overworking of the soldiers .
Consequently , she reduced deaths in the Army during peacetime and turned attention to the sanitary design of hospitals .
1. Catherine II , Empress of Russia 1729 – 1796
Catherine II ( the Great ) reigned as Empress of Russia for 34 years , from June 28 , 1762 until her death .
She exemplifies the enlightened despot of her era .
During her reign Catherine extended the borders of the Russian Empire southward and westward to absorb New Russia , Crimea , Right - Bank Ukraine , Belarus , Lithuania , and Courland at the expense of two powers — the Ottoman Empire and the Polish - Lithuanian Commonwealth .
Catherine made Russia the dominant power in south - eastern Europe after her first Russo–Turkish War against the Ottoman Empire ( 1768 –1774 ) , which saw some of the greatest defeats in Turkish history , including the Battle of Chesma ( 5 July – 7 July 1770 ) and the Battle of Kagul ( 21 July 1770 ) .
Catherine ’s patronage furthered the evolution of the arts in Russia more than that of any Russian sovereign before or after her .
She subscribed to the ideals of the Enlightenment and considered herself a “ philosopher on the throne ” .
She showed great awareness of her image abroad , and ever desired that Europe should perceive her as a civilized and enlightened monarch , despite the fact that in Russia she often played the part of the tyrant .

Silver , Gold & the Last American Hero JFK By Darryl Robert Schoon
Mar 31 2008 2:35 PM www.drschoon.com hero , def .
a man distinguished by exceptional courage and nobility and strength Like everything in our past , the late American president , John Fitzgerald Kennedy , exists as a memory .
Struck down by an assassin in a decade where bullets - democracy ’s deadly equalizer - quieted those brave enough to champion change , e.g. JFK , Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy , President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was a true American hero ; and heroes , while a champion to many are , by definition , a threat to some .
In How To Survive The Crisis And Prosper In The Process , I detailed how America ’s problems after 1950 mirrored England ’s descent from power one century before .
America ’s problems did not go unnoticed by those who then led the US , Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and his successor , John F. Kennedy .
The reaction of each , however , is a chilling reminder of the dangers facing those who rule .
President Dwight D. Eisenhower was Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces that defeated the fascist powers in World War II ; and , as a war hero , he was believed to be an ideal candidate for the Republican Party in the 1952 presidential elections .
Eisenhower was elected but while serving as president , Eisenhower clearly saw the forces that would someday be responsible for America ’s loss of power ; for it was during Eisenhower ’s presidency that the erosion of America ’s economic wealth began .
Prior to Eisenhower ’s presidency in 1952 , the US was the wealthiest nation in the world .
As the largest industrial power , the US enjoyed a positive balance of trade with its partners .
Before Eisenhower assumed office , the US had gold reserves totaling almost 22,000 tons , the most gold any nation had ever possessed .
When Eisenhower left office , however , it is uncertain how much gold remained ; because after 1954 , the US never allowed a public audit of its gold reserves .
As the US then sold more goods abroad than it bought , US gold reserves should have increased .
Instead , they declined .
In one year alone , 1958 , US gold reserves were reduced by 10 % .
The powerful forces that controlled America were spending so much of America ’s wealth on overseas military and corporate expansion that gold was flowing out faster than trade could bring it in .
Indeed , the profligate spending responsible for America ’s loss of gold and consequent debt began during Eisenhower ’s presidency .
I place economy among the first and most important republican virtues , and public debt as the greatest of the dangers to be feared .
To preserve our independence , we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt .
President Thomas Jefferson 1743-1826
Only days before leaving office , in his Farewell Speech Eisenhower named those he believed responsible for the policies that would someday endanger America ’s liberties and render this once wealthy nation financially insolvent .
In the councils of government , we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military - industrial complex .
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist .
… We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage .
We want democracy to survive for all generations to come , not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow .
Less than fifty years after Eisenhower uttered those prophetic words , America ’s patrimony is gone and its future mortgaged beyond its ability to repay .
His words were heard but not heeded - not then or since .
It can not be said that America was n’t warned .
It can and will be said that America did n’t listen .
WHO RULES AMERICA
It is no coincidence that Eisenhower waited until three days before leaving office to warn America about the US military - industrial complex .
A military man himself , Eisenhower felt it necessary to warn the country of the unwarranted influence and intrusion of military and industrial [ sic business ] interests that were then colluding to hijack the future liberties and prosperity of America .
Eisenhower ’s warnings were not conclusions he had reached just before his presidency ended .
They were conclusions Eisenhower had reached during his eight years as president , years spent observing how the business of government was conducted and who profited by its activities .
Eisenhower knew that even as President of the US , he did not possess the requisite power to openly oppose the powerful interests that were even then spending the US into insolvency .
So President Eisenhower waited until the very end of his last term to warn America of the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military - industrial complex .
Eisenhower was right not to openly challenge the military - industrial complex .
The man who succeeded Eisenhower as president , John F. Kennedy , did .
But those who wield the real power behind the government ’s facade of democratic fair and equal rule were not to be trifled with then .
They are not to be trifled with now .
REAL RULERS REAL POLOTIK
The real rulers in Washington are invisible , and exercise power from behind the scenes .
US Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter US President Woodrow Wilson also spoke of the real rulers in Washington DC decades before Eisenhower and Kennedy were to encounter them .
In his preface to The New Freedom : A Call For The Emancipation Of The Generous Energies Of A People , Wilson wrote : Since I entered politics , I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately .
Some of the biggest men in the United States , in the field of commerce and manufacture , are afraid of somebody , are afraid of something .
They know that there is a power somewhere so organized , so subtle , so watchful , so interlocked , so complete , so pervasive , that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it .
These are not words of an imprudent man .
They are the words of a US President who cared enough about his country to warn of the dangers lurking behind its illusory façade of law , liberty , justice and equality for all .
Dangers of which Americans were unaware of then — and of which the vast majority are still unaware of now .
EXECUTIVE ORDER 1110 AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK
Change is no more welcome in Washington DC than it was in Galilee John F. Kennedy was not to live out his first term as President .
Three years into his presidency , JFK was felled by an assassin ’s bullet in Dallas , Texas .
While there is much controversy surrounding his death , it is clear that whatever the theory , it was no accident .
The assassination of a standing president is not undertaken lightly .
The public killing of a highly popular political figure such as JFK is decided upon and agreed to only when sufficient amounts of money or power are at stake .
Previous theories have revolved around issues of power .
Dissident and / or dissatisfied rogue CIA agents and / or right - wing Washington DC power brokers and / or the mafia conspiring separately or together in a mutual hatred for the upstart Kennedy have been the favored theories .
Another , simpler theory , however , should also be considered - money .
On June 4 , 1963 , Executive Order 1110 was signed by President Kennedy directing the US Treasury to issue a new US currency .
This new US currency was to be backed by a precious metal - silver , unlike the credit - backed money issued by the Federal Reserve since 1913 .
EXECUTIVE ORDER 1110 AMENDMENT OF EXECUTIVE ORDER NO , 10289 AS AMENDED , RELATING TO THE PERFORMANCE OF CERTAIN FUNCTIONS AFFECTING THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY .
By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code , it is ordered as follows : ( Y ) SECTIOIN 1 .
Executive Order No. 10289 of September 19 , 1951 , as amended is hereby further amended - ( a) By adding at the end of paragraph 1 therefore the following subparagraph ( j ) : n " ( j )

SECTION 2 . The amendment made by this Order shall not affect any act done , or any right accruing or accrued or any suite or proceeding had or commenced in any civil or criminal cause prior to the date of this Order but such liabilities shall continue and may be enforced as if said amendments had not been made .
John F. Kennedy , The White House .
June 4 , 1963
By the stroke of a pen , President Kennedy ’s signing of Executive Order 1110 returned the power to issue currency back to the US Treasury thereby ending the fifty year monopoly of private bankers and the Federal Reserve Bank over US currency .
Six months later , President John F. Kennedy was shot and killed .
In 1913 , as a result of intense lobbying by business and banking interests , the US government had turned over the power to issue US currency to a group of private bankers - the Federal Reserve Bank .
Many believe this transfer was unconstitutional .
US presidential candidate and Congressman Ron Paul ( ranking member of the House Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy ) has stated : The United States Constitution grants to Congress the authority to coin money and regulate the value of the currency .
The Constitution does not give Congress the authority to delegate control over monetary policy to a central bank .
Furthermore , the Constitution certainly does not empower the federal government to erode the American standard of living via an inflationary monetary policy .
The power to coin money and regulate the value of the currency is among the most important responsibilities and functions of government .
That the US government in 1913 turned over this public function to a group of private bankers is astounding .
As a consequence , almost one hundred later , the US and its citizens are now on the edge of bankruptcy , indebted up to their eyeballs to the very bankers they gave the power to coin their money and regulate their currency , private bankers who are even now being bailed out by America taxpayers with money made available to them by their fellow - bankers at the Federal Reserve .
HELLO AMERICA , ARE YOU THERE ?
CAN YOU HEAR ?
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING ?
THE PUBLIC PURSE THE GREATEST PRIZE OF PRIVATE BANKING
For almost one hundred years in America , private bankers through the Federal Reserve Bank have had a monopoly on the printing and issuance of US currency .
In that time they have inflated the US money supply to such a degree the US dollar has lost 95 % of its purchasing power and again brought the nation to the edge of economic ruin .
In 1963 , fifty years after the Fed acquired the right to print , issue and inflate the money supply of the US , President John F. Kennedy quietly transferred that power back to the US Treasury , the only institution which the constitution had granted the power to coin and regulate currency .
Rest assured that transference did not go unnoticed by the private bankers and the Fed.
US Presidential candidate Ron Paul has introduced legislation during each Congress to abolish the Fed ( H.R. 2755 - 110th Congress , H.R. 2778 - 108th Congress , H.R. 5356 - 107th Congress , H.R. 1148 - 106th Congress ) .
His inability to attract congressional support , however , is in all likelihood his Washington DC life insurance policy .
Morto uomini non causano problemi , [ sic it .
Dead men do n’t cause problems ] .
… we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known .
I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks .
The Federal Reserve Board , a Government board , has cheated the Government of the United States and the people of the United States out of enough money to pay the national debt .
These twelve private credit monopolies were deceitfully and disloyally foisted upon this country by the bankers who came here from Europe and repaid us for our hospitality by undermining our American institutions ...
The people have a valid claim against the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks .
Congressman Louis T. McFadden , Chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency from 1920 –31 FED ASKS FOR OVERSIGHT OF ALL FINANCIAL MARKETS oversight n 1 : synonym , overlooking , as in government oversight Plan would expand Fed 's power to intervene in financial crisis March 29 , 2008 WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Federal Reserve would have the power to regulate virtually the entire financial industry under a Treasury Department proposal to be announced Monday .
The proposal is part of a sweeping overhaul of the government 's regulatory structure that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson will propose in a speech Monday , said Treasury Department spokeswoman Michele Davis .
" I am not suggesting that more regulation is the answer , or even that more effective regulation can prevent the periods of financial market stress that seem to occur every five to 10 years , " Paulson will say , according to a text of the speech obtained by The Associated Press .
According to Brookly McLaughlin , another department spokeswoman , Paulson will propose these changes :
Give the Federal Reserve authority to look at the financial status of any institution that could affect market stability ;
Merge the Securities and Exchange Commission with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ;
Give stock exchanges more room for self - regulation ;
Consolidate bank supervision into one regulator .
One of the most dramatic changes would extend the powers of the Federal Reserve -- designed to regulate the commercial banking industry -- to oversight of virtually the entire financial industry .
THE FOX IS IN THE HENHOUSE
After the recent collapse of Bear Stearns , the Fed announced that US funds will now be made available to international investment banks .
Previous to this announcement , any loaning of US funds to investment banks was prohibited .
On March 28th , the first day the funds were available , the Fed loaned the banks $ 75 billion dollars .
These investment banks , called primary - dealers , are the inner circle of the Fed ’s funding mechanism .
That these primary - dealers are in need of US support is an indication of the rapidly disintegrating state of their balance sheets - and the lengths the Fed will go to protect their fellow bankers in the private sector with public money ..

The bailout of the richest investment banks in the world by US taxpayers is tantamount to a kidnap victim being forced to defray their kidnappers ’ expenses .
Someday , however , these bail - outs by the Fed will come to an end , but that end will not be pretty - for the end of central banking will be both unprecedented and brutal .
Central banks and investment banks are two sides of the same coin ; and , now that the coin has been debased and recast with subprime securities and other suspect forms of debt ; investment banks and their enablers , the central banks , are as vulnerable as those they once exploited .
Their increased vulnerability will soon be triggered by any number of events , e.g. bank insolvencies , collapsing currencies , slowing economies , money - market failures , counter - party derivative defaults etc. , each one powerful enough to bring down a faltering house of cards built on a foundation of rapidly shifting sand .
PUBLIC PROBLEMS PRIVATE SOLUTIONS
It is the loss of our freedoms that has led us to understand them
It might be argued that the Federal Reserve is itself a private solution to a public problem .
Indeed , such might be argued and in fact , it is true .
The Federal Reserve
Act is the most important act of privatization that happened in the US .
It is also the worst .
This does not mean all private acts should be subsumed to public policy .
Indeed , the opposite is true .
Today , individual action is needed more than ever .
Only by such action can the future be saved but it can be saved only after the present American economy collapses , a collapse set in motion by the military - industrial complex and private bankers , a collapse that can no longer be avoided .
WE HAVE GONE TOO FAR WE ARE TOO FAR GONE
The US military - industrial complex is still too powerful to confront and / or stop .
With the bankers , they are responsible for America ’s increasingly insolvable problems , their self - interests blinding them to what they have done to the nation .
Eisenhower could n’t stop them , neither could Kennedy nor can Ron Paul .
Only they can stop themselves and this they will soon do ; albeit inadvertently as the foundation of their power , the US economy , succumbs to the damage they have inflicted upon it .
THE ARK OF GOLD & SILVER
If we invest in gold and silver - the anathema of private bankers , we can survive the crisis they caused .
The economic carnage set in motion by government ’s pact with private bankers will affect everyone - workers , savers , entrepreneurs , investors , pensioners , the helpless , as well the innocent and the guilty .
Yes , bankers , too , will lose at least some of their wealth , if not all .
Everyone everywhere will be affected by the collapse of credit - based central banking .
The economic landscape is already shifting as global credit markets implode .
Bankers - the parasites of commerce and productivity - are now victims of their own excessive greed .
Their demise will affect us all .
The torrent of collapsing debt accumulated and compounded since the beginning of central banking is about to be unleashed on an unsuspecting world .
All beginnings have endings .
So , too , does debt - based central banking .
THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S WAR ON GOLD
The Fed ’s war on gold is not without reason - their reason , not ours .
Ever since those in control of the US overspent America ’s gold in the pursuit of military power and corporate expansion , the US paper dollar has been just that , a paper dollar exposed and vulnerable to the more obvious value of gold to which it was once convertible .
This is the reason the Fed and central banks have fought the rise of the price of gold since the US reneged on its gold obligations in the 1970s .
The rising price of gold belies the Achilles heel of central banking , built on a foundation of debt - based paper money worth no more than the debts issued to produce it , debts that are no longer capable of being repaid .
The Swiss central bank sold 22 tons of its gold last fall as the price of gold raced towards the $ 1,000 per ounce mark .
Without the intervention of the Swiss central bank , the price of gold would have passed $ 1,000 last year as easily as a Ferrari passes an elephant or an ass .
Buy as much gold as you can as long as central banks are selling it .
It is our gold , after all , that they are selling .
For when the flight from paper assets begins in earnest , there will be no gold for sale , at any price ; and silver will do very well , as well .
BELIEF , HOPE , & REALITY Elie Wiesel tells the story about the Jews who entered the boxcars going to the Nazi death camps told by their rabbis that God would never allow his chosen people to be destroyed .
Today , our governments and leaders are reassuring us that our pensions and investments are safe , that they have the tools and resources needed to protect us from the economic chaos threatening our financial futures , that there is no reason to panic .
My advice : Buy gold and silver .
Do n’t get in the boxcar .

SAM AMAYA was six years old when he first pulled a gun on another person — his father , who was beating his mother .
At eight he would produce the gun when he wanted his sister to change the channel from a soap opera to a cartoon .
At 13 , after a fight with his father , he fled from his house to his school 's playground , where some members of the Two - Six gang were meeting .
He was initiated later that afternoon .
He began running drugs as a teenager , picking up consignments of marijuana and cocaine near the border with Mexico and selling them around Texas .
With such a background , it is perhaps not surprising that Mr Amaya was arrested after pistol - whipping a girlfriend and is today , at 28 , about to finish a long sentence for aggravated assault .
Statistics would suggest that he will be back before too long : according to the Pew Centre on the States , more than half of released offenders return to prison within three years , and Texas has the country 's second - highest rate of incarceration .
In fact , Mr Amaya 's future should be more cheerful than those numbers suggest .
Just before he is released on June 23rd , if all goes to plan , Mr Amaya will graduate from the Prison Entrepreneurship Programme ( PEP ) , a remarkable effort to prepare some of Texas 's harder cases for their transition back to freedom .
The programme was founded in 2004 by Catherine Rohr , a venture capitalist who changed careers after visiting several Texas prisons .
Her premise is that many criminals are intelligent people with good heads for business and healthy appetites for risk , and that these traits can be put to productive use .
She is particularly interested in people who have already demonstrated these skills — for example by running a successful drug business or achieving a high rank in a gang .
During the past four years PEP has put more than 300 inmates through four months of business classes and study .
They meet MBA students to develop business plans , and hundreds of businessmen have taken part in special events at the prison .
About 40 graduates already have businesses up and running .
The vast majority are employed .
Fewer than 5 % have reoffended .
The programme is privately funded , and that success rate has helped it grow .
In 2004 Ms Rohr used her savings to get things going ; this year the operating budget is $ 3.2 m .
PEP 's success is partly due to the fact that the programme takes only the most serious applicants .
Prospective participants first fill out a lengthy questionnaire .
Those that pass have an interview , where Ms Rohr claims she rumbles the fakers .
Once selected , a participant can be booted out at any time for a variety of infractions , such as cheating or maintaining gang membership .
The current class started with 87 members and is down to 39 .
Participants say that PEP provides male role models , and helps them have hope for the future .
Ms Rohr considers it her job to build character .
“ They 're not in here because they were bad businessmen , ” she says .
“ They 're in here because they were lacking moral values in their lives . ”
She assigns them ethical case studies and leads discussions on everything from honesty to sexual relationships .
Texas is making its own efforts to improve results for released offenders , but released prisoners typically get just $ 100 and a bus ticket to Houston or Dallas .
PEP picks up its graduates at the gate with packages of sheets , toiletries and business suits .
It helps them find work and housing , and even offers a free trip to the dentist .
According to Gregory Mack , a participant , all this makes a big difference .
Mr Mack has been in and out of prison on drug charges for the past two decades .
He completed a behaviour - modification programme in 2002 as a condition for parole , but its value was limited .
“ They really had nothing to offer outside the walls , ” he explains .
By 2005 he was behind bars again .
Mr Amaya now has a chance to avoid that fate .
Two British researchers challenged the conventional history of mathematics in June when they reported having evidence that the infinite series , one of the core concepts of calculus , was first developed by Indian mathematicians in the 14th century .
They also believe they can show how the advancement may have been passed along to Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz , who are credited with independently developing the concept some 250 years later .
“ The notation is quite different , but it ’s very easy to recognize the series as we understand it today , ” says historian of mathematics George Gheverghese Joseph of the University of Manchester , who conducted the research with Dennis Almeida of the University of Exeter .
“ It was expressed verbally in the form of instructions for how to construct a mathematical equation . ”
Historians have long known about the work of the Keralese mathematician Madhava and his followers , but Joseph says that no one has yet firmly established how the work of Indian scholars concerning the infinite series might have directly influenced mathematicians like Newton and Leibniz .
Joseph and Almeida , who spent three years digging through ancient Indian texts and Vatican archives , believe Jesuit priests brought scientific knowledge from southern India to Western Europe .
The priests were missionaries in India in the mid-16th century .
They learned local languages and scientific practices and sent meticulous reports back to Europe .

Distinctive Dinosaur Death Throes
9/11 ’s second round of slaughter

Online Journal

A review of Dust to Dust : the health effects of 9/11
A film by Heidi Dehncke - Fisher
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9137295628446919478&hl=en
What makes this documentary , Dust to Dust : the health effects of 9/11 , so special is not just the chilling statistics it displays onscreen about the poisonous brew of materials that fell on Ground Zero and the surrounding neighborhoods ; what makes this piece so affecting is the heart - rending testimony of the warm - bodied victims of 9/11 ’s fall - out , now living through a second round of slaughter , sadly their own .
These victims are struggling to stay alive and sane , combating cancers , pulmonary diseases , every conceivable kind of breathing disorder , and the psychic shock of being misled , flat - out lied to by the US and New York City governments as to the risk they were taking continuing to work , returning home or going to school in the area ; this whether on the piles , in the surrounding neighborhoods , office buildings or even small businesses , directly and months after the apocalypse occurred .
To make matters worse , the organizations designated to help these people , FEMA , the EPA , Workmen ’s Compensation , private insurance companies , municipal health providers , Social Security , Medicare , et. al , present these victims with a daily barrage of obstacles , largely red tape in paying ( or avoiding to pay ) for medical bills , including medications , surgeries , organ transplants , physical or psychological therapies , plus well - deserved financial benefits to help victims meet living expenses and literally keep a roof over their heads .
The federal , city and corporate blockage by the very people who should be facilitating assistance to these victims compound the inhumanity .
The guilty parties range from functionaries in the various federal and city agencies and insurance companies to those who stand at the very helm of this nation .
It ’s no wonder one female EPA worker says , staring in the face of this conspiracy of red tape and feet - shuffling , " We are the dust of 9/11 . "
What hit the victims ?
Dust to Dust boldly supers on the screen some of the 2,500 contaminants that erupted from the explosions of the World Trade Center towers , Tower Seven and the two , fuel - laden jetliners , turning into a toxic gray dust that hung in the air as well as settled in people ’s lungs and on area streets , vehicles , buildings , residences , both outside and inside the city for months . . .
Over 400 tons of asbestos , which once inhaled in any quantity cannot be expelled by the lungs
90,000 liters of jet fuel containing benzene , a carcinogen that suppresses the immune system and causes leukemia
Mercury from over 500,000 fluorescent lights that is toxic to the nervous system , and damaging especially to the kidneys
200,000 pounds of lead and cadmium from personal computers , toxic to the respiratory track , especially damaging to kidneys
Polycystic aromatic hydrocarbons that cause lung , laryngeal and throat cancers
130,000 gallons of transformer oil with PCBs , causing serious skin rashes and liver damage
Crystalline Silica from 420,000 tons of concrete , sheetrock and glass ( tiny particulates that lodge in heart , causing ischemic heart disease )
. . . and so on and on and on . . .
Meet life ’s cast
During the film we meet John Graham , an EMT , and carpenter , a strong , soft - spoken man battling with a handful of life - threatening conditions ; similarly there is silver - haired Richard Mulhern , a fiber optic technician ; Christ Baumann , an NYPD detective ; Bonnie Giebfried , EMT ; Timothy Duffy , a New York firefighter ; NYPD Detective Zagroda who survives his lost son ; Patrick Lynch of the New York Patrolmen ’s Benevolent Association , and others equally affecting .
Detective Zagroda describes an incident in which his son , a police officer as well , already suffering from a severe cough , stopped a lieutenant who was carrying five respirators .
He asked for one .
And the lieutenant told him , " Sorry , ca n’t do , these are for the brass . "
The young Zagroda died one morning on the floor of a bedroom in his home from black lung disease as his child slept on the bed above , and his father discovered him .
This is one of the most powerful moments of Dust to Dust , seeing this hulk of a man turn speechless with tears .
We also meet deer - in - the - headlights Michael Brown , former director of FEMA ; a truth - telling Hugh Kaufman , engineer / investigator and EPA critic .
And we meet the unbelievable Christine Todd Whitman , the EPA administrator who consistently told New York and the world there was " No reason for the general public to be concerned . "
Of course , we see George Bush , Dick Cheney , and Colin Powell , without facemasks , to make sure no one asks for one or uses even the meager paper masks that were available .
We meet Dr. Stephen Levin , head of the Mount Sinai Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine .
Levin tells how he and his colleagues could see early on that these people were being exposed to cancer - causing materials that would end in disaster .
This as Whitman kept reassuring everyone that we were " Not getting elevated levels causing concern . "
Nikki Tinsley , the former inspector general of the EPA , complained that there was no adequate access to get in to evaluate , including no electricity , equipment or analysts .
By 9/13 the inadequate ambient air samples led the EPA to claim the air was " Below levels of concern . "
Yet , many contaminants were simply not tested for .
As Robert Martin , former ombudsman of the EPA , says , " You ca n’t find what you do n’t look for .
This is true .
The agency could have done a much better job of looking . "
This as Christy Whitman was repeating , " From a real health problem , we do n’t have to worry . "
Of course , we ca n’t lay it all on her because initial and ongoing statements were not based on science , but rather on White House policy .
Ironically , the man who was appointed by George W. Bush as head of The White House Environmental Council , James Connaughton , formerly represented large corporations like ARCO in disputes about cleaning up toxic waste sites .
Adding insult to injury , he had formerly worked against the EPA .
So , as usual , the crime starts at the top .
And as Cate Jenkins , a science PhD for the EPA , and Nikki Tinsley , point out , the press releases that were written by the EPA were then rewritten by the White House .
One 9/11 press release that began EPA Initiating Response Activities : Testing Terrorized Sites for Environmental Hazards changed to EPA Initiating Response Activities : Reassures Public about Environmental Hazards .
That ’s quite a difference .
And on 9/14 , this following started out reading “ samples . . . showed levels of asbestos ranging from 2.1 % to 3.3 % . . . "
( The EPA concedes a 1 percent level as a definition for asbestos - contaminating material . )
Thus the top line was changed to " samples contained small percentages of asbestos . . . slightly above the 1 percent trigger for defining asbestos material . "
The difference between the numbers , from 1 percent to 2.1 percent to 3.3 percent is major enough to seriously hurt or kill you , given repeated exposure .
So any number cribbing is criminal .
Of course , Rudy Giuliani is seen with a somber faced , former Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik standing behind him .
Rudy tells us straight - faced that “ The air quality is safe and acceptable . . .
That ’s just the reality . ”
And we cut to a healthy looking black New Yorker who says , " If the mayor says it ’s okay , I believe him .
It ’s okay . "
And there it is in a nutshell .
Which led one doctor to say , " Economic and political motivations rather than a real concern for public health " were at play .
The underlying agenda
Perhaps the major agenda , as the filmmakers suggest , was to get Wall Street up and running in a matter of days , no matter what the cost to everyone else .
In fact , in one interview of a young woman Wall Streeter questioned as she walks briskly amidst the rubble to work , she insists she ’s okay ; she ’s happy to be back to work ; it ’s no problem .
It ’s that same innocence , that same willingness to jump into this polluted torrent of life .
An older woman who is questioned does not display that enthusiasm .
She is worried about even being there .
But these are just the little people caught in the jaws of some larger beast .
And thus , in addition to the 343 firefighters and paramedics , and the 78 police offers who died that day among the nearly 3,000 who perished , add to that the quietly disappearing numbers among the thousands of " survivors . "
I also reported on them in Online Journal in Ground Zero illnesses come back to haunt Giuliani , and No money to treat 9/11 workers , $ 3 billion a week to fight Iraq ?.
The ultimate irony is that the rush to work these men and women on the piles relentlessly aggravated in large part their nascent illnesses .
The compulsive push of Giuliani to wipe out this horrific crime scene in eight months when we had 30 months to do the job is again criminal .
In sharp contrast , first responders in Washington , D.C. , had to wear respirators to go to work at the Pentagon disaster site , absolutely , no questions asked .
Thus , at the end of Dust to Dust , we are left with this second tragedy .
On a personal note , I recognized in the film an old friend of my wife and myself , Lynda Caspe , an artist , who had a loft near Ground Zero at the time .
In the documentary she tells us , she felt her loft might be contaminated with asbestos .
When , in fact , she called the EPA , the examiner found a deadly 2.6 percent level of asbestos .
His next question to her was , " You sure did n’t plant this here ? "
Shocked , she answered , " What ?
Where would I even find this ? "
This personal connection to people lost and hurt , I might add , is a component of the undying pain and anger we in this city feel .
September 11 happened in our backyard , among the buildings , the kids at Stuyvesant High School , the men and women working their hearts out .
So it ’s up close and personal to us , no matter how much we get on with life .
This is why I suggest you savor this documentary , every word of these gentle victims ; every word of the innocent and the guilty .
They are all there for your scrutiny , and many still in power .
And , whether you believe 9/11 was an Inside Job or not , Dust to Dust will open your eyes to the punishable criminality of this second round of slaughter .
It will make your ire rise and demand justice one more time , this time for the lingering hurt .

The suggestion by Julian Le Grand , ministerial adviser , that smokers should be obliged to apply for a licence permitting them to buy tobacco seems to have been about as welcome as the sight of a cigarette butt in an ice - cream sundae .
Smokers and tobacco lobby groups were predictably apoplectic about the proposal – though with a faint whiff of martyred vindication to some of their reactions .
See , they hinted , we told you they were Nazis and you did n't believe us .
Now look what they 're planning .
But even anti-smokers did n't exactly rush to applaud the notion .
A spokesman for Action on Smoking and Health suggested that Prof Le Grand 's proposal to erect another hurdle between smokers and self - harm was unnecessary – given that most smokers already wanted to stop – and , tellingly , the spokesman for Forest and Ash both used the same word – " bully " – in describing the idea .
I have a feeling that Lord Darzi 's consideration of this particular policy suggestion wo n't take up a big chunk of his diary time .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
One of the things that 's wrong with Le Grand 's idea – apart from all those quibbles about practicality , implementation and tyrannical paternalism – is that it 's aimed at the wrong substance .
Even people who do n't like cigarette smoke were pretty stoical about putting up with it before the smoking ban came into force , and now that the ban is here it's hard to feel that other people 's smoking really constitutes a major social problem .
I think anti-smokers perhaps even feel a tiny sliver of guilt at the sight of those die - hards puffing away beneath the pavement heaters ... and they 're certainly in a mood to be magnanimous in victory .
The truth is you need a substantial level of public disquiet to justify such an intrusion of the state into the indulgences of the ordinary citizen – and tobacco just does n't cut it anymore .
Nobody fears walking down the street because a bit of passive smoke may be carried towards them on the breeze .
Alcohol would be a far better target for anyone who wants to introduce a nanny state pass law .
It has so much going for it , after all ... from recent tabloid panics over the binge - drinking of teenagers and the stealth alcoholism of Britain 's middle classes to social costs – human and economic – which dwarf those of tobacco .
When a group from the Academy of Medical Sciences recently studied the dangers of a whole range of drugs , illegal and legal , alcohol was found to kill more people than all of the others combined , and a 2003 Cabinet Office paper on the costs of alcohol misuse estimated the overall burden to the economy at somewhere between £ 18bn and £ 20 bn .
Even if you scratch the mysteriously precise figure of £ 4,678.6 m for " emotional impact costs for victims of crime " , the bill is still pretty staggering .
The case for a licence would surely be a bit easier to make as well .
There are some liberties – like that of driving a car – which are not an automatic right in a well - regulated society because their irresponsible exercise would involve unacceptable costs for others .
And just as selfish and reckless driving eventually results in a suspension of your licence to drive , there might be an argument for saying that selfish and dangerous drinking should result in suspension of a licence to purchase alcohol .
The system would n't be perfect – no legal prohibition is .
But if it did nothing else it might at least persuade Britain 's binge drinkers to pretend that they are sober when they are out in public .
When cars gave way to pedestrians
There 's a fascinating bit of movie footage in Tate Britain 's new exhibition about the Camden Town Group which shows Trafalgar Square in 1909 .
Part of its charm lies in the fact that it shows horse - drawn vehicles sharing the road with early motor cars .
But the really captivating thing is that people are in the mix too – walking all over the place as if they have just as much right to the King 's Highway .
The pedestrians know that nothing will be coming at them at a speed too high to avoid – and in a lot of cases the cars appear to stop for the walkers , rather than the other way round .
When did that assumption about priority become extinct , and how can we revive it ?
* One of the Sunday newspapers reports that a teacher has invented an untippable chair , the inspiration for his device being classroom injury and disruption from inveterate tipping .
All very well , this , and there are times when I might have been a customer myself , given my own children 's apparent inability to stay on all fours , as basic table manners require .
But before we get tough on chair - tipping , should n't we do a bit more research into the causes of chair - tipping ?
It is so powerful and universal an urge ( a lot of us remain closet tippers ) that I can't help feeling that there must be more to it than mere fidgeting .
Why is it so psychologically rewarding to teeter on the edge of falling ... and could it be that it serves to aid learning and concentration rather than hinder them ?
Given that chair - tipping is the only exercise some children get now , it might be unwise to rule it out without establishing some facts first .

In 1984 , Continental Illinois , then one of the country ’s largest banks , found itself on the verge of collapse , after billions of dollars ’ worth of its loans went bad .
To avert a crisis , the government stepped in , purchasing $ 3.5 billion of the soured loans and effectively taking over the bank .
Later that year , at a congressional subcommittee hearing , Representative Stewart McKinney summed up the lesson of the rescue effort : “ Let us not bandy words .
We have a new kind of bank .
It is called too big to fail .
T.B.T.F. , and it is a wonderful bank . ”
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
Since then , T.B.T.F. has become a generally accepted , if unwritten , rule in the financial world .
Two weeks ago , though , it was given a new twist when the Federal Reserve acted to save the investment bank Bear Stearns , orchestrating the company ’s sale to J. P. Morgan Chase by providing Morgan with up to thirty billion dollars in financing to cover Bear Stearns ’s portfolio of risky assets .
Previously , the government had intervened to protect only commercial banks — which take deposits and issue traditional loans , and which are heavily regulated .
( Another first : the Fed is now allowing investment banks to borrow from it directly . )
The Bear Stearns deal means that the T.B.T.F. rule now applies to investment banks as well .
Suddenly , the federal government is committed to saving a whole lot more companies than it was a couple of weeks ago .
Rescuing failing companies obviously runs the risk of creating moral hazard — if we insulate people from the consequences of their irresponsibility , they ’re more likely to be irresponsible in the future .
But the Fed did a good job of lessening that risk , making sure that Bear suffered a heavy toll .
The sale punished Bear shareholders severely , valuing Bear at just two dollars a share , down from sixty dollars a few days before , while thousands of Bear employees are likely to lose their jobs .
That ’s about as harsh as a bailout gets .
More to the point , the threat of moral hazard in this case was simply less dire than the threat of financial contagion .
The Fed could have done what it did in February , 1933 , when it stood quietly by while Detroit Bankers Corp. and the Guardian Detroit Union Group , Detroit ’s two largest banks , foundered after a series of bad loans .
But the failure of those two banks quickly led to bank runs in neighboring states —
Cleveland ’s two biggest banks failed soon after — and eventually to a national banking panic .
Bear Stearns ’s collapse , similarly , could easily have provoked market chaos .
Bear was n’t among the largest Wall Street banks , but it was a major clearinghouse for stock trades and played a central role in hundreds of billions of dollars of credit deals .
If not too big , it was too important to fail .
The Bear deal does mark a major policy shift , since the Fed has now implicitly admitted that it will catch investment banks when they fall .
But that shift really just ratifies the inevitable , given the nature of credit in today ’s world .
Most money that ’s borrowed these days no longer comes from commercial banks , which are responsible for less than thirty per cent of all lending .
Instead , in one form or another , the loans are packaged and sold as securities .
And since investment banks do much of the selling and buying of those securities , they play an ever bigger role in financial markets .
Two decades ago , the Fed could afford to let a firm like Drexel Burnham Lambert ( which , admittedly , was dealing with criminal charges in addition to its economic woes ) go under without worrying too much about the ripple effects .
It would demand very steady nerves to do the same thing today .
You might , then , see the Fed ’s willingness to help investment banks as evidence of their indispensability .
But what it really underscores is how badly Wall Street has managed its business in recent years .
Because investment banks ’ trades and investments are typically very highly leveraged — Bear Stearns , for instance , had borrowed thirty dollars for every dollar of its own — the banks need to be exceptionally good at managing risk , and they need to insure that people trust them enough to lend them huge sums of money against very little collateral .
You ’d expect , then , that Wall Street firms would be especially rigorous about balancing risk against reward , and about earning and keeping the trust of customers , clients , and lenders .
Instead , most of these firms have taken on spectacular amounts of risk without acknowledging the scale of their bets to the outside world , or even , it now seems , to themselves .
That ’s why , since the bursting of the housing bubble , we have seen tens of billions of dollars in surprise write - downs and complete paralysis in the credit markets .
When you consider that the banks at the center of the subprime debacle were also at the center of the tech - stock bubble , the surprising thing about the Bear Stearns crisis is n’t that a major investment bank was abandoned by its customers and lenders but , rather , that it did n’t happen sooner .
Now that the Fed has stepped in , it ’s possible that things will go back to normal .
But let ’s hope they do n’t get too normal : one of the biggest problems in the market in the past decade has been that lenders , clients , and even ordinary small investors have put far too much faith in the magical abilities of Wall Street firms , and have failed to give their promises and performance proper scrutiny .
Markets require trust to work well , but when trust is blind they are almost guaranteed to go haywire .
We do n’t want the paralytic level of skepticism that has reigned in the marketplace in recent months to continue , but we do n’t want a return to the way things were , either .
It ’s a good thing that Bear Stearns was saved .
But it ’s also a good thing that it nearly died . ♦
Pretty good story on the coming fight over financial regulation .
But it lets the Bushies off way too lightly , by suggesting that lack of coordination between agencies led to the awesome failure of regulators to take action against the bubble :
Except for the Federal Reserve , all of the federal bank agencies receive funding from fees paid by member institutions , and some specialists have long argued that the agencies competed with each other to woo institutions with lighter regulation .
“ There was no federal coordinated oversight , and as a result there was a competition to reach the bottom , both in federal and state organizations , ” said Brian C. McCormally , a former enforcement chief at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency .
Actually , there was plenty of coordination — a coordinated effort to destroy effective regulation :
Consider the press conference held on June 3 , 2003 — just about the time subprime lending was starting to go wild — to announce a new initiative aimed at reducing the regulatory burden on banks .
Representatives of four of the five government agencies responsible for financial supervision used tree shears to attack a stack of paper representing bank regulations .
The fifth representative , James Gilleran of the Office of Thrift Supervision , wielded a chainsaw .
The lack of oversight , in short , was no oversight : it was part of the plan .
Add : Robert Waldmann has a picture of the scene , chainsaw and all :

Here 's the impact on the economy , profits and stocks , and on the dollar .
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) -
Here we go again .
Just as they did a month ago , crude oil prices are at record highs near $ 50 a barrel -- a level that makes investors around the world shudder .
QUICK VOTE
Which of these events would do the most toward bringing down the price of oil ?

View results
And just as they did a month ago , energy experts and veteran market watchers disagree about how long the spike in energy prices might last .
Many analysts noted that hedge funds and other speculators , desperate for a hot market in which to play , have been inflating oil prices , which are already artificially high because of fear of terror attacks and supply disruptions in the Middle East , Russia and other parts of the world .
Other analysts , however , believe high prices could be sustainable , because of tighter supply and higher demand around the world , driven in part by emerging economies such as China and India .
Which ever side you buy into , there 's little doubt that higher prices are having an impact .
Here 's a look at some of the effects : Consumer spending
Before clucking too much about the dangers of high oil prices , it 's worth noting that , in inflation - adjusted dollars , crude oil is still not nearly as dear as it was in 1979 .
What 's more , the U.S. economy is far less energy - dependent than it was then .
Still , higher energy prices do act as a kind of tax on consumers , draining discretionary income that could be spent on more fun stuff .
This is critical for the broader economy , more than two - thirds of which is made up of consumer spending .
When oil spiked towards $ 50 in mid-August , gasoline prices stayed low , meaning the broader economic pain was limited .
During the current spike , however , gasoline prices are again threatening to cross $ 2 a gallon , and a new spending obstacle is cropping up : home heating oil prices , which have jumped in recent weeks to their highest level since early 2000 .
Though the current price of oil is probably not recessionary , sustained prices above $ 60 -- a possibility , according to Morgan Stanley economists -- could be .
Corporate profits and stocks
Higher oil prices have n't been a huge drag on corporate profits ( yet ) , but they 're making a difference at the margins .
Of more than 200 chief financial officers surveyed in early September by Financial Executives International and Baruch College 's Zicklin School of Business , just 19 percent said oil prices had hurt earnings .
But about 30 percent said they would feel a " significant " pinch if oil were to hit $ 50 a barrel .
And sixty - five percent of those companies feeling the sting of oil had simply eaten the higher costs , instead of passing them on to consumers , hurting profits .
Though manufacturing firms are usually the hardest hit by high oil prices , some less - obvious victims have warned of lower earnings recently , including consumer - staple firms Colgate - Palmolive ( CL : Research , Estimates ) and Unilever ( UL : Research , Estimates ) .
Those companies had other problems cutting into profits , but high energy costs did n't help .
On the other side of the ledger , big oil companies such as Exxon Mobil ( XOM : Research , Estimates ) , ChevronTexaco ( CVX : Research , Estimates ) , BP ( BP : Research , Estimates ) and ConocoPhillips ( COP : Research , Estimates ) usually thrive on pricey crude .
Unfortunately , since many other firms will feel at least a little profit pain from oil , stock prices have been dragged down nearly every time crude oil has risen , and the same has been true in recent days .
" It 's not going to make or break a bull or a bear market , but it 's a negative , " said James Awad , chairman of Awad Asset Management .
Inflation , bonds and the Fed While oil has been rising , bond prices have , too , pushing yields -- which move opposite to price -- lower .
For weeks , analysts have been trying to sort out what this means .
Many note that hedge funds and speculators are likely causing some of the mischief in bonds , riding a hot market and setting it up for a fall .
But others wonder if bonds are n't saying something about the future course of inflation and economic growth .
If companies are n't able to pass higher energy prices on to consumers , then their spending and hiring plans might suffer , inflation will stay tame , and economic growth will be weaker .
That would keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates as quickly as expected , meaning long - term interest rates are low for good reason .
" The big wild card becomes what the Fed does about it , " said Drew Matus , senior economist at Lehman Brothers .
" That 's why the bond market is rallying -- rather than concentrate on the inflationary aspects of higher oil prices , the market thinks the Fed will focus on the growth aspects . "
Currencies
For now , the only currencies feeling much pain from higher oil prices are those of industry - intensive countries that tend to use a lot of oil , Japan being the biggest and best example .

What is this ?
The U.S. dollar has fallen against the euro as oil has surged , possibly because of fear that higher oil prices would eventually fuel inflation and hurt the U.S. economy .
But the dollar actually surged against the Japanese yen , hitting a new five - week high last week , as did the Nikkei index -- not coincidentally .
" Japan is really the industrialized country most heavily dependent on oil imports , " said Ashraf Laidi , chief currency analyst at MG Financial in New York , " so the most direct impact of higher oil prices is on the Japanese yen . "
Of course , the rapidly - growing Chinese economy guzzles its share of oil , too , and its currency would likely be affected , if not for the fact that China keeps its currency artificially weak anyway .
At the G7 meeting on Friday , U.S. officials will likely pressure China to loosen its grip on the yuan , but higher oil prices could complicate the issue .
Bush intervention led EPA to scale back ozone limits

The Environmental Protection Agency weakened one part of its new limits on smog - forming ozone after an unusual , last - minute intervention by President Bush , according to documents released by the EPA .
EPA officials initially tried to set a lower seasonal limit on ozone to protect wildlife , parks and farmland , as required under federal law .
While their proposal was less restrictive than what the EPA 's scientific advisers had proposed , Bush overruled EPA officials Tuesday and ordered the agency to raise the limit , according to the documents .
" It is unprecedented and an unlawful act of political interference for the president personally to override a decision that the Clean Air Act leaves exclusively to EPA 's expert scientific judgment , " said John Walke , clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council .
The president 's order prompted a scramble by Bush administration officials to rewrite the regulations to avoid conflicting with past EPA statements on the harm caused by ozone .
Solicitor General Paul Clement warned administration officials Tuesday night that the rules contradicted the EPA 's past submissions to the Supreme Court , according to sources familiar with the conversation .
As a consequence , administration lawyers hustled to craft new legal justifications for the weakened standard .
The dispute involved one of two distinct parts of the EPA 's ozone restrictions , the " public welfare " standard , which is designed to protect against long - term harm from high ozone levels .
The other part is known as the " public health " standard , which sets a legal limit on how high ozone levels can be at any one time .
The two standards were set at the same level Wednesday , but until Bush asked for a change , the EPA had planned to set the " public welfare " standard at a lower level .
The documents , released by the EPA late Wednesday , provided insight into how White House officials helped shape the new air quality rules that , by law , are supposed to be decided by the EPA administrator .
The White House Office of Management and Budget questioned in a March 6 memo to the EPA why the second standard was needed .
EPA officials answered in a letter that high ozone concentrations can cause " adverse effects on agricultural crops , trees in managed and unmanaged forests , and vegetation species growing in natural settings . "
The preamble to the new regulations alluded to this tug - of - war , stating there was a " robust discussion within the Administration of these same strengths and weaknesses " in setting the secondary standard .
The preamble went on to say that the decision to make the two ozone limits identical " reflects the view of the Administration as to the most appropriate secondary standard . "
The bid to rewrite the language - on the day the agency faced a statutory deadline - forced EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson , at the last moment , to postpone a scheduled news conference to announce the new rules .
It finally took place at 6 p.m. , five hours later than planned .
Under the Clear Air Act , the federal government must re-examine every five years whether its ozone standards are adequate , and the rules that the EPA issued Wednesday will help determine the nation 's air quality for at least a decade .
Ozone , formed when pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and other chemical compounds released by industry and motor vehicles are exposed to sunlight , is linked to an array of heart and respiratory illnesses .
Almost seven months ago , I posted about my plans to move Demokritos over to Django .
Although Django has some support for the Atom Publishing Format ( RFC 4287 ) , it 's pretty minimal .
You can't produce full - content feeds without some hacking and the more advanced features of Atom are not supported .
And Django certainly does n't have support for the Atom Publishing Protocol , which just got approved as an IETF Proposed Standard .
Back at PyCon , I offered to both complete the implementation of the Atom Publishing Format in Django and also implement the Atom Publishing Protocol .
I filed ticket # 3569 and ticket # 3570 to cover these respectively .
Well five months after PyCon , I 've finally got off my butt and started working on it .
This afternoon , I started django - atompub at Google Code .
My approach for completing support for RFC 4287 is to first of all build a test model that covers the data model of RFC 4287 feeds and entries .
That 's pretty much done now and checked in .
Now I just need to work on the AtomFeed object that comes with Django and extend it to cover all aspects of that data model .
That should n't take too much longer .
Then work can begin on the substantial part of the project : support for APP .
With Demokritos
I 've implemented earlier versions of APP before , but the challenge with Django will be trying to maintain loose coupling between the feed and the user 's model .
Django's existing syndication support takes the nice approach of allowing arbitrary objects to be exposed as feeds and entries .
Making that work the other way around ( i.e. creating arbitrary objects via APP ) will be challenging but , hopefully , very useful .
UPDATE ( 2007-07-30 ) : The Atom Publishing Format support is almost done .
You can check it out at http://code.google.com/p/django-atompub/ and let me know if you have any feedback .
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication .
— Leonardo da Vinci
I need every word I write .
The titles of my articles are descriptive but unflashy .
I strive for short sentences .
I formulate simple concepts , act on their hint , and document my experiences in the hopes of inspiring others .
I use technology as an instrument of reach , rather than as an intellectual stairmaster .
I ’m a preacher of straightforward ideas because straightforward ideas kick ass .
My mission in life is to pursue personal growth and to help others grow .
My business plan is : 1 . Create high - quality content .
2 . Tell people about it .
3 . Profit .
My path to personal growth is shaped in large part by one tightly - guarded secret : Keeping Things Simple .
This is n’t a secret because no one knows about it ; it ’s a secret because you can scream “ Keep it simple ! ” as loud as you want and no one will hear you .
Simple Is Hard
Simple is n’t easy .
Easy means achieved without great effort .
Simple means easily understood .
I can bang out a complicated article in half the time it takes me to produce a simple one .
I never had to learn how to build convoluted software either — it was a natural talent , you might say — but I did have to make a conscious effort to build stuff that did n’t hurt .
But why is simple so hard ?
How do you start out wanting to build a text editor and end up building an entire operating system instead ?
Why do guys spend thousands of dollars on ebooks and workshops that promise to teach them the secrets of meeting women instead of taking the direct , cost - free , and equally rejection - prone route of just walking up and saying hi ?
In my experience , there are two primary reasons why we overcomplicate things .
The first is a loss of focus .
When you lose touch with why you ’re doing what you ’re doing , you inadvertently sentence yourself to trivial pursuits .
As a software developer , I see this all the time with frameworks , particularly frameworks that were created out of thin air instead of extracted from working applications .
Using them is like going to church : you pray to a higher power to help you make it through the day , you beg forgiveness for your sins , and they keep pestering you for donations .
The tagline for software built from these foundations usually ends with “ … but the code is really good . ”
Whether you ’re creating a product , working on expanding your social life , or trying to find a better job , avoiding the thorns of distraction involves regularly asking yourself these questions :
What ’s my goal ?
How will I know when I ’ve achieved it ?
How am I measuring my progress ?
How well is my current approach working ?
It also helps to write down your goals when you set them .
Not only does recording your dreams help you flesh out your desired outcome , it also helps remind you of your original intent .
Complexity and the Ego
The other major reason we flock to complexity is a problem of a very different nature , that requires a completely different solution .
It ’s rooted in our psychology .
It comes from the imperial nature of the human ego .
The ego ’s primary lubricant can be summed up in one word : More.
10 features are better than 1 . 1000 lines of code is better than 100 .
$ 500,000 / year is better than $ 100,000 / year .
Big is better than small .
To the ego , Less is kryptonite .
Making things more difficult than they need to be can also be induced by fear .
Our ego relies on fear to protect itself and complexity is a great place to hide .
Saying hi to a girl is an incredibly simple and direct way to improve your success with women , but the range of potential negative responses could pose a serious threat to who you think you are .
A much easier path for the ego to follow is to read about approaching women instead of actually doing it .
Not only does this remove the possibility of embarrassing social fumbles , it also quenches the ego ’s thirst for more .
If you ’ve read five seduction ebooks , you ’re obviously better off than if you ’d only read one .
Of course , all that information is just a diversion .
You end up realizing that no matter how much you read about meeting women instead of actually meeting women , the terror of rejection still remains .
And no matter what you do , your first several dozen , maybe even several hundred approaches will be as painful as they are instructive .
Dealing with the ego is a complex subject , which I ’ve already written much about .
To learn more , try these articles :
Reading in itself is obviously not a bad thing .
Losing yourself in unnecessary details to avoid doing what you already know needs to be done is a bad thing .
Prioritize Simple Solutions
Of the four major social media websites ( Digg , StumbleUpon , reddit , and del.icio.us ) , I ’ve done pretty well on three of them .
The final frontier for me was Digg .
If you read about how to get attention from these websites , you ’ll see people saying you have to create an account , vote up and comment on articles that other users submit , add everyone who votes up your content to your friends list , and so on .
But my goal with 30 sleeps is to write content that changes people ’s lives , not to be a social media power user .
To increase my presence on Digg , I asked myself “ What ’s the simplest way to get on the Digg front page ? ” I came up with the following algorithm :
Write great content .
Visit the front page of the relevant section on Digg .
Lifestyle / Education , in my case .
Find out who ’s submitting content that makes the front page of that section .
Contact them directly , with links to my best articles .
I found a few such power users who provided their email address in their profile , and specifically said that they ’re hungry for interesting links .
I contacted each one directly .
I made it clear that I do n’t spend a lot of time on Digg , but that I do spend a lot of time writing content dealing with personal growth , and provided them with links to some of my best work .
I did this only a few days ago .
The results were amazing .
My article on information addiction got submitted and was dugg 135 times .
That was n’t quite enough to push it to the front page , but the article got far more attention than anything I ’d tried before .
( By the way , if you have a Digg account and liked that article , your votes would be greatly appreciated . )
Remember step # 2 of the business plan I described earlier ?
It really is that basic .
The more complex your strategy for achieving your goals , the more you ’ll slow yourself down .
The simplest thing that can possibly work often does .

Whenever I debate the original American foreign policy of non-interventionism with an advocate of America ’s 20th Century foreign policy of interventionism I am confronted with the statement that World War II occurred because America returned to its policy of " isolationism " after World War I .
They argue that our failure to adopt the Versailles Treaty and to join the League of Nations allowed Hitler to come to power and eventually conquer Europe after the appeasement of Great Britain and France .
The best response to this argument is that if America had been true to its Founders ’ non-interventionist foreign policy and had refused to enter World War I there would have been a negotiated treaty in 1917 and no harsh Versailles Treaty forced on Germany .
Without the harsh Versailles Treaty , Hitler and Nazism would not have come to power .
If the war had ended in the early part of 1917 , there would have been no successful Russian Revolution and no successful birth of Communism .
In short , there would have been no World War II .
Admittedly , both of these arguments by the interventionists and the non-interventionists are counter - factual arguments .
However , you can call as your primary expert witness in support of American non-interventionism none other that Winston Churchill .
He made a statement to William Griffen , editor of the New York Enquirer in August of 1936 and it was reported by Mr. Griffen as follows :
America should have minded her own business and stayed out of the World War .
If you had n’t entered the war the Allies would have made peace with Germany in the Spring of 1917 .
Had we made peace then there would have been no collapse in Russia followed by Communism , no breakdown in Italy followed by Fascism , and Germany would not have signed the Versailles Treaty , which has enthroned Nazism in Germany .
If America had stayed out of the war , all these u2018isms ’ would n’t to - day be sweeping the continent of Europe and breaking down parliamentary government , and if England had made peace early in 1917 , it would have saved over one million British , French , American , and other lives .
( See Military History of the Western World by J.F.C. Fuller , vol .
III , p. 271 , paperback edition published by Da Capo Press .
Fuller is one of the world ’s foremost military historians . )
The above quotation has been hidden from the general public , as you might expect , because a few years later Winston Churchill was conspiring with Franklin Roosevelt secretly to get America back into the European War which began in 1939 .
This 1936 statement by Churchill would have been very damaging to their plans .
It should also be remembered that Churchill was one of the persons who acted secretly to get America into World War I with the sinking of the Lusitania .
For centuries European politicians had been concerned with the " balance of power " to keep one country from becoming a hegemonic power .
The stalemate reached during World War I in early 1917 showed that this " balance of power " had kept the competing nations from having a victor in the war which would have resulted in a negotiated peace treaty if America had not entered the war .
Instead , America ’s entry into the war destroyed this " balance of power " completely and allowed America and its allies to force a very unfair and harsh Versailles Treaty on Germany .
I believe that World War I and World War II were really one war with a twenty year recess and it was the harsh and unfair Versailles Treaty which allowed Hitler to come to power which then led directly to renewal of the war in 1939 in Poland when the League of Nations failed to revise the treaty , which it had the specific authority to do .
Many people rightly condemned the League of Nations for its failure to revise the treaty .
This failure of peaceful revision led directly to Hitler ’s revision by force and to World War II .

How is Abstinence - Only Sex Education Like South Africa ’s Driving Exam ?
South Africa has had , for the last dozen years , what may be the world ’s most difficult driver ’s license exam .
It ’s an exercise in extremely defensive driving .
Test examiners take off points for , among other things , failure to check all mirrors every seven seconds .
An applicant can fail instantly if he lets his car roll backwards even an inch when stopping or starting , or simply if his test examiner has n’t met his daily failure quota .
In a recent Times article , Michael Wines writes that passing the test requires an applicant to “ imagine that he is driving a live claymore mine under assault by guerillas in bumper cars . ”
So South Africa must have the safest roads in the world , right ?
Well , no .
The fatality rate per mile is five times higher than that of the United States , and rising fast .
Why ?
Because the test is so hard , and the accompanying bureaucratic process so byzantine , that it acts as a strong disincentive for South Africans to get proper driver training .
Many people simply drive without a license or buy one off the black market .
So the unintended consequences of South Africa ’s rigorous licensing program seem pretty plain : there is more bad driving as a result .
Turn now to the United States , where the Federal Government has spent upwards of $ 1 billion over the last decade on abstinence - only sex education .
( Call it defensive dating . )
The idea is that not teaching students about contraception , safe sex , etc. , will lead to better outcomes , including less unwanted pregnancies and fewer sexually transmitted diseases .
Except … it turns out that teenagers are circumventing their abstinence education and having sex anyway .
Studies have repeatedly shown that abstinence - only students have almost the same number of sexual partners , and have sex almost as early , as students who receive traditional sex ed .
In fact , abstinence - only programs may actually increase the risk of STDs and unintentional teen pregnancies .
That ’s because those abstinence - only students who do have sex tend to be less likely to use protection .
That ’s one of the reasons why New York State recently canceled its abstinence - only program , passing up millions of dollars in Federal aid .
Congress nevertheless appears ready to continue funding for similar programs .
Maybe abstinence - only would work better if the classes were administered by one of those stern South African driving examiners .

MOM -AND -POP retailers have helplessly stood by over the last decade as big - box merchants steamrolled over them .
Online , though , small merchants are not going down without a fight .
The number of small - and medium - size retailers selling online has swelled in the last two years , from 21 percent to 32 percent , according to a survey by IDC , a consulting firm .
Aided by less expensive and more sophisticated technology , stores like RealmDekor.com , CleanAirGardening.com and SitStay.com are competing with retailers as well as bigger sites like Amazon .
These businesses lack the huge marketing budgets of their bigger peers , of course , but they are unearthing cheap advertising methods that , in some cases , help them compete with million - dollar promotions .
The retailer of quirky home goods , RealmDekor.com , has experienced occasional sales increases not because of catalog shipments or television commercials , but because it formed relationships with bloggers and posted its products on new “ social shopping sites ” like ThisNext.com and StyleHive.com .
BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
A man in a wheelchair blew himself up Monday in a northern Iraqi police station , killing three National Police officers , including a commander , police said .
Soldiers stand by as pilgrims gather Sunday in Karbala for al - Arbaeen , one of holiest days on the Shiite calendar .
The attack also wounded nine officers on the police force , which the Iraqi Interior Ministry operates .
The bombing in Samarra raises concern about the recent tactics employed by insurgents in Iraq .
Bombs have been placed inside dead animals and hidden in carts .
And in recent days , vagrants have been involved in bombings .
" As a sign of desperation , some of those terrorists resorted to some new methods and techniques , " said Maj.
Gen. Qassim Atta , spokesman for Baghdad 's security plan .
One of the tactics is the use of remote - controlled " sticky " bombs , small enough to tape under vehicles .
A high - ranking Samarra police official said the disabled man came to meet with Brig .
Gen. Abdul Jabbar Rabei Muttar , deputy commander of security , at the security operations building in Samarra .
The pair met last week as well .
The man was searched when he entered the building , but police did n't look under his wheelchair seat , where the explosives had been placed .
The man , who police say was cogent , detonated the explosives when Muttar approached him .
Also Monday , a roadside bomb exploded in the middle of a crowd of Shiite Muslims in Baghdad , killing three people and wounding 15 , an Interior Ministry official said .
The strike , in southeastern Baghdad 's Zafaraniya district , is the latest attack against pilgrims trekking to Karbala for al - Arbaeen , one of the holiest days of the Shiite religious calendar .
It falls on Wednesday .
On Sunday , a suicide bomber in Iskandariya killed at least 45 people and wounded 68 others , and armed militants attacked pilgrims in southern Baghdad , killing three and wounding more than 30 others .
Pilgrims traditionally make their way to Karbala on foot as a demonstration of piety , and those who head to the city from Baghdad go through Babil province , where Iskandariya is located .
Joint forces have stepped up patrols during the pilgrimage to protect the thousands headed to Karbala .
Last year , more than 180 pilgrims were killed in a series of attacks , most during twin suicide bombings in Hilla , Babil province 's capital .
Sunday 's attack in Iskandariya , conducted by a bomber wearing an explosive vest , prompted authorities there to replace the police chief , Hilla police said .
More National Police officers have been deployed to Babil to ensure the safety of pilgrims heading to Karbala , a police official said .
The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and American - led coalition forces condemned Sunday 's " barbaric attacks in Baghdad and Iskandariya " against " innocent citizens participating in an important religious commemoration . "
Every year , thousands of pilgrims amass in Karbala for al - Arbaeen , which commemorates the end of a 40 - day mourning period for Imam Hussein , the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed .
Hussein , one of the most revered Shiite martyrs , is buried in Karbala , about 60 miles southwest of Baghdad .
Karbala 's main holy site is the gold - domed Imam Hussein Shrine .
Other developments
Gunmen ambushed an Iraqi Army convoy late Monday , killing eight soldiers , an official with Baquba police told CNN Monday .
The gunmen used rocket - propelled grenades and small arms fire in the attack in Buhriz , about 4 miles ( 7 km ) south of Baquba .
Baquba is about 37 miles ( 60 km ) north of Baghdad .
A suicide bomber blew up outside a mosque south of Falluja , killing two Iraqi police officers , two civilians and the bomber , a U.S. military statement released Monday said .
Twelve civilians also were wounded .
The Friday attack outside the Rahman mosque apparently was carried out by an adolescent , the military said .
The military reported raids Sunday and Monday in central and northern Iraq targeting al Qaeda in Iraq .
One person was killed and 11 others were detained .
The mayors of Baghdad and Tehran , Iran , signed an agreement expanding the cooperation between the cities on security and urban development matters .
The Monday memorandum of understanding said the cities will cooperate on training , security and the " implementation of infrastructure projects in both cities . "
CNN 's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report .

The research warns that most people are failing to make the most of their local area and have little knowledge of important geographical facts .
The survey was carried out to mark National Geographic 's geography awareness week and also today 's so - called " GIS Day " , which aims to encourage young people to understand the extent to which geographic information - and increasingly the opportunity to use technology such as digital mapping - underpins our daily lives .
The UK is among more than 80 countries which will participate by holding local events such as workshops and school assemblies .
Asked how many countries there were in the world , only a third were correct in choosing 193 .
A third of people thought Mount Everest was either in the Alps or the UK - it is in Nepal - and only half of respondents knew that the Nile was the world 's longest river .
Asked which facility had been visited the most during the past month , the DIY superstore came top with 39 % .
The local museum was bottom with only 9 % .
Almost a third said they had never visited their local museum or church and a quarter had never been to their leisure centre .
Respondents were also asked about what they remembered most about geography lessons at school from a list of eight topics .
Maps came top with 24 % , rocks / erosion and " do n't know " were in joint second place with 16 % , and farming in last with 5 % .
The findings follow a separate survey carried out earlier this week by the British Council , which showed that UK children aged 11 to 16 have the lowest international awareness among their age group in 10 countries .
David Lambert , professor of geography education and chief executive of the Geographical Association , said : " Geography helps us make sense of the world and face vital issues such as climate change , energy , food production , the ' war on terror ' , water and poverty .
It also touches all our lives every day , from businesses to schools , government to hospitals .
" Essential to a rounded education , young people should learn geography because it introduces them to relationships between the human activity within our physical world .
This is key to gaining an improved understanding of the environment we live in today and in the future . "
Swallowing a magnet the size of a watch battery is unlikely to cause health problems , but swallowing two can be fatal .
Braden Eberle , 4 , of San Jose , Calif. , told his mother that he had swallowed something , a tiny magnet attached to a toy .
His mother assumed that it would pass through .
The next day , his parents saw him swallow another .

Within 72 hours , Braden complained of mild pain in the left abdomen .
He had no other symptoms and was not in any apparent distress , but his parents took him to the emergency room anyway .
An X - ray showed what Dr. Sanjeev Dutta , in a case study published on Feb. 4 in The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine , calls “ an obvious opacity in the right lower quadrant area of the cecum , ” a foreign object near the mouth of the large intestine .
President Bush 's friends are concerned that he will face serious problems raising the estimated $ 250 million needed to build his presidential library , museum , and policy center at Southern Methodist University .
The Dallas school recently agreed to house the facilities , but family friends say coming up with the money wo n't be easy .
They fear that Bush 's unpopularity will put a damper on donations and that the sour economy will limit contributions even more .
Then there is the matter of an endowment to keep the library going , which could cost an additional $ 50 million .
Alarms went off among Bush supporters after the president commented on the library at a news conference in late February .
Bush was asked about the fundraising situation , and he did n't seem to be paying much attention to the details .
" I 'll probably take some foreign money but do n't know yet , " the president said .
" We just announced the deal , and I , frankly , have been focused elsewhere , like on gasoline prices and , you know , my trip to Africa and have n't seen the fundraising strategy yet . "
Fair enough .
But presidential libraries tend to become pet projects for their namesakes .
So raising money will inevitably take on increasing importance for Bush as his presidency winds down .

The William S. Hart Union High School District Governing Board is set to consider one of the most controversial issues in education today - the random testing of students for the presence of drugs .
If adopted , mandatory random drug testing would force students in extracurricular activities into a pool of possible candidates for a random drug test - regardless of parental consent .
This is all possible under a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing public schools the authority to test students in extracurricular activities for drugs , providing that they can prove a significant drug problem exists in their district .
But , is requiring high school students to submit to a medical procedure just so they can be involved with their school really necessary ?
Should we allow the government a power normally reserved for parents ?
My answer is no .
Mandatory random drug testing has been proven time after time to be an ineffective way to deter students from drugs , all while costing the district tens of thousands of dollars per year , driving students away from extracurriculars , and most significantly , creating a climate of fear and distrust between students and faculty in our schools .
A 2003 University of Michigan study of both schools that drug test students and those that do n't found schools with student drug testing had a higher percentage of students who used illicit drugs than at schools who do n't .
Why ?
Because drug testing is , at its core , ineffective .
Rather than prompting students to quit drugs altogether , drug testing drives them to more serious drugs that leave the body quickly , such as methamphetamines , Ecstasy or inhalants .
Even worse , since many of the tests do n't look for alcohol , drug testing could result in students turning to binge drinking , something in our community that has killed far more young lives than marijuana .
Additionally , drug testing could push some students to quit the activities at school that they are involved with .
For many , these activities keep them from going further in their drug habits .
Is it really wise to motivate students to spend more time away from school , potentially doing the very thing this system is meant to prevent ?
Apart from being ineffective , the program is expensive .
Testing 1,200 high school students per year ( approximately 5 percent of students ) will cost the district up to $ 62,400 .
That , of course , does n't include the cost of lawsuits against the district that are bound to come .
That money has to come from somewhere , and may very well end up taking away resources from programs which have been proven to be effective in deterring youth from drugs .
With the current budget cuts facing our state , I do n't believe investing more than $ 60,000 a year on a program that , statistically , has no effect on students is a good idea .
Perhaps the most frightening effect of the program , however , will be the relationship it creates between students and faculty .
Many students find their teacher or counselor as one of the only people whom they can confide in .
How does the district expect students to feel comfortable asking for help or guidance if the only people whom they can talk to are the ones administering the tests ?
Although the tests are randomly assigned , students will fear that their plea for help could result in them being chosen to be tested , instantly destroying the delicate bond many students currently share with their teachers .
Finally , in order to institute a Mandatory Random Drug Testing system , a school district must prove that there is a significant drug problem in the community .
While I do n't believe anyone will say drugs are not an issue in the Santa Clarita Valley , saying they are significant , in legal context at least , is simply untrue .
The school environment which prompted the ruling allowing drug testing in schools was listed , in the case , as follows :
" [ T ]he administration was at its wits end and ... a large segment of the student body , particularly those involved in interscholastic athletics , was in a state of rebellion .
Disciplinary actions had reached ' epidemic proportions . ' " ( Earls v. Board of Education of Tecumseh Public School District ) .
I do n't know about you , but if a " state of rebellion " exists inside the Hart district , it 's news to me .
In fact , a study conducted by the district itself shows that less than 1 percent of 7 - 12th graders were suspended for drug offenses in the 2006 - 2007 school year .
One percent is far from the " epidemic proportions " of disciplinary actions described in the case .
For the past few months , the district has assembled a committee of school administrators , teachers , law enforcement , parents and students to discuss all of the above issues and more .
When the report was released during last Wednesday 's board meeting , the information it contained was overwhelmingly negative against testing .
Law enforcement believes that the " typical " youth involved with drugs are " not involved in school 's extracurricular programs . "
Coaches believe that testing " will not change bad practices " and that " students [ are ] likely to re-engage in abuse at the end of the season , " and school administrators believe that " testing ... is potentially divisive " and that the results " would n't truly be confidential , as students [ would ] disappear from teams or groups . "
The response from parents also is negative , showing concerns for discrimination against students whose religion prevents them from surrendering bodily fluids and the confidentiality of private student information .
As a student in the Hart district , the prospect of being forced to undergo a potentially invasive procedure just to participate in school activities is frightening .
I 've talked to dozens of other students from across the district , and an overwhelming majority are strongly opposed to this program .
I do n't feel it is either the responsibility or right of the school district to monitor what I do on my own time .
Although I have always been and will continue to be drug free , I worry about the possibility of a false - positive result .
A positive drug test is a devastating accusation , especially for an innocent student .
The possibility of a false positive through urinalysis is extremely high , as many tests see innocuous items such as over - the - counter decongestants , codeine and even poppy seeds as amphetamines , heroin or opiates .
To try and combat this , many school districts require students to identify prescription medications they are taking before the test is administered , resulting in even more violations of a student 's medical privacy and creating addition burden for the district in order to ensure such private information is kept confidential .
I strongly believe that drug testing is something to be discussed between a student , his or her parents , and their doctor .
Therefore , I suggest that , if the district is to implement a drug testing policy , they make it an " opt - in " program , where parents can decide if their child is to be tested or not .
Besides making testing available to every family in the district , an opt - in program would eliminate any legal hurdles the district will encounter with mandatory testing , and allow parents who do n't want their student tested to still give their child the option of staying active in their school .
In closing , although mandatory drug testing may seem to be a good idea to deter students from illicit drugs , the reality is that it is an ineffective program that will not provide the results hoped for , and may further deteriorate the relationships shared between students and faculty .
As a student , I feel that the trust I 've received from my parents , peers , and teachers is far more effective in deterring me from drugs than any mandatory random test ever will be .

The Honorable Terry M. Bellamy
Mayor , Asheville NC
P.O. Box 7148
Asheville NC , 28802
Dear Mayor Bellamy :
As you no doubt realize by now , you have something of a PR nightmare on your hands .
One of your police officers , Russell Crisp , recently arrested a resident named Jonas Phillips for obstructing a sidewalk .
Since people were apparently having no trouble walking past him , and since the police department is reportedly trying to decide whether or not he ought instead be charged with some sort of state violation for “ endangering motorists , ” you can see how people like me ( a North Carolina native who loves your wonderful city , has vacationed there , and who has recommended it highly to friends and family contemplating where to spend their tourism dollars ) might suspect that the real reason he was arrested had something to do with the “ Impeach Bush - Cheney ” sign he was holding at the time .
Especially since the officer reportedly said things like “ I ’m sick of this shit ! ” and “ Here ’s your fifteen minutes of fame , buddy . ”
As I ’m sure you ’re aware , it ’s almost impossible not to read these reports in an ugly political context and to wonder whether the officer was abusing his authority by harassing a man whose political views he did n’t like .
Your Honor , Asheville is the budding jewel of the Carolina Blue Ridge .
It ’s a city that has worked hard to establish itself as a center for the arts and culture , and it has begun to reap the rewards of those efforts .
In some ways , Asheville has done a model job of developing the kinds of “ human capital ” that researcher Richard Florida says are essential to attracting top - flight talent and economic development .
I noted this on my last visit , and others I ’ve talked to as well nod in agreement when I say that Asheville is becoming the “ Boulder of the South . ”
The key to this equation is talent .
In order for a smaller city to thrive , as yours clearly wants to , it must attract certain kinds of young professionals ( and by all means , please read Florida if you are n’t already familiar with him , although I strongly suspect you or some of your people probably are ) .
This has overtly political implications .
Not to put too fine a point on it , but the core culture you need tends to be strongly progressive .
The actions of Officer Crisp , and the city ’s failure to quickly remedy what ca n’t help but look like a heavy - handed crackdown by a conservative law enforcement officer who did n’t like the way a citizen was exercising his Constitutional guarantee of free speech – Your Honor , these events are the sorts of things that cause vibrant young professionals and artists , some of who are considering a future in Asheville , to step back and take a harder look at their other options .
Not only that , a lot of people who are doing vacation planning are reading about this story , as well .
These developments are bad for Asheville and its citizens , Your Honor .
I ’ll go further and argue that they ’re bad for America , too – if we ca n’t agree on a citizen ’s right to public expression of a perfectly legal viewpoint ( and a viewpoint that has strong support nationwide , to boot ) , then economic development and tourism dollars are the least of our worries .
You and your police officers do n’t have to agree with me or Mr. Phillips , but if your fine city is to thrive , you and they must share a commitment to the rights to speak and disagree , which are the very foundation of our Republic .
I ’ll be watching as this case develops , Ms. Mayor , and rest assured that my opinion of Asheville , along with how I choose to spend future vacations and the advice I give my friends and readers , will depend on the statement you make about free speech in your city .
I strongly encourage you to exercise your influence in making sure the charges against Mr. Phillips are dropped .
After all , this one does n’t look that complicated .
If an officer ca n’t decide what a man holding a sign is doing wrong at a glance , then perhaps the officer and his colleagues in the Asheville Police Department are n’t competent for their jobs .
Or – and this seems more likely to me – perhaps Mr. Phillips was n’t doing anything wrong at all , and now the police have convinced themselves that rigging a charge they can make stick will somehow save the city further embarrassment .
If so , they ’re tragically mistaken , and your office will likely find itself wasting a lot of productive time answering for their misjudgment .
I thank you for your time and wish you and your staff the best as you work to set this unfortunate situation aright .
Sincerely ,

The Financial Services Authority has welcomed the plans The City watchdog is to get powers to offer immunity from prosecution to those providing evidence about market manipulation , under Treasury plans .
The chancellor wants legislation which would bolster the strength of the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) .
It follows shares in HBOS being driven down last week by what the FSA called " false " rumours about the bank .
The FSA has struggled to take action against those suspected of wrongdoing in the City .
' Welcome move '
In an interview with the Guardian , Chancellor Alistair Darling said that the plan to offer immunity to whistleblowers was part of a package of measures needed in a " period of unprecedented uncertainty " .
We have a duty to ensure we have clean and efficient markets
Alistair Darling
" I can't allow us to get into a situation where people quite deliberately manipulate markets for personal gain and with the potential to destabilise the financial system , " he said .
" We have a duty to ensure we have clean and efficient markets .
We will come down hard on people manipulating the system . "
The chancellor has been talking to the US Treasury Secretary , Henry Paulson , about a similar system which operates in the United States .
It is understood that the FSA would get plea bargaining powers which are currently enjoyed by other organisations , including the Serious Fraud Office and the Home Office .
Under the proposals , which would have to be introduced through legislation , the watchdog would get " specified prosecutor status " .
The FSA told the BBC it had lobbied for such powers for some time and that it would welcome the move .
It has previously found it difficult to take action against those suspected of manipulating the markets .
Circumstantial evidence However , Chris Brennan , partner at law firm Barlow Lyde & Gilbert , said he was uncertain that the changes would succeed in eradicating market manipulation .
" It is extremely difficult to prosecute , " he told the BBC .
" Insider dealing often involves purely circumstantial evidence that is not sufficient in most criminal cases .
" I am not sure how much the whistleblowing provisions will help , but the plea bargaining may well incentivise individuals to plead and avoid the need for a trial . "
Profit After the HBOS incident , which saw the bank 's shares slump by as much as 17 % , the FSA said that it would " not tolerate " traders starting " false " rumours about firms to make cash from dealing in their shares .
" There has been a series of completely unfounded rumours about UK financial institutions in the London market over the last few days , sometimes accompanied by short - selling , " the FSA said in a statement last week .
In short - selling a trader borrows shares , sells them immediately and hopes to repurchase the shares in the future at a lower price .
The trader can then return the shares to the lender and make a profit on the difference .
